F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
From the Development Grant Agreement: The objectives of the Project are to support the
Recipient's effort to improve the quality of basic education by: (a) increasing efficiency in
allocation and management of budgetary resources earmarked for basic education, and (b)
fostering equitable access to education services with emphasis on underserved areas, out of
school youth, and other minority groups, such as Pygmies.

From the Project Appraisal Document: The project development objectives are to improve
efficiency in the allocation and management of resources, improve the quality of the education
services offered, and reduce inequities in the provision of these services. In order to achieve
these objectives, the proposed Project will pursue a three-fold agenda of action. 1) It builds the
capacity of the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to prepare the system for
decentralization, in particular providing support to the Regional Departments of Education
(DDEPSA) to develop and monitor regional education plans, and strengthen their capacity to
provide support to the school system. 2) It provides support for the improvement of the quality
of education services offered by providing direct support to schools, through the
implementation of a National School Improvement Program. And 3) it provides support to
increase equity in the provision of services, by providing free textbooks, allocating resources
based on a per capita formula, focusing rehabilitation efforts in underserved areas, and
providing support to out of school youth and excluded population such as Pygmies.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
From the Development Grant Agreement: The objective of the Project is to improve efficiency,
quality and equity in the provision of basic education in the territory of the Recipient with a
view to achieving universal quality primary education by 2015.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Country Context. At the time of appraisal, the Republic of Congo (ROC) was a post-
conflict country with an estimated population of 3.2 million inhabitants, many of whom were
living along the Brazzaville - Pointe Noire corridor. The population was relatively young with
close to 65 percent under 24 years of age. ROC had gone through a cycle of civil wars that
ended in March 17, 2003 with the signing of a peace agreement. As a result of the continued
conflict, the economy was in disarray – with damaged infrastructure and collapsed social
sectors. In 2000, 70 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, and 11 percent of
the children in the country had been orphaned. Many of these children were no longer
attending school – with primary education attendance dropping from 90 percent to 40 percent
between 1990 and 2000.
2.      Sector Context. The education sector had been deeply impacted by the continued
conflict. Gross enrollment rates (GERs) had fallen significantly from 1995 to 1999, from 119,
64, and 25 percent for primary, lower, and upper secondary education to 57, 33 and 12 percent,
respectively. Repetition rates were very high, especially at the primary level. In 2002, the
repetition rate was 28 percent for grade 1 and 33 percent for grade 4. The education system
was characterized by significant income, gender and regional disparities highlighting important
issues of inequity. Spending on education (recurrent and capital) varied significantly during the
conflict period amounting to an average of 3.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
between 1996 and 2002 with notable year-by-year variations. Moreover, the education budget
was also unevenly distributed among the various sub-sectors with higher education (having
fewer than 2 percent of all students enrolled in the education system) benefiting from an
allocation of 32 percent of the budget, compared to an allocation of 35 percent for primary
education. The teacher management system was weak with a large number of ‘ghost’ teachers
(teachers on payroll yet no longer in the system) and bénévoles (teachers hired by the
communities). Furthermore, as of 2001 more than 40 percent of primary school teachers did
not have any professional training. The student-teacher ratio was high (at 92 if only teachers
recruited by the Government are included and at 74 if bénévoles and others are included).
3.      Project Context. At the time of appraisal, the Government of the Republic of Congo
(GOC) was committed to introducing the necessary changes to improve the quality of
education delivery and the internal and external efficiency of the education system. In
November 2002, the Ministry of Primary, Secondary Education and Literacy (Ministère de
l’Enseignment Primaire, Secondaire et Alphabétisation – MEPSA) prepared an Education for
All (EFA) Plan as suggested by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), which laid the foundations for education reform. The main features
of this reform were: (i) diversification and improvement of the education services offered; (ii)
decentralization of management and service delivery; (iii) strengthening of partnerships around
education focusing on civil society; (iv) improvements in quality of education; and (v)
improvements in efficiency and transparency in education sector management. A
decentralization law had been passed in 2003, giving the regional departments of education (or
Regional Departments for Primary and Secondary Education and Literacy (Directions
Départementales de l’Éducation Primaire et Secondaire et Chargé de l’Alphabétisation –
DDPESAs)) the authority to participate in the preparation of school mapping, and
responsibility for construction, equipment and management of pre-schools, primary and

                                               1
secondary schools, and literacy centers. The establishment of units for school-based
management (school management committees – SMCs) was made possible by a law that had
been passed in 1996.
4.       The Bank was supporting the GOC through the implementation of a Transitional
Support Strategy (TSS) beginning in 2001. The TSS and the subsequent Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP, 2004-2006) paid particular attention to boosting social
inclusion and strengthening the social sectors. The TSS emphasized the importance of
rebuilding the education system which included a combination of substantial investments to
rehabilitate destroyed facilities, capacity-building (particularly for teachers), and policy
reforms to better manage available resources. Pillar 3 (Access to Basic Social Services and
Social Welfare) of the I-PRSP emphasized the need to improve access to education. Therefore,
at the time of appraisal there was a strong rationale for the Bank’s engagement in the education
sector to support the GOC in reconstructing the education system, implementing reforms to
improve the efficiency of the system, and improving the quality of education service delivery.
5.       The World Bank-funded Support to Basic Education Project (P084317) (Projet d’Appui
à l’enseignment de base – PRAEBASE) provided financial support and technical assistance
(TA) to the GOC to: (i) rebuild the school network through rehabilitation and refurbishment of
classrooms and other school infrastructure; (ii) strengthen MEPSA’s capacity at the central and
local levels to plan and monitor education reform in a decentralized context, including the
preparation and implementation of regional education plans, and the consolidation of SMCs;
(iii) increase the availability of textbooks in primary and junior secondary schools, as well as
increase the number of better qualified teachers; (iv) gain a better understanding of the
characteristics of the teaching personnel and remove ‘ghost’ personnel from MEPSA’s budget;
and (iv) implement training programs for out-of-school youth and promote increased
enrollment among disadvantaged children.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
6.     The original project development objectives (PDO) of the Project (PRAEBASE) as
described in the Development Grant Agreement (DGA) were to support the Recipient’s effort
to improve the quality of basic education by: (i) increasing efficiency in allocation and
management of budgetary resources earmarked for basic education; and (ii) fostering equitable
access to education services with emphasis on underserved areas, out-of-school youth, and
other minority groups, such as pygmies. 1
7.       There were some discrepancies between the DGA and the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) in terms of the PDO indicators. Indicators in the DGA were: (i) net entrance in last year
of primary in rural and urban areas; (ii) primary repetition rates in rural and urban areas; (iii)
teacher-pupil ratio; (iv) increased share of public expenditure on education; and (v) recurrent
non-salary expenditures. Indicators in the PAD (Results Framework – RF) were: (i) percent of
net entrance to last year in primary; (ii) primary education repetition rate; (iii) pupil-teacher
ratio; (iv) administrative staff-to-teaching staff ratio in schools; and (v) capacity of regional
departments of education (DDEPSAs) to develop and monitor annual department education
plans. Indicators (iii) and (v) were disaggregated by region. From 2007 onwards, a consistent
set of five PDO indicators were reported on in the status reports (initially Project Status

1
 In the PAD, the PDO is “to improve efficiency in the allocation and management of resources, improve the
quality of education services offered, and reduce inequities in the provision of the services.”

                                                   2
Reports (PSRs) and later Implementation Status Reports (ISRs)) The set of PDO indicators
included: (i) primary completion rate; (ii) teacher student ratio; (iii) primary level average
repetition rate; (iv) ratio of administrative personnel - teachers at the school level; and (v)
regional departments of education have the capacity to produce annual education plans.
1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and PDO Indicators,
and reasons/justification
8.       The original closing date of the Project was June 30, 2009. By early 2009, 97 percent
of grant funds had been disbursed and implementation progress (IP) was rated Satisfactory. In
order to allow for the scaling up of all Project activities and to support the development of an
education sector plan within the framework of the Education for All – Fast Track Initiative
(EFA-FTI), which the ROC intended to join, an Additional Financing (AF) (P113508) of
US$15 million was approved on June 9, 2009. Under the AF, the wording of the PDO was
slightly modified although the underlying objectives and goals of the project remain unchanged
(i.e., to increase efficiency and improve quality and equity in basic education). The revised
PDO as indicated in the AF Project Paper (PP) was “to improve efficiency, quality and equity
in the provision of basic education in the Republic of Congo with a view to achieving universal
quality primary education by 2015”.
9.      The PDO indicators were revised accordingly. The revised set of PDO-level indicators
as stated in the DGA for the AF 2 included: (i) primary education completion rate; (ii) the girl-
boy primary school enrollment ratio; (iii) number of standardized tests administered; (iv) share
of education expenditures as a total of government expenditures; (v) student teacher ratio
(disaggregated by department); (vi) number of unqualified volunteers trained under the project;
(vii) number of textbooks per student (disaggregated by subject and by primary and secondary
level); (viii) number of Pygmy children enrolled in formal and non-formal education; and (ix)
number of out-of-school youth who have completed vocational training programs under the
Project. There was, however, some discrepancy between the indicators that were mentioned in
the DGA and those that were specified in the PP. 3
10.      Delays in the completion of the civil works program led to a restructuring of the Project
in April 2012 to allow for a one-year extension of the closing date to June 30, 2013. In addition
to the extension, the restructuring included revisions to the Project’s RF. These revisions were
made in order to highlight overall achievements made by the PRAEBASE and to better show
the progress made on several of the indicators since the beginning of the Project. The PDO-
level indicators under the restructured project were: (i) primary education completion rate; (ii)
student-teacher ratio; (iii) primary repetition rate; (iv) ratio of administrative staff to teaching
staff; (v) girl-boy ratio of primary school enrollment; and (vi) gross enrollment rate.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.      The main beneficiaries of the Project were primary and secondary school students and
education staff. First among those institutions to benefit from the Project was the MEPSA and
its different units across its organization and administrative levels (central, departmental and
local). The Project also targeted SMCs, out-of-school youth and Pygmy children. When the AF
was approved in June 2009, the two other Ministries in charge of Education (Ministry of

  The AF mentions performance indicators instead of PDO indicators.
3
  There was variation across indicators in the legal agreements and the PAD and PP. The PDO indicators specified
in the PP were: (i) primary education completion rate; and (ii) girl-boy ratio of primary school enrollment.

                                                       3
Technical and Professional Education, Qualifying Training and Employment (Ministère de
l’Enseignement Technique, Professionnel, de la Formation Qualifiante et de l’Emploi –
METPFQE) and the Ministry of Higher Education (Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur –
MES)) also benefitted from the Project, mainly through the provision of training to staff on
issues related to out-of-school youth.
12.     To support the development and implementation of a sector plan, studies and activities
were also funded including: studies on quality and governance of higher education, and on
types of technical and vocational training provision; training related to the Education
Management and Information System (EMIS) (e.g., database management, computer training,
the purchase of EMIS-related software, etc.); and the provision of equipment and furniture to
computer centers. The number of Project beneficiaries was approximately 63,000 students
benefiting from new classrooms; 1,694 schools benefiting from SMCs; 4,030 indigenous
children enrolled in primary education; and 1,423 out-of-school youth. In addition, 12,598
teachers, 945 inspectors, and 2,548 school directors were trained under the Project.
1.5     Original Components
13.     The Project had four components. The components remained largely unchanged
throughout the Project lifetime, though their titles were somewhat revised and a number of
activities were scaled up. The original components were:
14.     Component 1: Capacity Enhancement for MEPSA (US$2.7 million). This
component aimed at strengthening MEPSA and its various units at the central and local level in
order to prepare it for decentralized education management through strengthened DDEPSAs.
The Project aimed to ensure that the capacity of regional departments was strengthened to
develop, implement and monitor regional education plans, thus improving the internal
efficiency of the education system at the primary and secondary levels. The Component also
aimed at improving the efficiency of the teacher management system. Activities were
supported under each of the Project’s three sub-components: Sub-component 1.1. Capacity
Building for Planning; Sub-component 1.2 Support to Regional Departments and
Decentralization of Education; and Sub-component 1.3 Improvement of Human Resource and
Budget Management.
15.     Component 2: Rehabilitation of the School Infrastructure (US$8.5 million). This
decentralized and demand-driven component aimed at rehabilitating school buildings that were
damaged, had deteriorated during the war, or had not been properly maintained. The
Component also funded the provision of school furniture and rehabilitation and/or
reconstruction of administrative offices in selected schools and construction of teacher housing
in rural areas. A second aim of this component was to build the capacity of SMCs and
strengthen their capacity to prepare school plans, manage budget allocations for school
maintenance, and monitor the completion of rehabilitation works.
16.    Component 3: Support to the Improvement of Quality of Education (US$6
million). This component focused on strengthening the quality of primary and secondary
education by: (i) implementing an in-service teacher training program and providing training
for school directors, pedagogical advisers 4 and inspectors; (ii) supporting school inspectors to
improve pedagogical support to schools; (iii) providing all primary and junior secondary
4
  These are teachers (often with better qualifications and more teaching experience) who provide pedagogical
support to other teachers in schools.

                                                     4
school students with textbooks in three core subjects (French, Math and Civic
Instruction/Education for Peace-Building) as well as teaching guides for those schools; and (iv)
funding an assessment and review of the curriculum and providing assistance for the
preparation of relevant teacher training programs for secondary education. This component
included four sub-components: Sub-component 3.1 Textbooks; Sub-component 3.2 In-service
Training for Primary School Teachers and Directors; Sub-component 3.3 Curriculum
Development and In-service Teacher Training for Lower Secondary Schools; and Sub-
component 3.4 Support to Inspections 5 to Enhance Pedagogical Support to Schools.
17.     Component 4: Delivery of Formal and Non-formal Education Services to Out-of-
School Youth and Pygmies (US$1.8 million). This component focused on providing support
to two disadvantaged groups – out-of-school youth and Pygmy children. 6 For out-of-school
youth, the Project aimed to pilot interventions to provide formal and non-formal education and
training opportunities to youth ages 14 to 19 who had not been in school or who had dropped
out. Such opportunities included apprenticeships with artisans and support to job insertion. For
the second group, the Project supported activities aimed at increasing school enrolment of
Pygmy children, including the distribution of school kits and organization of sensitization
campaigns. The activities were organized under two sub-components: Sub-component 4.1 Out-
of-School Youth; and Sub-component 4.2 Education Programs for the Pygmy Population.
1.6     Revised Components
18.     Given the rationale behind the AF of 2009, the original components were maintained
(although renamed under the AF) and scaled up. The scope of Components 1, 2 and 3 was
modified. Under Component 1, a new sub-component was created to account for the current
context of sector policy development. Further, two of the original sub-components, Support to
the Regional Departments for the Decentralization of Education and Improvement of Human
Resources and Budget Management were merged into one sub-component, Institutional
Strengthening of the MEPSA. Component 2 was expanded to increase the number of
classrooms to be rehabilitated and to include the construction of new classrooms, latrine
blocks, wells, and houses for teachers; and also to include support to cover the costs associated
with small projects for SMCs such as income generating activities (IGAs). Component 3 was
expanded to include a new sub-component, Introduction of Standardized Tests for Primary and
Secondary Levels. Component 4 remained unchanged.




5
  The term Inspections refers to the School Inspectorate Department in the Ministry of Education both at the
central and local level.
6
  The expressions ‘Pygmy children’ and ‘autochthonous children’ are used interchangeably in the ICR.

1.7    Other significant changes
20.     During the implementation of the original project, there were two reallocations of
Project funds. In addition, the Project closing date was extended twice. It was first extended by
six months from December 31, 2008 to June 30, 2009 to allow for additional time to complete
civil works activities that had been delayed. During this period, and in order to support the
GOC in expanding the scope of the activities in the Project, an AF was prepared. The AF (in
                                                     6
the amount of US$15 million) was processed in June 2009. In 2013, delays in the completion
of civil works were again experienced which resulted in a second extension of the Project
closing date for one year from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. This was processed as a Level 2
restructuring and introduced revisions to the Project’s RF. Table 2 provides an overview of the
key milestones for the Project.

21.     By February 2007, the ‘Consultants and Audits’ and ‘Operating Costs’ categories (as
specified in the DGA) had surpassed their original allocation as the funding needed under these
categories had been underestimated. In 2009, a second reallocation was processed as the
‘Consultants and Audits’, ‘Operating Costs’ and ‘Transfers’ (under Component 2) categories
were close to surpassing their allocations. This was due to unforeseen developments as a result
of the new implementation arrangements being employed in the post-conflict environment.
Specifically, the reallocation was needed as a result of: (i) the high costs associated with
maintaining a Fiduciary Agency (FA) 7; (ii) the recruitment of additional staff; (iii) an increase
in the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) management costs (for Component 2);
and (iv) limited coordination in transfer of funds to UNDP making the timely tracking of
spending under each category difficult.

    The Project recruited a fiduciary agency (FA) as a fiduciary mitigation measure.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
22.     Project Preparation and Design. Project objectives fit squarely with MEPSA’s 2002
EFA Plan 8 and with the framework of on-going decentralization of the sector, as established by
the 2003 decentralization law. A number of research activities and analytical studies were
carried out to inform project design including: a national school census (2003-2004); a Public
Expenditure Review (PER) of the sector (2003); a functional assessment of the organizational
structure and capacity of School Inspection 9 (at its various levels); a study on teacher training;
and an assessment of school infrastructure in a sample of schools in 8 of the 11 regions. Other
pieces of analytical work undertaken included assessments of: programs targeting out-of-
school youth, educational opportunities for Pygmy children; and the potential social and
environmental impact of interventions being proposed under the Project. The Bank team
developed a sound dialogue with education stakeholders, including various agencies and civil
society organizations working in the sector.
23.     Analysis of school census data and of equity and efficiency in the PER were used to
inform the design of Component 1 (Capacity Building for the MEPSA). Further, the PER’s
analysis on education financing and spending, and teacher management, supported the design
of activities focusing on decentralization of education services and better teacher management,
including the identification and removal of ‘ghost’ teachers from payroll and the training of
bénévoles. Together the infrastructure assessment and analysis of community-driven civil
works programs in the ROC informed the design of Component 2 (Rehabilitation of the School
Infrastructure). The design of quality improvement activities under Component 3 (Support to
the Improvement of Quality of Education) were guided by the findings of the PER, as well as
the study on teacher training and assessment on School Inspection practices. Finally, the
assessments on educational opportunities for Pygmy children and of programs targeting out-of-
school youth were essential in the development of interventions to be supported by Component
4 (Delivery of Formal and Non-formal Education Services to Out-of-School Youth and
Pygmies).
24.      Lessons learnt from other IDA-financed projects in ROC and in other post-conflict
countries in Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe were useful in guiding project design
and implementation. Principle among the lessons used were: (i) the importance of improving
local governance and empowerment of local communities for promoting social stability and
cohesion – informing the design of decentralization activities and providing the rationale
behind strengthening SMCs; (ii) the advantages of using community-driven approaches to civil
works in social sectors – as a means to strengthen the sense of community and accountability
at the local level; (iii) the important role of stakeholder consultations – to promote engagement
in Project activities and to ensure the alignment of activities with the community’s needs; and
(iv) the utility of in-depth assessments of the needs of vulnerable populations – to design
effective programs to address their identified needs.



8
  As a follow up of the EFA Forum that took place in Dakar 2000, ROC prepared an EFA Plan, aimed at
providing a vision for the development of the primary education sector.
9
  The term Inspection refers to the School Inspectorate Department in the Ministry of Education both at the central
and local levels.

                                                        8
25.      Quality at Entry. The project design was well-aligned with the MEPSA’s 2002 EFA
Sector Plan and with the needs and priorities identified in both the TSS and I-PRSP, including
strengthening education services, rehabilitating school infrastructure, improving the quality of
education, and promoting access to education of children from disadvantaged groups. As
described above, the project design also benefitted from a number of studies while also
drawing on lessons learned in similar contexts. A QER undertaken during project preparation
in 2004 determined that the quality at entry was Satisfactory highlighting the clarity of the
PDO and proposed activities as well as the Project’s alignment with the ROC’s strategic
agenda for the education sector. Despite the Project’s strong analytical underpinnings, there
were a number of shortcomings in the original design including: (i) weaknesses and
inconsistencies in the presentation of key performance indicators across project documents; (ii)
an overly ambitious design given the limited institutional capacity within the post-conflict
environment; (iii) an underestimation of the time needed to effectively implement key reforms
(i.e., decentralization and demand-driven construction); (iv) an underestimation of the time
required for FM and procurement capacity to develop to ensure the effective implementation of
project activities and the timely and accurate tracking of project funds; and (v) the challenges
associated with effectively implementing a project when coordination among multiple agencies
is required by the design (i.e., MEPSA and UNDP). For these reasons, Quality at Entry is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.
2.2       Implementation
26.     The Project became effective on March 25, 2005 six months after it had been approved
as MEPSA experienced some difficulties in meeting the effectiveness conditions. These
conditions included: (i) the recruitment of UNDP for the management of civil works; (ii) the
recruitment of an FA for FM of the Project; (iii) the establishment of the Project Steering
Committee and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU); and (iv) the adoption of the Project
Implementation Manual. Although project effectiveness had been delayed, the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) in the amount of SDR 450,000 10 allowed the GOC to continue
project preparation activities and make progress towards meeting the conditions of
effectiveness.
27.     In the first several months of project implementation, there were some delays in terms
of activities that were supported under Components 2 and 4. The large number of stakeholders
involved in the implementation of Component 2 (including UNDP, SMCs, DDEPSAs, and the
Fiduciary Agency (FA), etc.) was challenging in terms of coordination and additional time was
needed to ensure better alignment between UNDP and Bank procedures. In addition, the initial
preparation activities for the sensitization campaigns and the program for out-of-school youth
supported under Component 4, took longer than expected. There were also delays in the
decentralization process. As a result, and in order to quicken the pace of these activities, the
project opted to forego its use of a fully demand-driven approach for civil works activities,
instead adopting one where MEPSA and UNDP would become increasingly responsible for
decisions related to school construction. As a result of this decision—which was recommended
by the Bank—the implementation of civil works activities gained significant momentum and
this pace was maintained during the second and third years of the Project.



10
     Approximately US$670,000.

                                               9
28.     During the mid-term review (MTR) in February 2007, the Bank and GOC undertook a
thorough analysis of progress made and challenges faced during the first two years of the
project. Some of the identified challenges included:             (i) the complex civil works
implementation arrangements which required the involvement of agencies whose procedures
were not aligned with the Bank’s; (ii) different standards for FM and procurement procedures;
and (iii) weak fiduciary and technical capacity in UNDP and MEPSA. The MTR recommended
a number of concrete remedial actions, each of which were undertaken, including: (i) hiring
staff to strengthen UNDP and MEPSA’s capacity while maintaining the fiduciary
arrangements, i.e. continuing to use an FA; 11 (ii) the recruitment of an Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) specialist; (iii) a reallocation of funds; (iv) fine-tuning of targets; and (v) a
renewal of the existing contract between MEPSA and UNDP.
29.     Despite the progress made as a result of concrete actions to address implementation
bottlenecks, it was not possible to fully complete all activities envisaged under the Project by
the original closing date of December 31, 2008. As described above, the Project closing date
was, therefore, extended by six months (to June 30, 2009) in order to provide adequate time to
complete these activities and properly monitor and report on achievements under the Project.
30.     Around the same time of the original project closing, the AF was processed.
Implementation of activities under the AF continued at the same pace, however, reforms
related to the decentralization process continued to be slow. During the MTR of the AF in July
2011, these implementation delays were highlighted as a major concern. However, following
the MTR, the implementation pace increased and most activities under Components 1, 3 and 4
had been completed by the original closing date of June 30, 2012 with the exception of school
construction and rehabilitation. At this time, the Project had disbursed approximately 94
percent of its funds and the one-year extension to June 30, 2013, allowed for the completion of
95 percent 12 of school construction and classroom rehabilitation. At the time of project closing
(in June 2013), 97 percent of IDA funds had been disbursed.
31.     Overall Project implementation is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.     Design. As previously described, project indicators were appropriate for measuring
progress towards the achievement of the PDO. Although the RF was modified a number of
times, the M&E framework remained focused on the Project’s core objectives of improving
equity, efficiency and quality in the provision of education services. As noted earlier, following
recommendations of the 2007 MTR, the RF was modified in order to fine-tune some of the
targets and to improve the appropriateness of the PDO-level indicators. The RF was also
modified in August 2008 in order to introduce core and mandatory sector indicators. In
addition, the RF was also adjusted under the AF in May 2009 and under the Level 2
restructuring in May 2012. Most of the modifications in 2009 and 2012 were made to
intermediate-level indicators to improve their alignment with project activities. For instance,
the RF did not initially include measures related to the construction of new classrooms.
Therefore, under the AF two new indicators were introduced to capture progress made in terms
of the number of classrooms rehabilitated and the number of classrooms built. Overall, the

11
  A detailed discussion on fiduciary aspects can be found in Section 2.4.
12
  A total of 1687 classrooms were built and rehabilitated out of a planned total of 1,780, corresponding to a 95
percent completion rate.

                                                      10
indicators used to measure outcomes and outputs were appropriate and allowed the Bank and
GOC to measure progress made throughout the project life. However, as described earlier,
there were inconsistencies between the indicators found in the DGAs and those specified in the
PAD and PP (for the AF).
27.     In addition to the standard RF, the monitoring and reporting under the Project also
included: (i) regular technical audits of civil works; (ii) financial and procurement audits; and
(iii) development of concrete action plans to address and rectify issues related to project
implementation, including most notably, those related to FM and procurement.
28.      Implementation and Utilization. The Project provided ongoing support to M&E
activities under the project, specifically financing: (i) the collection, consolidation and analysis
of EMIS data; (ii) training of MEPSA staff at the central and local levels on data management
and analysis; and (iii) the purchase of equipment required for the EMIS to function effectively.
The Project also supported continuous M&E capacity-building activities for the MEPSA
through seminars, workshops, field-level studies, etc. Data collected by the Project was used
for various purposes – to modify project activities and to inform the design of the AF. Further,
reports on civil works and technical audits allowed for refinements in procurement procedures
and improvements in the quality of construction. Further, data collected by the EMIS were
utilized in the preparation of a country education sector status report (that was published by the
Bank in 2010). This report, in turn, guided the development of the GOC’s medium-term
education sector strategy for 2008-2020.
29.      Monitoring progress under the Project was rather complex as it involved a number of
different actors and a large number of indicators, many of which were tracked at different
levels of the education system. Each Component’s activities were monitored by a different
entity 13 requiring the PCU to hire an M&E Specialist to consolidate the data which were used
to develop detailed quarterly and yearly reports. Prior to 2007, as was common practice at the
time, status reports (PSRs) did not systematically track and report on all of the indicators as
Bank teams had some flexibility in terms of deciding which indicators to include/exclude in
these reports. However, the majority of indicators were measured consistently beginning in
2007. Despite improved consistency of data monitoring and reporting, the DGA for the AF in
2009 did not distinguish between outcome (PDO) and output (intermediate) indicators.
Furthermore, in the PP most of the project indicators were classified as “Intermediate
Outcomes/Indicators” (or Tier 2 indicators). 14 Despite these limitations, in part related to
evolving practices around M&E indicators/presentation, those measures monitored by the Bank
throughout the life of the project provided sufficient information to track progress towards the
achievement of the objectives under both the original grant and AF. On the basis of the
information above, the M&E quality is rated Modest.
2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
30.      The Project triggered three safeguard policies. Classified as a Category B project, the
first safeguard triggered was that of Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) due to potential soil
erosion, water and air pollution and/or loss of vegetation that could be caused by the

13
   Monitoring responsibilities were the following: Component 1 (DDEPSA), Component 2 (UNDP); Component 3
(INRAP), and Component 4 (MEPSA’s Literacy Division).
14
   Consistent with the RF and monitoring template (and practice) at the time of the AF in 2009, Tier 2 level
indicators (Intermediate Outcome/Indicators) could actually be either outcome or output indicators.

                                                    11
rehabilitation activities included in Component 2. The Project design mitigated against the
identified potential risks by using an Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) which was disclosed in-country. Throughout the life of the original project, this
safeguard was rated Satisfactory as no special environmental problems were encountered.
Under the AF, the ESMF and the operations manual were adjusted 15 to take into account the
potential consequences of the construction of new schools on the environment since the
original project had only financed the rehabilitation of existing schools. In the end, the risks did
not materialize, but the safeguard rating was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory until the
end of the Project largely due to delays in making the adjustments required in the ESMF and
the operations manual.
31.     The second safeguard triggered by the Project was that of Involuntary Resettlement
(OP 4.12) given the potential social impact of land acquisition by the Project and loss of
livelihood. As a mitigating measure, the GOC prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) outlining the principles and procedures needed in case such risks were to materialize.
The RPF was also disclosed in-country. This safeguard was rated Satisfactory as the need for
land acquisition and/or a loss of livelihoods did not occur.
32.     The last safeguard policy triggered by the Project was that of Indigenous People (OP
4.2 - revised to become OP 4.10) resulting from the inclusion of activities targeting Pygmies
and other indigenous populations under Component 4. An Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) was
prepared prior to the Project to assess the potential risks of the Project in terms of its impact on
the indigenous population and to identify mitigation measures. As activities under Component
4 took some time to reach a sound pace, there was a limited likelihood of the Project having an
adverse impact on the Pygmy population and other indigenous groups. However, by the time
activities began to be implemented under Component 4, the national strategy for the education
of the indigenous population was updated. From this point forward, the rating for this
safeguard was upgraded to Satisfactory and remained as such until the closure of the Project.
33.      Fiduciary Compliance. Throughout the project life quarterly financial reports and
regular audits were generally submitted in a timely manner. The GOC took concrete steps
(agreed with the Bank) to address any fiduciary weaknesses that were identified over the
course of the Project. Under the original project, the recruitment of a Fiduciary Agency (FA)
was required as a mitigation measure against the risk of fiduciary non-compliance that had
been identified at appraisal. Although an FA was recruited and Bank recommendations were
largely implemented, the PCU’s fiduciary capacity remained limited and such capacity was
never fully developed within the MEPSA. Further, designating UNDP as implementing agency
under Component 2 introduced additional fiduciary challenges. While the Project was able to
provide support to address limited fiduciary capacity related to activities being implemented on
the ground, fiduciary issues which were more systemic in nature (i.e., resulting from specific
institutional arrangements and/or the difficult post-conflict environment) were harder to fully
address and rectify.
34.    Ineligible expenditures were identified at three points during project implementation. In
2006, an amount of US$106,000 corresponding to ineligible expenditures was observed which
15
   These adjustments included: i) a “General Environmental management conditions for construction contractors”
in the EMSF; ii) an adequate sanitation infrastructure as a condition for all interventions in infrastructure under
Component 2, and; iii) a more specific environmental screening process to identify social and environmental
issues and decide on any mitigation measures.

                                                        12
resulted from a misalignment between Bank and UNDP procedures. There was, however, no
evidence of a misappropriation of project funds. First, the Bank auditor was not able to access
UNDP accounts (since UNDP procedures did not require disclosure of accounts to project
auditors, having their own internal accounting and auditing procedures). The incomplete
documentation prevented the audit from fully tracking how the money was spent across project
activities supported under Component 2. Second, UNDP had covered a number of expenditures
which had not been explicitly stipulated in the contract between UNDP and MEPSA with
project funding and there were some Project expenses for which there was no justification.
When FM and procurement reviews were undertaken in 2007, UNDP agreed to better align its
procedures with those of the Bank and to make its accounts more readily available for Project
audits to be carried out. Also, during the MTR in 2007 it was recommended that the Project
continue to use an FA as a mitigation measure and to further strengthen fiduciary capacity
within the MEPSA and UNDP. In 2008, the above-mentioned ineligible expenditures were
reimbursed in full and the related recommendations from the MTR were followed.
35.     In 2009, the project audit covering the grace period of the original IDA grant (4 months
following project closing – from July 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009) identified the execution
of ineligible expenditures. Specifically, the following unauthorized transactions had been
made: (i) payments by UNDP to contractors; and (ii) payments for project management. It also
identified (iii) a large amount of funds still in the UNDP account. Following extensive
discussions between the Bank, UNDP, and the MEPSA (in which detailed explanations were
provided on each issue identified), (i) MEPSA agreed to: (a) finance these payments from its
budget; and (b) reimburse the corresponding IDA-ineligible expenditures; while (ii) UNDP
agreed to transfer the remaining funds in its account to the Bank. These agreed actions were
implemented though with some delay and in 2009, the Bank received the following
reimbursements: FCFA 46,188,655 (approximately US$95,000) for payments made to
contractors (during the grace period); FCFA 3,695,092 (approximately US$7,000) for
operational costs covered by project funding for UNDP’s management of Component 2; and
FCFA 179,979,239 (approximately US$350,000) for funds remaining in the UNDP account
that had not yet been returned.
36.     Issues related to ineligible expenditures were also encountered under the AF. In 2010,
the Bank’s procurement review requested that FCFA 26,728,000 (approximately US$60,000)
be reimbursed to the Bank to cover ineligible expenditures (of this amount) which had been
processed. Specifically, the Bank review had identified some irregularities related to
procurement activities carried out prior to the Bank’s issuance of No Objections as well as
failure to fully adhere to Bank guidelines. Following FM and procurement reviews, a related
action plan was prepared and implemented which strengthened FM and procurement
supervision. It had been determined that the FM issues had occurred as a result of: (i)
challenges around the recruitment of the Project internal auditor (as the existing auditor
resigned); and (ii) weak capacity of the procurement staff in the PCU, especially since the FA
was no longer supporting the Project. With delays, the funds were fully reimbursed in 2011. In
each of these instances, the Bank worked closely with MEPSA and UNDP often holding
technical missions to devise concrete action plans to address the identified issues – plans which
were enacted on the ground.




                                               13
2.5        Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
37.    To date, there has been no post-completion operation. However, the Bank intends to
continue its engagement with the GOC in the education sector. Specifically, it aims to support
the GOC’s efforts to assist vulnerable youth through the Skills Development for Employability
Project (P128628) signed in October 2014. Furthermore, in the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) (2013-2016), the Bank expressed its willingness to fund an education project in Fiscal
Year 2015. A PER of the sector is also currently being prepared.
38.    In the meantime, funding for the continuation of activities originally supported by the
Project continues to be provided by the GOC through its budget and by other development
partners including UNESCO and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). UNICEF, for
example, plans to provide approximately US$1.4 million for the EFA and Quality Program
earmarked in MEPSA’s 2014 budget. Specifically, these funds will be used to rehabilitate
schools and their canteens.
3.      Assessment of Outcomes
3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
39.     Relevance of Objectives. The relevance of the PDOs both under the project’s original
design and under the AF was Substantial. The PDO was aligned with: (i) the GOC’s national
development plans; (ii) major international education frameworks including that of the EFA-
Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) 16; (iii) priorities under the TSS (i.e., supporting the
rehabilitation of the school network and school system); and (iv) the main features of the PRSP
series (which, in the education sector, focused on increasing access and implementation of
policy reforms related to quality and efficiency). Given that the Bank was the main actor in the
sector, the GOC considered PRAEBASE to be the primary mechanism (and source of funding)
for efforts in the ROC targeted towards rebuilding the education system and implementing
reforms to improve quality, efficiency and equity in the provision of basic education services.
The GOC’s support of this project was evidenced in its decision to provide a substantial
amount of counterpart funding (US$15 million) under the AF in 2009.
40.     As of project closing, the PDOs remained highly relevant and aligned with the current
CAS (2013-2016) which aims to support the GOC in improving the delivery of basic public
services, including education services. Within the education sector, the sought outcomes
include, among others, increased equity, access and the quality of basic education – delivered
in an efficient manner.
41.    Relevance of Design. The design of the project (both under the original project and the
AF) is rated Modest. The project built on lessons learned from previous operations, a number
of which were implemented in post-conflict settings in Africa and Latin America, some of the
key lessons which informed the project’s design included: (i) improving local governance and
empowerment of local communities; (ii) the importance of using community-driven
approaches in construction of social sectors; (iii) the importance of ensuring stakeholder
consultation in the design and implementation phases; and (iv) drawing on in-depth needs
assessments to guide activities to assist vulnerable groups. The original and revised project
designs (under the AF) incorporated activities directly supportive of the GOC’s efforts to:
expand access (construction and/or rehabilitation of classrooms); improve the quality of

16
     Now called the Global Partnership for Education (GPE).

                                                        14
education services (teacher training, provision of textbooks, etc.); and increase equity (by
supporting sensitization campaigns and programs to increase access among hard-to-reach
populations). However, as described earlier there were some shortcomings in project design
including: inconsistencies in the presentation of indicators; an overly ambitious design given
the project timeframe especially in terms of capacity-building and a demand-driven civil works
approach; and an underestimation of the time required for FM and procurement capacity to
develop. Though some of these design features posed challenges throughout the life of the
Project, there were notable improvements observed under the AF. Principle among these
included: (i) a marked improvement in the implementation of project activities related to
school construction and rehabilitation; (ii) capacity-building within the MEPSA; (iii) closer
collaboration with UNDP and alignment of FM and procurement procedures; and (iv) the
consistent follow up on FM and procurement issues using concrete action plans.
42.     Relevance of Implementation. The relevance of implementation is rated Substantial
given the number of achievements within a very difficult post-conflict environment. While
some activities were not realized in full (e.g., roll-out of EMIS and the establishment of a
demand-driven approach to civil works), the majority of planned activities were completed by
project closing, including: (i) reconstruction of the school network; (ii) reduction of ‘ghost’
personnel in MEPSA; (iii) preparation of a medium-term sector strategy; (iv) training of
teachers; (v) provision of textbooks in core subjects to primary and lower secondary school
students; (vi) training of a large number of out-school children; and (vii) activities to increase
the number of indigenous children with basic skills.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
43.     Assessment of PDO Achievements. The overall rating for achievement of the PDO is
Moderately Satisfactory given the gains observed under the original project and later under
the AF. A review of PDO indicators showed positive trends in terms of improvements in the
quality, equity and efficiency of the education system. These were substantial achievements in
light of the post-conflict context in which PRAEBASE was implemented. Moreover,
achievements in these areas are reflective of broader international frameworks including EFA
objectives and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As the Project was the main
intervention in the education sector (and provided the primary source of funding) throughout
the time in which it was implemented, improvements in these areas (measured by these
indicators) can be, at least in part, attributable to activities initiated by and supported under the
Project.
44.     The PDO for both the original Project and the AF focused on improving quality,
efficiency and equity in basic education; with only slight revisions in the PDO under the AF.
However, given these slight revisions, progress towards achievement of the PDO is analyzed
under the original project and under the AF.
Achievement of PDO-level indicators under the original Project
45.     As discussed previously, prior to 2007 as was common practice at the time, indicators
were not regularly tracked in each status report. Beginning, however, in 2007 a consistent set
of five PDO indicators were reported on in the status reports. For analytical purposes, this set




                                                 15
of indicators is used to measure achievement towards the PDO under the original Project. 17 The
achievements are summarized in Table 3 which follows.

     Education have the capacity to produce         No              No               No          Target not met
     education annual plans.

46.      During implementation of the original project, important gains were observed in quality
aspects of the education system – most notably in the primary completion rate which increased
from 50 percent to 77 percent during this period (surpassing the original target of 70 percent).
There is also evidence of improvements in efficiency with: (i) the teacher-student ratio
decreasing from a baseline of 92 to 63 during this same period (also surpassing the target of
70); (ii) the primary repetition rate decreasing from 30 percent to 21 percent (nearly achieving
the target of 20 percent); and (iii) the administrative personnel to teachers ratio decreasing
from 40 to 24 (though not meeting the end-of-project target of 15). However, the Project was
less successful in terms of sufficiently developing the capacity of the regional departments of
education (DDEPSAs) to prepare, implement and monitor regional annual education plans.
Achievements in terms of equity can be observed in relation to the outputs and outcomes under
Component 4 which targeted disadvantaged and hard-to-reach populations to increase their
access to basic education, notable among these was the increase in indigenous children
enrolled in formal education observed during this period as well as the increase in the number
of these children who received pedagogical kits and school uniforms.
Achievement of PDO-level indicators under the AF
47.     Under the Level 2 restructuring approved in 2012, the RF was modified. The indicators
used to measure progress towards achievement of the PDO during the implementation of the
AF are those that were introduced at the time of the Restructuring. As described previously,
project indicators were classified as “Intermediate Outcomes/Indicators” (or Tier 2 indicators)
in the PP for the AF. Consistent with the RF and monitoring template (and practice) at the time
of the AF in 2009, Tier 2 level indicators could actually be either outcome or output indicators.
Under the 2012 Restructuring, however, a clearer distinction was made between the types of


17
  These indicators include 2 indicators from the DGA, although with some slight revisions: indicators 2 and 3; the
remaining indicators were in the PAD.

indicators (e.g., in terms of their classification as either PDO- or intermediate-level). Table 4
summarizes the progress made on these indicators under the AF.

       school enrolment

48.    As presented in the table above, gains were observed across most PDO indicators
during this period: (i) the completion rate continued to increase under the AF even if at a
slower pace (with the target partially achieved); (ii) efficiency continued to show gains
evidenced in the teacher student ratio (for which the target was achieved); and (iii) equity also
improved evidenced in increases in both gender parity and in the gross enrolment rate (with
both end-of-project targets being surpassed). The Project, however, was less successful in
terms of reducing the ratio of administrative personnel to teachers at the school level.
Achievement of Intermediate-level Indicators
49.     The intermediate-level indicators were strongly tied to project activities and showed
important gains throughout the life of the project. For ease of analysis, these indicators are
discussed in relation to the three key areas captured under the PDO – equity, quality, and
efficiency. Progress observed under the Project is summarized below.
50.      Quality. PRAEBASE supported improvements in the quality of education services. The
Project contributed to an increase in availability of quality education inputs such as qualified
teachers, textbooks for core subjects, better inspection support, revised curricula, and the
introduction of testing for measuring learning outcomes. It also supported a number of
activities (e.g., preparation of an institutional action plan, international workshops, training on
ICT) designed to strengthen technical capacity within the MEPSA. 18 The Project: (i) improved
qualifications of 1,697 primary teachers; and (ii) trained 9,141 primary teachers (including
bénévoles) and 1,760 lower secondary education teachers. In total, PRAEBASE upgraded the
qualifications of 12,598 basic education teachers. In addition, (iii) 2,548 school directors; and
(iv) 945 inspectors and pedagogical advisors for primary education received training. Finally,
(v) 2.6 million Math, French, and Civic Education textbooks at the primary level; and (vi)
340,000 textbooks in French and Mathematics at the secondary level were bought and
distributed.

51.     Equity. Under Component 4, the Project piloted programs for out-of-school youth and
supported educational programs for Pygmies. Specifically, the Component provided TA to
develop training programs and sensitization campaigns, along with basic materials for Pygmy
children, and TA to prepare a strategy to promote equitable access to education among
disadvantaged children. A number of gains in equity were observed. Out of the over 1,400 out-
of-school youth that were trained under the Project, 62 percent were working in a new activity
with six months of completing the training and 4,030 additional indigenous children enrolled in
primary education after having been provided school materials (e.g., pedagogical kits, school
uniforms, etc.) as an incentive to enroll in basic education. Over 80 percent of the indigenous
children that enrolled as a result of these activities had remained in school as of project closing.
52.      Efficiency. With support from the Project, the following were accomplished: (i)
statistical yearbooks were produced (with some delays); (ii) a sectoral strategy for EFA-FTI
was approved; (iii) the share of education budget allocated to primary level increased as did
(iv) expenditures on education (as percentage of total public expenditure); and (v) improved
HR management with more than 3,000 ‘ghost’ personnel being removed from MEPSA’s
budget. Further, school-based management was supported wherein: (vi) 1,694 SMCs were
created; and (vii) SIPs were implemented by 270 of these SMCs. The increased availability of
data (e.g., on teacher distribution, annual sector statistics) combined with construction and
rehabilitation of schools is thought to have contributed to some improvements in the pupil
teacher ratio which occurred during the Project. Further, although in percentage terms the
budget increases were not very high, in nominal terms they were very important. Section 3.3
and Annex 3 provide further details on the efficiency aspects of the Project.
53.       Detailed information on outputs and activities under the Project are presented in Annex
2.
54.     The rating for overall PDO achievement is Moderately Satisfactory. This is based on
the discussion above and on the calculation summarized in Table 5. In calculating the overall
rating for the PDO, the following was considered: the original IDA grant (IDA-H1270)
contributed to 57.6 percent of the overall IDA Project funding and the AF grant (IDA-H4870)
contributed to 42.3 percent of overall IDA Project funding.

   The scale used was: highly unsatisfactory = 1; unsatisfactory = 2; moderately unsatisfactory = 3; moderately

3.3 Efficiency
55.      Positive trends in key education indicators and internal efficiency gains.
PRAEBASE was designed to support the GOC in achieving universal quality primary
education by 2015 through improved efficiency, quality, and equity in the provision of basic
education. As the main intervention in the education sector during the period from 2005 to
2013, the Project contributed to positive gains which occurred in the sector during this period:
(i) the GER increased from 107 percent to 116 percent; (ii) the completion rate increased from
50 percent to 79 percent; and (iii) the girls to boys ratio in primary education increased from
0.91 to 0.96. Gains in internal efficiency in primary education were evidenced by decreases in:
(i) the repetition rate (from 30 to 22.87 percent); and (ii) the pupil teacher ratio (from 92 to 57).
56.     Improved management in the education sector. Efficiency of the sector improved
through changes in MEPSA HR management including, most notably, the reduction of ‘ghost’
personnel from the MEPSA’s budget. Further, the decrease in the pupil teacher ratio also
points to a more effective distribution of human resources across the sector. The development
of school-based management which was supported under the project is expected to bring gains
in efficiency over time in terms of the use of resources at the school-level, as communities are
empowered to take a lead role in school management. The budget allocation to education
increased with a more balanced distribution between the sub-sectors observed over the Project
life (with increased funding to primary education). The use of EMIS data and a financial
simulation model in the preparation of a medium-term budgeted sector plan contributed to the
changes in budget allocations among education sub-sectors.
53.     Project Costs. Component 2 Rehabilitation of the School Infrastructure/ School
Infrastructure and Management received US$14.5 million in IDA funds and US$6.5 million in
GOC funds making it the largest Component under the project. Under this Component,
classrooms were built and rehabilitated at an average unit cost of FCFA 11,284,820
(approximately US$23,700). Although this unit cost is higher than that of other comparator
countries such as Ghana (US$16,000 in 2008) or Madagascar (US$20,000 in 2011), it is lower
than the unit cost (for classroom construction), for example, in South Sudan (another post-
conflict country where the average cost is US$30,000). Civil works in remote rural areas are
very expensive due to higher transportation costs. For instance, in some departments with
dense forest, materials must be transported through or procured in Gabon. Costs associated
with the use of a FA under the original grant, and the overhead costs associated with UNDP’s
management of Component 2, increased the operating costs of the Project. However, the use of
the FA was deemed to be a very important fiduciary mitigation measure for the Project.
Further, though the overhead costs associated with UNDP’s management of civil works were
higher than anticipated, in the post-conflict environment there were few (if any) organizations
that had the necessary capacity to implement these civil works activities envisaged under this
Component. In light of these factors, the overall rating for efficiency is Modest.
3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
57.     The objectives and design of the Project were well-aligned with the GOC’s strategic
objectives for the education sector and reflected the main thrust of larger international
programs, including EFA and MDG initiatives. Most of the PDO-level indicators were
achieved during the project life and in some cases, surpassed their end-of-project targets –
making the achievement of PDOs rating Moderately Satisfactory as per Table 5 in section
3.2. Relevance of implementation was Substantial with important gains observed, and while

                                                 19
there were some significant delays, most Project activities were completed during the life of
the project. By project closing, approximately 97 percent of available project funds had been
disbursed. Although there were important efficiency gains (e.g., reduction of ‘ghost’ personnel
from MEPSA’s budget, decreases in repetitions rates, etc.), civil works activities were typically
delayed though in most cases completed, while the expenditures associated with these
interventions were comparable to those costs observed in other similar post-conflict settings.
For these reasons, project efficiency was Modest. The overall outcome rating is, therefore,
Moderately Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
58.     Poverty Impact, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. The Project had a
sizeable impact on gender equity and social development. Under the Project, the girl to boy
ratio in primary school enrollment (PDO level indicator) increased from 0.91 to 0.96 in 2013.
The Project’s support to the construction of latrines may have played an important role in
increasing equity as available research suggests that placing latrines in schools results in an
increase in school attendance among girls. Since one of the Project components (Component 4:
Out-of-School Youth and Pygmy Children) focused specifically on vulnerable groups, it was
well-positioned to promote the inclusion of disadvantaged populations in the education system
which could have a continued and important impact in the medium- and long-term. Further,
many of the out-of-school youth who participated in the training program supported by the
Project subsequently signed employment contracts with artisans – providing them with an
additional source of income. Although the sustainability of the SMCs established is limited, the
creation of SMCs and their role in empowering the school community was a major
achievement of the Project, and the strengthened engagement of the community in school life
is expected to be maintained.
59.     Institutional Change/Strengthening. The Project played an important role in
strengthening the MEPSA by introducing: (i) HR management improvements; (ii)
strengthening M&E (including EMIS and use of standardized tests to measure outcomes); (iii)
effective coordination of sector activities; (iv) fostering closer relationships with the
communities on education sector management; and (v) improving GOC’s capacity to: (a)
promote inclusion of disadvantaged populations; and to (b) develop and implement strategic
policies and key reforms.
60.    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative). There are no other
unintended outcomes or impacts other than what has been reported.
3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.
4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
61.     The risk to development outcomes at Project closing is rated Substantial. The risks
identified during Project preparation were appropriate. Some of those identified included: weak
capacity at the level of MEPSA (central and local levels); weak implementation capacity
(including fiduciary); and the potentially tumultuous post-conflict context and development of
tension around elections. Several mitigation measures were effectively implemented,
including: (i) the use of an FA to carry out FM for activities under the original project; (ii) an
outsourcing of the entire management of Component 2 to UNDP; and (iii) capacity building
and TA throughout the Project life.
                                               20
62.     The fiduciary risks remained substantial throughout the Project implementation period
and MEPSA’s technical and fiduciary capacity was not sufficiently strengthened at the local
and central levels. There were ineligible expenditures observed at different times under the
Project. Continuous mitigation measures were put in place to follow up and to resolve these
identified shortcomings. The Bank undertook field-level missions which developed FM and
procurement action plans to strengthen these aspects of the Project and to build GOC capacity
in these areas. Despite these efforts, many of the FM challenges remained, more due to
systemic issues than to project related ones. Given the above, the risk to development
outcomes remains Substantial following the Project.
5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1    Bank Performance
(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
63.      Bank performance at entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The original project
design was well-aligned with MEPSA’s 2002 EFA Sector Plan and also with the needs and
priorities identified in the TSS and I-PRSP. The design also benefitted from a series of key
analytical pieces including, among others, a PER as well as lessons learned from other IDA-
financed projects in ROC and operations in post-conflict countries in Africa, Latin America
and Eastern Europe. As noted earlier, a QER confirmed that the quality at entry was
Satisfactory. However, there were a number of shortcomings in the original project design
including: (i) weaknesses and inconsistencies (across documentation) in the RF; (ii) an overly
ambitious design (a) given the limited capacity and the time required for key reforms such as
decentralization and demand-driven construction to materialize and (b) which relied on a high
level of coordination among various agencies with different capacities and procedural norms
related to FM and procurement; and (iii) an underestimation of the need for strong and
continued capacity-building related to FM and procurement throughout the Project, particularly
early in the project life.
(b)    Quality of Supervision
64.    Bank performance with regards to quality of supervision is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. The Bank team carried out 19 supervision missions, two MTRs, FM and
procurement reviews as well as several technical audits. The Bank Team was able to respond
to Project-related issues resulting from the slow pace of institutional strengthening and
capacity-building at the central and local levels of the country’s education sector. The Bank
was also proactive in identifying FM and procurement-related issues and responding
appropriately by holding FM and procurement missions and collaboratively developing action
plans to address the issues promptly. Although the monitoring and reporting of Project’s
outputs and outcomes remained a challenge throughout most of the project life, beginning in
2007 there was improved consistency in the indicators used to measure progress – although
M&E design and implementation/utilization was never fully satisfactory. The Bank could have
done a better job of systematically documenting progress across each of the project
components. Though there were five TTLs throughout the implementation of the Project, the
Bank teams were comprised of technical experts with an appropriate skills mix for supporting
and supervising the Project. At a higher level, the Bank was able to establish and maintain a
strong dialogue with various entities, including the MEPSA, UNDP, and CSOs which was a
notable accomplishment in a difficult post-conflict context characterized by significant need

                                             21
and serious capacity constraints. Despite the context and difficulties faced during
implementation, the Bank and the GOC were able to make significant strides in improving the
country’s education system.
(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
65.   Based on the performance of the Bank at entry and supervision and the overall project
outcome rating, the rating for overall Bank performance is Moderately Satisfactory.
5.2    Borrower Performance
(a)    Government Performance
66.     The GOC demonstrated a high level of commitment to the Project, under the original
IDA Grant and the AF for which it provided US$15 million in counterpart funds. Though
ineligible expenditures were identified during project implementation as described earlier,
these expenditures were reimbursed in full (though with some delays) and the GOC was
proactive in addressing these issues. In addition, the effectiveness of the original grant and the
AF were delayed as effectiveness conditions were not met during the expected time frame. At
the same time, however, the GOC was faced with the large task of post-conflict reconstruction
of the education system following a long period of conflict. In this environment of significant
need and limited resources, the GOC was able to play an active role in the sector and to
achieve considerable gains in the sector. These achievements are likely to serve as the building
blocks for improving the quality and delivery of education in ROC moving forward. The
rating for Government performance is, therefore, Moderately Satisfactory.
(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
67.     Over the life of the Project, MEPSA’s responsibilities in its role as implementing
agency increased significantly. Most notably, the FA used early in project implementation was
no longer used under the AF in 2009 as MEPSA took on these responsibilities. MEPSA was
also responsible for general oversight of the Project and coordinating various inputs from a
number of entities (e.g., PCU, FA, UNDP and DDPESAs) often with different procedural and
management norms. This posed a considerable challenge particularly as the capacity of
MEPSA itself did not materialize quickly during the early years of project implementation.
Though financial reports and regular audits were submitted in a timely manner, there were a
series of FM and procurement issues identified at various points during the project life. While
both the Bank and MEPSA were proactive in identifying and addressing these bottlenecks,
these issues persisted. Since MEPSA’s technical and fiduciary capacity was and remained
relatively weak, the responsibility for implementation of Component 2 was assigned to UNDP.
68.      UNDP played an important role in the Project as it was given responsibility for
implementation of Component 2 in light of MEPSA’s capacity constraints at the time of
appraisal. Though UNDP participated in Bank missions, since the procedures and guidelines
relating to FM and procurement were not fully aligned, the Project experienced delays in
implementing civil works activities and in validating financial transactions in a timely manner.
Though UNDP did modify its approach and ultimately completed most of its assigned
activities (e.g., completing classroom construction/ rehabilitation and preparing contingency
plans to ensure their completion), these difficulties were never fully remedied and hampered
the overall efficiency of project implementation.

69.    In light of the above, the Implementing Agencies’ performance is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.
(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
70.    Taking into account the ratings for Government and Implementing Agencies’
performance, and as well as the Project’s overall outcome rating, Borrower performance is
rated Moderately Satisfactory.
6.       Lessons Learned
71.     Capacity development and institutional strengthening take time to materialize
especially in a post-conflict context characterized by significant need, competing demands
and limited resources. This knowledge should, therefore, factor greatly into all aspects of
project design. The Project’s design relied on an assumption that key education institutions
would quickly regain the institutional capacity that had dissipated during the protracted conflict
period. The Project’s results and experience during implementation indicate that while capacity
may develop in areas relevant to specific project activities, significant gains in institutional
capacity (e.g., those required to undertake key reforms such as decentralization) require more
time to develop and require continued support from several partners.
72.     Working effectively with other organizations in project implementation necessitates a
thorough understanding of each organization’s procedures, guidelines and field-level
practice in the design phase. The challenges encountered in civil works activities under the
PRAEBASE, for which UNDP was the main implementing agency, show some of the potential
bottlenecks that can arise without this understanding. However, by bolstering this
understanding collaboration can be highly beneficial – allowing the project to effectively
accomplish shared objectives in an environment characterized by severe capacity constraints.
73.     Persistency in investments in equity pays off. Activities targeting disadvantaged
groups took quite some time to start, however, keeping such activities in the AF proved
fundamental for the improved equity resulting from the Project. This was the case for the
persistency in building latrines (which was neglected during implementation of the original
grant) and that should have an impact in improved gender parity as a result of the Project. The
best practices of the training provision to out-of-school youth were used in the design of one of
the components of the Skills Development for Employability Project (P128628), aimed at
extending the equity gains of PRAEBASE.
74.     Project documentation and reporting should be consistent and organized especially
in terms of the M&E framework established to monitor progress under the Project. The
inconsistencies in the project RF across various project documents, as well as the inconsistent
reporting on progress, particularly earlier in the project life may have obscured some important
project gains.

                        Support to Basic Education Project – PRAEBASE

                                  Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The Republic of Congo Support to Basic Education Project (PRAEBASE) was
implemented with financing from two separate IDA grants, an original grant in the total
amount of US$20 million and an additional financing (AF) grant in the amount of US$15
million 20. The original Project Development Objective (PDO) was to support the Recipient’s
effort to improve the quality of basic education by: (i) increasing efficiency in allocation and
management of budgetary resources earmarked for basic education, and (ii) fostering equitable
access to education services with emphasis on underserved areas, out-of-school youth, and
other minority groups, such as Pygmies.
2.      The PDO was only slightly revised under the AF, as the AF aimed to scale up activities
which had begun under the original grant. Thus the revised PDO was a refinement of the PDO
for the original grant. The revised PDO was to improve efficiency, quality and equity in the
provision of basic education in the territory of the Recipient with a view to achieving universal
quality primary education by 2015. 21
3.      PRAEBASE was one of the only large-scale projects in basic education in the ROC
during the period in which it was implemented. Civil works in the sub-sector were financed
solely by PRAEBASE (using both IDA and counterpart funds under the AF) and support from
other donors, such as UNICEF, UNESCO and the French Development Agency (Agence
Française de Devéloppement – AfD) was very limited. This continues to be the case today.
Thus, PRAEBASE, alongside with ROC budget funds, was the main financier and thus largely
responsible for basic education development in Congo during the Project life. 22
4.      The Project provided support to a sector in great need, facilitating the
reconstruction of a school network in a context of increasing decentralization, and correcting
system inefficiencies. Overall, it aimed to develop and consolidate delivery of quality and
inclusive basic education in line with the MDGs. To achieve these objectives, the Project
aimed to: (i) strengthen MEPSA’s planning function at the central and local level; (ii) carry out
the physical reconstruction of the school network; (iii) correct inefficiencies in teacher
distribution and management system; (iv) increase the budget allocation for the sector, and in
particular for basic education; (v) improve the quality of service delivery through trained
teachers and widely distributed textbooks based on revised curricula; and (vi) address the
challenges of providing education to autochthonous children and out-of-school youth, in order
to respond to important inequity challenges in the education sector. In doing so, PRAEBASE
focused on providing support to civil works, technical assistance (TA) and training, improving
access to education inputs (e.g., procuring textbooks), piloting training programs for

   As per the respective DGAs.
22
   AF financing was in a total amount of US$30 million of which US$15 million were provided by IDA and
US$15 million were counterpart funds. Counterpart funds financed in 50 percent PRAEBASE activities; the
remaining 50 percent was financed by the IDA grant.

disadvantaged groups, producing school yearbooks, and supporting policy development and
implementation. The following is a list of project outputs by component.
5.     Component 1: Capacity-Building for MEPSA 23. Based on the civil works completed
under PRAEBASE (with consideration for the planned activities as outlined in the DGA),
Component 1 is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Component 1 supported activities which
would be important in preparing the basic education sub-sector for successful decentralization.
This included providing TA to the central level to improve its capacity to define and manage
sound policy planning and implementation as well as monitoring of such policies, which aimed
at improving the internal efficiency of the sector. A set of reforms was expected be introduced,
namely at the level of management of human and budget resources.
6.       Sub-component 1.1: Capacity Building for Planning. The objectives of this sub-
component were to support the establishment and operationalization of an Education
Management and Information System (EMIS) at the central and regional levels that could
facilitate the development of coherent and efficient education sector programs with a medium
and long term vision. The Project, therefore, planned to: (i) support capacity-building of
planning units at the central and regional level; (ii) procure the necessary physical inputs for
the planning units to function, including computers and software, energy generators, and office
equipment; and to (iii) pilot and implement yearly data collection and analysis, and produce
education statistics yearbooks.
           Capacity-building activities. PRAEBASE supported a variety of capacity building
           activities to strengthen MEPSA’s staff capacity in data collection and analysis. Key
           among these were: (i) an international workshop 24 for 10 senior staff from MEPSA’s
           Planning Unit where experiences were shared with counterparts from another country;
           (ii) training of 100 central and department level MEPSA staff in planning and
           management; and (iii) training of 180 regional teams on information and
           communication technology (ICT). Yearly workshops to support data cleaning, analysis
           and production of education data were carried out during the lifetime of the Project.
           Procurement of physical outputs. The sub-component equipped MEPSA’s Planning
           Unit and several units in the various regional departments according to their needs.
           Production of school yearbooks. The Project financed and provided TA for a school
           census. Baseline data on the sector and on the basic education school network was
           collected. In addition, questionnaires were prepared and piloted for regular data
           collection on the key indicators. In addition to supporting data collection activities, this
           sub-component also supported data cleaning and analysis. It also supported the
           production of school yearbooks. The school mapping method was also introduced in
           several regions of the country, which allowed for the preparation of manuals defining
           the roles of each administrative level. Finally, the data collected under the sub-
           component allowed for the preparation of an education sector country status report

        (CSR) 25 which informed the elaboration of the education sector strategy under Sub-
        component 1.3 (supported under the AF).
7.      Most of the expected outputs under the sub-component were realized. However,
the full roll-out of the EMIS was not accomplished during the Project life and annual statistics
were, therefore, only carried out with significant delays. There are still coordination challenges
in terms of preparing for data collection, ensuring adequate funding, undertaking data analysis
and producing annual yearbooks on time.
8.      Sub-component 1.2: Support to the Regional Departments and for the
Decentralization of Education; and Sub-component 1.3: Improvement of Human Resource
and Budget Management which were combined in the AF under Sub-component 1.2:
Institutional Strengthening of the MEPSA. These sub-components aimed at supporting
MEPSA’s institutional reorganization within the context of decentralization; strengthening
DDPESAs; and promoting human resources (HR) and budget management reforms. To this
end, the sub-components supported the following activities: (i) preparation and implementation
of an action plan for the institutional reorganization of the MEPSA (centralized and
decentralized levels); (ii) development and implementation of annual education plans with the
participation of the DDEPSAs; (iii) development and implementation of school improvement
plans (SIPs) by SMCs with the support of school inspectors and planning units; (iv)
reformulation of personnel management policies, especially the reallocation of teaching staff
and modified incentive mechanisms for keeping teachers in schools in disadvantaged regions;
(v) elimination of ‘ghost’ personnel from MEPSA’s budget; and (vi) improvement of budget
management.
        Preparation and implementation of an action plan for MEPSA’s institutional
        reorganization. An institutional assessment of MEPSA was carried out in 2006. The
        action plan for its reorganization that was prepared, however, was not implemented.
        The sub-components financed the equipment for DDEPSAs and inspections units
        including procurement of motorbikes and pirogues (small boats), and provided
        capacity-building activities for DDEPSAs and inspection staff.
        Development and implementation of annual education plans with DDEPSAs’
        participation. Under this sub-component TA and capacity-building were provided to
        DDEPSA staff in the preparation of annual education plans, which were, in turn,
        prepared by some DDEPSAs. However, as MEPSA’s decentralized reorganization was
        not established, there were limited incentives among the DDEPSAs to produce and
        implement the annual plans in a systematic manner.
        Development and implementation of SIPs by SMCs with the support of inspections
        and planning units. SMCs were supposed to prepare and submit SIPs to the DDEPSAs
        and inspections for approval. This process was critical in strengthening the demand-
        driven civil works program under Component 2. Activities related to the development
        and implementation of SIPs were supported by these sub-components and by
        Component 2. Component 2 created more than 1,600 SMCs which received training in

  The World Bank provided TA to MEPSA’s planning team for the preparation of the Education CSR, which was
published by the Bank in 2010 as part of the Africa Region Human Development Series: Le système éducatif
congolais: diagnostic pour une revitalisation dans un context macroéconomique plus favorable.

           the preparation of the SIPs. By the end of project, 270 SIPs were prepared and
           implemented, which exceeded the original target of 150.
           HR management – Teachers management system. The sub-components provided
           financial and technical support to the preparation and implementation of a teachers’
           census. This was essential in identifying ‘ghost’ teachers and teachers from other
           ministries being paid under MEPSA’s budget. It also provided information on the
           proportion of bénévoles in the teaching force (35 percent) and was useful in informing
           the design and implementation of the teacher training program (under Component 3)
           targeting those teachers with very little (if any) qualifications (including the bénévoles).
           From February 2008, the salaries of 5,148 identified ‘ghost’ teachers were frozen and
           1,672 agents were identified as ‘ghost’ personnel with their salaries also suspended. In
           addition, 2,253 staff from other ministries was identified under MEPSA’s budget. The
           census allowed for a better understanding of teacher distribution in the ROC. On the
           basis of the census, the sub-components supported the development of policies on
           reallocation of teaching staff and established incentives for teachers’ to remain in
           disadvantaged regions. However, there was insufficient political commitment to
           approve and implement the proposed policies.
           Budget management. The sub-components aimed at supporting the preparation and
           monitoring of annual education budgets which would ensure budget allocations
           between the sub-sectors were balanced. The CSR supported under Sub-component 1.1
           played an important role in ensuring such balance. The CSR provided a sector financial
           analysis which was used to inform decisions on budget allocations. It was expected that
           the annual budget include increased funding to recurrent costs other than salaries, and a
           budget line would be added to provide support to schools for operational costs. The cost
           estimates were to be based on the SIPs and the budget managed by the SMCs. Training
           and capacity-building activities at the central and local levels were supported by the
           sub-components. SMCs and planning units in MEPSA and DDEPSAs benefited from
           budget management training. Under the Project, a positive trend was observed in terms
           of increased budget allocations to the sector (increasing from 9 to 12 percent between
           2004 and 2012), to basic education and to recurrent costs (other than for salaries). At
           the same time, the budget line for SIP related operational costs was not established.
9.      Most of the sub-components’ activities were implemented and the majority of the
challenges encountered related to political commitment to undertaking key reforms, including
the reorganization of MEPSA, increasing decentralization and undertaking teacher
management reforms. Under the sub-components, capacity was strengthened at the central and
local levels and improvements in HR and financial resources management were observed with
the elimination of MEPSA’s ‘ghost’ personnel. As noted above, the overall budget allocation
to education – and to primary education – increased under the Project.
10.     Sub-component 1.3: Support to the development and implementation of an EFA-FTI
sector plan 26. This sub-component, introduced under the AF, aimed to improve sector planning
and management through the preparation and implementation of a sector wide budgeted
medium-term strategy. In addition to guiding sector activities, this strategy could be used to
access additional funding to the sector through the EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund (CF) and would

allow for improved harmonization of donor support to the sector. The sub-component also
supported TA and studies needed for the preparation of the strategy.
        Education sector strategy. The sub-component financed a number of technical and
        high level workshops which allowed for in-depth discussions on the sector and, in turn,
        contributed to the development of a vision for the education sector. Using the CSR as a
        baseline and with TA under the sub-component, a medium term budgeted strategy
        (Document de stratégie sectorielle de l'éducation 2008-2020) was drafted. The strategy
        was approved by the education authorities and is currently under implementation. The
        strategy, however, was not endorsed by the local donor group, and thus no follow up
        request for funding from the EFT-FTI CF took place 27.

  The endorsement of the education sector plan by the local donor group was a pre-condition for the submission
of a funding request. The donor group appraised the plan and provided recommendations for its improvement. As
the plan was not revised by the authorities, it was never endorsed by the donors.

12.     Component 2: Rehabilitation of School Infrastructure / School Infrastructure and
Management. Component 2 is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Component was designed
with the objective of implementing a demand-driven approach to school rehabilitation and school
construction program in the context of increasing decentralization. Originally, the Component
focused exclusively on supporting the rehabilitation of school infrastructure destroyed during the
conflicts, and later, it also supported the construction of new schools. It was envisaged that:
SMCs would be established and trained in preparing SIPs – as a way to identify school
rehabilitation needs; and that DDEPSAs would be trained to play a fundamental role in assessing
and approving SIPs. Though the Component did support the creation and training of SMCs, it
was less successful in establishing a fully operational demand-driven approach to civil works. To
further strengthen the capacity and role of the SMCs, the Component also financed income
generating activities (IGAs) and small school projects (SSPs).
           Rehabilitation and construction of school infrastructure. The Component was
           responsible for rehabilitating 781 existing classrooms and constructing 135 new
           classrooms – in sum – creating an additional 908 primary education classrooms. The
           classroom civil works program had a completion rate of 95 percent. In addition, the
           Component supported the refurbishing of additional classrooms and the construction of
           teacher housing and latrine blocks. With regards to the latter, only a few latrine blocks
           were built under the Project 28. The Component also financed technical audits of civil
           works to guide future approaches to school construction in ROC – which would not
           necessarily require outsourcing to a third party (e.g., as it had been outsourced to UNDP
           under PRAEBASE).
           Creation and capacity building of SMCs and the implementation of demand-driven
           civil works. The Component supported the creation of 1,694 SMCs (out of the original
           target of 1,700). Training for SMCs was also provided under the Component (as well as
           under Component 1, as mentioned previously). However, the preparation of good quality
           SIPs was challenging for the newly created SMCs, and thus, only 270 SIPs were prepared
           and implemented, falling short of the original target of 600. This meant that the civil
           works’ demand-driven strategy could not be fully implemented.
           Implementation of IGAs and SSPs. The Component supported the preparation and
           implementation of 41 SSPs (out of an original target of 50). The SSPs were intended to
           finance activities to improve the school environment including: the construction of fresh
           water wells and latrines; and purchasing power for the school. A total of 164 IGAs were
           financed (14 more than originally estimated) which largely supported production
           activities (86 percent financed agriculture production-related activities, 7 percent
           financed rehabilitation of small infrastructure such as stables for animals, and 7 percent
           financed small activities in catering and business). To support the development of the
           IGAs and SSPs various sensitization activities took place.

14.     Component 3: Support to the Improvement of Quality of Education / Education
Programs. Based on the completeness of the work that was supported by the Component and
when compared to the prospective outlined activities in the DGA, Component 3 is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. This component aimed at improving the quality of education
‘software’ by: (i) supporting and expanding an in-service teacher training program for teachers in
primary and junior secondary schools through a cascade approach targeting all provinces of the
country; (ii)training trainers, inspectors, and school directors; (iii) providing TA for curriculum
development and piloting of standardized tests to measure student learning outcomes; and (iv)
providing textbooks and teaching guides for three core subjects (French, Math and Civic
Instruction for Peace-Building for primary and junior secondary schools).
15.     Sub-component 3.1: Training of Primary and Lower Secondary Teachers. 29 The
objectives of this sub-component were to provide TA for the preparation, implementation, and
revision of an in-service teacher training program; and to support the qualifying of bénévoles and
primary and lower secondary teachers. The sub-component supported the implementation of the
teacher training program throughout the Project life with revisions introduced under the AF
following an assessment of program implementation under the original IDA grant. The program
was implemented by the MEPSA based on a pilot study undertaken by the National Institute for
Research and Pedagogical Action (Institut National de Recherche et d’Action Pédagogique –
INRAP). The training program was supported by several modules focusing on academic subjects
(French and Math) and pedagogical issues. Training modules were adapted as curriculum
changes were introduced. Under the teacher training program, this sub-component supported the
training of 9,141 primary school teachers (out of a target of 6,000). Approximately two-thirds
(6,974) of these were bénévoles, thus significantly increasing the number of better qualified
teachers in primary education. An additional 1,760 lower secondary teachers were also trained.
Finally, the sub-component supported the training of 140 teacher trainers to administer the
program and the training of 2,548 school directors with a particular focus on the introduction of
the new curricula.
16.     Sub-component 3.2: Support to Inspections to Enhance Pedagogical Support to
Schools. This sub-component aimed at training school inspectors to more appropriately support
schools in the context of decentralization. The sub-component also aimed to introduce a different
approach to inspection geared towards pedagogical support and moving away from the
traditional ‘policing’ approach. To achieve this, TA, training and procurement of goods was
provided. The project trained 945 inspectors and pedagogical advisers in areas such as classroom
practices, assessment of learning outcomes, administrative, budget and school assets
management, and professional ethics. Office equipment for provincial inspections and
motorbikes and pirogues were procured to facilitate the work of inspectors and pedagogical
advisers, allowing them to reach as many schools as possible.
17.     Sub-component 3.3: Textbooks and Pedagogical Material. This sub-component’s
objectives were to increase the number of textbooks in core subjects in primary and lower
secondary schools and to ensure that textbooks and other pedagogical materials were aligned
with the reformed curricula. To this end, the sub-component supported the development of
pedagogical materials and the procurement and distribution of textbooks, as well as revisions of
the content of primary and junior secondary textbooks in French and Math. These textbooks
were reproduced and distributed to primary and junior secondary schools throughout the country.
29
     The order to the sub-components follows their order in the AF PP.

                                                          33
As a result of this, 2.9 million textbooks (including those for Civic Instruction for Peace-
Building and for Natural Sciences under the AF) are being used by students in the ROC.
18.     Sub-component 3.4: Curriculum Development. The Sub-component was responsible for
revising primary and secondary education curricula and reviewing and adapting teacher training
programs accordingly. Therefore, the sub-component provided TA and training. As a result of
the TA provided to the MEPSA and to the INRAP, new primary education curricula was
prepared and validated in a high-level workshop in 2012. The sub-component also supported the
preparation, printing and distribution of 6,000 copies of the new curricula and provided TA to
four institutions and MEPSA departments 30 - supporting them in preparing 18 syllabi and 5 skills
development frameworks for in-service teacher training. The materials have yet to be fully
utilized.
19.    Sub-component 3.5: Introduction of standardized tests for primary and secondary
education. The sub-component was responsible for the design and implementation of
standardized tests for Grade 6 in French and Math. Capacity-building was provided to the
MEPSA in creating, piloting and implementing the tests. The tests were first carried out in
school year 2010-11 and MEPSA has included a budget line to finance annual testing. Tests for
secondary education have not yet been fully implemented.

21.     Component 4: Delivery of Formal and Non-Formal Education Services to Out-Of-
School Youth and Pygmies / Special Programs. Based on the work that was completed under
this Component – it is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This component was designed to support
the inclusion of disadvantaged groups in the education system. The Component provided training
to out-of-school youth (ages 14 to 19) and supported the development of mechanisms to support
school enrolment of Pygmy children. The Component provided TA to develop training programs
and sensitization campaigns, along with basic materials for Pygmy children, and the TA to
prepare a strategy to promote equitable access to education among disadvantaged children.
22.     Sub-component 4.1: Pilot Programs for Out-of-School Youth. The objective of this sub-
component was to pilot apprenticeship-based training programs that could allow out-of-school
youth to find employment either in informal sector enterprises or by becoming micro-
entrepreneurs. The sub-component contributed to strengthening local MPESA structures and
associations which identified artisans and training candidates for the apprenticeship-based
training program. Criteria were developed for accessing the training including a signed contract
with the parents of the youth allowing their children to complete the training in exchange for free
enrollment into the program. This sub-component identified 115 artisans who were trained in the
areas of sewing, hairdressing, welding, auto-mechanics, carpentry, and agriculture and cattle
breeding. These artisans were then supported by 40 local literacy teams (whose capacity was also
strengthened through workshops and seminars provided by the sub-component) who then trained
1,423 youth, of which 638 were boys and 785 were girls. The sub-component also established a
follow-up strategy to accompany the trainees. This, however, was only partially implemented, as
not all necessary information on the trainees was maintained. The program is now being
modified and scaled up by a new operation financed by IDA and the GOC called Skills
Development for Employability Project (P128628) approved in September 2013.
23.     Sub-component 4.2: Support to Education Programs for Pygmies. This sub-component
aimed at increasing school enrollment among Pygmy children. To achieve this, the Sub-
component supported capacity building, training, and the provision of educational goods to
improve the access of Pygmy children to primary school. Thus, the Sub-component supported
TA for the preparation of the Stratégie Nationale d’éducation des populations autochtones du
Congo (National Strategy for the Education of Congo’s Autochthonous Populations), defining
roles and responsibilities of the different actors in the education system responsible for the
education of Pygmy children. The Strategy was approved by the education authorities and is
under implementation. The sub-component also supported the procurement and distribution of
school kits (including a backpack with basic education materials) for autochthonous children 31.
More than 4,000 kits were distributed along with school uniforms also procured by the sub-
component. In addition, the Sub-component also provided TA to existing NGOs working with
autochthonous children in ROC and more than 1,000 t-shirts and materials for advocacy related
to education were provided to these NGOs along with training on advocacy campaigns. The
NGOs were fundamental in the distribution of the education materials and uniforms. Some of the
NGOs included: Association enfance créatrice de développement, CARITAS, and Association
congolaise pour le développement et l’intégration des populations autochtones. As a result of the
sub-component activities, an additional 4,030 indigenous children enrolled in primary education
during the life of the Project and 81 percent remained in school. Table 4 presents the various
output indicators for Component 4.

1.      This annex includes an analysis of the economic rationale for investments in basic
education in the ROC, and the cost effectiveness of PRAEBASE by focusing on issues of
external and internal efficiency, and sustainability. An analysis of rate of returns to education is
provided to assess the external efficiency of the education system. Issues of access, equity and
number of out-of-school children are presented so as to provide insight into the internal
efficiency of the system. Sustainability analysis on Project interventions is also presented. It is
worth noting that the Project was the main intervention in the education sector in the ROC
during the last seven years. The Project played a fundamental role in changes observed in the
education system during its implementation. Finally, some elements on efficiency of Project
implementation are introduced.


External Efficiency
2.      Economic theory stipulates that participation in education builds human capital and is
typically associated with higher earnings over an individual’s life span. Moreover, educated
individuals tend to be better-nourished, healthier, and more productive. Educated women
usually enjoy more autonomy and their level of education level is associated with lower fertility
rates and mortality rates. Many studies using cross-national data from industrialized and
developing countries highlight the important contribution of education to economic growth 32.
Current education spending is a fundamental determinant of the future educational profile of the
working age population, thus, impacting future labor market outcomes and other socio-
economic outcomes, including better earnings, secured employment opportunities, and overall
well-being.
3.       An analysis of data from the Questionnaire des Indicateurs de base du bien-être -
Enquête d'évaluation et de suivi de la pauvreté 33(QUIBB2 2011) provides some compelling
evidence of the positive impact of investments in education on the labor market in ROC. Figure
1 illustrates the relationship between average wage earning by level of education and age in the
ROC in 2011. As the graph points out, a higher level of education is positively associated with
higher lifetime earnings. While the returns to education are relatively low at the primary level,
returns to upper secondary education are higher.

4.       The Mincerian regression coefficient shows that, among salaried workers, one additional
year of education is associated with an average 8.8 percent increase in monthly earnings (8.5
and 9.3 percent for male and female, respectively). Estimations by level of education show that
of all levels of education, completion of higher education is associated with the largest increase
in earnings (Figure 2). This direct relationship between level of education and earnings supports
the argument that education plays a significant role in poverty reduction in ROC. This means
that as educational attainment increases, the likelihood of an individual to move out of poverty
also increases. When wage employment is analyzed in relation to education level categories,
attainment of some primary education produces an increase in monthly earning of 3.4 percent;
the corresponding figures for completed primary, completed lower secondary, completed upper
secondary, TVET, and tertiary education are 28.3 percent, 57.9 percent, 89.0 percent, 100.1
percent and 131.8 percent, respectively. Overall, for wage employment, attainment of some
higher education seems to have the highest incremental yields, while incomplete primary
education attainment yields the least compared to the subsequent level of education. Further,
that rate of returns to education among females is greater than the rate of returns among males
for all levels of education.

5.      Although the ROC is a middle income country, the poverty incidence rate is very high
and it inversely relates to the educational attainment of the population. At the national level,
about 47 percent of the total population, and 42.1 percent of the working age population, live
below the absolute poverty line (less than US$1.25 a day). The poverty incidence quickly falls
with the level of educational attainment. An estimate from the QUIBB data (2011) for the
working age population (age 15-64) shows that about 61 percent of the workforce with no
education lives below the extreme poverty line compared to 59 percent for the workforce with
incomplete primary education, 50 percent with completed primary education, 38 percent with
completed lower secondary education, 25 percent with completed upper secondary education, 22
percent with TVET, and only 17 percent with some higher education (Figure 3).

6.      Educational attainment of the labor force directly correlates with the level of household
income (by quintile). Similar to the association with an individual’s income, a higher education
level of the household is associated with higher income. Only 2.6 percent of head of households
with some higher education fall within the lowest income quintile, while more than 50 percent

7.     Education also provides opportunities to engage in more productive activities and secure
employment, as it also improves the level of earning of the working age population. Earnings
from wage employment are 109,490 CFAF (approximately US$230) per month, compared to
58,943 (approximately US$124) CFAF and 42,525 (US$90) CFAF per month for self-
employment and family farming, respectively (Figure 5). Compared to 2005, the level of
earnings for all categories increased (note that this is a nominal comparison).

8.      The educational profiles of the employed population vary accordingly to the return
differential between sector of employment and employment status. About 80 percent of the
population with some higher education secured wage employment, and the corresponding
figures for TVET, upper secondary, lower secondary, completed primary, incomplete primary
and no education are 55 percent, 56 percent, 36 percent, 21 percent, 14 percent, 10 percent,
respectively (Figure 6). Figure 7 also demonstrates similar scenarios for sector of employment.

Internal Efficiency
9.      In line with PRAEBASE development objectives, the discussion on internal efficiency
focuses on quality of service delivery and educational indicators such on access, equity using
data from two household surveys (QUIBB 2005 and QUIBB 2011).


10.     Access to all levels of education improved between 2005 and 2011. A gross enrollment
rate (GER) greater than 100 percent, yet decreasing, indicates an increase in access to the system
of the appropriate age-cohort. (Figure 8). This can also be seen through the increase in the net
enrollment rate (NER), which increased at all levels of education. Overall, the access rate in
ROC significantly improved during Project implementation.
                                                                                                                   42

11.     Gender gaps in all levels of education improved overtime. Between 2005 and 2011,
access rates among females increased at a faster pace than rates among males in upper
secondary and tertiary education. Further, more girls attended upper secondary schools than
boys (Figure 9). ROC has met the respective Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for gender
parity (Figure 10).

12.    Access to upper secondary and tertiary education improved for all income quintiles
except for the lowest quintile. It is not unusual for the participation rate from the poorest
segment of the population to be low in upper and tertiary education, but the decline in the trend
is abnormal and further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind it. Although there is
a concern regarding the issue above mentioned, overall, equity in education service delivery
showed sound improvement during the lifetime of PRAEBASE (Figure 11).

13.     Analysis of out-of-school children also shows that the equity and efficiency of the
education system slightly improved over time. Except for the lower secondary case dropout
rates for all levels of education in 2011 were lower than those observed in 2005, during the early
stages of Project implementation. Overall, the out-of-school rate for the school age children
(official age 6-18) dropped from 16 percent in 2005 to 14 percent in 2011(Figure 12).

14.     Out-of-school rate by income quintile shows huge improvements between 2005 and
2011 for all income groups (Figure 13). ROC has one of the lowest prevalence rates of out-of-
school children in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (with the SSA average being 26 percent). Over the
Project life, the gap between the poorest and richest dropped from 17 percent to 6 percent.
Similarly, the gap between gender and area of residence also improved during the same period.
Therefore, the Project contributed to a reduction in the number of out-of-school children and in
disparities observed by income, gender, and other social factors.

Sustainability
15.      Based on recent estimates by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the GOC has a
sound budget framework and the momentum achieved with PRAEBASE could be sustained
within the existing fiscal space (Figure 14). In addition, the absolute value of the GOC’s budget
allocation to the education sector has been increasing over the past five years, and it accounts for
close to half of the total spending in the social sectors. However, due to fast growth in GDP, the
relative share allocated to education has been slightly declining, and it is also low if compared to
the SSA average of about 3.9 percent of GDP (2011). Although the value-added of PRAEBASE
is very high given that the country was emerging from a period of conflict, the Project amount
relative to the GOC’s own education budget is small, and there would be no significant pressure
on the budget once the Bank is no longer providing support to the sector in the ROC. The GOC
has a good reputation with implementation and sustaining of similar interventions. Thus, the
proposed incremental costs are manageable under the current fiscal space, bearing in mind that
there is a huge need for resources to maintain the sector. Therefore, the investment of
PREABASE is in line with the GOC priorities and manageable within the fiscal space of the
current budget framework. Consequently, the sustainability of PRAEBASE interventions is not
at risk.

Additional Aspects of efficiency of Project implementation
16.    Positive trends in key education indicators and internal efficiency gains.
PRAEBASE was designed to support the GOC in achieving universal quality primary education
by 2015 through improved efficiency, quality, and equity in the provision of basic education. As
the main intervention in the education sector during the period from 2005 to 2013, the Project
contributed to positive gains which occurred in the sector during this period: (i) the GER
increased from 107 percent to 116 percent; (ii) the completion rate increased from 50 percent to

                                                      46
79 percent; and (iii) the girls to boys ratio in primary education increased from 0.91 to 0.96.
Gains in internal efficiency in primary education are evidenced by decreases in: (i) the repetition
rate from 30 percent to 22.87 percent; and (ii) the pupil teacher ratio from 92 to 57.
17.     Improved management in the education sector. Efficiency improved through changes
in MEPSA HR management including, most notably, the reduction of ‘ghost’ personnel from
the MEPSA’s budget. Further, the decrease in the pupil teacher ratio also points to a more
effective distribution of human resources across the sector. The development of school-based
management which was supported under the project is expected to bring gains in efficiency in
terms of the use of resources at the school-level, as communities are empowered to take a lead
role in school management. The budget allocation to education increased with a more balanced
distribution between the sub-sectors observed over the Project life (with increased funding to
primary education). The use of EMIS data and a financial simulation model in the preparation of
a medium-term budgeted sector plan contributed to the changes in budget allocations between
education sub-sectors.
18.     Project Costs. Component 2 Rehabilitation of the School Infrastructure/ School
Infrastructure and Management received US$14.5 million in IDA funds and US$6.5 million in
GOC funds making it the largest Component under the project. Under this Component,
classrooms were built and rehabilitated at an average unit cost of FCFA 11,284,820
(approximately US$23,700). Although this unit cost is higher than that of other comparator
countries such as Ghana (US$16,000 in 2008) or Madagascar (US$20,000 in 2011), it is lower
than the unit cost (for classroom construction) in South Sudan (another post-conflict country
where the average cost is US$30,000). Civil works in remote rural areas are very expensive due
to higher transportation costs. For instance, in some departments with dense forest, materials
must be transported through or procured in Gabon. Costs associated with the use of a FA under
the original grant, and the overhead costs associated with UNDP’s management of Component
2, increased the operating costs of the Project. However, the use of the FA was deemed to be a
very important fiduciary mitigation measure for the Project. Further, though the overhead costs
associated with UNDP’s management of civil works were higher than anticipated, in the post-
conflict environment there were few (if any) organizations that had the necessary capacity to
implement these civil works activities envisaged under this Component.

1.      Le projet d’appui à l’éducation de Base (PRAEBASE) est né avec la signature de l’accord
de financement signé le 23 Septembre 2004 entre la République du Congo et la Banque Mondiale.
Au total, le PRAEBASE a reçu deux financements de l’IDA comprenant un premier Don IDA de 20
Millions $US et un Don supplémentaire de 15 Millions $US signé en avril 2009. A ces deux
financements s’ajoute le financement du Gouvernement Congolais qui représente un montant de 15
Millions de $US pour la deuxième phase. Au total, le financement du projet est d’un montant de 50
Millions de $US sur la période 2005 – 2013. Le premier financement du PRAEBASE est entré en
vigueur le 25 mars 2005 et les activités du projet ont effectivement démarré en avril 2005 avec une durée
prévisionnelle de quatre ans. Pour le deuxième financement, la mise en vigueur a eu lieu le 19 janvier
2010. Le projet s’est clôturé le 30 juin 2013.
2.      La tutelle du projet est assurée par le Ministère de l’Enseignement Primaire et Secondaire
Chargé de l’Alphabétisation (MEPSA), principal organisme responsable de l’exécution du
programme. Pour renforcer les capacités du MEPSA dans la gestion de projets, y compris les
procédures de passation des marchés et de gestion financière, une unité de gestion du PRAEBASE
(UGP) a été créée dès le démarrage de la première phase. Pour lui permettre d’assurer la gestion et la
coordination du projet, l’UGP a été doté du personnel suivant : (i) un coordinateur du projet ; (ii) des
coordinateurs pour les composantes 1, 3 et 4 ; (iii) un spécialiste en Suivi et Evaluation (S & E) ; (iv)
deux adjoints de programme ; (v) un spécialiste en passation des marchés ; (vi) un spécialiste en gestion
financière ; (vii) un auditeur interne ; (viii) un comptable ; (ix) un trésorier ; et (x) un aide-comptable.

Matrice des indicateurs de résultat sur le projet PRAEBASE
3.       Pendant les sept années de mise en œuvre du projet, l’accès, la qualité et l’équité du
système éducatif congolais se sont améliorés : un plus grand nombre d’enfants ont accès à l’école et
peuvent étudier dans des classes plus petites même si le ratio élèves / enseignant reste élevé pour garantir
un bon apprentissage ; il est passé de 92 :1 à 59,5 :1. D’importants défis demeurent quant à la
disponibilité des enseignants et sur le ratio personnel administratif / enseignant qui reste encore très élevé
et qui contribue à la captation des ressources du système au détriment d’une amélioration de la qualité.
La parité fille - garçon a été atteinte en 2011-2012 au niveau du cycle primaire. Les progrès dans la
scolarisation des filles sont très encourageants et les objectifs ont été atteints avec une parité de 1,06. En
revanche, le succès est plus mitigé concernant l’amélioration de la qualité et l’efficience du système
même si les progrès accomplis sont remarquables : le taux d’achèvement du primaire est de 80,6% en
2012 et le taux de redoublement est passé de 30% à 22,8% en 2012. Le taux de redoublement est
particulièrement élevé au CE1 avec un taux de 26,4%. Le taux de redoublement reste donc élevé et

freine l’accroissement du taux d’achèvement. La politique de la gratuité introduite par le gouvernement
en 2008 a eu des effets positifs sur l’accroissement des effectifs scolaires. Le montant versé par le
gouvernement pour compenser la gratuité scolaire est de 1500 F par élève pour le primaire, 2500 F pour
le secondaire et 3000 F pour le lycée. Le gouvernement respecte son engagement sur le versement annuel
de ces fonds aux écoles.
4.       Durant la 2ème phase du projet un accent particulier a été mis sur l’acquisition des
apprentissages avec l’appui d’un cabinet d’études international. C’est ainsi qu’un dispositif d’évaluation
a été mis en place par le Ministère de l’Education Nationale avec notamment la formation d’un équipe
ministérielle de 20 cadres susceptibles de poursuivre la mise en œuvre des tests standardisés à condition
de renforcer davantage leurs compétences dans le domaine du traitement et de l’analyse des données. A
cet effet, il est prévu une ligne budgétaire spécifique pour la formation de 4 cadres parmi les 20 pour le
renforcement de leurs capacités et assurer la pérennité des acquis.
5.       S’agissant des formations des enseignants, des directeurs d’écoles, des inspecteurs, le
PRAEBASE a atteint ses objectifs en termes quantitatifs mais il serait utile de mener une évaluation
plus approfondie et spécifiques sur les impacts de ces formations au niveau même des pratiques
enseignantes dans les salles de classe. Par ailleurs, le projet PRAEBASE a permis l’actualisation de des
programmes scolaires dans l’enseignement primaire et secondaire 1er cycle qui doivent être introduits
durant l’année scolaire 2013-2014.
6.       Des progrès restent à accomplir au niveau du renforcement des capacités de
l’administration centrale et décentralisée, notamment en termes de données statistiques et de
planification. Dans les années à venir, une attention toute particulière devra être mise sur ces questions
qui sont essentielles pour le pilotage du système éducatif et pour lesquelles le projet n’a pas permis un
véritable changement. Toutefois, le Ministère s’est engagé à poursuivre ces efforts en inscrivant une
ligne budgétaire spécifique dans le budget 2014 pour assurer une production régulière des données
statistiques de l’éducation.
7.       A la date du 30 juin 2013, le taux d’exécution financier total du projet PRAEBASE est de
97%. Le don du gouvernement Congolais a été entièrement versé et consommé.

Composante 1 : Renforcement des capacités du MEPSA

Le renforcement des capacités de planification
8.      Cette composante avait pour objectif de renforcer les capacités du Ministère afin de leur
permettre un pilotage par les résultats du système éducatif congolais. Cela impliquait notamment la
mise en place d’un Système d’Information de Gestion de l’Education (ou plus simplement un système de
collectes de données statistiques) et le développement de la carte scolaire.
9.      Le Système de Gestion de l’Information de l’Education (SIGE). Les informations
quantitatives et qualitatives sont indispensables pour la gestion des systèmes éducatifs et elles permettent
une bonne planification. Un SIGE a été développé durant la première phase du projet et la deuxième
phase du projet PRAEBASE a prévu la poursuite de la mise en place du SIGE au niveau central et son
déploiement dans les DDEPSA. A la clôture du projet PRAEBASE, la collecte des données est encore un
point faible au niveau du Ministère. Le SIGE est fonctionnel mais pas encore opérationnel malgré les
appuis apportés avec l’intervention d’une Société Informatique. L’Annuaire Statistiques est publié avec

                                                    51
en moyenne une année de retard et plusieurs données sont manquantes, limitant ainsi le pilotage du
système. Les raisons avancées de ces faiblesses sont structurelles avec notamment : (i) une insuffisance
de cadres formés dans le Service Statistique de chaque DEP des Ministères en charge de l’éducation ; (ii)
le questionnaire utilisé pour la collecte des données couvre l’ensemble des variables scolaires mais seule
une partie des données est intégrée dans la base de données et exploitées ; (iii) Manque de prévisibilité du
budget de l’Etat pour la collecte des données statistiques. La collecte des données commence donc très
tardivement dans l’année, ce qui induit un retard considérable dans la disponibilité de l’annuaire
statistiques. Au niveau des directions décentralisées, le SIGE n’est pas opérationnel et de la même façon
la carte scolaire n’a pas été mise en place.
10.      Gestion et déploiement des enseignants. Durant la première phase du PRAEBASE des efforts
très importants ont été mis en place par le MEPSA afin de réviser les bases de données des enseignants.
Ainsi, les résultats de la première phase ont été très encourageants avec notamment le recensement des
enseignants « craie en main » financé par le PRAEBASE qui a permis de geler le salaire de 1672
enseignants « fantômes » et de recenser 2253 fonctionnaires travaillant dans d’autres ministères. Malgré
ces efforts importants durant la première phase du PRAEBASE, des difficultés persistent sur la gestion
des ressources humaines dans le secteur éducatif congolais. Au niveau de l’affectation des enseignants,
l’affectation se fait par le niveau central. Or, les dernières données statistiques produites par la DEP ne
permettent pas d’analyser la situation au niveau de la gestion et du déploiement des enseignants dans la
mesure où l’aléa dans l’allocation des enseignants n’est pas connu. Le MEPSA accordera une attention
plus particulière sur la production de certaines données statistiques telles que le nombre d’enseignants et
d’enseignants bénévoles par département et sur l’aléa dans l’allocation des enseignants. Durant la phase
2 du projet PRAEBASE, aucune activité spécifique n’a été menée au niveau central concernant la gestion
du personnel et des enseignants.
11.      Réorganisation du MEPSA et décentralisation. Une analyse organisationnelle du MEPSA a
été réalisée en 2006 35 afin de mettre en exergue les changements pour améliorer la décentralisation et la
gestion du système éducatif congolais. Les recommandations émises n’ont toutefois pas été adoptées par
le Ministère en raison des implications politiques qu’elles pouvaient entrainer. En effet, les changements
d’organigramme entraînent un processus long qui dépend plus de la volonté gouvernementale que du
Ministre. De la même façon, les prérogatives données aux structures décentralisées de l’éducation
(DDEPSA) restent très restreintes dans la réalité et la gestion du système éducatif reste très centralisée.
Le projet PRAEBASE n’a pas pu contribuer aux changements organisationnels du MEPSA qui sont du
ressort du politique. En revanche, le projet PRAEBASE a largement contribué au renforcement des
capacités des structures décentralisées que ce soit en termes d’équipements ou en termes de compétences.

Soutien au développement et à l’exécution du Plan sectoriel
12.       Un plan sectoriel a été élaboré en 2010 intégrant un modèle de simulation financier qui a
été réalisé avec l’appui de la Banque Mondiale. Ce plan sectoriel se situe dans un horizon de douze
ans (2008 – 2020). Ce plan sectoriel a été validé par le Gouvernement de la République du Congo mais
les partenaires techniques et financiers ne l’ont pas endossé. Le non endossement du plan sectoriel est lié
à : (i) un problème de procédure car le Plan Sectoriel a été validé par le gouvernement avant que les PTF
puissent donner leurs commentaires et (ii) l’évaluation externe du Plan Sectoriel a révélé plusieurs
insuffisances qui n’ont pu être corrigées dans la mesure où le gouvernement l’avait validé. Cette situation
est d’autant plus dommageable qu’aucune requête de financement n’a été exprimée par le Congo au
Partenariat Mondial de l’Education (PME, ex-FTI). Dans le cadre de la stratégie sectorielle, plusieurs
activités ont été menées par le Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur (MES) et le Ministère de
l’Enseignement Technique, Professionnel, de la Formation Qualifiante et de l’Emploi (METPFQE).


Composante 2: Infrastructures et renforcement des comités de gestion scolaire

13.    Au cours de la première phase du projet, exécutée de juillet 2005 à juin 2009, la
responsabilité de la Maîtrise d’Ouvrage Déléguée de la composante 2 du PRAEBASE a été assurée

par le PNUD Congo, à la demande du MEPSA. Un contrat a été signé entre le MEPSA et le PNUD
définissant les responsabilités des deux institutions. Ce contrat est assorti d’un Manuel de Procédures. Au
cours de la revue à mi-parcours (juillet 2011), il a été décidé (i) de prolonger le contrat MOD-PNUD de six
mois (jusqu’au 31 décembre 2011) en vue de terminer le 1er programme qui avait pris du retard ; (ii) de
laisser le PNUD poursuivre l’exécution du 2ème programme de la Partie B et (iii) de proroger d’un an la date
de clôture du projet afin de permettre l’achèvement du deuxième programme de la partie B ainsi que
l’achèvement des autres activités du projet. Pour la réalisation du 2ème programme de la partie B (2012-13),
il a été décidé que le PNUD conserverait le personnel en place.
14.       Cette prolongation du contrat du PNUD jusqu’à la clôture du projet est en partie due aux retards de
l’exécution du premier programme mais aussi à l’impossibilité d’un transfert rapide des compétences du
MOD-PNUD vers le MEPSA, contrairement à ce qui avait été prévu lors de la préparation de la deuxième
phase. Ce non transfert des compétences est principalement lié à la non identification par le Ministère des
structures ou des cadres qui pouvaient prendre le relais et bénéficier des compétences du PNUD. La
Maîtrise d’Ouvrage Déléguée, gérée par le PNUD, est organisée en unités interdépendantes :
         (i) Au niveau national : la Coordination Nationale qui joue le rôle de conseil d’administration ;
         (ii) Au niveau régional : les cinq Antennes du PNUD qui ont chacune le personnel technique
               chargé de gérer les projets de la région ; et
         (iii) Au niveau local : les antennes s’appuient sur les Comités de Gestion de Développement
               (CGDC) pour la préparation des projets, pour la mobilisation communautaire et pour le suivi
               des travaux.
15.       L’évaluation de cette composante reprend en grande partie les analyses qui ont été menées dans
les deux études suivantes financées par le PRAEBASE : (i) audit technique semestriel des constructions
2012 36 ; (ii) rapport d’évaluation de la composante B, volet « gestion communautaire » 37.

Les infrastructures scolaires
16.      Pendant la première phase, le suivi et la gestion de l’exécution d’un nombre de projets
aussi important dans une situation de post-conflit, avec des chantiers dispersés à travers tout le
pays, a été un challenge qui malgré les difficultés a été remporté avec un certain succès par une équipe
relativement restreinte. Malgré tout, des difficultés techniques et financières38 sont apparues qui auraient
pu être évitées avec un suivi plus rapproché des travaux et de leur contrôle. Cette faiblesse du dispositif
initial a été corrigée avec le recrutement d’un ingénieur au niveau national qui est chargé de la
coordination et le suivi des activités de la deuxième phase dans les cinq antennes. Ce renforcement a été
bénéfique au projet et il a eu pour résultat une amélioration des performances techniques des antennes
ainsi qu’un meilleur contrôle financier des dépenses. Par ailleurs, afin de renforcer les capacités de suivi
et de contrôle des ingénieurs des antennes régionales du PNUD, le projet a recruté deux techniciens du
bâtiment technicien à « pied d’œuvre » (maçons, ouvriers de chantier recrutés localement) par chantier.
Ces techniciens, formés à la passation des marchés et au suivi des travaux, sont chargés du suivi de
l’avancement des chantiers et de la qualité des matériaux.
17.      Pour le premier programme de la phase 2, le projet a financé la formation de 140 techniciens
(70 écoles) ainsi que leur intervention pendant 4 mois avec cependant un forfait supplémentaire pour la
prolongation de leur intervention sur les chantiers qui ont pris du retard. Pour le second programme, ce
système a été modifié afin d’éviter les prolongations non-justifiées : le paiement des techniciens locaux
se fera désormais sur la base d’un forfait payé par tranche suivant l’avancement des travaux, jusqu’à la
réception provisoire.
18.      La sélection des écoles s’est faite sur la base des critères d’éligibilité énoncés dans le Manuel
d’exécution du projet. Pour la première phase, ces critères étaient essentiellement axés sur la
réhabilitation des bâtiments scolaires endommagés au cours de la guerre et/ou par manque d’entretien. A
ces critères ont été ajoutés des critères spécifiques à la deuxième phase pour permettre la construction de
nouvelles infrastructures dans les districts qui n’avaient pas bénéficié de travaux en première phase et
notamment dans les zones reculées ou vivent les populations autochtones. Cela a permis de créer une

véritable cohérence dans le projet avec un lien entre la composante B et la composante C. Concernant le
mobilier, la priorité a été donnée aux écoles de la première phase qui n’avaient pas reçu de mobilier.
19.      Les plans standards de construction. Les plans standards des blocs de classes, bloc
administratif et blocs latrine ont été initialement fournis par le MEPSA (la Direction des études et de la
Planification). Pour la deuxième phase, ces plans standard ont été modifiés/améliorés par la MOD-
PNUD. Les modifications apportées dans les plans types de construction scolaires entre la phase 1 et la
phase 2 du projet ainsi que les faiblesses constatées ci-dessus devront être validés par le Ministère afin
que ces nouveaux plans types deviennent la référence nationale.
20.      L’exécution des travaux par la MOD-PNUD. Le programme de la partie2 s’est déroulé en
deux phases avec deux programmes successifs pour la deuxième phase : La phase 1, exécutée entre
Juillet 2005 et Juin 2009, a duré quatre ans et avait essentiellement pour objectif la rénovation des
infrastructures des écoles endommagées par la guerre et/ou détériorés faute d’entretien. De plus, le projet
prévoyait de contribuer à la création et à l’entrée en activité des CGDC. Le premier programme de la
phase 2 (phase 2-1) initialement prévu pour deux ans et demi (Juillet 2009 et Décembre 2011) a pris du
retard et a dû être prolongé jusqu’en 2012. Il a repris les objectifs de rénovation des écoles et de création
des CGDC de la première phase auquel a été ajoutée la construction de nouvelles salles de classe. De
plus, la composante appuie les nouveaux CGDC par des activités de formation visant à renforcer leurs
capacités et leur viabilité ainsi que par un soutien pour l’élaboration des plans de développement des
écoles (PDE). Le second programme de la phase 2 (phase 2-2) est une extension du premier
programme qui doit être exécutée en 2012 et 2013. Son exécution a démarré en mai 2012 avec le
lancement des appels d’offres du Génie Civil.
21.      Il est important de noter que la construction des nouvelles salles de classes du projet n’a
parfois pas été accompagnée de construction de bloc latrines. C’est particulièrement le cas pour la
première phase pendant laquelle, il était estimé que l’urgence était avant tout de réhabiliter ou de
reconstruire les classes endommagées par la guerre. Plusieurs écoles n’ont pas de point d’eau sur leur
site et que souvent pour amener de l’eau à l’école les élèves devaient parcourir de grande distance. Les
bâtiments réhabilités ou construits en zone urbaine n’ont pas de clôture, ce qui entraîne un risque de
vandalisme de la part de la population environnante et une dégradation rapide des locaux. La seule
solution pour éviter les programmes de réhabilitation à intervalles rapprochés, serait de construire des
murs de clôture pour les écoles situées en zone urbaine et d’imposer aux CGDC de mettre en place un
système de gardiennage.
22.      Les délais d’exécution. L’exécution de la deuxième phase de la composante 2 a subi
d’importants retards dès son démarrage. Parmi les contraintes qui ont entrainé ces retards, il a été
mentionné : (i) le retard du premier décaissement en faveur de la MOD-PNUD qui n’est intervenu qu’en
juin 2010, (ii) le temps mis pour la préparation et la validation des nouveaux plans et spécifications
techniques pour les nouvelles constructions ; (iii) les difficultés rencontrées par la MOD-PNUD pour
l’évaluation des premiers appels d’offres ; et (iii) le démarrage des premiers chantiers au début de mai
2011, à la fin de la période pluvieuse alors que l’accessibilité des sites était encore très difficile pour les
entreprises aussi bien que pour les contrôleurs du PNUD.
23.      L’exécution budgétaire. Au 30 juin 2013, le montant total des dépenses pour la construction des
salles de classe, des latrines et des logements est de 5 241 557 317 FCFA sur la totalité du projet
PRAEBASE. Il est toutefois à noter que certaines dépenses devront être encore réalisées car certains
chantiers de la phase 2 ne sont pas terminés. L’étude des coûts unitaires par salle de classe réalisée lors
d’une étude 39 sur les travaux de construction montre que les coûts étaient moins élevés en première phase
qu’en deuxième phase. Les raisons sont multiples : (i) la majorité des classes ne comprenaient pas de
coursive sur la façade principale et les modifications apportées aux plans standards ont augmenté les
coûts ; (ii) les bâtiments annexes (logements, administration et latrines) étaient plus nombreux qu’en
première phase ; (iii) il s’est écoulé 4 ans entre le début de la première phase et celui de la seconde phase,
avec un taux d’inflation important pour le secteur du bâtiment ; et (iv) dans de nombreux cas, les
entreprises ont été sollicitées pour des réhabilitations et c’est juste avant le démarrage des chantiers qu’il
leur a été signifié que finalement les bâtiments existants seraient démolis et reconstruit. Ce changement a
donc fait l’objet de négociations directes. Les coûts unitaires pour la construction d’une salle de

Millions FCFA pour la Likouala et de 8,8 Millions dans le département de la Cuvette.

Les Comités de Gestion et de Développement Communautaire (CGDC)
24.      La création des Comités de Gestion et de Développement Communautaire (CGDC) dans les
écoles répond au souci de mettre en place des dynamiques de développement capables d’assurer
efficacement la gestion communautaire des écoles, le suivi des travaux de réhabilitation et de
préservation des infrastructures scolaires réhabilitées. Dans le cadre de l’exécution de sa première phase,
le projet PRAEBASE a permis de créer 1 610 Comités de Gestion et de Développement Communautaire
(CGDC) sur l’ensemble du territoire congolais. Cependant, l’expérience a montré que le dynamisme et
l’enthousiasme de ces comités s’émoussaient avec le temps 40. Par conséquent, il a été envisagé au cours
de la phase 2 du projet de (i) renforcer les capacités et la viabilité des CGDC mis en place et de (ii)
favoriser leur autonomisation et leur pérennisation. Durant la deuxième phase du projet, l’objectif initial
était de faire bénéficier 500 CGDC d’un appui et d’un encadrement pour le développement de
microprojets. Toutefois, en raison des contraintes du terrain et du temps imparti pour former
correctement les CGDC, l’objectif a été révisé à la baisse en cours d’exécution pour passer à 350. Deux
types de sous projets sont éligibles: (i) les Activités Génératrices de Revenus (AGR) avec un plafond fixé
à 2 000 dollars américains ; (ii) et les Petits Projets d’Aménagement de l’Environnement Scolaire
(PPAES) plafonnées quant à eux à 500 dollars.
25.      Les Plans de Développement des écoles. Les apports du projet aux écoles se font sur la base des
Plans de Développement d’Ecoles (PDE) élaborés par les Comités de Gestion et de Développement
Communautaire (CGDC). A partir des PDE, les CGDC formulent les besoins des écoles au niveau des
infrastructures, des équipements, des fournitures, du personnel et des aménagements divers. Pour
s’assurer que les CGDC peuvent élaborer les PDE et formuler correctement des requêtes de financement,
un mécanisme de sensibilisation et de formation des CGDC par les antennes PNUD a été mis en place
avec l’aide des spécialistes de la sensibilisation et de la mobilisation communautaire.

Composante 3 : Amélioration de la qualité de l’Education

Formation des enseignants, des inspecteurs, des conseillers pédagogiques et de directeurs
d’école
26. La formation des acteurs du système éducatif est au centre des questions de qualité des
apprentissages. Cette sous composante représente un volet important du projet PRAEBASE d’autant plus
que plusieurs. Au total 18 syllabus et 5 référentiels de compétences ont été produits durant la deuxième
phase du projet PRAEBASE. Cela représente une masse importante de documents didactiques pour le
Ministère afin de renforcer les compétences des acteurs de l’éducation. Toutefois, il est important de
noter que ces outils ont été validés avec le Ministère de l’Enseignement primaire, secondaire et de
l’Alphabétisation mais que le statut de ces outils n’est pas encore clairement défini. Le projet n’a pas
touché tous les enseignants du pays. En conséquence, tous les enseignants ne disposent pas de ces outils.
Le Ministère devrait s’interroger sur la possibilité de disponibiliser les syllabus à tous les enseignants.

La formation des acteurs du système éducatif
27. Les effectifs scolaires dans les écoles publiques du primaire ont considérablement augmenté ces
dix dernières années passant de 442.000 élèves en 2005 à 506.000 en 2011. Sur la même période le
premier cycle du secondaire, l’augmentation des effectifs passe de 128.000 à 152.000. Le rythme de
recrutement des enseignants n’a pas suivi l’augmentation des effectifs et le système éducatif congolais
s’appuie sur un nombre conséquent d’enseignants bénévoles. Ces enseignants bénévoles constituent une
réponse des parents qui ont été conduits à recruter directement des enseignants. Ces enseignants
bénévoles n’ont pas reçu de formation initiale. Ils sont pour la grande majorité titulaire du BEPC. Les
formations des enseignants sont menées par les réseaux des formateurs départementaux de

40
  Le rapport sur l’état d’avancement des activités de la composante B produit en mars 2009 estimait que le taux de
fonctionnement des CGDC avait chuté à 65,82 % depuis le démarrage de la première phase du projet.


                                                       55
l’enseignement. Ces réseaux de formateurs départementaux sont constitués d’inspecteurs, de conseillers
pédagogiques et de professeurs du secondaire. Is ont été mis en place en 2002 par l’INRAP. L’objectif de
ces réseaux est (i) d’assurer la décentralisation et la démultiplication des formations, (ii) apporter un
appui auprès des équipes de circonscription. Les 180 membres de ces réseaux ont ainsi bénéficié d’un
renforcement des capacités chaque année durant toute l’exécution du projet (phase 1 et phase 2). Selon
l’évaluation externe effectuée sur les formations, il s’avère que la quasi-totalité des formateurs (91,6%)
ont considéré que cette formation leur a été utile car elle leur a permis de se replonger dans les matières
qui faisaient l’objet des formations des enseignants. Par ailleurs, il est important de noter que le
programme de formation des enseignants du primaire a introduit une sensibilisation sur les questions de
VIH/Sida et MST.
28. La formation des enseignants du primaire bénévoles. Le bilan de ces formations montre que la
formation a touché 1697 enseignants bénévoles du primaire sur 2000 enseignants bénévoles prévus par
le projet. Selon les personnes rencontrées, ce résultat est optimal car tous les enseignants bénévoles ont
été touchés. Ces formations ont duré 26 jours et ont eu lieu chaque année.
29. Formation des enseignants titulaire du primaire. Sur la période de la deuxième phase du projet,
2162 enseignants titulaires du primaire et nouvellement recrutés ont reçu une formation pendant 12
jours contre 2000 prévus. Les critères de sélection pour la formation des enseignants étaient qu’ils ne
devaient pas avoir reçu de formation par le PREABASE durant la phase 1. Formation des enseignants
titulaire du secondaire. 1760 enseignants du secondaire premier cycle ont été formés lors de la 1ère
phase du PRAEBASE et 2398 durant la 2ème phase. Soit un total de 4158 enseignants formés. Les
formations se sont orientées sur les matières suivantes : Mathématiques, Sciences physiques, Français,
Sciences de la Vie et de la Terre, Anglais, Histoire-géographie. La formation des directeurs d’écoles.
2548 directeurs d’écoles ont été formés durant les deux phases du PRAEBASE, l’objectif étant de 2600.

Appui aux inspecteurs
30. Les formations financées par le PRAEBASE ont porté sur les pratiques de classe, le contrôle,
évaluation, l’encadrement et formation du personnel, la gestion administrative, des finances et du
patrimoine scolaire et l’éthique professionnelle. L’objectif de 900 inspecteurs et conseillers pédagogiques
formés a été atteint sur l’ensemble du projet avec la formation de 945 personnes. Formation des
inspecteurs du secondaire. Une session de renforcement des capacités des inspecteurs des collèges
d’enseignement général a été organisée pendant six jours dans les matières suivants en 2011

Manuels scolaires et matériels pédagogiques
31. L’acquisition des manuels scolaires passent par les procédures d’appels d’offre lancées par
l’unité de gestion de projet. Les dossiers d’appels d’offre incorporaient l’acquisition et la distribution des
manuels. Durant la période du projet, des difficultés, non spécifiques au Congo, sont apparues avec les
questions de Copyright (droits d’auteurs) qui ont entraîné une réallocation des fonds lors de la revue à
mi-parcours. Cette réallocation des fonds a été faite au bénéfice de la rédaction des projets des manuels
nationaux.

Développement des curricula
32. Le développement des curricula s’est fait avec les cadres de l’INRAP durant la 1ère phase. Un
cabinet d’étude est venu former ces cadres à la rédaction et l’édition. Cela a abouti à la rédaction et à la
production des manuels mathématiques CP1, CP2 et des manuels Education civique et morale &
éducation pour la paix. Durant la 2ème phase, le financement a porté sur la rédaction des manuels
Mathématiques cités dans le tableau ci-dessous. Mais seuls les manuels de Mathématiques CE1 et CE2
ont été finalisés et produit durant cette phase. Les autres manuels doivent être finalisés par le Ministère.

Introduction des tests standardisés
33. A travers la deuxième phase du projet PRAEBASE, le Ministère de l’enseignement primaire,
secondaire et de l’alphabétisation (MEPSA) a reçu pendant un an (de mai 2012 à mai 2013) un appui
technique d’un bureau d’étude canadien 41 en matière de conception d’un dispositif de pilotage du
système éducatif à travers l’élaboration et l’analyse de tests standardisés. Une équipe de vingt cadres
nationaux a été constitué et formé dans le domaine de l’évaluation des acquis des élèves s’appuyant sur
des tests standardisés. Cette équipe est constituée par plusieurs cadres issus de directions différentes :
INRAP, DEPS, IGEPSA, DGEB et DFC et un cadre de l’université. Les appuis ont porté sur les cinq
grandes étapes clés pour la mise en œuvre des tests standardisés : (i) élaboration des tests, (ii)
échantillonnage, (iii) administration des tests et questionnaires, (iv) traitement des données et (v) analyse
des données. L’équipe nationale a retenu comme objet à évaluer les acquis scolaires des élèves de CM1,
en français et en mathématiques, tel qu’indiqué dans les termes de référence du projet. Au total, 100
classes ont été identifiées via la technique de l’échantillonnage. Sur 2072 écoles de la base de sondage,
100 écoles ont été identifiées à travers les douze départements scolaires du Congo. Du point de vue de la
population scolaire, 1942 élèves ont passé le test (20 par classe). Des tests ont également été administrés
aux enseignants et aux directeurs des écoles.

Composante 4: Soutien aux jeunes non scolarisés et à la scolarisation des peuples
autochtones

34.     La composante 4 a pour objectifs d’expérimenter des activités pour offrir des opportunités
d’éducation et de formation formelles et non formelles aux jeunes âgés de 14 à 19 ans, et
d’améliorer la conception, l’efficacité et la cohérence globale des programmes en soutenant la
scolarisation des peuples autochtones. Elle comprend deux types d’activités (i) l’élaboration de
programmes pilotes en faveur des jeunes déscolarisés, et (ii) l’élaboration de programmes d’éducation
pour les enfants autochtones.

Programmes pilotes jeunes déscolarisés
35.     Durant la phase 1 du projet 512 jeunes ont été formés dans des ateliers moyennant une
contrepartie financière de 56.000 FCFA / an pour le maître Artisan ainsi que l’achat de la matière
d’œuvre et de l’outillage. Durant la deuxième phase du projet, le programme pour les jeunes déscolarisés
s’est concentré dans les villes de Dolisie et de Pointe Noire. Au total 1423 jeunes déscolarisés (sur une
cible initiale de 1600 – soit 89%) ont bénéficié d’une formation professionnelle. Le processus de
sélection des maîtres artisans a été le même que durant la première phase, à savoir par appel à
manifestation d’intérêt. En revanche, les critères de sélection des apprenants ont été relevé avec
notamment (i) l’obligation d’avoir le CEP ou le niveau sixième, (ii) l’obligation des parents de signer un
engagement parental mentionnant qu’ils paient les frais de déplacement et la nutrition durant toute la

durée de la formation. Durant cette phase, le montant versé aux maîtres artisans a été revalorisé à
100.000 FCFA. En amont de la formation, des organes de concertation dénommés « comités
départementaux de sélection pour les jeunes déscolarisés (CDS)» ont été mis en place dans les localités
de mise en œuvre du programme dont le rôle était de : (i) sélectionner les jeunes déscolarisés susceptibles
de bénéficier l’appui ; (ii) sélectionner les ateliers susceptibles d’assurer la formation des jeunes
déscolarisés.
36.      La matière d’œuvre et des kits de formation ont été acquis et distribués dans toutes les filières et
à tous les jeunes apprentis placés dans les ateliers de formation professionnelle. Au total, 115 maitres
artisans des filières de couture, coiffure, soudure, mécanique auto, menuiserie et agropastoral ont pris
part à cette formation. Les modules développés pour cette formation ont été axés sur : (i) La fiche de
suivi des jeunes déscolarisés ; (ii) Tenue d’un atelier et gestion financière d’un atelier ; (iii) Rappels de
quelques notions sur l’esprit d’entreprise ; (iv) Conseils avertis à un entrepreneur particulier ; (v) La
gestion financière ; (vi) La gestion de stock ; (vii) Le calcul du prix de revient d’un produit ou d’une
prestation ; (viii) La fixation du prix de vente d’un produit ou d’un service ; (ix) La gestion du budget
domestique ; et (x) La gestion rationnelle de la micro entreprise. Plusieurs ateliers ont été organisés pour
renforcer les capacités des conseillers techniques d’alphabétisation œuvrant à Dolisie et à Pointe Noire.
Ces ateliers ont également permis d’élaborer et de valider des outils permettant à ces derniers de mieux
suivre les jeunes apprenants. Au total les compétences de quarante conseillers techniques
d’alphabétisation (CTA) 42 ont été renforcées. Par ailleurs, le suivi professionnel des jeunes
déscolarisés formés lors de la première phase du PRAEBASE a constitué un élément important de
cette composante du projet. A noter que sur les 512 jeunes formés, 318 jeunes exerçaient toujours dans
les ateliers les ayant formés (soit 62%). Durant la 2ème phase, sur 1423 jeunes formés, 30% ont été insérés
sur le marché du travail soit 436 jeunes et 124 jeunes ont abandonné. L’étude réalisée sur les coûts de la
formation professionnelle des jeunes dans 5 filières (couture, coiffure, menuiserie, soudure et mécanique)
fait ressortir que les couts de formation proposés par le PRAEBASE sont inférieurs aux pratiques
existantes, ce qui est encourageant au regard de sa possible pérennisation43.

Programmes d’éducation des enfants autochtones
37.      Ce volet a pour objectif de rechercher et de mettre en œuvre des approches efficaces pour
développer la scolarisation des enfants autochtones. Les activités mises en place ont débuté lors de la
phase 1 du projet PRAEBASE avec comme principal résultat l’élaboration de la Stratégie Nationale
d’éducation des populations autochtones du Congo. Cette stratégie a permis de créer un cadre fédérateur
pour l’ensemble des partenaires et des ministères qui interviennent en faveur de la scolarisation des
enfants autochtones. Des activités de vulgarisation et de sensibilisation sur cette stratégie ont été menées
au démarrage de la phase 2 du projet PRAEBASE. Le programme d’activité se concentre dans quatre
départements : Niari, Pool, Plateaux et Cuvette-Ouest. La première phase du projet a permis l’inscription
de 1642 enfants autochtones. Toutefois, il a été constaté un taux de rétention faible avec seulement 46%
des enfants qui sont restés scolarisés. Durant la phase 2 du projet PRAEBASE, le nombre d’enfants
inscrits est passé à 4030 (sur une cible de 4000) et le taux de rétention a considérablement augmenté avec
un taux de 76%. Les meilleurs résultats obtenus dans la phase 2 sont essentiellement liés à l’amélioration
de l’offre et de la demande scolaire avec notamment : (i) La construction d’écoles financées par le projet
PRAEBASE proches des populations autochtone ; (ii) La fourniture de cantines scolaires par le
partenaire IPHD et PAM ; (iii) Des actions de sensibilisation rapprochées avec le recrutement d’une
ONG par département. Lors de la première phase, une seule ONG avait été recrutée pour couvrir les 4
départements et sa mission se limitait à la distribution des kits ; (iv) Une loi a été promulguée par le
gouvernement en février 2011 protégeant les populations autochtones dans laquelle un article encourage
ces populations à envoyer leurs enfants à l’école.
38.      Les kits 44 et uniformes scolaires acquis par le PRAEBASE ont été distribués aux enfants
autochtones. Le tableau ci-après présente les effectifs des bénéficiaires dans les quatre départements :
