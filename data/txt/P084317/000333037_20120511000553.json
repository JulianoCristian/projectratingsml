Since\n            July 2011, Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education in\n            charge of Literacy (MEPSA) has taken a number of actions\n            that will create a stronger enabling environment for the\n            project to proceed, notably: (i) the strengthening of the\n            procurement capacity and the recruitment of an internal\n            auditor, (ii) retrofitting the sector indicators with a\n            consistent base of population projection, (iii) decision to\n            continue with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)\n            for the execution of the 2nd phase of the school\n            infrastructure and school-based management program, and (iv)\n            partnership with Program on the Analysis of Education\n            Systems (PASEC) for learning assessment.
