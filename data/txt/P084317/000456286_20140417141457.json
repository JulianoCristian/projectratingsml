"The overall outcome of the Support to\n            Basic Education Project (PRAEBASE) for the Republic of Congo\n            was moderately satisfactory.

Lessons learned from this project\n            include, 1) capacity development and institutional\n            strengthening take time to materialize especially in a\n            post-conflict context and need to factor greatly into all\n            aspects of project design; 2) working effectively with other\n            organizations in project implementation necessitates a\n            thorough understanding of each organization's\n            procedures, guidelines and field-level practice in the\n            design phase; 3) persistency in investments in equity pays\n            off; and 4) project documentation and reporting should be\n            consistent and organized especially in terms of the M&E\n            framework established to monitor progress under the Project."}, "docdt": "2014-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
