                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to: (i) help alleviate the current power supply shortfall in the Kurdish region through urgent repair work; (ii) strengthen
                         the capacity of local operational staff; and (iii) prepare for the subsequent rehabilitation of the Dokan and Derbandikhan hydropower plants. The reliability of
                         both power plants is very low and the effective capacity of each has been as low as 50 percent. Subsequent rehabilitation would restore their original capacity
                         of 400 and 249MW respectively.

                         The only current risk to full and satisfactory completion of the project is the lack of progress on rehabilitation of Derbandikhan switchyard. The contract for this work is yet to be made
                         effective due to issues with processing of payments to the Contractor. The PMT is now working closely with the Bank to resolve the status of this contract and advance works on

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         All works are now well underway apart for the rehabilitation of Derbandikhan switchyard. The contract for rehabilitation of Derbandikhan switchyard has been delayed due to
                         problems associated with processing the advance payment to the contractor. The PMT is working to resolve this issue so that it does not affect the project completion date or budget.
