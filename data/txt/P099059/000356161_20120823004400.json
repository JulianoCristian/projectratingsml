The changes include in this restructuring\n            paper are: the extension of the project closing date, and\n            revision of the results framework indicators. First, the\n            closing date for the project is requested to be extended\n            from September 30, 2012 until December 31, 2013. The\n            15-month extension to the project closing date is necessary\n            to complete a single contract under one of the project\n            components: the repair of Derbandikhan switchyard. The\n            second change includes modifications to the results\n            framework indicators. The Project's Development\n            Objectives (PDOs) remain unchanged; however the results\n            framework indicators (PDO-level and intermediate) are to be\n            changed to better measure progress towards achieving the\n            PDOs and the intermediate results necessary to meet these."}, "docdt": "2012-08-17T00:00:00Z"}
