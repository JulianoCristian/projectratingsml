                                    RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.     This restructuring Paper introduces changes in the Dokan and Derbanikhan Emergency
Hydro Power Project in Iraq (IDA Credit No. 4249 IQ), P099059. The changes include: (i) the
extension of the project closing date, and (ii) revision of the results framework indicators.

2.     First, the closing date for the project is requested to be extended from September 30,
2012 until December 31, 2013. The proposed 15-month extension to the Project Closing Date is
necessary to complete a single contract under one of the project components: the repair of
Derbandikhan switchyard.

3.      The second change includes modifications to the results framework indicators. The
Project’s Development Objectives (PDOs) remain unchanged, however the results framework
indicators (PDO-level and intermediate) are proposed to be changed to better measure progress
towards achieving the PDOs and the intermediate results necessary to meet these. The target
dates for the related intermediate results indicators and PDO level indicators have also been
extended to December 31, 2013 (see details in Annex 1).

4.      A formal request for extension of the Project Closing Date was received from the
Ministry of Finance of Iraq on March 7, 2012. This will be the second and last extension sought
for this project, bringing the cumulative extension of the project to 36 months. The project
became effective on October 30, 2007, and the original Closing Date was December 31, 2010.
The project experienced early delays due to the prevailing security situation in Iraq and the
impact this had on the ability of the Project Management Team (PMT) to attract international
bidders for the contracts financed by the Credit. Therefore, an earlier extension of the Closing
Date (of 21 months, from the original closing date of December 31, 2010 to September 30, 2012)
was processed on August 24, 2010.

5.      RVP’s approval of this restructuring is required because the cumulative extension of the
project goes beyond 24 months.

B. PROJECT STATUS

6.      Significant progress has been made in contracting the works and services for urgent
repairs to Dokan and Derbandikhan power stations, with most of the repair works either
completed or well underway: (i) six of 13 project contracts (construction and services) have
already been completed and the remaining contracts’ physical completion varies between 65-
95%; (ii) disbursement and commitments stand at 95%; and (iii) work has not commenced on
only one contract, the rehabilitation of Derbandikhan switchyard. The contract was awarded in
February 2012 and work is expected to begin in September 2012. For this reason, an extension of
the Project Closing Date is required.

7.     The Project involves emergency repair works to increase the available generation
capacity in the Dokan and Derbandikhan hydro power plants (currently as low as 50% of the


                                               6
original capacity of 400MW and 249MW respectively). The Project also provides consulting
services for planning, costing and design of a full rehabilitation program that can subsequently
be undertaken by the Government, to restore full capacity of each hydropower plant and increase
the life-cycle of the hydropower plants, and thereby ensure the sustainability of emergency repair
works. Training is also being provided to improve the operational capacity of power station
staff.

8.     Achievement of the PDOs remains highly probable as shown by the progress below,
although the implementation environment in Iraq remains very challenging.
     PDO 1, help alleviate the current power supply shortfall in the Kurdish region through
       urgent repair work. Progress: all contracts have been awarded and most are close to
       completion.
     PDO 2, strengthen the capacity of local operational staff. Progress: training needs have
       been identified and agreed with the Client and necessary training activities have been
       designed and are progressively being implemented.
     PDO 3, prepare for the subsequent rehabilitation of the Dokan and Derbandikhan
       hydropower plants. Progress: assessments of rehabilitation needs, costing, designs and
       bidding documents have been completed.

9.      The last supervision mission was carried out in April 2012, and included a review of the
project’s financial situation and disbursement projections, which rated these as Moderately
Satisfactory. The overall implementation progress for the project is rated at Moderately
Satisfactory, however the Bank team will consider upgrading this rating once work commences
on repair of Derbandikhan switchyard. The Borrower is in full compliance with audit
requirements and there are no overdue or unsatisfactory audit reports, safeguards problems, or
other pending issues related to this project.

10.     As of August 1, 2012, US$27.5 million (69% of the original US$40 million approved
amount) has been disbursed. Total commitments amounted to around US$38 million (95% of the
IDA US$40 million). Significant repair works have already been completed, while ongoing and
planned works under remaining contracts are well in progress. The team intends to formally
revise the project disbursement schedule at the time the Project Closing Date is extended.

11.     The PDOs remain unchanged1: (i) help alleviate the current power supply shortfall in the
Kurdish region through urgent repair work; (ii) strengthen the capacity of local operational staff;
and (iii) prepare for the subsequent rehabilitation of the Dokan and Derbandikhan hydropower
plants.

  During the restructuring of the project, the Team recognized that a discrepancy exists between the wording of
the PDOs in the Financing Agreement and Technical Annex of the Project Paper. The PDOs presented above and in
the rest of the documentation are the ones from the Technical Annex since these reflect well the intended
objectives of the project. The PDOs in the Financing Agreement are to help alleviate the current power shortfall in
the Recipient’s territory through urgent repair works and prepare for the subsequent rehabilitation of the Dokan
and Derbandikhan hydropower plants. Given the advanced implementation level of the project, with 95% of the
allocated funds committed, there is little to be gained from adjustments to the PDOs at this stage.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

         Results/indicators:

12.     The results framework indicators (PDO-level and intermediate) have been revised to
better reflect the PDOs and the intermediate results required to achieve these. The target dates for
the related PDO-level and intermediate results indicators have also been extended to December
31, 2013. Both sets of indicators are based on work defined under each project component that
will have the overall outcome of increasing generation capacity and resolving operational
problems in both plants – thus allowing the PDOs to be met (see details in Annex 1).

         Financing:

13.     Disbursement arrangements and Procurement: the Borrower has prepared new
disbursement and procurement plans acceptable to the Bank, which will allow it to complete the
project by December 2013, the proposed new Project Closing Date. Updated procurement and
disbursement projections are enclosed in Annex 2.

         Project Closing Date:

14.     The proposed 15-month extension is necessary to complete a single contract under one of
the project components: the repair of Derbandikhan switchyard. This is the only major work that
has not yet been commenced under the Project, and which will start in September 2012.

15.      In April 2011, a contract to undertake this work with an Iranian Company, Safa Nicu,
was cancelled after significant delays due to a force majeure event. This event related to inability
of the contractor to put in place acceptable commercial bank arrangements for project payments
and guarantees. Therefore, a new round of bids was launched on September 15, 2011. The PMT
signed a new contract for this work (for a value of US$7.9 million) in February 2012, with works
estimated to be completed by no earlier than July 2013. The Government of Iraq has therefore
requested an extension of the Project Closing Date up to December 31, 2013 to allow completion
of this work.

16.    The proposed extension does not result in any change to the Project activities nor require
a modification to the Project Description in the Loan Agreement.

         Implementation schedule:

17.    The reason for this extension is outside the Borrower’s control. The Borrower has
prepared an action plan acceptable to the Bank to ensure completion of the project within the
new Project Closing Date – this action plan (Annex 3) consists of re-contracting repair works at
Derbandikhan switchyard, which is now well underway, and extension of the contracts for on-
going works.




                                                 8
18.    No changes to Components, Safeguards, Institutional Arrangements, Financing Structure
and Financial Management are envisaged and requested.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY


19.    The above changes do not result in a change of impact (from the original Appraisal
Summary of the Project Appraisal Document/Technical Annex) in any of the Economic and
Financial analyses, Technical, Social, Environment, Exceptions to Bank policy and Risks
components of the Project.

20.     Given that the project is highly likely to meet its development objectives if the Project
Closing Date is extended, the team recommends approval of this request for the extension of the
Project Closing Date, up to December 31, 2013 and the revision of the results framework
indicators.
