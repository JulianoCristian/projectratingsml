                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to: (i) help alleviate the current power supply shortfall in the Kurdish region through urgent repair work; (ii) strengthen the
                         capacity of local operational staff; and (iii) prepare for the subsequent rehabilitation of the Dokan and Derbandikhan hydropower plants. The reliability of both power
                         plants is very low and the effective capacity of each has been as low as 50 percent. Subsequent rehabilitation would restore their original capacity of 400 and 249MW
                         respectively.

                         expected under existing contracts are being well managed by the Ministry of ElectricityProject Management Team (PMT), and these contracts are expected to be completed on

                         However, only one component of the project - the rehabilitation of Derbandikhan switchyard, will likely not be completed by the current Project Closing Date. The contract for this work
                         was terminated due to a force majeure event. Therefore, a new round of bids was launched in September 2011 and a new contract has been signed (for a value of Euro 6.01 million)

                         December 31, 2013 to allow completion of this work. Currently, the World Bank project team is working on this extension request and a project restructuring, to be completed soon.
