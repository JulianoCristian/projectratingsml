Project\n            components include: (a) reforestation in the two watersheds;\n            (b) construction and maintenance of forest roads; (c)\n            construction of charcoal ovens; (d) provision of equipment\n            and vehicles for forest protection and fire prevention; (e)\n            a feasibility study of the Magat watershed; (f) pilot\n            programs in range management and smallholder agroforestry in\n            the Magat watershed; (g) initiation of forest protection\n            pilot programs in two provinces in Northern and Central\n            Luzon; and (h) provision of consulting services for (a),\n            (e), (f) and (g) above."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
