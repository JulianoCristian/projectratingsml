The project consists\n            of a single tranche operation, based on up-front, completed\n            actions that demonstrate substantive progress toward\n            medium-term objectives. It builds on, and deepens the\n            cross-cutting reforms undertaken under the first DPL\n            operation, and sets out mutually agreed upon triggers for\n            the upcoming third DPL. Key benefits include: 1) Progress\n            toward government's medium-term objectives of a)\n            macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness; b) improved\n            investment climate; and, c) public financial management. 2)\n            Sustained Bank engagement in policy dialogue with the\n            Government on the direction and content of, and strategies\n            for, its economic, structural, and institutional reform\n            agenda. 3) Donor harmonization (the Bank, Government of\n            Japan, Asian Development Bank) around a common policy\n            framework and dialogue. 4) Critical signaling effect and key\n            endorsement by donors of the Government's sound\n            economic management and policy implementation. However\n            several risks exist, that is, a worsening economic\n            volatility, rising interest rates, increased social\n            tensions, fiduciary and reputation risks, deteriorating\n            external environment, and the growing fears of a bird-flu epidemic."}, "docdt": "2005-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
