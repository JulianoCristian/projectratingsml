PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Chile's Highway
Reconstruction Project for which Loan 1927-CH in the amount of US$42.0 million
was approved by the Executive Directors on December 9, 1980. Upon
cancellation of the undisbursed balance of US$281.697.21, the loan was fully
disbursed on May 28, 1985.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from LAC
Information Center, President's Report No. P-2901-CH, Staff Appraisal Report
No. 2145b-CH for the Highway Reconstruction Project, Staff Supervision Reports
and Working Papers, and data and final report provided by Chile's Ministry of
Public Works (MOP).
In accordance with revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OF") but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft report
was sent to Lne Borrower and their comments have been reflected in the report
and are shown as Annex 1 and Annex 2.

HIGHWAY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT (LOAN 1927-CH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
The Highway Reconstruction Project was successful in achieving its
objectives, and was completed within the period and cost estimates forecast
at appraisal. The main project component was the reconstruction of badly
deteriorated sect'ons of the Longitudinal Highway totalling about 250 km.
The reconstructed sections of that highway, which is the backbone of the
Chilean highway system, substantially improved traffic corditions thus
contributing to the economic development of the area. These sections are
located immediately north and south of Santiago, the country's capital city,
following the Central Valley where about 70% of the country's population
lives. No major problems were encountered during project implementation; the
highway reconstruction component was completed within the appraisal estimates
for program and budget.
Other project components: pre-investment studies, technical
assistance for maintenance and training of personnel, and purchase of
vehicles, office and laboratory equipment were also completed within
appraisal estimates. All eight weigh-in-motion scales for vehicle axle load
control have been in operation since mid-1983 with very positive results.
The preparation stage of the project was rather long (about three
years) to enable Vialidad to ensure the availability before appraisal of well
prepared engineer'Lng designs for the reconstruction works. Appraisal took
place in February 1978 but discussions with Government on the size and
composition of the project and the need for a confirmation of the social
impact of the project delayed the issue of the SAR until November 1980.
Procurement was initially carried out in accordance with Bank
guidelines. However, later in the project implementation period, contracts
for reconstruction works were awarded on the basis of revised procedures
agreed with the Bank (Para. 3.04)1/

CHILE
HIGHWAY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT (LOAN 1927-CH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPCrT
I. INTRODUCTION
A. General
1.01      Chile has an area of about 575,000 km2 and a population of about
11.7 million. It is a long and narrow country stretching about 4,500 km from
north to south, but its width is no more than 150-200 km in most places. At
appraisal in 1978 Chile's highway network totaled some 76,200 km (subdivided
in 22,500 km main and 53,700 km local network) out of which about 9,600 km
were paved. The road network is adequate in the more heavily populated areas
of the country. The backbone of the highway system is the Longitudinal
Highway (about 3,400 km long) running north-south through the center of the
country linking most of the main cities and acting as a collector of traffic
from transverse roads. This highway is vital to Chile's economy and fosters
national integration.
1.02      The Longitudinal Highway was originally designed and constructed 15
to 30 years ago, to the design standa;ds and estimated volumes of traffic
prevailing at that time. Some sections became seriously deteriorated, having
outlived the original design standards and estimated traffic volumes, while
others deteriorated because of deficient maintenance. These sections
required reconstruction and improvement to meet existing or foreseen traffic
requirements over the next 10 to 20 years.
1.03      Vialidad was gradually reconstructing the highway as traffic grew
and funds became available. To assist Vialidad's efforts, the project
provided funds for the reconstruction of about 250 km of various sectiono of
the highway located in the Central Valley where some 70% of the country's
population lives, About 70% of Chile's agricultural exports, 75% of its food
crops, virtually all of its forestry exports and 40% of the country's copper
output are produced in the Central Valley area.
1.04      The Bank Group has been active in the Chilean road subsector since
1961 and prior to the Highway Reconstruction Project had extended four loans
and a credit, totalling US$91 million, for road projects.  The earliest
operations were Credit 4-CH and Loan 287-CH (both aoproved in June 1961).
They supported projects designed to expand and improve the highway network
and to strengthen road maintenance.  While the maintenance project (Loan
287-CH) was successfully completed in 1966, the Credit for construction was
not fully disbursed until 1971 because of delays encountered in engaging
colasultants and in completing the engineering. The project was also set back
by floods in 1965-66, which did serious damage to the roads under
construction,
1.05      A second Highway Maintenance Project was financed under Loan
558-CH, approved in September 1968. 'Its aim was to further the maintenance
improvement program launched under Loan 287-CH.  After a promising initial



- 2 -
start, the project was caught up in the economic turmoil through which Chile
passed in the early and mid seventies. It was particularly affected by
insufficient counterpart funds and rampant inflation.  As a result, the
project was not completed until 1978, about five years behind schedule.
Moreover, owing to the adverse economic conditions in Chile, the project did
not fully realize its objective of improving road maintenance. Nevertheless,
without the project, road maintenance in the country would have deteriorated
even more than it did.
1.06      The fourth Bank operation in the subsector, Loan 688-CH (approved
in 1970), was addressed at financing a Second Highway Construction Project.
Due to conditions in Chile in the early 1970's, there was virtually no
progress in its execution through 1973. In 1974, the Executive Directors
approved a reduction in the project scope and the revised project was
successfmlly completed in early 1979.
1.07      This Project Completion Report is based on information obtained
from the LAC Information Center, President's Report No. P-2901-CH, Staff
Appraisal Report No. 2145b-CH, Staff Supervision Reports and working papers
and a comprehensive Final Report on the project prepared by the Ministry of
Public Works (MOP) through its Directorate of Highways (Vialidad).
II.  PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTYIATIONS
2.01      A Preparation Mission that visited Chile in early 1975 was informed
by MOP authorities that the composition of the proposed project, as envisaged
by them, should comprise: a) bridge rehabilitation works; b) road
reconstruction works; and c) purchase of maintenance equipment. Total
estimated cost was US$121.5 million including a US$62.0 millien Bank
participation. Insufficient engineering preparation, coupled with a very
difficult economic situation of the country (in 1975 cooper prices dropped to
their lowest level in two decades), and the Government's priority for
investing in the productive sectors (agriculture and mining) resulted in the
proposed project remaining essentially at a standstill until 1977.
2.02      In 1976 MOP engaged three local consulting firms to prepare
feasibility studies and engineering designs for the main project component;
the reconstruction of the most deteriorated sections of the Longitudinal
Highway. The consultants recommended that of the total length of 3,400 km,
805 km required immediate reconstruction and of these sections about 370 km
were identified as part of a possible Bank-financed project. Other critical
sections were proposed for fiaancing either by IDB or MOP's own resources.
2.03      Further preparation missions visited Chile betweei November 1975
and July 1977 to review the status of project preparation and to discuss with
Government the composition and financing of the proposed project. The
project size was reduced not only because of the country's financial problems
but also because the Bank'7 allocation in the lending program for
transport projects in Chile was limited to US$30.0 million. Because of these
constraints MOP submitted to the Bank's July 1977 preparation mission a
revised project including only the reconstruction of sections of the
Longitudinal Highway, and technical assistance for highway maintenance and
the local construction industry. Total estimated cost of the revised project
was thus reduced to about US$60.0 million, including a Bank participation of
US$30.0 million.



2.04      The appraisal of the proposed project was carried out in Chile
between January 30 and February 17, 1978. The components appraised were: a)
the reconstruction of sections of the Longitudinal Highway totalling about
370 km and related construction supervision; b) technical assistance for
training and implementation of a maintenance program; c) maintenance and
pre-investment studies; and d) procurement of vehicles, office and laboratory
equipment. Total project cost was estimated at US$86.8 million, including a
Bank participation of US$40.0 million after the Bank agreed to increase its
allocation in the lending program from US$30.0 to US$40.0 million.
2.05      The Issues/Decision Memorandum dated April 4, 1978 confirmed that
there were no unresolved issues. Feasibility studies by local consultants
for the reconstruction works were made available at appraisal and final
engineering designs were expected to be ready by the time of negotiations.
2.06      Project preparation experienced substantial delays because of:  a)
the need for a detailed review of pavement designs for the reconstruction
works; b) the preparation by MOP of a report on highway maintenance
operations and equipment requirements; c) protracted discussions between the
Bank and MOP cn the annual amount to be allocated for maintenance operations;
d) the preparation of a special study, carried out by the Bank, on the social
impact of the project; and e) the need to develop more accurate cost
estimates. All this information was obtained during the course of two post
appraisal missions and four additional missions which visited Chile between
June 1978 and October 1980. Finally MOP and the Bank agreed on the
composition and size of the project which comprised:
i)   civil works and related supervision for the reconstruction of about
260 km of the Longitudinal Highway;
ii)   technical assistance for the implementation of a maintenance
program and training of personnel;
iii) pre-investment studies for priority transport investments 2/; and
iv)   purchase of vehicles and office and laboratory equipment.
2.07      Ultimately, the project's total cost estimate was US$91.7 million,
including a Bank participation of US$42.0 million. Detailed cost estimates
are shown in the following page. The closing date was established as
December 31, 1984. The project was completed in four years (1981-1984)
within the completion period estimated at appraisal.
2/ Possible areas to be considered were feeder roads, port access roads and
fishing ports.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Reconstruction Works
3.01      Complete engineering designs were prepared by local cona.ultants only
for the badly deteriorated sections of the Longitudinal Highway whicb required
immediate reconstruction. The project comprises the reconstruction of
secticns with a total accumulated length of about 260 km (Map IBRD 13528R2).
For bidding purposes the sections (appraisal estimate - $7.4-$17.1 million per
section) were grouped into three bidding packages. In order to attract local
and foreign bidders contracts ould be awarded to prequalified contractors on
the basis of the lowest evaluated bid for the entire package or to several
contractors for one or more sections, The three bidding packages were to be
tendered at intervals of about nine months. All initial procurement
procedures were in accordance with Bank guidelines.
3.02      However, in March 1980 the Government issued a decree establishing
tendering and contracting procedures for public works which departed from the
previously used unit price approach based on detailed engineering prepared by
consultants. The new approach shifted the detailed engineering responsibility
to the contractor.3/
3.03      The revised procedure provided that a) the contractor should prepare
the detailed engineering and present his bid in terms of final cost for
completed stages of the works; b) the final cost should include physical
contingencies but could be adjusted for inflation; and c) the selected
contractor would be paid on delivery of completed specific stages of the
works. Vialidad tested the procedure in selecting contractors through ICB for
works financed by the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB).3/
3.04      Initially the Bank did not agree to the usa of the new procedure,
but in May 1982 the Bank's Procurement Legal Advisor indicated that, at least
on a trial basis, the procedure could be used on work being financed through
Bank loans. The Advisor did note that he felt international contractors might
have some reservations as to the equitability of the revised procedure when
compared to the usual Bank guidelines. In practice, foreign contractors
continued to show interest and the new system proved satisfactory and
generally within the Bank's procurement guidelines. With minor changes, the
Bank has agreed to its use for contracting works in the follow-on projects
(Loan 2297-CH, US$128.0 million - August 1983 and Loan 2589-CH, US$140 million
- October 10, 1985).3/
3.05      One impertant characteristic that distinguishes the Chilean
procurement system for civil works is the degree of responsibility placed upon
the contractor, who is required to produce, and stand by, the final design of
the works. Contractors are given basic survey and soils information, as well
as the performance specifications, from which they work to achieve a finished
product. Construction work is also paid for by clearly identified stages of
completed work. The system practically eliminated claims, resulted in a good
and timely completion record and, together with good management by the
Borrower, resulted in completion of the project works within time and cost
parameters.3/
3/ The Borrower in its comments rightly points out that the revised tendering
and contracting procedures were not used under Loan 1927-CH, subject of
this report. The new procedures were utilized under the follow-on Loan
2297-CH (Annex 2).



3.06      In early 1980 Vialidad invited contractors to prequalify for the
works on the first bidding package. Since Vialidad was interested in
obtaining comparative proposals for construction of bituminous and/or cement
concrete pavements, the prequalification documents requested information on
the contractor's capacity for constructing one or both types of pavements.
Twenty local and six foreign firms were prequalified for carrying out works in
the four sections included in the first bidding package. In early 1981
Vialidad invited interested contractors to submit prequalification data for
the second bidding package (four sections); twenty-four local and nine foreign
firms were prequalified. The same list of prequalified contractors was used
for the third bidding package (two sections).
3.07      Bids for the first bidding package were opened in December 1980, in
mid July 1981 for the second package and in July 1982 for the third package.
An average of ten bids were received for each section or grouping of sections
included in the bidding packages; if so prequalified, bidders could submit
proposals for both pavement alternatives. Eight contracts were awarded, seven
to local firms and one to a Chilean-Argentine joint venture. Details of
awarded contracts are shown in Table 1. The total amount of awarded contracts
(US$82.1 million) was below appraisal estimates (US$84.3 million, including
contingencies). The principal reason for the reduction was the continuing
devaluation of the local currency.
3.08     Late in 1981, Vialidad and the Bank reviewed the project's financial
status and found that because of cost increases in the first six contracts
awarded, loan funds would not be available for financing the two remaining
sections (package 3). Construction prices were depressed at the time the
appraisal estimates were prepared but by the time bids were called demand for
construction services was strong and prices reflected this change in market
conditions. Normally, this would imply a reduction of the disbursement
percentage but instead Vialidad proposed, and the Bank agreed in principle,
that Chile would finance 100% of those two sections with its own funds.
However, at a later stage of the project and because of devaluation of the
local currency, enough loan funds remained available for financing the work on
these two sections. Works were completed in December 1984 at a total cost of
US$82.07 million, 3% below the US$84.27 million estimated at appraisal.
3.09      Vialidad takes direct responsibility of supervision for construction
and assigns personnel from its own staff to supervise each major contract or
group of minor contracts. Consultants are also engaged to supplement Vialidad
staff. For this project, three consulting firms were selected after inviting
proposals from a short list of prequalified consultants4/. Coordination of
the work of the supervising consultants was provided by7an experienced
engineer engaged by Vialidad from a U.S. consulting firm to act as Project
Coordinator. Total cost of supervision was US$3.0 million or about 3.5% of
the cost of civil works. Consultant costs were partially financed under the
loan.
3.10      No major problems were encountered during project implementation.
At one stage, surface cracking began to appear on some of the portland cement
concrete pavements but, after consultation with the Bank, special studies were
carried out and the condition corrected.
4/ The Borrower in its comments suggests the deletion of this phrase. The
reasons, not in the text of the comments, are: (i) more than three
consulting firms were selected; and (ii) the selectio;; procedure was on
the basis of competition open to all comers (Annex 1).



-7-
B. Highway Maintenance
3.11      The Bank has been concerned with the need to improve road
maintenance operations since 1961 when it first became involved in Chile's
highway subsector. The Second Highway Maintenance Project (Ln, 558-CH) was
devoted entirely to maintenance, and two other earlier projects had
substantial maintenance components. However, during the early 1970's the
economic and political turmoil experienced by Chile contributed to a serious
deterioration of the highway ma:,.ntenance activity, and the Blank-financed
maintenance project uid not fully achieve its objectives (para. 1.05).
3.12      In 1980, Vialidad and the Bank agreed to: a) the creation of a
Maintenance Task Force to prepare a maintenance program; and b) the execution
of the program directly by Vialidad staff, instead of being supported by
consultants. The project financed studies which contributed to the
preparation of the program, but most of the funds originally assigned Lo
consultancies for maintenance were later reallocated (Table 2).
3.13      After discussions in March 1982 between the Bank and Vialidad, a new
Maintenance Council was established, chaired by a newly appointed Deputy
Director of Vialidad, having as its members the Cbiefs of Engineering,
Maintenance, Laboratory and Construction Departments. The Planning Section of
the Maintenance Department, under the general direction of the Council,
prepared a routine and periodic maintenance program for the main network.
3.14    These were important institutional steps, which were followed by
Vialidad resuming full responsibility for the maintenance of 22,500 km of main
roads and 24,000 km of local roads now designated as primary local roads. The
remaining 32,000 km of the local network are secondary roads, whose
maintenance continued under the responsibility of the municipalities. Funds
allocated for maintenance of the basic network have been generally adequate
but funding for the rest of the network has been unsatisfactory. The issues
of funding and adequate support for the maintenance of secondary roads are
being addressed in subsequent projects. The outlook is good for continuing
steady improvements in the maintenance of the road network.
C. Pre-Investment Studies
3.15      The project originally envisaged the preparation of pre-investment
studies to determine high priority investments in the transport sector.
During project implementation Vialidad and the Bank agreed to limit these
studies to the highway subsector to which the Government allocated the highest
priority, Between mid-1981 and mid-1983, Vialidad invited and received
proposals from pre-qualified consultants for carrying out the studies. Six
contracts were awarded to local firms and one contract to a joint
Chilean-U.K. venture. The studies covered mainly rehabilitation, maintenance,
and improvement of the Longitudinal Highway in Regions II to IX, plus similar
studies for a feeder road in Region II and Transverse Roads in Region VII.
All studies were completed by Auguet 1984. Total cost was US$1.21 million.
D. Purchase of vehicles aiid office and laboratory equipment
3.16      The appraisal estimate included US$180,000 to finance the purchase
of vehicles and office and laboratory equipment. During project



-8-
implementation, Via lad and the Bank, in view (If urgent need of platform
trucks, light trucks, paint for lane marking, equipment for testing soils and
pavement evaluation as well as for maintenance., agreed to increase that amount
to about $2e5 million. By agreement with the Bank, certain items were
procured through local bidding procedures, and the balance in accordance with
Bank ICB guidelines. A summary follows:
Purchased              Items                                     Costs

E. Training abroad of technical staff
3.17      As indicated in para. 3.11, the Bank agreed to Vialidad's proposals
with respect to "in-house" preparation of the maintenance program and the
implementation thc - without the assistance of outside consultants.  As an
alternative use of some of the funds thus released, Vialidad proposed and the
Bank agreed to the use of loan funds to finance training abroad for selected
Vialidad staff.  Details of this training follow:
No. of Engineers           Country           Disciplines
1                   USA                Transportation, low traffic roads

2                   South Africa       Asphalt pavements
3.18      The trainees are contributing to the improvement of Vialidad
management. Total cost of the training program was US$29,400.
IV. PROJECT COST AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison between appraisal estimates and final costs is shown in
Table 2,  Final project cost was US$88.9 million or about 3% below the
appraisal estimate of US$91.7 million. The reduction resulted from the
devaluation of the local currency which translated into a lower amount in
foreign currency than originally envisaged. Table 1 shows, for the highway
reconstruction component, a comparison contract by contract between the
appraisal estimate and final cost.



-9-
4002      In early 1983 the Government requested, and the Bank agreed, to a
reallocation of proceeds of the loan to a) cover initial cost increases of the
reconstruction works; b) carry out additional pre-investment studies for the
reconstruction of about 500 km of the Longitudinal Highway and 250 km of
transversal highways for inclusion as road reconstruction items in the Bank's
follow-on project (Ln. 2297-CH); and c) increase the allocation for purchase
of vehicles, office and laboratory equipment. The proposed revision was
agreed in March 1983; comparison between the original, revised and final
allocations follows:

was modified as above on 3/24/83.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The highway reconstruction program was justified at the time of
appraisal on the basis of the benefits derived by highway users in the form of
vehicle operating cost savings, through the improvement of the road condition
and decreased road maintenance costs. The economic reevaluation, which
quantified the same type of benefits than the original one, was carried out by
the Direccion de Vialidad with the use of the Highway Design and Maintenance
Model (HDM-III). This exercise confirmed the economic merit of the project,
with economic rates of return (ERRs) ranging from 47% to 148% for the
different road sections.
5.02      Table 4 summarizes the major parameters used for the original and
ex-post evaluations and the corresponding results, while Table 5 presents the



- 10 -
vehicle operating costs used in both analyses. The economic reevaluation
resulted on EERs substantially above those expected at appraisal. This is
mostly explained by the different methodologies used in both exercises, which
voids the direct comparison of ERRs. In any case, the ex-post return on the
subproject portfolio financed under the loan, should be somewhat above
appraisal expectations, since investment costs and traffic growth rates were
generally in line with estimates, while the start of project implementation
was delayed by two years and road condition deteriorated further. However,
this should not lead to the conclusion that the economy was better off as a
result of the registered slippage, since the foregone vehicle operating and
road maintenance costs savings throughout the period of delay may not be
offset by the alternative return on the freed investment resources throughout
the same period.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      Overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory.  Vialidad
showed a high degree of competence in preparing and managing the execution of
the present project. Starting in 1974, highway administration in Chile has
become progressively more efficient after previously having had to operate
under severe financial constraints and during a period of basic and major
government administrative reorganizaition. Due to adequate planning no major
problems were encountered during project execution. The lengthy preparation
period stemmed primarily from the time required to refine the detailed
engineering and cost estimates. Once the loan was approved implementation of
the various components went smoothly and the project was completed within the
agreed period and the appraisal estimates.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
6.02      General compliance with Loan Covenants was satisfactory.  Early in
the project implementation period Vialidad requested, and the Bank agreed, to
a short term postponement of some loan covenants relating to report submission
on the start-up of various loan components. Vialidad complied with the
revised deadlines.
6.03      Two of the Loan Covenants required the Government to complete the
construction of the second and fourth sectors of the Longitudinal Highway not
later than 30 June 1985 and 31 December 1985 respectively. The 805 km of the
highway identified as requiring immediate reconstruction were divided into
four sectors; reconstruction of the first sector of 240 km was completed in
1979-1980 with Government funds; the second sector of 170 km was completed in
1981 also with Government funds and the third sector of 250 km was completed
on schedule under the present project. The fourth sector, originally
programmed for 145 km, was expanded to 540 km as a result of studies completed
under this project and its construction work was completed on schedule with
the financial assistance of two IDB loans (78-IC-CH and 79-IC-CH). Thus 1200
km of the important Longitudinal Highway have been reconstructed to modern
standards instead of the originally specified 805 km.



- 11 -
6.04      Consultants for pre-investment studies and construction supervision
were engaged in a timely manner and all contracts for reconstruction works
were satisfactorily completed. Local counterpart funds were readily available
as required. Maintenance of the basic network is satisfactorily programmed.
6.05      An  mportant covenant of the loan agreement required the Government
to complete its program for the control of vehicle weights. The Government
purchased and installed eight weigh-in-motion scales with its own funds, all
of which were in full operation by mid-1983. Fines for overweight vehicles
were increased in November 1981 and stricter regulations for freight carrying
vehicles were established. According to Vialidad's Final Report issued on
June 1985 this program has reduced the proportion of overweight vehicles from
25% to around 1%.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The project objectives were successfully fulfilled.  A substantial
contribution was made to Chile's highway improvement program, particularly
with the initiation of modern maintenanee and planning methods which provided
a basis for primary components in two subsequent projects. In retrospect it
can be concluded that the Bank, through the project, made an important impact
on the highway subsector through its encouragement of Vialidad in improving
and streamlining its operations, and introducing important sector initiative,
such as the very successful overweight vehicle control program. This impact
was enhanced by the receptivity of Vialidad staff, and Vialidad's discipline
and sound management practices.  It was, indeed, fertile ground in which to
sow,
7.02      The decision to reconstruct selected sections of Chile's most
important highway was sound. The economic re-evaluation of the investments
shows high rates t return.
7.03      The Bank's agreement to replace the L    enance technical assistance
component with a training component did not ha;_ an adverse effect on the
project, and the Bank's suggestions for institutional improvement, together
with the purchase of items of maintenance equipment, contributed to the
overall improvement of the maintenance program.
7.04      The revised bidding and contract award procedures adopted after the
start of the project did not cause problems. The same procedures with slight
modifications have now been agreed in the subsequent Bank-assisted highway
projects. The practice of making the contractors responsible for the final
design and paying for finished work on clearly identified stages produced good
results, by practically eliminating claims and contributing to the timely
completion of the Project works, within budget. It offers a good lesson which
may be replicable elsewhere.5/
7.05      Vialidad's management of the project and its development of modern
planning methods was commendable, This is perhaps the most important lesson
-- sound, receptive management as a key to project success.
5/ The Borrower suggests that this paragraph be deleted since, as explained
in the footnote to paragraphs 3.02 to 3.05, the new procedures were not
used under Loan 1927-CH (Annex 1).

UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION OF THE BORROWER'S
COMMENTS ON THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Santiago de Chile, December 12, 1986
International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development
Washington, D.C.,
USA
Attn: Mr. Brian Shields
Division Chief of Energy, Infrastructure
and Urban Development
Operations Evaluation Department
Re your letter of November 19, 1986 about the Completion Report on the
Highway Reconstruction Project, Loan 1927-CH we suggest:
AAA) Delete last phrase of page vi;
BBB) Revise paragraphs 3.02 to 3.05 in order to establish that the
modified procurement system was not used under Project
1927-CH but it was utilized in a restricted form under
Project 2297-CH;
CCC) In paragraph 3.09 delete the third phrase;
DDD) Delete paragraph 7.04;
EXE) In Table 1 regarding details of contracts and costs, it
should be written: S-4/S-5 and S-1/S-2 instead of 54/55 and
51/52.
Sincerely,
Remberto Urrea Muster
Director, Nacional de Vialidad
