   Project's main objective is to reconstruct about 250 km\n            of badly deteriorated sections of Chile's Longitudinal\n            Highway. This road, the backbone of the country's road\n            network, is of critical importance to the national economy.\n            The project also includes studies to strengthen road\n            maintenance and prepare priority projects in the transport\n            sector. The project faces no special risks."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
