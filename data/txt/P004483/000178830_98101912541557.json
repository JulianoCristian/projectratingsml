         in elementary education. Policy changes are being introduced\n            to reduce disparities in educational opportunity, to improve\n            quality, and to increase the efficiency of the school system\n            as follows: a revised procedure is being adopted to allocate\n            a larger share of development expenditures to educationally\n            deprived regions; the share of recurrent expenditure for\n            nonsalary items is being increased to improve the quality of\n            instruction; the policy for teacher utilization is being\n            revised to make more efficient use of subject matter\n            teachers; and policies for student admissions, evaluation,\n            and progression are being improved to raise the\n            participation rate of the school-aged group and to reduce\n            the dropout rate. The organization, functions, and staffing\n            of the main agencies involved with elementary education are\n            being modified to strengthen sector management and planning.\n            Instructional programs and materials and the distribution of\n            facilities and teachers will also be improved."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
