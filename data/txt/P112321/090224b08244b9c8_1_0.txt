                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A restructuring was approved on March 27 to extend the closing day from March 31, 2014 to March 31, 2015.
                         Prior to the crisis that began in December 2012, project implementation performance was rated satisfactory. The client is highly appreciative of the impact of project activities on the
                         ground and has noted the positive trends in the primary education sector. Unfortunately, with several phases of political upheaval and its overall impact on the education sector,

                         progress towards achieving the PDO is downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory. Reports from the technical counterparts and the media indicate that the security situation is
                         preventing regular school activities. All results that have been achieved to contribute to improved access and quality of education have diminished.
