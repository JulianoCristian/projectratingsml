                         The proposed Grant will contribute to the implementation of Phase 1 of the Government National Education Strategy (2008-2011), and aims to improve access to better
                         quality primary education.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards achieving the project development objective remains satisfactory. The production of the 2011/2012 statistics is incurring some delays. From 2007/2008 to
                         2010/11, primary education has achieved significant results. The GER has increased substantially to reach 87.2% in 2010/11 from 73.7% in 2007/2008. New entrants in Grade 1 and
                         Grade 6 have also progressed steadily. For Grade 1, for example, the number of new entrants reached 115 803 in 2011 from 113 513 in 2010. Further, students have greater access
                         to textbooks. The distribution of textbooks allowed two students to share three books in 2011 while three students shared one book a year earlier. Despite these achievements, more

                         efforts are needed to improve girls’ access to education and internal efficiency. At the primary level, the girls:boys ratio has stagnated around 42% for the past several years. The
                         internal efficiency at the primary level remains weak, with a repetition rate of 23% and a drop-out rate of 8.4%, impacting the completion rate that reached 40% in 2011, compared to
                         the target of 58%.

                         The project is in the last phase of construction using the savings from contracts signed with AGETIP and ACTED. The Government and the two MOD have been informed of the
                         importance of completing the works before the closing date to benefit from the financing under the Grant. The project will close on June 30, 2013 and the Grant funds are available to
                         finance solely works, goods and services that are fully executed and completed before the closing date. This policy applies to the entire project.

                         As of December 19, 2012, US$35.31 million (93% of the total grant amount) has been disbursed, a 13% increase from March 2012.
