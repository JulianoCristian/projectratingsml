Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project will close on March 31, 2015. Th project has completed all activities; nevertheless, their impact on the system is significantly reduced.
 Political instability and periodic conflicts have damaged the majority of project results and prevented accurate assessment of results on the ground.
 The Project organized a retreat in December 2014 to take stock of achievements. A report was provided to the Bank, presenting quantitative information
 with modest assessment of the functioning of the system.
