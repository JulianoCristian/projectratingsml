                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation is satisfactory. The school infrastructure program, that experienced delays, has picked up and produced concrete results since October 2011 as follows: 501
                         classrooms built (against the target of 513) and 314 rehabilitated (against the target of 410). Disbursements have also shown good progress, reaching US$29.5 million (78% of grant
                         amount) - a 48% increase from October 2011.

                         At the sector level, the project has contributed to improving access and enhancing the teaching and learning environment. Since the reporting in October, sector indicators remain
                         unchanged for the 2010-11 school year: GER for the primary level reached 87.2%, surpassing the target of 79.5%. New entrants in the first grade were 115,803 students compared to
                         a target of 110,142. As for the second grade, overall the target was met with 47,107 new entrants, compared to 47,612 as planned. Students/teacher ratio was 81/1, compared to the
                         target of 91/1. With the distribution of textbooks completed, the students/textbook ratio of 1.4 compared favorably with the target of 1.9. Even though access has been in constant

                         progression, the Government is aware of the high repetition rate (22%) that constitutes an impediment to the goal of attaining universal primary education.

                         The project closing date has been extended by 12 months to June 30, 2013 and will enable the Government to consolidate the results achieved under the project and to fully utilize
                         the grant proceeds.

                         The work for a comprehensive review of the implementation of the first phase of its National Education Strategy is underway. A workshop to present the results, with the participation
                         of high level officials, the civil society and the development partners, is scheduled for mid-may 2012.
