Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 A limited survey in April 2014 undertaken by the Government showed that 56% of the schools have re-opened. With the return to relative stability, it is
 expected that schools resumption will return to normalcy soon. At the Project level, the Technical Permanent Secretariat (Secrétaire Technique
 Permanent, STP) has undertaken missions in the field to take stock of Project achievements, notably those related to the school civil works program and
 the internship of the student-teachers. The Bank is awaiting a comprehensive report from the STP.

 Overall Comments
 All indicators are kept as they are since the last reporting. The Statistics Department has not been able to restart its function since the crisis.
 The operation that has been submitted for GPE-financing approval, under UNICEF management, has included activities to restore the capacities
 of the Statistics Department. It is expected that regular statistics production can resume for 2015-2016 academic year.
