I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country background. At the time of preparation of the Education Sector
Development Project (P112321) in 2008, the Central African Republic (CAR) was a
country showing signs of emergence from a long period of political and economic
instability. Since its independence in 1960, CAR had been plagued by a series of
autocratic leaders and bouts of armed low-intensity conflict in various areas throughout
the country mitigated with fragile peace treaties. These conflicts had led to the
destruction of much of the country’s infrastructure and contributed to poor
socioeconomic outcomes. In March 2003, the country underwent a regime change and
established a transitional government led by President François Bozize, who successfully
held national elections in 2005. The World Bank had re-engaged in CAR in 2004,
following a period of suspension due to CAR’s extended instability and the accumulation
of unsustainable arrears. During the time of Project preparation, peace talks were
underway with key rebel groups. Security remained fragile, with ongoing bouts of
violence, but macroeconomic performance and policy implementation were improving.
Notably, in 2007, growth had reached its highest in a decade, at 4.3 percent, with further
increases projected. However, CAR remained dependent on foreign aid.

2.      Despite significant mineral deposits and the potential of its diverse natural
resources including uranium, gold, diamonds and hydropower as well as significant
quantities of arable land, poverty remained widespread due to instability and misdirected
economic policies. In 2008, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was US$474,
making CAR one of the poorest countries in the world; indeed, an estimated 66 percent of
the population of about 4.3 million were living below the poverty line in 2008.

3.      Furthermore, the conflict between the Government and rebels was ongoing in
certain areas of the country, with an August 2009 United Nations (UN) report
highlighting that more than a million people had been affected by civil unrest in CAR.
The recurrent armed and violent conflict contributed to a decline in all social indicators:
CAR ranked 178th out of 179 countries in the UNDP’s 2008 Human Development Index;
life expectancy at birth was estimated at 39 years, down from 49 years in 1988; the adult
literacy rate for persons 15 years and above was 65 percent; and the incidence of
HIV/AIDS was considered to be at crisis level, at 6.2 percent. The infant mortality rate in
2003 was around 132 per 1,000 compared to 86 per 1,000 for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA),
and maternal mortality had increased from 683 to 1,350 deaths per 100,000 births from
1988 to 2003, respectively.

4.      Sector background. Several factors characterized CAR’s education sector. At
the time of Project preparation in 2008, the primary gross enrollment rate (GER) in
education—which was 73.7 percent during the 2007-08 school year—had remained
relatively stagnant over the previous 15 years in part due to the effects of recurrent
violent conflict affecting the ability of teachers and children to attend school. Its primary



                                             1
GER placed CAR at 10 percentage points below other francophone African countries in
2004-2005, meaning that one in four children in CAR had never been to school, with an
intake rate of 76 percent in Grade 1, an average dropout rate of 26 percent, and a primary
completion rate (PCR) of 31 percent in 2005.

5.      At the same time, there had been a significant increase in the non-public sector,
which housed 44 percent of students. A contributing factor to this state of affairs was
teachers’ salaries. In comparison to other low-income African countries, salaries of CAR
civil servant teachers were significantly higher, and nearly triple the proportion of GDP
per inhabitant than the average observed in poor countries making the most progress
toward achieving universal primary education. As a result, budget constraints meant the
number of civil servant teachers in CAR was insufficient to meet education demand, and
that the system responded with an increase in non-civil servant teachers to address high
student-to-teacher ratios. Thus, more than 40 percent of primary teachers were
community teachers, untrained and hired by families, in particular in rural areas; primary
school student-to-civil servant teacher ratios were, on average, 109 in Bangui, and over
450 in the more remote North and North-East provinces.

6.      While the long term instability had also contributed to reduced educational
infrastructure, a shortage of teaching and learning materials (an average of one reading
textbook per 10 students), fewer teachers and the general stagnation of the system’s
capacity, a significant increase in education demand was expected due to demographic
growth of two percent per year. Indeed, the number of children of primary school age
was projected to more than triple by 2018, which was expected to have serious negative
implications, including for the already high pupil-to-classroom ratios (111 in 2005), if
adjustments were not made to accommodate the increased demand. Finally, CAR had
both low levels of learning (the lowest among the 10 French-speaking countries
participating in the 2006 PASEC (CONFEMEN Program for the Analysis of Education
Systems) “Light” French and math tests), and low levels of education system efficiency,
as evidenced by a primary repetition rate of 30 percent.

7.      Overall, the system was therefore faced with important shortcomings with respect
to the supply of education services (the stagnation of the system’s capacity), and the
quality of education service provision (untrained teachers and lack of basic teaching and
learning inputs contributing to poor learning outcomes). There was Government
commitment, however, to address these challenges. With financing from the multi-donor
Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI, now known as the Global Partnership
for Education – GPE), a 12-year national education strategy (2008-2020) had been
developed and formally adopted by the Government in February 2008. This strategy had
been endorsed by the local education development partner group as credible and aligned
with the country’s medium term expenditure framework, though in need of external
financing.

8.     Role of other development partners. In close consultation with other
development partners, the Project supported the first phase (2008-11) of the national
education strategy. The local education development partner group, led by the French



                                            2
Development Agency (AFD) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), provided feedback during preparation, and guidance and
oversight during the implementation of the Project. In addition, local development
partners financed or were expected to finance other interventions that complemented
Project-financed interventions to address sector needs. During the period of appraisal and
onward through implementation, development partners in CAR embraced a harmonized
approach whereby partners’ support contributed to sector-wide objectives as laid out in
the national education strategy. As such, other partners provided both budget support
(International Monetary Fund, European Commission, AFD, and China) contributing to
education civil servant wages, and technical assistance and investment financing. In
particular, AFD, UNESCO, UNICEF and WFP were financing or expected to finance
complementary programs or assistance to the government in primary education and/or
institutional strengthening at the time of appraisal.

9.      Rationale for World Bank and EFA-FTI involvement. The Project was
financed through a grant from the EFA-FTI, which aimed to enhance countries' capacity
to improve results in primary education in access, equity, quality, and stronger and
inclusive education systems. At the time of Project appraisal, the main objective of the
EFA-FTI was to support the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
in education, to which the Project was expected to contribute in CAR. The World Bank, a
key partner active in CAR’s education sector at the time, was selected to be the
Supervising Entity (SE) for this grant; as such, it supported the preparation of the Project
in collaboration with local development partners, and assumed full fiduciary oversight
and implementation support for the grant. Development partner financing was much
needed in the CAR education sector—with external aid accounting for two percent of
GDP, as compared to an average of six percent in other post-conflict countries. There
had been a severe drop in budget priority afforded to primary education (from 28 percent
of public expenditure excluding debt on education in 1996 to 14 percent in 2005), in
particular, with higher education favored relative to other countries. The World Bank,
which at the time had been the SE for all EFA-FTI grants, had experience in their
administration and was considered to have a comparative advantage in leading a dialogue
with the Government on education as linked to its broader development strategies and
macroeconomic framework.

10.     Higher-level objectives to which the operation was to contribute. In addition
to supporting CAR’s national education strategy—which included as an objective
reaching universal primary education by 2020—the Project aimed to contribute to the
achievement of broader objectives identified in CAR’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) 2008-10. In particular, by (inter alia) helping to expand access to basic services,
the Project was meant to contribute to human capital development, identified as a key
factor in attaining sustainable, long-term growth. Additionally, through the provision of
education infrastructure, it was expected to contribute to the Government’s goal of
removing physical bottlenecks to economic revival, and to facilitate the achievement of
universal primary education. Finally, the Project was expected to be aligned with the
human resource development pillar of the joint World Bank-African Development Bank
Country Partnership Strategy for CAR being developed at the time of appraisal.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

11.    In the Grant Agreement, the PDO was as follows: “The objective of the Project is
to contribute to the implementation of Phase 1 of the Recipient’s National Education
Strategy (2008-2011), adopted by the Recipient’s Cabinet at its meeting of February 15,
2008, by improving access to better quality primary education.”

12.     The PDO as reflected in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was slightly
different, but without a substantive difference in stated Project objectives, as follows:
“The proposed Grant will contribute to the implementation of Phase 1 of the Government
National Education Strategy (2008-2011), and aims to improve access to better quality
primary education.” The slight wording differences do not affect the evaluation of the
Project’s achievements.

13.   There were five PDO-level indicators, outlined in the table below as provided in
the PAD:

Table 1: PDO-level Indicator and Target Values at Appraisal

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

14.     There were no revisions to the PDO or to key indicators. Although the Project
underwent three restructurings to extend its closing date, the target values which had been
established for 2011 remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

15.    While the main beneficiaries were not explicitly identified in the PAD, the
Project—which covered most of the country in terms of geographic targeting—was
designed to reach:



                                              4
        Primary school aged children in all regions of CAR, including those from
         vulnerable groups and indigenous peoples, expected to benefit from new and
         rehabilitated classrooms and textbooks (612,806 pupils expected to be enrolled in
         schools in overcrowded conditions by 2011/12, plus 49,250 pupils expected to
         benefit from school furniture).
        Teacher candidates and community and contract teachers, expected to
         benefit from training and skills upgrading and salaries financed. (In-service
         training and subsequent hiring as student-teachers of 365 community teachers;
         pre-service training and subsequent hiring as student-teachers of 750 teacher
         candidates; 2,767 additional teachers expected to be contracted and employed).
         Teachers in newly built or rebuilt and furnished classrooms were also
         expected to benefit from improved teaching conditions. (985 teachers were
         expected to benefit from classroom furniture.)
        Ministry of Education directorates, which were expected to benefit from
         institutional capacity strengthening.     These included the Directorate for
         Construction and Equipment (Direction des Constructions et Equipements
         Scolaires - DCES), eight regional units for construction and equipment (Unité
         Régionale de Construction des Cadres Techniciens et Equipement Scolaire -
         URCES), Teacher Training Colleges (Ecole Normale des Instituteurs - ENI),
         eight Regional Pedagogical Centers (Centre Pédagogique Régional - CPR) for
         teacher training, and the Permanent Technical Secretariat (Secrétariat Technique
         Permanent - STP) for Project management.

1.5 Original Components

The Project consisted of three components, as follows:

16.    Component 1: Access (school construction, rehabilitation, and furniture)
(Appraisal: US$18.55 million; Actual expenditure: US$9.67 million1). In the context of
expected increasing demand for primary education and overcrowded classrooms, this
component aimed to expand education system capacity through classroom construction
and rehabilitation, thereby improving access to education. In particular, the component
was designed to support the construction of 568 new and rehabilitation of 417 unusable
classrooms (including provision of furniture), as well as the construction of 214 latrines2
and 190 feeder wells. The component was expected to target areas of the country not
under active conflict at the time of appraisal, in coordination with other development
partner financing which covered the northern, post-conflict regions of the country. The



1
  Actual expenditures for all components were calculated by converting to US$ (using an exchange rate of
US$1 = FCFA479.34) the final expenditures reported in FCFA in the final project external audit. An
additional US$429,945 were spent under the “unallocated” line of the budget, according to the final
external audit. According to this audit, this figure is not associated with a particular component but is under
disbursement Category 2 of the Project.
2
  Two numbers are used in the PAD: 214 latrines are mentioned in paragraph 79 (pg. 22) and in the Results
Framework; and 216 are mentioned (likely a calculation error) in the table on page 22. The number used in
this document is 214, as it also reflects the Government documentation.


                                                      5
increase in classrooms was expected to help reduce the pupil-to-classroom ratio from an
expected 116:1 (in 2008-09) to 111:1 in 2011-12.

17.     Component 2: Quality (teacher training and textbooks)3 (Appraisal: US$8.30
million; Actual expenditure: US$10.74 million). To counter the potentially negative
effects of the growing demand for schooling—which contributed to overcrowded
classrooms and recruitment of local community-based teachers at the time of appraisal—
this component aimed to enhance the quality of education by providing basic inputs for
effective teaching and learning. Namely, it supported teacher training and the provision
of textbooks through two sub-components: (a) in-service teacher training and skills
upgrading for 365 community-based teachers to meet minimum qualification criteria, as
well as pre-service training for 750 teacher candidates annually in CPRs and ENIs; and
(b) the provision of 480,000 textbooks and 27,600 teacher manuals in mathematics and
French to all CAR schools to reduce the pupil-to-textbook ratio.

18.     Under the teacher training sub-component, four new CPRs were expected to be
built, and four ENIs rehabilitated to receive community-based teachers and teacher
candidates under improved conditions; training of teacher trainers was to be provided;
new teacher training curricula developed; teacher materials provided to existing and new
teacher training facilities; and regional inspectorate and local circumscriptions were to
receive additional means to manage student-teachers and contract teachers.

19.     Component 3: Management and efficiency (Appraisal: US$9.64 million; Actual
expenditure: US$16.96 million). This component aimed to improve the management and
efficiency of the education system through reforms of the teacher payment system and
capacity building activities for the Ministry of Education (MoE). With respect to reforms
of the teacher payment system, the component supported the continuation and scale-up of
the recruitment, deployment and payment via private sector actors of primary school
contract teachers, from 809 under a previous Bank-financed project4 to 2,767 covered
under the Project (including stipends for student-teachers and teacher salaries). The
component also provided physical and institution capacity building—including
construction of offices, provision of equipment and vehicles, and training—for the MoE’s
central administration.

1.6 Revised Components

20.    There were no revisions to Project components.

1.7 Other significant changes

21.   The Project was restructured on three occasions over its lifetime to revise its
implementation schedule. The first two restructurings were approved by the Country

Manager; the final restructuring, which required a cumulative extension of more than two
years of the Project closing date, was approved by the Regional Vice President.

22.      The first restructuring, on February 1, 2012, extended the closing date by one year,
from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to provide the MoE with additional time to complete
activities that were behind schedule due to procurement and implementation delays. In
particular, the extension allowed the MoE to: (i) complete the civil works program, and
specifically the portion of the program delegated to one of the delegated project
management firms (Maître d’Ouvrage Déléguée - MOD) for management; and (ii) allow
the final (2010-2012) teacher cohort to graduate in September 2012.

23.      Following the armed overthrow of CAR’s President Bozize and his Government
on March 24, 2013 by the Seleka rebel alliance—and act which launched the resurgence
of active political and violent conflict on a broader scale—the execution of Project
activities was disrupted. Schooling activities in CAR could not follow their normal
course, and both the Project infrastructure program and the training of teachers were
interrupted. Furthermore, the precarious political and security situation prompted the
World Bank to trigger its Operational Policy (OP) 7.30, which suspended all CAR project
disbursements in March 2013. However, Project objectives remained relevant, and CAR
and the World Bank’s assessment was that a continued active presence of the Bank in the
sector was important to preserve progress toward Project objectives and maintain a
dialogue and technical support on managing the effects of the crisis on the sector. As a
result, the Project remained open despite the turmoil, and the second restructuring, on
June 12, 2013, extended the closing date by 9 months to March 31, 2014. This
restructuring allowed for the resumption of the school infrastructure program and the
completion of the teacher training program using already-disbursed funds remaining in
the Project designated account.

24.     The resumption of Project disbursement was authorized in December 2013. As a
result of the delays accumulated during the months of crisis and the period during which
OP 7.3 was in effect, there was a need for additional implementation time. The final
restructuring, on March 21, 2014, therefore extended the closing date by an additional 12
months to March 31, 2015 to provide sufficient time for the assessment of remaining
implementation plans and the execution of remaining agreed activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation


25.     Analytical underpinnings. A 2008 CAR Country Status Report of the National
Education System provided a comprehensive analysis of the needs and priorities in the
sector at the time, and was the basis for the development of CAR’s national education
strategy, as well as for the preparation of the Project. Background analysis on the gaps
and the needs of the sector—including the dearth of trained teachers, overcrowded


                                             7
classrooms, and overall underfinancing of the sector—provided the financing rationale
and justified the choice of Project-financed activities.          Furthermore, technical
assessments were conducted during the Project preparation phase on factors including
Government planning and monitoring capacity and context-specific constraints such as
security and infrastructure. At the time of preparation, the decision to focus Project
resources on school construction was valid because of the high pupil-to-classroom ratios
and projected rapid increases in the demand for education. Similarly, providing a
package of interventions around teacher recruitment, training and integration into the
basic education system was relevant in a system in which the lack of teachers engendered
two types of problems: (i) a very high pupil-to-teacher ratio; and (ii) the recruitment by
families of community-based teachers with low levels of academic training and little to
no professional training. The CAR budget constraints in education also justified Project
interventions to finance lower-cost contract teachers (as compared to civil servants).

26.    Government commitment. Strong Government commitment beginning at the
Project preparation stage led to the establishment of a national education strategy
recognized as credible by the local development partner community. The Project drew
heavily on this strategy in the selection of activities for implementation. At the
preparation phase, Government ownership was apparent through the active and multi-
stakeholder nature of the Project preparation team, leading to a project design that had the
buy-in of key Government actors at the central level, facilitating the implementation
phase and achievement of outcomes.

27.      Stakeholder participation and consultation. Despite strong central level
ownership, Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) mission discussions
with actors at multiple levels of the teacher program implementation chain reported no
input into the design or adaptation of the component during preparation, and an overall
lack of information on the Project and its objectives and plans throughout implementation.
More stakeholder involvement and MoE consultation, in particular, with the full
pedagogic support chain with respect to teacher activities (ENI and CPR staff, inspectors,
school directors, etc.) could have further improved ownership by actors at these levels
critical for the successful establishment of a new training program, thereby further
facilitating achievement of outcomes.

Design

28.     Objectives and results chain. Project objectives were clear, as was the rationale
for the activities selected for financing. Activities were also appropriate in terms of their
likelihood of contributing to the achievement of the PDO, as further detailed in Section
3.2. In terms of access, the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms, including
latrines and wells, can be expected to contribute to improve the education system’s
capacity and to those conditions that will facilitate student attendance. In terms of quality,
teacher training combined with the provision of mathematics and reading textbooks can
also be expected to contribute to improved student learning. However, the results
indicators linking Project-supported inputs to expected outputs and outcomes could have
been improved (as further detailed in Section 2.3), as they did not specifically capture the



                                              8
outcomes which could be clearly attributed to the interventions supported under the
Project. However, the intermediate-level indicators were sound and strongly aligned with
project-support activities and provide valuable data to evaluate progress towards
achievement of the project development objectives.

29.      Conceptual and implementation framework. The Project was generally well
tailored to in-country implementation and absorption capacity, notably through the
establishment of a “classic”, well-tested education project design (school construction,
teacher training, provision of teaching and learning materials); and the establishment of
simple implementation arrangements. The limited scope of components and limited
number of activities to be implemented were sensible choices given the relative lack of
experience of the MoE in implementing Bank-supervised funds, and given that new
institutional arrangements were being established and used to coordinate implementation.
In addition, an approach using delegated project management agreements to manage and
supervise civil works proved important in complementing Government capacity. Project
design also appropriately called for locally-based technical assistance to reinforce
capacity on civil works monitoring.

30.     Technical considerations: school infrastructure. From a technical standpoint,
an important design element was not included with respect to the school infrastructure
component, leading to cost inefficiencies: technical water studies to identify the presence
of water and its depth as well as pollution levels. Contingencies and funds for alternative
approaches for the construction of the wells in schools were also not planned. These
design omissions led to: (i) construction of wells on school sites where there were water
pollution risks; and (ii) the cancellation of construction of 65 percent of the wells built
after digging had begun, for various reasons that likely would have been identified by
water studies. Given that research shows that access to clean water in schools facilitates
access to school by promoting improved student health and attendance in school, the
achievement of Project objectives in relation to access could likely have been enhanced
had wells been built in all schools.

31.     The Project also made a strategic decision to adopt a lower-cost school
architectural design in order to maximize the number of classrooms that could be built.
However, a technical audit during implementation revealed that the choice may have
gone too far in the direction of reducing costs (including notably in the technical
specifications for building materials), leading to negative impacts in terms of the
durability and quality of schools built. For instance, the choice of a low-cost clay brick as
a building material is expected to result in accelerated wear of the bricks, with an audit in
2012 estimating that higher quality bricks would have: (i) been more cost effective given
the losses (20 percent) due to triage of low quality bricks; (ii) resulted in greater ease of
execution; and (iii) would not require a protective coating, which is recommended
(though in this case not executed) for lower quality bricks, but can increase by about 70
percent the costs of the surfaces to which it is applied. Technical details such as
clearer/more detailed architectural plans for construction would have also facilitated high
quality execution of construction works.




                                             9
32.     Technical considerations: teacher training. With respect to interventions to
support teachers, the development of a new teacher training approach allowing lower-cost,
contract teachers to be available sooner in the system—from their second year of training,
under supervision—was well tailored in terms of meeting the immediate need for
teachers in CAR. A training format whereby training courses occurred during periods
when schools were out of session, coupled with practical training/application in situ, are
recognized as effective. Furthermore, although the content matter of the training could
have benefited from a more practice-oriented and less theory-based curriculum, its focus
on academic reinforcement in fundamental disciplines and pedagogical and didactic
training, was a relevant choice for teachers without pre-service and in-service training.

33.     While the objective of simplicity drove Project design in the face of the low
capacity context, Project design would have been stronger had it: (i) included
interventions to train and support the entire chain of actors supervising and mentoring the
trained teachers, from school inspectors to pedagogic advisors and school directors
(rather than uniquely teacher trainers and the student-teachers themselves); and (ii)
aligned the training curriculum to a clear set of teacher competencies upon exit. Including
these aspects might have helped lay the foundations of a common culture of teaching and
classroom practices; strengthened the ability of these actors, who are best placed to
support, train and evaluate teachers; and helped ensure that newly developed teaching
practices could be sustained—all of which could have increased the likelihood of
successfully achieving objectives and maintaining gains, in terms of improved quality of
education. Finally, the preparation team faced a difficult choice with respect to the
sequencing of teacher training activities, and—in order to more quickly meet the needs of
the system—teacher training activities were implemented in parallel to the establishment
of a national education staff training strategy and revision of the teacher training
curriculum. On one hand, this choice was understandable given the significant need for
additional trained teachers. On the other hand, the chosen sequencing did not allow for
the training program to integrate the curriculum improvements, nor for the training
strategy to inform an approach for the construction and rehabilitation of teacher training
infrastructure under the Project. As a result, the training program was not fully adapted to
the sector context by Project closing.

34.     Innovative aspects. One important innovation introduced into the Project design
was the teacher payment system using private sector actors to reach those in more remote
or insecure areas with no established financial structures. While in theory the approach
was commendable, in practice, the combination of: (i) the fragile security situation; (ii)
high risks associated with non-bank entities operating payment networks in a fragile
context; and (iii) mistrust of the private sector in conducting business with a government
entity, led to the withdrawal of the Catholic Church distribution network and lack of
interest of petrol stations and mobile phone companies in the proposed teacher payment
system. In addition, interventions through other development partner financing which
would have facilitated implementation of this approach by promoting regional economic
development, did not have the impact expected. As a result, this innovation was not
implemented as planned: teachers continued to be paid through the formal banking
system, and difficulties persisted in paying salaries and student-teacher stipends in the



                                            10
aforementioned remote and insecure areas. It is possible that these difficulties reduced the
effectiveness of interventions to improve both access and quality, particularly if it
contributed to teacher absences.

35.     Risk assessment and mitigation. While the operating context was assessed as
high-risk, the Project was considered to have potentially substantial impacts on the CAR
education system. The grant represented 45 percent of total resources allocated to
primary education between 2009 and 2011, and was expected to cover more than a third
of the total resource gap for primary, pre-primary and literacy.

36.     At the country level, high and substantial risks were appropriately identified
related to the macroeconomic framework, the possibility that CAR would fall into arrears
resulting in the Bank’s disengagement, and the risk that the security situation would
deteriorate. This was particularly true given CAR’s instability in these areas. Mitigation
measures described to address these issues were based on existing frameworks and
mechanisms. For instance, fiscal prudence and inflows of donor funds were expected to
mitigate macroeconomic risk; and review of satisfactory implementation of the World
Bank’s CAR Interim Strategy Note, combined with continued World Bank dialogue and
support, were expected to mitigate the risk of disengagement with CAR. The security
situation was considered a substantial source of risk potentially affecting outcomes,
though one largely outside of the scope of the Project in terms of mitigation measures.

37.     At the sector level, low MoE institutional capacity was a relevant risk identified
which could potentially affect Project outcomes. As a mitigation measure,
implementation arrangements were tailored to capacity, and the Project provided capacity
strengthening, including by hiring an international specialist in project management who
provided implementation support and knowledge transfer over the long term.

38.     At the Project level, appropriate risks were also identified, while the mitigation
measures implemented were effective to varying degrees. Many risks (including, notably,
fiduciary risks) were appropriately mitigated in the design of the Project itself—for
instance, the delegation of the management of procurement processes by the Ministry of
Finance to the MoE. In relation to the technical Project design, risks to achieving
development outcomes were rightly identified as including relatively weak capacity of
non-governmental stakeholders for school construction, and the potential for delays in
developing adequate teacher training curricula. Mitigation measures focused on the
provision of technical assistance, which proved important to supporting implementation.
Weak implementation capacity of the MoE and other stakeholders was also identified as
a potential source of general delays during Project implementation.

39.     However, despite the mitigation measures in place—including (i) technical
assistance, (ii) establishing the MOD approach which aimed to delegate responsibilities
based on MOD implementation capacity, and (iii) the hiring of private suppliers (bureaux
d’études techniques) to provide technical studies and monitor activities—significant
delays materialized even prior to the political and security crisis, particularly with regards
to the school construction activities. These delays were likely, in part, a result of



                                             11
misalignment between MOD and implementation firm capacity and the level of
responsibilities delegated to them (given that this was the first time these firms had
worked under a MOD arrangement with the MoE). With respect to environmental and
social safeguards, while appropriate safeguards management tools were developed and
stakeholders trained on their application, the establishment of measures to mitigate
against the risk of inadequate supervision of safeguards implementation may have been
beneficial.

Quality at Entry

40.     Quality at Entry Rating: The Project design was underpinned by a
comprehensive analysis of sector needs and priorities, was well aligned with those sector
needs and with implementation capacity, benefited from strong Government commitment
at the preparation stage, and for the most part, identified relevant risks and mitigation
measures. However, the original design had a number of shortcomings that had a
negative impact on Project implementation and performance. Notably, technical studies
(including those related to water) which were necessary to properly inform the design and
implementation of the school infrastructure activities were not undertaken. Furthermore,
a low-cost school construction prototype was adopted, which limited the quality and
durability of schools built. The teacher training program would have benefited from
revised sequencing and the establishment of a holistic approach at the design stage
including an arrangement to train additional actors involved in the training of teacher
candidates. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design (described in Section 2.3) could
also have been strengthened. In addition, with respect to the analysis of the Project’s
expected efficiency (described in Section 3.3 and Annex 3), the Economic and Financial
analysis at appraisal omitted three dimensions: a cost-benefit analysis, the accompanying
sensitivity analysis, and the economic performance criteria. In light of the above, Quality
at Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

41.      Project implementation was characterized by two distinct periods separated by the
full-fledge resurgence of the political and security crisis in late December 2012. During
the first period, from Project effectiveness in June 2009 through December 2012, a
majority of activities were implemented, with Project disbursement reaching 93 percent
in December 2012. School construction encountered implementation delays but had
greatly picked up speed by 2012 and was nearing completion, and community and
contract teacher training was proceeding as planned, with multiple cohorts of teachers
having completed training. During this period, progress was observed against most
intermediate-level output indicators despite the delays in achieving school construction-
related targets. During this period, improvements were observed on a number of sector-
wide indicators, including those tracked by the Project. The second period of Project
implementation (January 2013 through closing), following the overthrow of the President
and Government that had been in office during Project preparation and implementation,
saw the Government’s ability to implement Project-financed activities and to monitor the
education system hampered. Project implementation slowed, though remaining planned
activities were implemented. The limited data available indicate a regression in education


                                            12
system indicators, while at the Project level, despite the significant challenges, the STP
continued to track Project-level outputs.

The Political and Security Crisis

42.     The political and security crisis during Project implementation. The conflict
began when rebels accused the government of President François Bozize of failing to
abide by peace agreements signed in 2007 and 2011; Seleka rebel forces subsequently
captured many major towns in the central and eastern regions of the country in December
2012. The ensuing conflict has been characterized by significant levels of violence
against civilians, often along ethno-religious lines, and large population displacements.
After an unsuccessful ceasefire agreement in January 2013, Seleka rebels overran CAR’s
capital and seized power in March 2013 in a coup d’état that was condemned
internationally. President Bozize fled, and in August 2013, coup leader Michel Djotodia
was sworn in as president. The insurrection in the capital, in particular, was associated
with a rapid deterioration of law and order, looting and targeted attacks, and the
temporary evacuation of international organizations.

43.    With turmoil continuing in the country in 2013, Djotodia resigned in January
2014, and Catherine Samba-Panza took over as interim leader. This government of
national unity faced and continues to face considerable challenges, including securing the
country, organizing elections, and restoring public services. In January 2015, the CAR
government rejected a ceasefire deal made in Kenya between two militia groups aimed at
ending more than a year of clashes. Presidential and parliamentary elections, initially
scheduled for February 2015, have been repeatedly delayed. Overall, the continued
crisis—ongoing at the time of the writing of the ICR—created a complex humanitarian
emergency, displacing over 25 percent the country’s population and causing a significant
economic contraction. In addition, it prompted a large-scale international response,
including peacekeeping intervention from the African Union, French, European Union
and United Nations (UN) forces as well as concomitant emergency relief by UN agencies
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

44.      Impact of the crisis on the education sector and Project implementation. The
crisis had a significant negative impact on the education system as a whole. In February
2014, an estimated 65 percent of CAR schools were closed. While this figure improved
in later months, even in schools that were open, functioning was reported to be frequently
irregular and dependent on security and the presence of teachers, who also faced
challenges affecting their ability or willingness to be present (insecurity, unpaid salaries).
Thirty-eight percent of schools assessed reported having suffered from at least one type
of attack such as looting, threats against personnel and occupation.

45.     At the Project level, effects included: an inability to disburse additional funds for
a period of 9 months; unquantified damages to Project-financed classrooms and teacher
training infrastructure; loss of materials, vehicles and equipment both at the STP and
Government agencies as well as at the school level; the interruption for several months of
the teacher training program for the final cohort in its last year of training (practical
application in the classroom); and the slowdown of school construction. From March


                                             13
2013 to December 2013, only minimal progress was possible on Project implementation
as a result of the crisis and the resulting hold put on Project disbursements. Furthermore,
the period after December 2012 is characterized by a severe lack of data both on the
status of the education system, and at the Project level; due to the security situation,
neither Project nor World Bank staff could visit Project sites and undertake
implementation support missions.

Capacity Constraints

46.    Capacity constraints at multiple levels also had an important impact on Project
implementation. While these constraints were exacerbated by the crisis due to the
departure from the country of a portion of its qualified human resources, they existed
during all stages of implementation and had an impact on key Project-financed activities,
including notably the civil works component. Overall, and as described below, higher
implementation firm capacity and improved MOD and STP supervision efficiency and
capacity, would likely have resulted in more timely and higher quality school
construction.

47.     Project Technical Unit capacity to manage the MOD approach. A lack of
prior MoE experience with the newly introduced MOD approach adopted under the
Project, and in particular with the fiduciary procedures it required, was a significant
source of delay for construction under the Project. Since the MoE did not have a
directorate responsible for procurement/fiduciary matters or sufficient staff with this
competency, the STP, a Project Technical Unit, was established under the authority of the
MoE. The STP was staffed by a combination of MoE civil servants responsible for the
sector-specific technical aspects, and Project-financed fiduciary and M&E consultants,
and was the primary entity responsible for Project implementation. The initial months of
operation of the STP required the newly appointed staff to become knowledgeable of
World Bank fiduciary procedures in relation to Project activities, which included having
to restart incorrectly executed procurement processes. Construction, therefore, began with
about one year of delays as a result of delays in the multiple procurement processes
required (for MODs, construction firms and technical studies consultants).

48.     MOD and construction firm capacity. The procurement-related delays were
compounded by delays incurred by construction firms once recruited. While the MOD
approach allowed for greater implementation capacity, the drawback was the limited
availability of entities with the capacity to take on this role, in particular for those areas
farther away from the capital. The two MODs (AGETIP and ACTED) selected were
both based in Bangui, and (in particular for one MOD) were physically removed from the
construction sites they were meant to supervise; this distance exacerbated weaknesses in
their monitoring, support and supervision of construction in areas outside of Bangui.
Indeed, according to the technical audit of the work of the MODs which was conducted
during project implementation in 2012, efficiency of M&E by the MODs needed
improvement: for one MOD, supervision was managed at the level of construction firm
contracts rather than by individual construction site; and for another, monitoring
instruments to collect data on construction progress (linked to the payment of the firms)



                                             14
contained only partial or incorrect data, or went unused, contributing to payment delays
to construction firms. In addition, the audit highlighted that the STP was insufficiently
involved in the supervision of MODs and construction progress. Moreover, the capacity
of construction firms recruited to build the education infrastructure was variable, and in
some cases, low. Additional delays, therefore, resulted from a lack of respect of
contractual timelines by some construction firms, which were not sanctioned for these
delays as called for by contractual clauses, either by the MODs or the Government.

49.     Local market capacity. Another major cause of implementation delays on the
infrastructure component was the capacity of local markets and, in particular, the
unpredictability of available supply of necessary construction materials. Due to the
dependency of CAR on imports of certain construction materials in some cases and to the
priority the country placed on exporting its raw materials rather than maintaining them
for internal consumption (such as wood) in other instances, shocks such as closures of the
border due to the conflict at times caused national shortages in necessary construction
materials. Further advanced planning and the purchase of selected raw materials at the
beginning of construction activities might have mitigated the delays due to unavailable
materials.

50.    Cost savings. The implementation delays requiring Project closing date
extensions, coupled with the inability of the Project to build the initial number of wells
planned, led to cost savings on the initial phase of construction and additional
implementation time which allowed for the Project to finance additional phases of school
construction and rehabilitation.

Government Commitment

51.      As with Project preparation, Government commitment and implementing agency
ownership played a determining role at all stages of implementation, and in particular, it
allowed the Project to successfully complete planned activities despite the very difficult
operating environment post-crisis. The combination of alignment of Project objectives
with sector priorities, clear and generally realistic outputs linked to main Project activities,
and the adequately staffed STP working within the MoE, contributed to an environment
which fostered continued Government and STP commitment during implementation. The
Government also supported an enabling environment for Project implementation during
the period of relative political stability from 2005 until the crisis, by steadily
implementing macroeconomic and structural reforms contributing to modestly increased,
but stable growth. It also established the agreed-upon implementation arrangements.
Evidence of the Government’s commitment includes its integration of Project-trained
teachers into the national budget as civil servants, an action which was key to ensuring
the intended impact on the system of having additional trained teachers. Throughout the
crisis, the STP also played a critical role in ensuring a minimum continuation of Project
activities, including by conducting some site visits during the period of conflict, and by
finding solutions to allow activities such as the teacher training to complete
implementation. It is likely that the continued Government and STP support mitigated
the regression seen (using the limited available data) in the Project outcomes.



                                              15
World Bank Implementation Support

52.     Responsive implementation and technical support, and periodic quality
assurance. A number of proactive actions by the World Bank team helped mitigate risks
during implementation. At the onset of the Project, in response to the difficulties with
procurement processes, the World Bank intervened rapidly through its Project team to
provide support with the processes for the hiring of MODs and the acquisition of
textbooks, playing an important role in eliminating confusion and bottlenecks in
implementation. With respect to textbooks, a factor of success in the timely distribution
of textbooks to schools was the early World Bank technical assistance, which helped the
MoE develop a strategy for the acquisition and distribution of school textbook and
teacher guides. In addition to technical assistance (built into the Project and provided by
the World Bank), the Project structure also allowed for periodic evaluations to determine
whether outputs were on track during implementation. Quality assurance audits, such as
the technical audit of school construction completed in 2012, highlighted best practices
and provided recommendations on areas of improvement to the Government on technical
aspects.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Rating: Modest

53.    M&E Design. The Project M&E results framework (RF) as outlined in the PAD
included indicators at multiple levels to track progress toward implementation and
expected outcomes: five Project-level outcome indicators, four intermediate-level
outcome indicators, and 17 output indicators. The RF described the purpose of each
outcome-level indicator, linking each back to the changes expected through the Project’s
interventions.

54.     The Project’s PDO-level indicators were well integrated into country systems in
their design, relying on existing instruments at the country level (the annual school
census) to measure progress toward objectives. Intermediate-level indicators were
tracked by the STP, and were robust in terms of measuring Project implementation
progress. For example, Component 1 intermediate-level indicators appropriately tracked
progress toward the achievement of Project outputs necessary to have an impact on
access to primary school: numbers of classrooms, latrine blocks, and wells built; and
Component 2 indicators tracked activities such as the numbers of additional community
and contract teachers being trained and number of textbooks distributed. The
intermediate-level indicators as established at appraisal were also comprehensive,
covering all key Project activities, which allowed for tracking progress on all aspects of
implementation. However, data collection methods for indicators were not specified in
Project documentation, nor was the method of calculation.

55.     Shortcomings in the design of the M&E indicators meant that PDO-level
indicators did not capture progress toward expected outcomes as linked specifically to the



                                            16
Project interventions. At the time of Project preparation, the use of sector-wide indicators
to track project outcomes was common practice, including in particular in EFA-FTI
projects; sector-wide indicators were thus used in the Project RF. Indeed, there were no
provisions in the M&E design allowing for the attribution of outcomes attained at the
sector level to Project interventions versus effects from shocks or other interventions in
the sector. As a result, it was more challenging to systematically track progress towards
the achievement of the envisioned outcomes of the operation. Although Project financing
represented 45 percent of resources allocated to primary education at the time, other
factors beyond the Project could and did impact the education system, and were reflected
in Project-level outcomes. Modifications to the PDO or the RF either prior to or during
the first Project restructuring, therefore, would have been beneficial. For instance, it
might have been useful to revise PDO-level indicator definitions and obtain additional
data to measure changes in access and quality specifically in Project-targeted regions, or
to adjust targets in line with expectations of changes in Project impacts given the
evolution of the GER from other interventions. In addition, the RF would have benefitted
from alternative or additional performance measures to better assess improvements in the
quality of primary education. While research has shown that providing textbooks to
students can have an impact on learning outcomes, no assessments were set up to track
student learning under the Project. Similarly, building instruments into the teacher
training program to assess teacher learning or to evaluate improvements in teaching
practices would have allowed the Project to speak to the level of qualification of the
newly trained teachers, helping show a likelihood of increased quality of instruction in
the CAR education system.

56.     Implementation & utilization. Given a lack of documentation found on M&E
aspects of the Project, and that its M&E specialist was deceased in the months prior to the
ICR mission, limited information was available on the M&E system in place and its
implementation. Periodic site visits from the M&E specialist and other Project staff
provided data used to update the RF, and in particular the tracking of the intermediate-
level indicators. In coordination with other partner financing, the Project also provided
technical support as needed for MoE data analysis and the regular production of the
annual statistical yearbook following school census exercises. During the ICR mission,
the Government reported using data collected for the school census to inform the
deployment of new teachers, indicating that data produced and used to report on the
Project, were also used more broadly to inform decision making. With respect to M&E
reporting, not all output indicators were reported on in World Bank ISRs. There were also
differences in the end targets reported in World Bank and Government documentation.
In addition, end targets for certain indicators were revised at various times in World Bank
documentation, and one indicator was dropped from ISR reporting, without being
formally documented in restructurings over the course of the Project (see Annexes 2 and
10 for more details on indicators and their targets).

57.    The crisis also had a significant impact on M&E implementation: notably, due to
the security situation, no school census had occurred since the 2011-12 school year at the
time of writing of the ICR, meaning that system-wide outcome indicators were no longer
monitored. Furthermore, Project staff were generally unable to conduct regular site visits.



                                            17
Data on implementation therefore became spotty, relying heavily on reporting from
MODs on school construction. The Government also was unable to verify the status at
Project closing of schools built and materials equipment provided by the Project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Social and Environmental Safeguards Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

58.     Social and environmental safeguards. The Project was classified as an
environmental category B and the safeguards pre-screening indicated that OP/BP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment), OP/BP 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples) and OP/BP 4.12
(Involuntary Resettlement) were triggered. Environmental and social impacts under the
Project were expected to be relatively minor and localized because most construction was
on existing school sites to expand existing buildings or replace damaged buildings.

59.     The Project received a waiver during preparation allowing for the application of
selected provisions of the Bank’s safeguards to be completed as a condition of signature
of the grant, rather than at appraisal. Three safeguards instruments were developed and
disclosed by the MoE to assess and mitigate potential environmental and social impacts
of Project-financed civil works activities: an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF); an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF); and a
Framework for Involuntary Resettlement and Compensation (FIRC). The MoE ensured
documentation required by these instruments were included in civil works procurement
documents, safeguards training organized for MODs and replication by MODs for the
firms they recruited.

60.     MoE Project implementation progress reports did not report on compliance with
and execution of safeguards tools; however, most World Bank Implementation Status
reports reported satisfactory ratings and no particular issues until December 2014, when a
lack of accurate monitoring of the school civil works program was reported over the
remaining Project execution period. During the ICR mission, the MoE and both MODs
responsible for civil works reported full compliance with safeguards instruments both
pre- and during the crisis, with periodic supervision by the MoE on safeguards aspects.
One case of involuntary resettlement was identified in the 2012 World Bank-financed
technical audit of school construction. While the STP undertook some follow-up in the
field to help ensure proper application of social safeguards tools, no follow up was done
by the World Bank, and this case was not reported upon by the Project. No information
was available at the time of writing of the ICR to confirm full resolution of this case.
Given the gaps in reporting on these aspects at the Project level, closer monitoring of
safeguards implementation by the World Bank would have been beneficial.

Procurement Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Financial Management Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.    Procurement and financial management. With respect to procurement,
unfamiliarity of the MoE and MODs with the required World Bank procurement


                                           18
procedures—given that it was the first time a MOD approach was being implemented
under a World Bank-financed project in CAR—led to a delay in the selection and
contracting of civil works firms. In the initial months of implementation, difficulties
under the Project in terms of producing procurement documentation acceptable to the
World Bank also contributed to the delays; additionally, there were delays in the Project
establishing a viable procurement filing system. These issues were resolved through
close and extensive support by the World Bank Task Team which clarified procedures,
enabling the MoE to produce acceptable documentation. In addition, following the
departure of its procurement specialist—a resource on loan from CAR’s national
procurement department—the Project hired a part-time procurement specialist to provide
support in this area.

62.     The financial management (FM) institutional arrangements—with the STP
responsible for administrative aspects of FM as well as payments, and accounting and
disbursement aspects subcontracted to a local accounting firm—were adequate, as were
flow of funds arrangements. However, FM was a persistent challenge, with its
consistency and quality variable throughout the life of the Project. STP implementation
reports consistently identified the unfamiliarity of Project staff with the FM software
required by the World Bank as a source of difficulty. This likely also contributed to an
adverse opinion on the Project’s 2009 and 2010 audits. Issues of weak internal controls
and late payments to suppliers were recurrent. The crisis further exacerbated FM capacity
issues: Project archives were stolen, impacting the availability and regularity of FM
report production. To resolve these issues, additional support was provided: FM action
plans were developed by the Project and followed up by the World Bank. At the time of
writing of this ICR, there were still pending FM issues, including notably about FCFA
992,000 (approximately US$1,600) remaining to be justified/refunded to the Bank
following the withdrawal application deadline. There were no counterpart funds under the
Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

63.     Follow-on sector planning and operations. An updated CAR national education
strategy (Education Transitional Plan 2015-17) was prepared with the support of
development partners, and adopted by the Government following the crisis. The
Education Transitional Plan 2015-17 served as the basis for the preparation of an
application for a second grant from the GPE (Projet d’appui au relèvement du système
éducatif), for which UNICEF is the Managing Entity responsible for implementation.
Given the effects of the crisis on the education sector, the grant objectives are to support
the resumption of educational activities in CAR in order to regain by 2017 the pre-2013
quantitative and quality level of basic education status. Among expected results are
increased school enrollment and participation, a primary gross enrollment rate restored to
the level achieved in 2012, and a one-to-one student-textbook ratio achieved for reading
and math textbooks. In addition to financing institutional strengthening, the US$15.51
million grant resumes several of the main activities financed under the Project, including
notably school construction and rehabilitation, the provision of textbooks in primary
schools, training of community teachers using the model developed under the Project,



                                            19
and the training, recruitment and payment of contract teachers. UNICEF is working in
coordination with the STP as a key implementation partner, and at the time of the ICR
mission, was adapting the Project operational manual for the implementation this second
grant.

64.     Despite the change in implementation arrangements—from implementation by the
MoE under the Project, to implementation by UNICEF—some lessons learned from the
Project were explicitly taken into account in this new operation. For instance, with
respect to student-teacher stipends and teacher salary payments, while the same payment
arrangements as those under the Project were adopted for areas with access to
commercial bank networks, at the time of ICR writing, additional studies were expected
to be undertaken by UNICEF to determine the capacity of non-commercial bank
operators to ensure salary payments in difficult to access areas not covered by
commercial banks. Its results were expected to inform the institutional arrangements for
payments in those areas in which teachers did not receive regular payments under the
Project. With respect to teacher training, additional actors in the pedagogical chain were
trained under the new grant, to accompany teachers during their training period. In
addition, the World Bank continues to be active in the sector dialogue and is preparing a
country re-engagement strategy: a diagnostic of the impact of the crisis on education is
planned under the World Bank Country Engagement Note for FY2016-2017 for CAR,
which was under preparation at the time of the writing of the ICR and will inform future
interventions in the sector.

65.     Other development partner interventions. In addition to the second GPE grant,
information available on interventions planned by other development partners dating
from October 2014, indicated that there were two relatively significant additional external
financing sources expected or under implementation at the time of Project closing: a 21
million euro grant from the European Union (expected to be effective in 2015 for three
years) intended to, inter alia, rehabilitate at least 300 schools, provide institutional
strengthening to the MoE, and establish temporary schools and short term programs to
support schooling; and a US$11.5 million financing from UNICEF for the construction of
50 schools, which was implemented by the Japanese Cooperation from 2012-15.

66.     Challenges to sustaining reforms. In terms of other actions taken to sustain
reforms financed under the Project, it is unclear whether school construction works will
be maintained and operated, given the ongoing insecurity, and given that no structures or
funds were established for the physical and operational maintenance of the schools that
were built/rehabilitated. A second challenge will be maintaining the institutional capacity
strengthening provided during Project implementation, given the temporary nature of the
consultant contracts financed to staff the STP; the ICR mission observed the relatively
low level of staffing/human resources capacity of this entity following Project closing.
However, given Government financing of the salaries of the teachers trained under the
Project, the effects of this intervention are more likely to be sustained.

3. Assessment of Outcomes



                                            20
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

67.      Relevance of objectives. The objectives of the Project were highly relevant at the
time of approval, and continue to be highly relevant at the time of writing of the ICR, as
they support CAR’s stated key priority of achieving universal primary education, as
elucidated in its national education strategy. Project objectives were aligned with the
CAR PRSP 2008-10 which includes promotion of sustainable human development (by
facilitating access to basic services) as one if its four pillars, and with the joint World
Bank-African Development Bank Country Partnership Strategy for CAR being developed
at the time of appraisal. Objectives were and are aligned with the World Bank Education
Strategy 2020, which describes the World Bank’s commitment to helping countries reach
the education MDGs, while making a shift to focus in particular on improved learning.
Project objectives continue to be aligned with the World Bank Country Engagement Note
for FY2016-2017 for CAR. In addition, objectives continued to remain important with
the change in circumstances brought about by the crisis, which had a negative impact on
education access and was detrimental to basic inputs—teacher presence, learning
materials, etc.—needed to provide education services of quality. This alignment is
evident in the Project’s consistency with CAR’s current development priorities as
outlined in its Education Transitional Plan 2015-17, which prioritizes the re-
establishment of the primary education system. Finally, Project objectives are aligned
with the GPE Strategic Plan 2012-2015 priorities, which aim to support: an increase in
children’s learning; improved teacher effectiveness through their training; recruiting,
support and retention; and an increase in the volume of funding to education in GPE-
endorsed countries.

68.     Relevance of design & implementation. The rating for Project design and
implementation is modest across the Project life. The design was well adapted in terms
of the choice of Project activities, components and their consistency with Project
objectives, and implementation arrangements taking into account MoE capacity. Project-
supported activities which aimed to increase access and improve the quality of education
were and continue to be relevant in the CAR context today, as evidenced by the
substantial need for additional teachers and classrooms and low levels of learning
achievement. The Project financed well-established approaches to improving access
(school construction), supported by the provision of basic quality inputs (additional
trained teachers and teaching/learning materials), and also tried to introduce innovations
in teacher payment systems.

69.      However, the link between Project activities and expected final outcomes could
have been more robust, as expressed through its M&E RF (in particular for PDO-level
indicators, which made attributing achievements exclusively to project-supported
activities more challenging. Several technical aspects could have been improved during
the design stage or during implementation, including: clearer technical plans for

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

70.     Despite the conflict-affected context and the interruption of Project
implementation by the political and security crisis, and notwithstanding some challenges
associated with the identification, tracking and reporting on PDO-level indicators, the
majority of the intermediate-level indicators were able to properly document progress
towards achievement of the project objectives. Moreover, data on the relevance of
objectives and design and on the efficiency of the operation were also available at Project
closing. In light of this, sufficient evidence exists to rate the Project following the
established OPCS Guidelines.

71.     Tables 3-7 below display the evolution of progress against Project results
indicators over the course of implementation, and in particular: the annual progress
tracked up until the resurgence of the crisis, and the end-Project targets using the
available data, with a gap from 2013 to Project closing in March 2015. Despite a number
of Project extensions, indicator target values which had been established for 2011
remained unchanged throughout the life of the Project.

Part 1 of the PDO: improving access to better quality primary education

72.    Access. The first part of the PDO, linked to Component 1 of the Project, aimed to
improve access to primary education through the construction and rehabilitation of
primary school classrooms. PDO-level indicators measuring outcomes on access were: (i)
Gross enrollment in primary; and (ii) new entrants (non-repeaters) in Grade 1. It was
expected that the availability of new or usable classrooms (which had been previously
unusable) in a country with severely limited and overcrowded classrooms would allow
children, who had been previously unable to attend primary schools, to have access. The
progress made on Component 1 PDO-level indicators was positive during project
implementation, until the political and security crisis. Targets for both indicators were
surpassed at the time of the last school census in 2011-12, with primary GER at 88.3
percent and the number of new entrants (non-repeaters) in Grade 1 reaching 120,010.

73.     However, the construction of most classrooms was finished late in the 2011
calendar year meaning that students would have most likely only been able to use these
classrooms in the 2012-13 school year, after the start of the crisis and during a period for
which there are no data. Due to insecurity and other effects of the crisis – preventing a
school census from being undertaken – data were not available on any of these indicators
at the time of ICR writing to confirm whether end-of-Project targets were achieved by
Project closing. Other data on the status of the sector during the crisis, however, indicate
an overall regression in education system progress. Indeed, due to insecurity, a significant



                                            22
number of schools were closed, looted, or suffered attacks. It is, therefore, likely that
there was a regression during the crisis in the results achieved during Project
implementation. Project documentation does not report on the actual number of students
benefiting from the new and rehabilitated classrooms, the contribution of this increase in
classrooms to GER improvements, or the number of new entrants in grade 1 as a result of
schools built. Given the above, it is not possible to attribute improvements in primary
school access solely to Project interventions.

74.     In addition, while the Project represented 70 percent5 of support planned or under
implementation to education relative to other donors in October 2014, a number of
interventions were implemented at the same time in CAR, and potentially contributed to
improved basic education access. Funding from several donors to help re-establish social
services in education were being prepared or implemented in late 2014: light
rehabilitation of 250 schools and reparation of school furniture (GPE funding during the
crisis implemented by UNICEF), establishment of temporary learning establishments,
(OCHA funding implemented by the CAR Education Cluster), and construction of 50
schools (Japanese government though UNICEF funding). The second GPE grant
implemented by UNICEF was under preparation; and the European Union funding
planned to finance school rehabilitation, establish temporary schools, and organize “Back
to school” campaigns. These interventions may have contributed to a positive evolution
of primary GER and the number of new entrants in grade 1.

75.    With respect to intermediate-level indicators on access, the Project tracked the
number of classrooms built and rehabilitated, as well as the number of latrine blocks and
wells built. Due to delays in implementing school infrastructure, there was a lag in the
achievement of civil works outputs with respect to the planned schedule, and planned
end-of-Project targets were not met. Ninety-four percent of the number of classrooms, 75
percent of the number of latrine blocks, and 54 percent of the number of wells expected
were built. Fewer wells and latrine blocks than expected were built for several reasons,
including: (i) the omission of water studies meant that some school sites were unsuited to
have wells built as intended and with the budget allotted; construction of these wells was

which led to building on sites with different infrastructure needs than initially planned.

76.     Pupil-to-classroom ratio, an intermediate-level indicator measuring progress
toward Project outcomes, helped to track the effects of classroom construction and
rehabilitation (greater availability of classrooms). Similarly to the PDO-level indicators
on access, with the crisis, no data were available at the time of writing of the ICR to
confirm pupil-to-classroom ratio. This indicator is also subject to the same shortcomings
as the PDO-level indicators on access: the RF did not establish a clear results chain
conclusively linking improvements in pupil-to-classroom ratio to the Project intervention
versus other interventions being supported at the time to increase the number of
classrooms in CAR. While the ratio did substantially improve over the course of Project
implementation, these improvements were seen even prior to the availability of Project-
financed classrooms in 2012, indicating that factors exogenous to the Project were having
an impact on improvements in access to education.

Part 2 of the PDO: improving access to better quality primary education

77.     Quality. The second part of the PDO, linked to Project Component 2, aimed to
improve the quality of primary education, primarily through pre-service and in-service
teacher training and the provision of reading and mathematics textbooks to primary
schools nationwide. PDO-level indicators measuring outcomes on quality were: (i)
number of new entrants (non-repeaters) in Grade 6, which was intended to track
improvements in the progression of students within primary school; (ii) pupil-teacher
ratio, which was intended to decrease as additional teachers became available in the
education system; (iii) pupil-to-reading textbook ratio; and (iv) pupil-to-math textbook
ratio. The two pupil-to-textbook ratios were considered a proxy for measuring



                                                    24
improvements in the quality of education, given the research which shows that the
provision of textbooks often has a highly positive effect on student learning achievements.

78.     The evolution of Component 2 PDO-level indicators was also positive during the
Project implementation period. The Project achieved the end-of-Project target of reducing
the pupil-teacher ratio to 80, by increasing the number of trained teachers in the system.
With respect to the provision of textbooks, both end-of-Project targets tracking pupil-to-
reading and pupil-to-math textbooks were exceeded, at a ratio of 1.4 to 1, each. The
number of books purchased and distributed surpassed expectations, which helped reduce
the pupil-textbook ratio more significantly than envisaged. However, with respect to the
number of new entrants in Grade 6, as with the PDO-level indicators tracking access-
related outcomes, data were not available on this indicator at the time of ICR writing to
confirm whether the end-of-Project target was achieved at closing. However, the number
of new entrants in Grade 6 reached 50,280 as of 2011-2012, surpassing the end target at
this time. It is likely that, similarly to Component 1 PDO-level indicators, given the
overall regression in education system progress post-crisis, achievement in terms of the
number of new entrants in Grade 6 was also negatively affected.

79.      There is established research showing that training teachers, as a factor in and of
itself, has no proven effect on education quality. Therefore, a simple increase in the
number of trained teachers in the system, as measured by the first PDO-level indicator on
quality, may not have had a positive impact on education quality. Including additional
indicators or other instruments which measure improved skills/higher level of
competency and teacher practices of the newly trained teachers, or teacher or student
learning outcomes, would have allowed for a better assessment of the teacher training
intervention’s impact on quality. On the other hand, provision of textbooks (and in
particular, of reading textbooks) has been shown to have a highly positive effect on
learning achievements. Therefore, taken together, the increase in trained teachers and


                                            25
reduction in the pupil-to-textbook ratio can be seen as contributing to improved education
quality in CAR.

80.     A limited number of partner-financed interventions was also expected to
potentially contribute to the prevention of a decline in education quality: training on
education in emergency situations and the provision of schooling materials (UN Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs financing), and implementation of remedial
classes (GPE financing during the crisis implemented by UNICEF).

81.      With respect to intermediate-level indicators on quality, the Project tracked 12
indicators, five of which met or surpassed expected target values. Four additional
indicators met or surpassed expected targets prior to the full-fledged onset of the crisis in
December 2012, but no data was available at Project closing to confirm their status.
Community and contract teacher training proceeded on time and as planned until the
crisis, when training activities for the final cohort of contract teachers in its last year of
training (practical application) was interrupted. By this time, 365 community teachers
had already completed training (41 percent of the expected total), as well as the first two
cohorts of contract teachers. Therefore, although effects on the teacher training in
progress was significant, given that the sub-component had nearly finished its
implementation and that the MoE found solutions to allow the affected students to finish
their training despite the security situation, the relative impact on teacher training
activities was moderate. At closing, the Project had trained more teachers in total than
anticipated (2,765, rather than the 2,550 expected).

82.    Under the teacher training sub-component, the following was expected: four new
CPRs were to be built, and four ENIs rehabilitated to receive community-based teachers
and teacher candidates under improved conditions; training of teacher trainers was to be
provided; new teacher training curricula developed; teacher materials provided to existing
and new teacher training facilities; and regional inspectorates and local districts were to
receive additional means to manage student teachers and contract teachers.

83.     These activities were completed, with targets surpassed in some cases: five CPRs
were built instead of four, and four additional CPRs (rather than ENIs) were rehabilitated.
However, at the time of ICR writing, the data were not available to confirm whether the
buildings built or rehabilitated had been damaged during the crisis, or whether the Project
investments stood intact at Project closing. The shift from ENIs to CPRs did not have a
substantial impact on the results, given that both institutions were equipped to train
student-teachers. The teacher training curriculum was also revised as planned under the
Project. Finally, more than twice the number of math and reading textbooks planned was
provided under the Project, allowing it to reach more beneficiaries, and with acquisition
and delivery occurring in a timely manner during the first year of implementation. Fewer
teachers’ guides than planned, however, were acquired and distributed.

84.     Component 3 outputs. There were no PDO-level Component 3 indicators. At the
output level, the Project tracked only one indicator in the ISRs in the early life of the
Project. This output-level indicator, “Successful achievement of annual output indicators”,
was identified in the PAD as an indicator of implementation capacity. Given a lack of
information on this indicator, it is not possible to make a judgment about its attainment.
Four other indicators were tracked by the Government but not reported on by the World
Bank, namely: (i) Number of contract teachers paid through the Project by the end of the
calendar year; (ii) Number of engineers contracted to the URCES; (iii) STP offices
constructed and equipped; and (iv) Financial and procurement audits executed. Despite
the difficulties in reaching teachers in difficult to access and insecure regions, more
teachers than expected were ultimately paid under the Project. As planned, to support
local implementation capacity, 13 engineers (81 percent of the number planned) were
contracted to regional construction units. However, it is not clear whether these engineers
were retained through Project closing, as data on this indicator are only reported until the
2010-2011 school year. Financial audits were executed annually, although procurement
audits were not undertaken. Finally, the STP office building was constructed and
equipped, although it was subsequently damaged in looting during the crisis, and had to
be repaired/re-equipped.

Overall achievement of the PDO

85.     Achievement of the PDO is rated Modest. The difficult context, coupled with the
challenges associated with M&E design and implementation, made it difficult to
systematically track progress towards the PDO. With respect to access although the
majority of classrooms, three-quarters of latrine blocks, and about half of the number of
wells planned were built, the infrastructure would have only begun to be used by students
after the start of the crisis and during a period for which there are no data on GER and
student entry into grade 1. Even if data had been available, the challenges with M&E
also prevented the implementation team from confidently providing a logical link
between the observed trends and the specific activities which were supported under the
Project. Given the lack of data and the M&E shortcomings, it not possible to attribute to
Project interventions improvements in primary education access—the component of the
Project which received 49 percent of funds (at appraisal).

86.     However, the Project appears to have achieved outcomes on primary education
quality, to which 22 percent of funds were allocated: although data were not available to
track improvements in the progression of students within primary school as a result of
Project interventions, Project financing allowed for a greater number of trained teachers
in the system, improving the pupil-teacher ratio. The number of reading and math books
provided to school children surpassed expectations, which helped reduce the pupil-
textbook ratio. In addition, there were relatively few other interventions known to have
been implemented to improve education quality, making sector-level outcomes more
easily attributable to the Project.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Modest

87.     This section provides an overview of the efficiency of the Project in terms of
external efficiency and cost effectiveness. This analysis is structured differently than the
analysis conducted at Project appraisal, which was based on the World Bank’s Ten
Dimensions of Economic Analysis for capturing the necessary information for sound
economic analysis for the Project. A summary of the analysis conducted at the appraisal
stage can be found in Annex 3.

88.     The Economic and Financial analysis at appraisal did not address three
dimensions: the cost-benefit analysis, the accompanying sensitivity analysis, and the
economic performance criteria were entirely omitted at Project appraisal, without
justification or substitution with a qualitative assessment. Unfortunately, the external
efficiency section of the present analysis is also devoid of a cost-benefit analysis of the
Project interventions. Efforts to build a cost-benefit analysis model from the ground up at



                                            29
the closing stage were ultimately constrained by the lack of data on returns to education
for CAR and the erratic records of spending allocations, which compounded to make this
analysis impractical and its expected results overly inaccurate. Instead of a cost-benefit
analysis, the external efficiency of the Project is justified based on an in-depth analysis of
the education sector in CAR conducted by the World Bank in 2008, namely the Country
Status Report (CSR) of the National Education System.

89.    External efficiency. An analysis of external efficiency of the CAR education
system in 2008 revealed




90.


                                            Therefore, from both the economic and social
perspectives, the analyses clearly highlight the necessity of investing in basic primary
education. Together, they support the notion that the Project, by focusing its resources on
improving the accessibility and quality of primary education in CAR, has helped to
maximize the economic and social benefits that the country can gain from its investments
in education.

91.     Cost effectiveness. School construction costs under the Project compare
favorably with respect to the costs of similar construction works implemented recently by
one other development partner in CAR who was able to produce comparable unit costs.
The combined unit cost of constructing a classroom under the Project from 2009 until
2012 was US$18,045 6 . In comparison, UNICEF, who had a school construction
component in their project from 2012 to 2015, had unit costs of US$20,437 (adjusting for
inflation).

 Calculated using an average exchange rate over the period of disbursement, and the cumulative amount in
FCFA spent as of 2012. Details on the elements included in the cost per classroom can be found in Annex 3.


                                                   30
92.      The provision of textbooks under the Project was relatively cost-effective in
comparison with other development partners who also financed textbook provision in
CAR in recent years. In 2010, the Project sourced textbooks at an average unit cost of
1.26 euros (US$1.83), which included shipping to schools. In 2015, in the context of the
implementation of the second grant from the GPE, UNICEF sourced textbooks at a unit
cost of 1.94 euros (US$2.23), with delivery limited to Bangui. Even after adjusting for
inflation, the cost of the Project textbooks were 48 percent lower than the textbooks
procured under the UNICEF project, despite the inclusion of a more extensive delivery
service. Both of these costs, however, are relatively high in comparison with the unit
costs from other conflict or post-conflict African countries where data was available
(Democratic Republic of Congo – US$1.327, Sierra Leone8 where the unit cost ranged
from US$0.97 to US$1.66, and Niger 9 where unit costs ranged from US$1.10 to
US$1.40).

93.     Since the advent of the Fast Track initiative indicative framework in 2004, which
set a benchmark for the average annual teacher salary as a multiple of per capita GDP,
the cost-effectiveness of teacher salaries has largely been assessed using this metric. The
benchmark, set at 3.5 units of GDP per capita, corresponds to the average teacher salary
registered in low-income countries with the best performance with regard to primary
completion10. The CSR was critical of the relatively high civil servant teachers’ salaries
in CAR, sitting at 7 units of GDP per capita for primary, with respect to other low-
income countries in Africa. In the context of the Project, the elected salary of contract
teachers corresponded to 3.4 units of GDP, allowing for the recruitment of a larger
number of contract teachers and an effective improvement in student-teacher ratio.

94.     The three Project sub-components evaluated together account for 64.3 percent of
the Project spending at closing: 25.4 percent for new school construction, 6.4 percent for
textbooks, and 32.5 percent for teacher salaries. Other subcomponents, such as school
rehabilitation and teacher training, were not included because of their context specificity
or the difficulty of finding comparable unit costs. Based on this analysis, two thirds of the
Project spending was spent on least-cost solutions, at least in terms of intra-country
comparisons. It should be noted that due to gaps in detailed data, the economic analysis
could not be divided into cost-effectiveness performance pre- and post-restructuring, or
pre- and post-crisis. The project components, budget and implementation arrangements
were not changed significantly as a result of these internal or external events, therefore
the project cost-effectiveness was not notably affected.

95.    Efficiency of implementation. Several implementation challenges had a
detrimental effect on the efficiency of the Project. The most noteworthy of these are the
construction implementation delays and the political and security crisis, which resulted in

damages to Project-financed investments (STP and beneficiary equipment looted, STP
Project archives stolen, damaged infrastructure, as well as the interruption of Project-
financed activities). These setbacks demanded additional time and effort for
implementation to return to its planned course, contributing to an implementation time
frame of six years (interrupted during the conflict) instead of three years. On the
construction front, the failure to conduct water studies eventually led to the cancellation
of the construction of wells at 67 school sites after digging had begun, resulting in wasted
resources. The acquisition of a greater number of textbooks than the sector needed led to
a surplus of unused textbooks in storage, financed by the Project. Poor quality of
construction materials in the technical specifications of the school buildings, according to
the technical expert evaluating the school construction progress, resulted in increased cost,
effort and time required for construction, while compromising the expected durability of
the building. No specific data on costs was available on these inefficiencies at the time of
ICR writing.

96.    In summary, Project efficiency is rated Modest for several reasons. (i) The, by
helping to

                                             two thirds of Project spending was spent on
least-cost solutions, with school construction and textbooks relatively cost-effective in
terms of intra-country comparisons, and contract teacher salaries cost-effective relative to
an international benchmark. (iii) However, unit costs of textbooks were relatively high in
comparison with the unit costs from other conflict or post-conflict African countries; and
the Project’s design shortcomings and implementation challenges (technical
shortcomings, implementation delays pre-crisis, and the effects of the crisis) reduced the
efficiency of implementation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

97.     The overall outcome rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory in light of the
shortcomings under the Project. A brief overview of these shortcomings and their
respective ratings is provided below; assessed together, they had a negative impact on
achievement of Project objectives, efficiency, and relevance.

      In supporting CAR’s national education strategy and PRSP, Project objectives
       were and continue to be highly relevant with respect to both the Government and
       the World Bank’s priorities. However, shortcomings in: (i) the linkage between
       Project activities and the M&E framework used to measure their impacts, which
       were not corrected during implementation; and (ii) technical designs of key
       components, led to design and implementation which did not fully meet the
       timeliness and quality standards planned.
      Achievement of the PDO was modest, due to shortcomings in the Project M&E
       framework which did not allow for attribution of any improvements that occurred
       in education access—the component representing nearly half of Project
       financing—to the Project . Compounding this challenge, the lack of data caused
       by the crisis did not allow for the measurement of GER or new entrants in the


                                            32
          education system. These indicators, however, are necessary to calculate
          improvements in access in the CAR education system.
         The Project design was economically justified in terms of external efficiency.
          However, Project interventions—in particular, school construction, provision of
          textbooks, and teacher payments—were modestly cost-effective, in comparison to
          other development partner-financed interventions in CAR and similar
          interventions in other African countries. In addition, inefficiencies in Project
          implementation, linked to the shortcomings in Project design and in gaps in the
          implementation of civil works, resulted in increased cost, effort and time.
          Together, these factors result in a modest level of efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

98.    As one of the poorest countries in the world, with projected poverty rate of 56.8
percent in 2014, even an intervention not specifically targeted to the poorest is likely to
have a poverty reduction impact. While specific data are not available on the Project’s
poverty reduction impact11, the ICR mission confirmed that, as planned, schools were
built and teachers were deployed to larger cities as well as more remote and more
insecure and difficult to access areas, which are more likely to contain the poorest of the
poor.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

99.     Institutional capacity was a concern during all stages of the Project, with the
objective of strengthening Government capacity to manage the education system.
Leveraging the high level of Government commitment and ownership during preparation
and implementation, the Project allowed for the MoE to lead and implement, using their
technical staff and with expert support, some key activities requiring technical expertise
in specific education sub-areas. Notably, the MoE undertook the development of a
national teacher training strategy, and the revision of the teacher training curriculum,


11
   A targeting mechanism for school construction based on criteria including poverty index, gross
enrollment rate, student-to-classroom ratio, and gender parity in the CAR regions eligible for intervention
was developed with support from a World Bank-financed consultant during Project implementation.
However, no confirmation could be obtained at the time of ICR writing that the mechanism was applied in
the identification of sites for school construction.


                                                    33
which were reviewed and supported by technical assistance under the Project and
subsequently adopted by the Government. In addition, a long-term international technical
assistant on Project management, based at the STP, was provided using Project funds.
This technical assistant provided advice, guidance and knowledge transfer to the MoE
and STP on an as-needed basis on all aspects of implementation. Also, the local
accounting firm hired to support the Project’s financial management also had as a part of
its mandate a role of knowledge transfer, which helped to strengthen the capacity of
Project staff on financial management. This approach likely contributed to strengthening
of MoE and Project staff competencies in these technical areas.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

100. Despite the crisis, as the first Project of its scale implemented by the MoE and
which invested in strengthening its capacity, the Project served a catalytic role in the
sector, not only in terms of mobilizing the Government around the implementation of its
strategy, but also with a demonstration effect encouraging other development partner re-
engagement in the sector following previous periods of conflict.

101. In addition, anecdotal information from the ICR mission indicates that the school
construction activities supported under the Project had an impact on the state of the
country’s construction firms. As a large-scale construction intervention in relation to the
size of the country’s existing network of educational infrastructure, implementation of
this component deployed construction firms in most regions of the country to meet the
need to build the classrooms in the time frame needed. The construction contracts to
firms were a “make-or-break” opportunity for many small construction firms. Those
firms successful in implementing the requested program were able to obtain additional
contracts with the cost savings during the three phases of construction under the Project,
allowing some firms to grow; those who could not successfully implement their contract
were substituted by others, and in some cases saw their business not survive.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

There were no beneficiary surveys or stakeholder workshops.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

102. The most substantial sources of risk to maintaining the Project’s intended
development outcomes of improved access to and quality of primary education, come
from the fragile, high-risk operating context at the country level. Despite appropriate
mitigation measures in place, potential risks to the operation identified at the appraisal
stage materialized during Project implementation and affected Project development
outcomes. These include namely risks in relation to the macroeconomic framework, the
World Bank’s engagement with the country, and the security situation. There is a high




                                            34
likelihood of these factors continuing to pose a significant threat to maintaining Project
outcomes. The most significant risks to development outcome are described below.

103. Stability of the macroeconomic framework. The crisis interrupted a period of
relatively stable economic growth being experienced in CAR, and led to an economic
downturn which put pressure on public finances. Domestic revenues dropped from 11.5
to 4.9 percent of GDP between 2012 and 2014. The payment of civil service wages and
pensions, suspended for most of 2013, resumed on a regular basis in early 2014 only due
to large-scale donor re-engagement—notably through foreign aid constituting more than
13 percent of GDP. Public finances remained under pressure in 2015. With the crisis still
underway at the time of writing of the ICR, there is a continued high risk of economic
instability and dependency on external aid to pay civil servant and contract teacher
salaries.

104. Level of engagement from development partners. Compounding the risk of the
Government’s inability to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework, there is a risk of
disengagement or reduced engagement from development partners in education. During
Project implementation and at the time of writing of the ICR, development partner
financing served as a mitigating factor preventing the full-blown negative impact from
fiscal slippages. For instance, following the effects of the crisis on the education sector,
the GPE provided in November 2013, 20 percent of its allocation of funds available for
CAR (US$3.69 million), which was managed by UNICEF, and financed emergency
education services for displaced children. If, however, key partners reduce their levels of
financing or disengage from the CAR education sector—both of which are possibilities
given the continued possibility of political instability and political transitions not
recognized by the international community—the effects would be highly detrimental to
the Government’s ability to, inter alia, finance teacher salaries. Such a change could
reduce or negate positive impacts of the Project on primary education access and quality.

105. Security situation. The unstable security situation has had and may continue to
have far-reaching effects on CAR’s education sector, leading to, for instance: the closing
of schools in insecure areas; and the departure of qualified teachers and Government civil
servants from the country, thereby further diminishing the country’s institutional capacity.
The security factor therefore constitutes a substantial risk which already manifested
during implementation, and for which mitigation measures are beyond the control of the
World Bank. High insecurity also aggravates the Government’s inability to pay the
salaries of certain teachers with more difficult access to the formal banking system, given
the lack of established and secure mechanisms to ensure teacher payment in remote and
insecure areas.

106. Follow-on GPE financing. There is, however, an important factor contributing to
the attainment of Project-financed outcomes: the implementation of the second GPE
grant, which carries forward many of the main activities financed under the Project, while
pulling from its lessons learned. Notably, this grant ensures continued payment of
contract teachers, as well as construction and rehabilitation of primary schools and the
provision of textbooks, while maintaining contingencies for the implementation of



                                            35
emergency educational activities for displaced children, in the event that the security
situation does not allow for full implementation of the previously mentioned activities.
This approach is likely to help preserve education system outcomes, mitigating the risk to
development outcome.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

107. The World Bank supported the preparation of a Project that was highly relevant to
national priorities and based on: (i) a comprehensive analysis of the needs and financing
gaps of the sector, leading to a Project concept that was economically justified, that
aimed to address misalignment in the CAR education system, and that was likely to help
improve external efficiency of the system; (ii) a national education strategy endorsed by
sector development partners; and (iii) a simple technical education Project design that had
proved successful in other contexts. Given that the Project was to be implemented in a
difficult and high-risk operating environment, particular attention was rightly paid to
simplicity of technical design, and the establishment of adapted implementation
arrangements tailored to existing capacity and intended to mitigate fiduciary risk. The
approach of building Government capacity through providing equipment, training and
technical assistance, while supplementing capacity where necessary (through MODs and
the STP) helped to ensure Project outputs could be produced in the time envisaged. These
aspects contributed to the achievement of some Project outcomes.

108. However, despite the challenging operating context, some significant
shortcomings within the control of the World Bank affected the Project’s quality at entry.
Most notably, the World Bank could have been more effective in supporting the
Government at the design stage in the introduction of technical elements critical to
properly and efficiently implementing key Project-financed activities and attaining
Project outcomes. Indeed, the inclusion of water studies and/or contingency plans in the
technical design of the civil works component would have helped ensure efficient use of
the funds allocated to schools for construction of wells, reduced the risk of beneficiaries
being exposed to polluted water, and facilitated access to schools; while the use of an
architectural prototype with higher-cost, higher-quality specifications would have helped
enhance the quality and durability of schools built. With respect to teacher training
activities, providing training to additional actors meant to supervise and mentor teachers,
aligning the training curriculum to a clear set of teacher competencies upon exit, and
allowing for curriculum improvements to inform the teacher training program would
have resulted in a more sustainable training program better adapted to the needs of the
system. Although the World Bank adopted an approach to M&E that was common
practice at the time, the selection of PDO-level indicators and metrics to measure and
accurately attribute the impact of the Project on access and quality in the sector would



                                            36
have also facilitated the measurability of the Project’s interventions. With respect to the
analysis of the Project’s expected efficiency, the Economic and Financial analysis at
appraisal would have benefited from a qualitative assessment in lieu of the omitted cost-
benefit analysis and economic performance criteria.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

109. World Bank supervision of the Project was relatively proactive with respect to the
provision of local and international technical assistance to improve planning, reporting
and operating capacity, thereby supporting the establishment of a foundation of
competencies needed to maximize the Project’s development impact. In addition, it used
an iterative supervision process whereby regular communication and supervision
missions (pre-conflict) evaluated the Government’s implementation progress, level of
engagement on particular issues, and data on the evolution of the sector. This process
informed World Bank decisions on next steps needed in terms of implementation support,
and led to tailored recommendations adapted to the needs of the sector at a particular time.
The World Bank’s sustained dialogue with the Government also led to the national
budget taking over the majority of student-teacher stipends and teacher salaries covered
under the Project, supporting a transition toward the sustainability of interventions post-
Project. Furthermore, in coordination with other development partners, the Bank was
active in supporting the development of the Education Transitional Plan 2015-17 adopted
during the crisis, and in providing lessons for the preparation of the second grant from the
GPE made available to the Government.

110. The political and security crisis—a major factor beyond the control of the World
Bank—had a significant impact on the quality of Project supervision. The ability of the
World Bank to hold supervision missions was severely constrained in the months
following the crisis, although Government-Bank communications were maintained
remotely. The Bank showed responsiveness and flexibility in its sector-level engagement
during the crisis in the face of an extremely difficult operating context, including a lack
of information on the situation on the ground and its impacts on the sector, Project, MoE
and STP. Its approach of maintaining a presence in the sector, and of evaluating Bank-
supervised CAR projects on a case-by-case basis to determine their readiness to resume
disbursement during the crisis, helped minimize the length of implementation
interruptions for this Project. The timely closing date extensions also allowed for
sufficient time to complete implementation.

111. Irrespective of the conflict situation, some aspects of World Bank supervision
could have been improved. Notably, an audit earlier during Project implementation of the
civil works component may have improved Project efficiency by identifying sufficiently
early technical omissions and improvements needed; holding this audit earlier could have
allowed for the incorporation of recommendations in the second and third phases of
construction. Cost reallocations could have been undertaken to support these changes in
an earlier Project restructuring. With respect to teacher training, the choice to focus on



                                            37
training teachers rather than the full pedagogical chain was driven by the desire to
maintain the design and implementation simplicity of the Project, as this was perceived as
the best way for it to achieve the most immediate impact in the face of the important gaps
in trained teachers. In addition, with the full-fledged onset of the crisis, the focus turned
to managing the short-term effects of the crisis rather than assuring the longer-term
benefits that may have been gained by aligning the training program to the revised
curriculum.

112. Proactive restructuring to improve the Project’s M&E framework would have also
been beneficial for the assessment and attribution of Project outcomes; however, the
prevailing theory at the time favored sector-wide coordination including through the use
of sector-wide indicators. Still, end-of-project targets were not adjusted despite the
various restructuring and extensions of the Project’s closing date. In addition, closer
monitoring of safeguards by the World Bank during implementation may have been
beneficial, given gaps in reporting on these aspects at the Project level and the case of
resettlement identified by the technical audit which was not followed by the World Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

113. The rating for World Bank performance is Moderately Unsatisfactory, based on
its moderately unsatisfactory performance in ensuring quality at entry of the operation; its
moderately satisfactory performance in supporting effective implementation through
appropriate supervision; and the moderately unsatisfactory Project overall outcome rating.




                                             38
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

114. The Government, represented by the Ministry of Planning, Economy, and
International Cooperation, was active in demonstrating its commitment to achieving and
maintaining Project development objectives at all stages of preparation and
implementation. It supported an enabling environment during the period of relative
political stability from 2005 until the crisis, and established the agreed-on implementation
arrangements. During implementation, the Government provided support to the Project
and contributed to the sustainability of its interventions by taking the measures needed to
finance student-teacher stipends and most teacher salaries previously covered under the
Project. Finally, the Government generally complied with legal covenants, except for
those regarding financial audits, which it had difficulties in fully complying with due to
capacity issues. Once the crisis began—an exogenous event which was outside of the
Government’s control—the Government was no longer able to maintain the stability (in
particular with the macro and security environments) needed to maintain the basic
functioning and outcomes of the education system. However, its continued commitment
to the Project was evidenced in its continued support of the implementing agency as these
entities continued to function, and to the extent possible, achieved the outputs envisioned
under this operation.

115. The Project would have benefited, however, from closer monitoring and a candid
assessment by the Government of the Project, including its technical and M&E aspects,
in particular pre-crisis. Putting in place additional measures to keep the implementing
agency, MODs and service providers accountable for the timely delivery of results—for
instance, through closer follow up by the Project steering committee—may also have
improved Project outcomes.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

116. The Project implementing agency was the MoE, supported by the STP. A number
of issues beyond implementing agency control affected its performance. Capacity
constraints—an existing characteristic of the fragile context which both the World Bank
and the Government aimed to mitigate during Project preparation and implementation—
played an important role in creating delays and limiting direct supervision of civil works
by the MoE and STP. These constraints negatively impacted the Project’s achievements
(in particular the quality and efficiency of civil works). In addition, the crisis
unquestionably had an adverse impact on implementing agency performance, aggravating
capacity issues, including through the loss of staff, data and equipment needed for
monitoring and implementing the Project.




                                            39
117. As with World Bank performance, some aspects in relation to Project preparation
and implementation were within the control of the MoE and STP. Among these,
implementing agency commitment (in addition to Government commitment) was a key
factor contributing to the achievement of Project outcomes, particularly in the face of a
crisis situation beyond its control. This engagement contributed to the organizing of field
visits even under dangerous travel conditions to take stock, in some cases help ensure
teacher payment, and conduct a minimum of supervision by some staff; and partially
recuperating and protecting Project archives following the looting of Project offices.
Legal covenants were also generally complied with in a timely manner, except for delays
in financial statement audits.

118. However, some aspects of preparation and supervision within implementing
agency control could have been improved. For instance, the MoE and STP did not enact
penalty clauses on construction firm contracts when they incurred delays. Beneficiaries
and stakeholders could have been further consulted during preparation and
implementation, and particularly in relation to the teacher training program, to promote
ownership and buy-in of the chain of actors involved in the implementation of various
activities. In addition, gaps in supervision meant that many technical shortcomings in the
execution of construction works were not flagged during construction or during the
preliminary/provisional admission process for completed civil works. The result was, in
some cases, shortcomings in quality having a negative impact on the teaching and
learning environment (e.g., orientation/placement of building leading to low lighting,
leaks in school roofing, insufficient complementary infrastructure such as latrines and
wells, and difficult-to-navigate exterior terrains). Finally, Project reporting pre-crisis
could have been more complete and in particular to include a standardized updated
results framework and reporting on social and environmental safeguards.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

119. The rating for Government performance is Moderately Satisfactory, based on its
moderately satisfactory Government and implementing agency performance.

6. Lessons Learned

120. Complementing government capacity with external service providers and
delegated project management agreements can be effective in fragile contexts to
produce results in the short- to medium-term. Investments should aim to balance
building state capacity with complementing capacity through external service providers,
based on an analysis identifying sector needs, and the gaps that can and cannot be filled
by relying on and building existing capacity. An approach using external service
providers should ensure sufficient management and operational capacity of management
firms and service providers, a strong supervision chain from the local to the central levels,
and be accompanied by close development partner support and monitoring to ensure
timeliness and quality of service provision. Taking into account these factors is
particularly important when there are limited numbers of implementation firms to which
activities can be delegated, including when firms have variable levels of capacity.



                                            40
121. World Bank teams should ensure the establishment of a robust M&E system
allowing for the tracking of implementation progress and attribution of outcomes to
Project-financed interventions. Addressing shortcomings in the indicators selected to
track Project-financed outcomes may have resulted in clearer attribution of progress on
sector-wide indicators to the impact of the Project. Thorough consideration should be
given to: Project indicators to be selected, to ensure that they are measurable while
remaining as simple as possible and providing useful data to track Project outputs and
outcomes; the logical framework linking expected inputs, outputs and outcomes to ensure
a clear causal chain; and the protocols established for indicator monitoring, to ensure
sufficient data collection and analysis capacity exists or is created. Alignment with
country M&E systems can also facilitate data collection, ownership and sustainability,
though teams should aim to ensure that there is sufficient disaggregation when using
sector-wide indicators to distinguish Project-specific contributions to outcomes from
exogenous contributions.

122. In fragile contexts, simplicity of project design and tailoring of
implementation arrangements to government and implementing agency capacity
help ensure absorption of financing. The simple Project design focusing on a limited
number of main activities (school construction/rehabilitation, teacher training, and
teacher payment); with due attention to mitigation of risks through institutional
arrangements and technical support; and with a basis in well-tested interventions was
effective, enabled implementation despite a very challenging capacity context and
circumstances of active conflict. In addition, a flexible and iterative approach to
implementation support, taking into account sub-areas of particular Government
ownership, can foster positive relationships between the Government and its development
partners, and facilitate Government engagement and efficient implementation.

123. Close supervision is critical in low-capacity contexts, and in particular for
delegated management arrangements to help promote the success of school
infrastructure programs. Supervision in closer proximity would have been beneficial in
a context where certain beneficiary communities were in difficult to access areas. In
addition, in low-capacity contexts, putting additional time and resources into the
technical plans and studies for school infrastructure (i.e., to increase their level of detail
and reduce ambiguity in their interpretation, to develop prototypes for certain
construction elements as a reference for implementing firms, and undertake preliminary
technical studies) can improve the quality of both design and construction execution.

124. There is high value in the World Bank remaining engaged with client
countries during periods of crisis, including in cases where policies require the
suspension of project disbursements. The World Bank’s maintained dialogue with the
Government and coordination with other development partners on supporting the
education sector during the crisis facilitated its ability to quickly prepare its full re-
engagement when the political and security situation allowed. Maintaining a dialogue and
financing operations on a case-by-case basis can also help mitigate negative effects of




                                             41
crisis at the country level, by providing technical advice and/or financing for critical
activities to maintain stability in an education sector.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      This Annex describes the outputs of the Project’s three components: (i) improve
access to education through classroom construction, rehabilitation and equipment; (ii)
enhance the quality of education through teacher training and the provision of textbooks;
and (iii) improve the management and efficiency of the education system through reforms
of the teacher payment system and capacity building activities. The Project had a total
baseline cost of US$37.8 million entirely financed from the GPE. The assessment of
outputs by component is based on the PAD, ISRs and STP Project implementation
reports12. This annex focuses on the indicators tracked by the STP in implementation
reports as well as by the World Bank in Project ISRs. A number of indicators under
Components 2 and 3 identified at the appraisal stage in the PAD were tracked by the STP,
but not in World Bank ISRs. There are much fewer data available on the evolution of
these indicators, and they are therefore mentioned in this annex but not analyzed in depth.
Additional information on these indicators is available in Annex 10.

2.     The PDO in the Grant Agreement was to contribute to the implementation of
Phase 1 of the Recipient’s National Education Strateg y (2008-2011), adopted by the
Recipient’s cabinet at its meeting of February 15, 2008, by improving access to better
quality primary education. Although there were three Project restructurings, each
extending its closing date, the PDO remained unchanged over the life of the Project, and
PDO- and intermediate-level indicators were not formally revised. However, a number of
intermediate-level indicators were added, revised or dropped without formal
documentation in a restructuring at various points of Project implementation.

3.     The political and security crisis culminating in the armed overthrow of CAR’s
President Bozize and his Government on March 24, 2013 by the Séléka rebel alliance,
had significant impacts in CAR, including in its education sector. Schooling activities in
CAR could not follow their normal course. The conflict-triggered crisis—ongoing at the
time of the writing of the ICR—created a complex humanitarian emergency, displacing
over 25 percent the country’s population and causing a significant economic contraction.
In addition, it prompted a large-scale international response, including a peacekeeping
intervention from the African Union, French, European Union and United Nations (UN)
forces as well as concomitant emergency relief by UN agencies and non-governmental
organizations. The crisis had significant negative impacts on the education system as a
whole. In February 2014, for instance, an estimated 65 percent of CAR schools were
closed. School functioning was subsequently reported to be frequently irregular and
dependent on security and the presence of teachers.

4.    In addition, the precarious political and security situation prompted the World
Bank to trigger its Operational Policy (OP) 7.30, which suspended all CAR project

disbursements in March 2013. These events had far-reaching effects on the Project and
the ability of the Government to implement and monitor it. At the Project level, effects
included, inter alia, an inability to disburse additional funds for a period of 9 months;
unquantified damages to Project-financed classrooms and teacher training infrastructure;
loss of materials, vehicles and equipment both at the STP and Government agencies as
well as at the school level. From March 2013 to December 2013, only minimal progress
was possible on Project implementation—and in particular in terms of the school
infrastructure program and the training of teachers—as a result of the crisis and the
resulting hold put on Project disbursements. The period after December 2012 is also
characterized by a severe lack of data both on the status of the education system, and at
the Project level. Due to the security situation, neither Project nor World Bank staff could
undertake monitoring visits to Project sites or implementation support missions. As a
result, there are insufficient data to confirm the final impact of the crisis on Project-
financed investments, as further explained below.

5.      Component 1: Access (school construction, rehabilitation, and furniture) At
appraisal, Component 1 was estimated to cost US$18,547,000, or 49.1 percent of total
Project cost. In the context of expected increasing demand for primary education and
overcrowded classrooms, this component aimed to expand education system capacity
through classroom construction and rehabilitation, thereby improving access to education.
In particular, the component was designed to support the construction of 568 new
classrooms and the rehabilitation of 417 unusable classrooms (including provision of
furniture), as well as the construction of 214 latrines 13 and 190 feeder wells. The
component was expected to target areas of the country not under active conflict at the
time of appraisal, in coordination with other development partner financing which
covered the northern, post-conflict regions of the country.

6.      Component 1 outcomes. The impact of Component 1 was measured by the
following PDO-level indicators: (i) Gross enrollment in primary; and (ii) number of new
entrants (non-repeaters) in Grade 1. It was expected that making available new
classrooms or previously unusable primary classrooms usable would provide access to
students previously unable to attend primary school. As highlighted in Table 1 below, the
evolution of Component 1 PDO-level indicator targets was positive during the Project
implementation period, until the crisis after which limited data were available to measure
those indicators given the inability of the Government to conduct the annual school
census. Available information, however, indicates an overall regression in education
system progress. Indeed, due to the unstable security situation, a significant number of
schools were closed, looted, or suffered attacks in its aftermath. It is therefore likely that
there was a regression post-crisis in the results achieved during the Project
implementation period, and in particular in gross enrollment rate and new entrants in
Grade 1.

  Two numbers are used in the PAD: 214 latrines on para. 79 and in the Results Framework (p. 32), and
216 in the table on page 22. The number used in this document is 214, as it also reflects the Government
documentation.

7.      Component 1 outputs. The Project tracked four Component 1 intermediate-level
indicators in order to assess progress against the achievement of intended Project outputs,
as highlighted in Table 2 below. In particular, indicators tracked the numbers of
classrooms built and rehabilitated, as well as the numbers of latrine blocks and wells built.
Due to delays in the recruitment of MODs, as well as implementation delays related to
school infrastructure construction, there was a lag in the achievement of civil works
outputs with respect to the timing planned, and planned end-of-Project targets were not
met.

8.      Ninety-four percent of the number of classrooms expected, 75 percent of latrine
blocks, and 54 percent of wells expected were built. Fewer wells and latrine blocks than
expected were built for several reasons, including: (i) the omission of water studies meant
that some school sites were unsuited to have wells built as intended and with the budget
allotted. Therefore, these constructions were cancelled after the start of digging, resulting
in cost inefficiencies; and (ii) unanticipated changes of construction site, which led to
building on sites with different school infrastructure needs than initially projected.

9.      Pupil-to-classroom ratio, an intermediate-level indicator measuring progress
toward Project outcomes, helped to track the effects of classroom construction and
rehabilitation (greater availability of classrooms). Similarly to the PDO-level indicators
on access, with the crisis, no data were available at the time of writing of the ICR to
confirm pupil-to-classroom ratio. This indicator is also subject to the same shortcomings
as the PDO-level indicators on access: the RF did not establish a clear results chain
conclusively linking improvements in pupil-to-classroom ratio to the Project intervention
versus other interventions increasing the number of classrooms in CAR. While the ratio
did substantially improve over the course of Project implementation, improvements were
also seen prior to the availability of Project-financed classrooms in 2012, indicating that
factors exogenous to the Project were also having an impact on improvements in access
to education.

10.     Component 2: Quality (teacher training and textbooks). Component 2 was
estimated to cost US$8,300,000 at appraisal, representing 22 percent of total Project cost.
To counter the potentially nefarious effects of the growing demand for schooling—which
contributed to overcrowded classrooms and recruitment of local community-based
teachers at the time of appraisal—this component aimed to enhance the quality of
education by providing basic inputs for effective teaching and learning. Namely, it
supported teacher training and the provision of textbooks through two sub-components:
(a) in-service teacher training and skills upgrading for 365 community-based teachers to
meet minimum qualification criteria, as well as pre-service training for 750 teacher
candidates annually in CPRs and ENIs; and (b) the provision of 480,000 textbooks and
27,600 teacher manuals in mathematics and French to all CAR schools to reduce the
pupil-to-textbook ratio.

11.     Component 2 outcomes. The impact of Component 2 was measured by the
following PDO-level indicators, aimed at tracking changes in education quality: (i) New
entrants (non-repeaters) in Grade 6, which was intended to track improvements in the
progression of students within primary school; (ii) pupil-teacher ratio, which was
intended to decrease as additional teachers became available in the education system; and
(iii) Pupil-to-reading textbook and pupil-to-math textbook ratio, which were a proxy to
measure improvements education quality, given the research showing that the provision
of textbooks has been shown to have a highly positive effect on student learning
achievements. As highlighted in Table 5 below, the evolution of Component 2 PDO-level
indicators was positive during the Project implementation period, with all targets met or



                                                  47
surpassed at Project closing except for one indicator for which there is no recent data
post-crisis. The distribution of textbooks occurred relatively early in Project
implementation, due to proactive efforts from the Government, with the support of the
World Bank team. The number of books distributed surpassed expectations, which helped
reduce pupil-textbook ratio more significantly than envisaged.

12.     Component 2 outputs. The Project tracked 12 Component 2 intermediate-level
indicators, five of which met or surpassed expected target values. Four additional
indicators met or surpassed expected targets prior to the full-fledged onset of the crisis in
December 2012, but no data were available at Project closing to confirm their status.
Community and contract teacher training proceeded on time and as planned until the
crisis, when training activities for the final cohort of contract teachers in its last year of
training (practical application) was interrupted. By this time, 365 community teachers
targeted had already completed training (as compared to 900 expected to be trained – 41
percent of the expected total), as well as the first two cohorts of contract teachers.
Therefore, although effects on the teacher training in progress was significant, given that
the sub-component had nearly finished its implementation and that the MoE found
solutions to allow the affected students to finish their training despite the security
situation, the relative impact on teacher training activities was moderate. At closing, the
Project trained more teachers in total than anticipated (2,765, rather than the 2,550
expected).

13.    Additional Component 2 outputs identified in the PAD and tracked by the
Government, but not tracked in ISRs are the following: (i) ENU Bambari rehabilitated
and furnished; (ii) 4 CPR rehabilitated and furnished; (iii) 4 CPR constructed and


                                                48
furnished; (iv) curricula for initial and continued teacher training revised; (v) number of
teachers embarking on 1st year of initial training at ENI; (vi) number of teachers
embarking on 1st year of initial training at the 8 CPR; (vii) number of community
teachers embarking on 1st year of continued training at the 8 CPR; (viii) number of
French and mathematics textbooks delivered to schools (total); (ix) number of French and
mathematics teacher’s guides delivered to schools (total).

14.      Under the teacher training sub-component, four new CPRs were expected to be
built, and four ENIs rehabilitated to receive community-based teachers and teacher
candidates under improved conditions; training of teacher trainers was to be provided;
new teacher training curricula developed; teacher materials provided to existing and new
teacher training facilities; and regional inspectorate and local circumscriptions were to
receive additional means to manage student teachers and contract teachers. These
activities were completed, with targets surpassed in some cases: construction of five
CPRs occurred instead of four, and the rehabilitation of four additional CPRs (rather than
ENIs) occurred. However, with respect to the civil works, at the time of ICR writing, the
data was not available to confirm whether the buildings built or rehabilitated had been
damaged during the violence and looting of the political and security crisis, or whether the
Project investments stood intact at Project closing. The shift from ENIs to CPRs did not
have a substantial impact on the results, given that both institutions were equipped to
train student-teachers. While there were some delays, the teacher training curriculum was
also revised as planned under the Project. Finally, with respect to textbooks, more than
twice the number of math and reading textbooks planned was provided under the Project,
allowing the Project to reach more beneficiaries, and with acquisition and delivery
occurring in a timely manner during the first year of implementation. Fewer teachers’
guides than planned, however, were acquired and distributed.

15.     Component 3: Management and efficiency. Component 3 was estimated to cost
US$9,640,000 at appraisal, representing 25.5 percent of total Project cost. This
component aimed to improve the management and efficiency of the education system
through reforms of the teacher payment system and through capacity building activities
for the Ministry of Education (MoE). With respect to reforms of the teacher payment
system, the component supported the continuation and scale-up of the recruitment,
deployment and payment via private sector actors of primary school contract teachers,
from 809 under a previous Bank-financed project14 to 2,767 covered under the Project
(including stipends for student-teachers and teacher salaries). The component also
provided physical and institution capacity building—including construction of offices,
provision of equipment and vehicles, and training—for the MoE’s central administration.

output level, the Project tracked only one indicator in the ISRs in the early life of the
Project (other indicators were tracked by the Government but not reported on by the
World Bank). This output-level indicator, “Successful achievement of annual output
indicators”, was identified in the PAD as an indicator of implementation capacity. It was
dropped from ISRs without explanation beginning with the fifth Project ISR, and was not

reported on by the STP at Project closing. Although no specific definition of this
indicator could be recovered given the gaps in data on Project M&E, it is likely that it
tracked the achievement of all other component 3 indicators, on which data were
collected annually. These other Component 3 indicators focused on the number of
teachers paid through the Project, the number of engineers contracted to the URCES
(Unité Régionale de Construction des Cadres Techniciens et Equipement Scolaire), the
construction and equipment of STP offices, and the execution of financial and
procurement audits. Given the lack of information on this indicator, it is not possible to
make a judgment about its attainment.

17.     Additional component 3 outputs identified in the PAD, tracked by the
Government, but not tracked in ISRs are the following: (i) Number of contract teachers
paid through the Project by the end of the calendar year; (ii) Number of engineers
contracted to the URCES; (iii) STP offices constructed and equipped; and (iv) Financial
and procurement audits executed. Despite the difficulties in reaching teachers in difficult
to access and insecure regions, more teachers than expected were ultimately paid under
the Project. As planned, to support local implementation capacity, 13 engineers (81
percent of the number planned) were contracted to regional construction units. However,
it is not clear whether these engineers were retained through Project closing, as data on
this indicator is only reported until the 2010-11 school year. Financial audits were
executed annually, although procurement audits were not undertaken. Finally, STP
offices were constructed and equipped, although subsequently damaged by looting during
the crisis, and had to be repaired/re-equiped.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     This Annex provides an overview of the efficiency of the Project in terms of
external efficiency and cost effectiveness. This analysis is structured differently than the
analysis conducted at Project appraisal, which was

                                            . Because this analysis is intended to
complement and revisit the economic and financial analysis conducted at appraisal, a
brief summary is warranted.

2.      The economic and financial analysis at appraisal addressed the dimensions one by
one, beginning with demonstration of the alignment of the Project with the country’s
strategy as well as the World Bank’s strategy. Another section provided the justification
for public investment in education in generic terms, by highlighting that social returns to
education exceed private returns, and that public intervention in this sector addresses
market imperfections like information asymmetries and credit constraints that
disadvantage the poor. The dimension analyzed in the greatest depth, the fiscal analysis,
compared planned public education expenditures with projected domestic resources
committed to the sector. Despite the poor state of the fiscal data and general political
uncertainty hindering the ability to make precise projections, this fiscal analysis
concluded that while the Project funds were relatively very significant for the overall
sector financing, important gaps remained. Finally, three more dimensions were covered
with a brief institutional capacity analysis, poverty analysis, and sustainability analysis.

3.      The Economic and Financial analysis at appraisal did not address three
dimensions: the cost-benefit analysis, the accompanying sensitivity analysis, and the
economic performance criteria were entirely omitted at Project appraisal, without
justification or substitution with a qualitative assessment. Unfortunately, the external
efficiency section of this Annex is also devoid of a cost-benefit analysis of the Project
interventions. Efforts to build a cost-benefit analysis model from the ground up at the
closing stage were ultimately constrained by the lack of data on returns to education for
the Central African Republic and the erratic records of spending allocations, which
compounded to make this analysis impractical and its expected results overly inaccurate.
Instead of a cost-benefit analysis, we justify the external efficiency of the Project based
on an in-depth analysis of the education sector in the Central African Republic conducted
by the World Bank in 2008, namely the Country Status Report of the National Education
System (CSR).

External efficiency

4.     The last comprehensive study of the CAR education sector was completed in
2008. “Le système éducatif Centrafricain - Contraintes et marges de manoeuvre pour la
reconstruction du système éducatif dans la perspective de la réduction de la pauvreté” is
a working document published by the World Bank, complete with an entire chapter on
the external efficiency of the education system based on the limited data that was
available at the time.



                                            55
5.      One of the main conclusions of the external efficiency analysis is that there exists
an important misalignment between the human resources educated in the country and the
needs of the economy. On the lower end of the education spectrum, the system is not
training enough students to reach sustainable literacy levels. As a result, the agricultural
and informal sectors, which employ the vast majority of the working population, lack the
literacy skills required to increase their productivity, grow the economy and contribute to
poverty reduction. At the other end of the spectrum, the number of students completing
higher education degrees greatly exceeds the number of available positions for that level
of qualification – there are six times more graduates than there are positions requiring
their skill level).


                    access to basic education while enhancing its quality, the Project
contributed to addressing the structural mismatch between the available profile of human
resources and the needs of the labor market.

6.      The available data in CAR unfortunately does not allow for the calculation of
returns to education. However, Table 8 below shows a clear and expected tendency for
individuals with more training to find better employment, which is consistent with
positive returns to education. The simultaneous trend of rising unemployment with
increased schooling that can also be observed in Table 8, however, is one of the
symptoms of the shortage of employment opportunities corresponding to the skill levels
of highly educated Central Africans, and points to decreasing returns at higher levels of
education.

7.      Looking beyond the economic benefits of education, the same study also found
positive and substantial social benefits, particularly for girls, along three main
dimensions: reproduction, maternal and child health, and female protection. For instance,
the probability of using contraceptive methods, as well as the probability of consulting
pre- and post-natal care, clearly increased with the level of education. Furthermore, the
analysis showed that primary education had the most impact on most indicators, with
decreasing marginal impact with every additional level of education.

8.     From both the economic and social perspectives, the analyses clearly highlight the
necessity of investing in basic primary education. Together, they support the notion that
the Project, by focusing its resources on improving the accessibility and quality of basic
education in CAR, has helped to maximize the economic and social benefits that the
country can gain from its investments in education.



9.      Under the first component of the Project, the cost efficiency of the construction of


                                               57
new classrooms can be evaluated by comparing the average unit cost of building a
classroom within the Project across different implementers, and also by comparing
against the unit costs of other financial partners involved in school construction. First, the
unit cost per classroom was calculated and compared across the two MODs responsible
for managing the construction of schools in different geographies of the country. As of
the last thorough evaluation of the construction component of the Project that provided
cost breakdowns between the two MODs (in August 2012), the unit cost for ACTED was
only marginally higher than the unit cost for AGETIP, at US$19,968 vs. US$19,118
respectively, a relatively insignificant 4.4 percent difference. However, the direction of
the difference is not consistent with expectations, considering that AGETIP was
responsible for building in Région 6, which is relatively large and difficult to access due
to security reasons and poor infrastructure. This implies that AGETIP was relatively
more cost-effective than the other MOD.

10.    The school construction costs under the Project compare favorably with respect to
the costs of similar construction works implemented recently by one other development
partner who was able to produce comparable unit costs. The combined unit cost of
constructing a classroom under the Project from 2009 until 2012 was US$18,04516. In
comparison, UNICEF, who had a school construction component in their project from
2012 to 2015, had unit costs of US$20,437 (adjusting for inflation)17.

11.     The provision of textbooks under the Project was relatively cost-effective in
comparison with other development partners who also financed textbook provision in
Central African Republic in recent years. In 2010, the Project sourced textbooks at an
average unit cost of 1.26 euros (US$1.83), which included shipping to schools. In 2015,
in the context of the implementation of the second grant from the GPE, UNICEF sourced
textbooks at a unit cost of 1,94 euros (US$2.23), with delivery limited to Bangui. Even
after adjusting for inflation, the cost of the Project textbooks were 48 percent lower than
the textbooks procured under the UNICEF project, despite the inclusion of a more
extensive delivery service. Both of these costs, however, are relatively high in
comparison with the unit costs from other conflict or post-conflict African countries
where data was available (Democratic Republic of Congo – US$1.3218, Sierra Leone19
where the unit cost ranged from US$0.97 to US$1.66, and Niger 20 where unit costs
ranged from US$1.10 to US$1.40).

12.     Since the advent of the Fast Track initiative indicative framework in 2004, which
set a benchmark for the average annual teacher salary as a multiple of per capita GDP,
the cost-effectiveness of teacher salaries has largely been assessed using this metric. The


16
   Calculated using an average exchange rate over the period of disbursement, and the cumulative amount
in FCFA spent as of 2012. The cost per classroom includes pro-rata latrine facilities, classroom furniture,
and in some cases the digging of a well, but excludes management and supervision costs.
17 Again, the cost per classroom includes pro-rata toilet facilities and classroom furniture, but excludes
management and supervision costs.

benchmark, set at 3.5 units of GDP per capita, corresponds to the average teacher salary
registered in low-income countries with the best performance with regard to primary
completion21. The 2008 education Country Status Report was critical of the relatively
high civil servant teachers’ salaries in CAR, sitting at 7 units of GDP per capita for
primary, with respect to other low-income countries in Africa. In the context of the
Project, the elected salary of contract teachers corresponded to 3.4 units of GDP,
allowing for the recruitment of a larger number of contract teachers and an effective
improvement student-teacher ratio.

13.     The three Project sub-components evaluated together account for 64.3 percent of
the Project spending at closing: 25.4 percent for new school construction, 6.4 percent for
textbooks, and 32.5 percent for teacher salaries. Other subcomponents, like school
rehabilitation and teacher training, were not included because of their context specificity
or the difficulty of finding comparable unit costs. Based on this analysis, two thirds of the
Project spending was spent on least-cost solutions, at least in terms of intra-country
comparisons.

Efficiency of Implementation

14.      Beyond the cost-effectiveness analysis based on unit costs, several
implementation challenges ended up having a detrimental effect of the efficiency of the
Project. The most noteworthy of these is the political and security crisis, which resulted in
damages to Project-financed investments (STP and beneficiary equipment looted, STP
Project archives stolen, damaged buildings, as well as the interruption of Project-financed
activities like training and construction activities). These setbacks demanded additional
time and effort for implementation to return to its planned course, contributing to an
implementation time frame of six years (interrupted during the conflict) instead of three
years. On the construction front, the failure to conduct water studies eventually led to the
cancellation of the construction of wells at 67 school sites after digging had begun,
resulting in wasted resources. Poor quality of construction materials in the technical
specifications of the school buildings, according to the technical expert evaluating the
school construction progress, resulted in increased cost, effort and time required for
construction, while compromising the expected durability of the building.

15.        In light of all of the above, the efficiency is rated Modest.

                                   RAPPORT SYNTHESE DE CLOTURE DU PROJET
                                   D’APPUI AU PROGRAMME SECTORIEL DE
                                   L’EDUCATION (PAPSE), Période : 2009-201522

        Le Projet d’Appui au Programme Sectoriel de l’Education a été créé en Février
 2009, suite à l’octroi à la République centrafricaine par l’Initiative de Mise en Œuvre
 Accélérée de l’Education Pour Tous (IMOA.EFA/FTI) en décembre 2008 d’un Don de
 37,8 millions de dollar USA. Il a officiellement démarré ses activités après satisfaction
 des conditions préalables, le 15 octobre 2009. En bénéficiant de ce fonds, la RCA
 rejoignait ainsi ce que l’on appelle aujourd’hui le Partenariat Mondial pour l’Education
 (PME)
         Le but de ce financement, c’est la réalisation des Objectifs de l’Education Pour
 Tous (OEPT) à l’an 2015 et l’atteinte des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le Développement
 (OMD) relatifs à la Scolarisation Primaire Universelle (SPU). Pour la RCA, en
 application de la Stratégie Nationale du Secteur de l’Education (SNSE 2008-2020), il
 s’est agi spécifiquement d’atteindre cet objectif en 2020, compte tenu du retard accusé
 depuis le sommet mondial sur l’éducation de Dakar en avril 2000.
        Le Don de 37,8 millions de dollars USA a été géré par le Ministère de l’Education
 Nationale via le STP-CSE et supervisé par la Banque Mondiale.
     A partir de la date de sa mise en vigueur en juin 2009, le projet devait être clôturé en
 juin 2012, mais en raison de la crise de décembre 2012, et qui perdure encore, la date de
 clôture a été reportée successivement de 2012 à 2013 et de 2013 au 31 mars 2015.
      De sa mise en œuvre, les principaux résultats atteints par composante du Projet sont :

   This annex was reproduced from the report mentioned in the annex title ( Rapport Synthèse de Clôture du
 Projet d’Appui au Programme Sectoriel de l’Education (PAPSE )). However, the paragraphs indicated in
 this annex in italicized font were drawn from the Rapport synthétique de l’atelier bilan du Projet D’Appui
 au Programme Sectoriel de l’Education (PAPSE ) dated March 5, 2015, which provided some additional
 Government analyses on key implementation issues.



                                                    65
   I.      Composante accès
   540 nouvelles salles de classe sont construites et équipées sur 513 prévues, 410 salles
   de classe réhabilitées et équipées sur 417 prévues, 160 blocs latrines réalisés sur 214
   prévus. Les détails sont donnés par l’Expert en génie civil en annexe;

Observations : le surplus du nombre de nouvelles salles de classe (540 sur 513) se
justifie par la réaffectation et l’utilisation des économies réalisées dans l’exécution de la
première phase du projet pour construire de nouvelles salles. Quant à l’insuffisance du
nombre de classes réhabilitées et de blocs de latrines construits, ce sont les difficultés
d’accès aux sites pour les deux activités et, particulièrement la nature des sols pour les
latrines en plus de l’insécurité.

    Il convient de noter que la composante Génie civil, relative à la
construction/réhabilitation et équipement en mobiliers scolaires a été confiée pour
exécution à des ONG, en qualité de Maîtres d’ouvrages Délégués. Il s’agit de : AGETIP-
CAF et ACTED-Centrafrique, avec répartition par région. Les régions 1 et 2 (comprenant
les préfectures de : Ombella M’poko, Lobaye, Sangha-Mbaéré et Mambéré-Kadéï) ont
été confiées à ACTED et les régions 4, 6 et 7 (comprenant les préfectures de : KEMO,
OUAKA, Basse-KOTTO, MBOMOU et la ville spéciale de Bangui) à AGETIP-CAF.

    Par contre, les volets formation, recrutement, construction/réhabilitation et
équipement des CPR ainsi que l’affectation des enseignants dans les écoles ont été
réalisés par le Gouvernement par le biais du Secrétariat Technique Permanent du Comité
Sectoriel de l’Education et du Projet d’Appui au Programme Sectoriel de l’Education
(STP-CSE/PAPSE).

    Les constructions et réhabilitations de nouvelles salles de classe ont nettement
amélioré les ratios élèves/classe et favorisé l’accès à de nombreux enfants tant dans les
centres urbains que ruraux. De nombreux témoignages de la population, des politiques
etc. souhaitent un second PAPSE pour pouvoir juguler les besoins éducatifs essentiels du
pays.

    Aussi, sauf les cas exceptionnels des préfectures de la Kémo, de la Ouaka, de
Bamingui-Bangoran sur les 16 que compte le pays et quelques rares cas isolés à Nola au
sud du pays, nos différentes missions de contrôle en province ont constaté que les écoles
ont été moins vandalisées.

    Le recours à la Maîtrise d’Ouvrage Déléguée (MOD) a permis de décaisser dans le
temps et d’améliorer la capacité d’absorption des fonds malgré quelques difficultés
constatées liées au manque de précaution dans le recrutement de certaines entreprises
notamment par l’AGETIP-CAF. Ce qui a causé de sérieux retards dans la réalisation des
travaux de construction dans la région 5 (Ouaka) et 6 (Basse-Kotto et Mbomou).




                                             66
   II.     composante qualité

- 5 nouveaux Centres Pédagogiques Régionaux (CPR) ont été construits et 4 autres
réhabilités, tous équipés en mobiliers et matériels bureautiques, 1 Ecole Normale de
formation initiale des instituteurs (ENI) réhabilitée et équipée ;
- des programmes de formation initiale et continue révisés et adaptés au contexte ;
- 2400 recrutés maîtres d’enseignement, formés et certifiés, 365 maîtres-parents formés
et certifiés, soit 2705 nouveaux enseignants du primaire recrutés et formés ;
- 1 339 418 manuels de français et de mathématique achetés et distribués dans toutes les
écoles publiques et privées du pays sur 480 000 initialement prévus, 14 092 guides de
français et de mathématiques achetés et distribués aux enseignants et aux encadreurs
pédagogiques…..

Observations : Ici, tous les objectifs en termes de recrutement, de formation et de
certification de nouveaux enseignants ainsi que la qualification professionnelle des
Maîtres-parents répondant aux critères académiques de sélection ont été largement
atteints.

     Le nombre de manuels de lecture et de mathématique a été multiplié par trois,
dépassant ainsi les 480 000 initialement prévus. L’appui et les orientations de la Banque
Mondiale, via la Chef de projet, Mme DUNG Kim PHAM ont été déterminants dans
l’atteinte maximale de ces résultats. Cette expérience de gestion de programme mérite
d’être pérennisée.

    Les actions de formation à la fois initiale et continue des enseignants ont commencé à
produire des effets positifs sur les enseignements et les apprentissages quand la crise a
éclaté en décembre 2012. En l’absence d’une évaluation systématique des bienfaits de la
mise en œuvre du PAPSE, il est reconnu par les acteurs de la vie publique centrafricaine
que le projet a suscité un grand espoir dans la politique d’enseignement et de formation.

   III.    composante gestion et efficacité

        En récupérant les 1100 enseignants formés sur fonds d’urgence santé et éducation
(PSES) financé par la Banque mondiale en 2006-2009, plus ceux formés par le PAPSE,
on comptabilise à la fin du projet 3055 enseignants contractualisés et payés à 60 000 Fcfa
d’Octobre 2009 à fin Septembre 2012. A ceux-là, il convient d’ajouter les 750
enseignants recrutés, formés et certifiés de 2012 à 2013, et qui sont contractualisés par le
Gouvernement à la fin du programme. Au total, 3 805 nouveaux enseignants ont été
qualifiés, certifiés par le PAPSE et affectés dans les écoles ; ce qui a nettement amélioré
le ratio élèves/maître de 111 en 2009 avant la mise en œuvre du PAPSE à 82 élèves
par maître en 2012.

Observations : en application des dispositions collectivement arrêtées par le
Gouvernement et la Banque mondiale, tous les enseignants formés par le PAPSE ont été
intégrés dans la Fonction Publique et les 750 enseignants de la dernière promotion




                                            67
contractualisés en attendant une éventuelle intégration au titre de la prochaine année
budgétaire.

Par contre, les enseignants et les élèves en fuite pour leur sécurité ont de la peine à
regagner les domiciles et les écoles.

       La régularité de la gestion des fonds a été constatée par plusieurs missions d’audit
des comptes qui ont certifié les différents rapports financiers et appuyé le projet de
conseils en vue de la perfection des modalités de gestion et d’archivage des dossier s tant
administratifs que financiers.

        En plus des audits des comptes, l’Inspection Générale d’Etat a en 2012, contrôlé
la régularité des dépenses et a félicité dans son rapport le service fiduciaire représenté par
le BCF et le SGF, responsable de la comptabilité et de la gestion financière du projet.

       Malgré la démission du Spécialiste de passation des Marchés du PAPSE en début
2012, la Banque mondiale, grâce à l’appui de son expertise en passation des marchés,
nous a aidés à éviter des dérapages dans ce domaine et à tenir à jour les nouveaux
dossiers en mettant à notre disposition, les services à temps partiel, d’un consultant en
passation des marchés.

        En outre, la performance du STP-CSE/PAPSE a été reconnue par les partenaires
internationaux lors de la revue à mi-parcours de la mise en œuvre du projet. A fin 3ème
semestre de 2012, le taux d’engagement des fonds avoisinaient les 96% du montant du
Don et celui de décaissement les 92%, attestant ainsi une bonne capacité de
consommation.

       A ce jour, le taux de décaissement est plus de 99% avec un reliquat de fonds à
rembourser à l’entité de supervision, la Banque Mondiale de : cent trente millions
(130 000 000) de FCFA.

        Pour atteindre l’objectif de relèvement du système éducatif national, le STP -CSE,
en collaboration avec tous les partenaires du GLPE, sous la vigilance de l’entité de
coordination et de gestion des appuis d’urgence : l’UNICEF), a développé en application
des instructions du Ministre de l’Education Nationale et de l’Enseignement Technique,
un Plan de Transition couvrant la période 2015-2017. Il réactualise les priorités du
Gouvernement en matière de fondation et reconstruction du système éducatif en synergie
avec la vision de développement durable d’un capital humain de qualité.

REALISATIONS

Tous les chantiers faisant partie de la première phase du projet ont démarré en février
2011dans les régions sous contrôle d’ ACTED et 6 mois plutard dans les régions
contrôlées par AGETIP.

Le Maître d’Ouvrage Délégué ACTED a réalisé 100% de nouvelles salles de classe et
96,33% des salles réhabilitées alors que l’autre MOD AGETIP a réalisé 95,62% de
nouvelles salles construites et 69,43% des salles réhabilitées. Ainsi jusqu’en décembre
2012, le PAPSE a pu réaliser 501 salles de classe sur 513 prévus en 2010,314 salles
réhabilitées sur 410 de prevu,160 latrines sur 156 ;Beaucoup de puits à construire sont
restés infructueux du fait de la nature des sols qui sont sablonneuses ou ayant des blocs
granitiques difficiles à creuser à la main dans certaines régions ,ou la nappe phréatique
est à plus de 30 mètres de profondeur.

Régions n° 4 et 6 : MOD AGETIP

Signalons que sur les 274 salles de classe à réaliser, les travaux de construction des salles
à l’école NZACKO dans la zone contrôlée par la LRA de Joseph KONY ont été
supprimés ;

et pour les mêmes raisons sécuritaires, les travaux sur les sites des écoles Ndjouengba,
Kouango, Soumayassi et Lihoto non seulement ont connu des retards dans leur exécution


                                             74
jusqu‘à ce jour subissent de perturbations considérables (pillage systématique des
matériaux par les rebelles de la SELEKA).

Il en est de même pour les circonscriptions scolaires de Bangassou de Bambari et de
Grimari où les écoles ont été pillées par la SELEKA Cette situation a compromis
fortement l’avancement des travaux de réhabilitation des salles de classe des écoles de
ces régions 4 et 6 sous contrôle des rebelles de la SELEKA.

Le mois dernier, les entreprises contractualisées sont à pieds d’œuvre dans ces régions
pour achever les travaux de réhabilitation suspendus pour des raisons évoquées ci-dessus.

RELIQUAT
  • Le reliquat dégagé sur le budget attribué aux deux MOD a été utilisé pour la
     construction des salles de classe supplémentaires (36 salles de classe) ,12
     latrines dans les régions 1 et 5 (ACTED) et de 15 salles de classe), extensions
     de 2 bureaux ,5 latrines et 5 puits dans les régions 4 et 6 (AGETIP).
   •   Construction de 36 salles de classe et 12 latrines par ACTED:
    - 36 salles de classe sont entièrement terminées, équipées et réceptionnées;.
   • Construction de 15 salles de classe et 2 bureaux de directeurs par AGETIP
      - Les travaux d’extension des deux bureaux sont terminés, équipés et
réceptionnés,
       - Les travaux de 9 salles de classe sont terminés équipés mais non réceptionnés
    pour cause d’insécurité dans la région ;
      -Les travaux des 6 autres salles de classe bien avancés ont aussi repris le mois
      dernier.

   •   Réalisations pendant la crise
       Pendant ce moment de crise que connait le pays, la coordination du projet a fait
       fabriquer 1100 table-bancs (distribués dans les salles pillées) et réhabiliter 14
       salles de classe saccagées dans les régions de l’Ombella-Mpoko, de la Lobaye et
       de la Sangha-Mbaéré dont deux salles étaient déjà réhabilitées pendant la phase
       II ce qui porte à 324 le nombre de salle classe réhabilitées et équipées.

        Unless revisions to targets were formally undertaken through a Project restructuring, they are not considered as the target. These end targets were changed
     without a restructuring; new end targets appear in the ISR Sequence No. 9 (May 2014). ISR Sequence No. 8 (likely archived July 2013, but ISR does not contain
     a date of creation/modification) does not contain a results framework so it is not clear whether the targets were revised beginning with this ISR or with the
     subsequent ISR (No. 9).

   Unless revisions to targets were formally undertaken through a Project restructuring, they are not considered as the target. These end targets were changed
without a Project restructuring; new end targets appear in the ISR Sequence No. 9 (May 2014). ISR Sequence No. 8 (likely archived July 2013, but ISR does not
contain a date of creation/modification) does not contain a results framework so it is not clear whether the targets were revised beginning with this ISR or with
the subsequent ISR (No. 9).

   This is mistakenly reported as new entrants in “Grade 2” rather than “Grade 6”in multiple documents reporting on the Project (ISRs no. 4, 5 and 6 and first
Restructuring Paper from Feb 2012). This error was rectified in subsequent documentation.

  Unless revisions to targets were formally undertaken through a Project restructuring, they are not considered as the target. These end targets were changed
without a Project restructuring; new end targets appear in the ISR Sequence No. 9 (May 2014). ISR Sequence No. 8 (likely archived July 2013, but ISR does not
contain a date of creation/modification) does not contain a results framework so it is not clear whether the targets were revised beginning with this ISR or with
the subsequent ISR (No. 9).

  There were no Component 3 targets tracked by the Bank at Project closing (in ISRs).
36
  Unless revisions to targets were formally undertaken through a Project restructuring, they are not considered as the target. These end targets were changed
without a Project restructuring; new end targets appear in the ISR Sequence No. 9 (May 2014). ISR Sequence No. 8 (likely archived July 2013, but ISR does not
contain a date of creation/modification) does not contain a results framework so it is not clear whether the targets were revised beginning with this ISR or with
the subsequent ISR (No. 9).
