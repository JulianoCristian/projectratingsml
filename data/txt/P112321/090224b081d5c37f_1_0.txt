                         Implementation Status Overview
                          With the change of the political situation in March 2013 and its overall impact on the education sector, progress towards achieving of PDO is downgraded to moderately
                         unsatisfactory. Reports from the technical counterparts and the media indicate that the security situation is preventing normal schooling activities. All results achieved contributing to
                         stronger access and quality of education have shrunk.
