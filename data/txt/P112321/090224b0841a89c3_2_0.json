Development Project for\n            Central Africa were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was high, Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Grantee\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: complementing government capacity with\n            external service providers and delegated project management\n            agreements can be effective in fragile contexts to produce\n            results in the short- to medium-term. World Bank teams\n            should ensure the establishment of a robust monitoring and\n            evaluation (M and E) system allowing for the tracking of\n            implementation progress and attribution of outcomes to\n            project-financed interventions. In fragile contexts,\n            simplicity of project design and tailoring of implementation\n            arrangements to government and implementing agency capacity\n            help ensure absorption of financing. Close supervision is\n            critical in low-capacity contexts, and in particular for\n            delegated management arrangements to help promote the\n            success of school infrastructure programs. There is high\n            value in the World Bank remaining engaged with client\n            countries during periods of crisis, including in cases where\n            policies require the suspension of project disbursements."}, "docdt": "2015-12-29T00:25:01Z"}
