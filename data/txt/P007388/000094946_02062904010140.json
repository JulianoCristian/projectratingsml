satisfactory,\n            sustainability as likely, institutional development impact\n            as substantial, Bank performance as satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance as satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned from the project implementation include: 1) The\n            promptness of IDA's response to the devastating effects\n            of Hurricane Mitch as instrumental in preserving the\n            benefits of the project. IDA's continued assistance\n            helped the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing\n            (SOPTRAVI) in keeping a long-term view while attending to\n            the reconstruction effort, as illustrated by the\n            incorporation of strategic lessons learned from Hurricane\n            Mitch and the implementation of long-term reforms to enhance\n            road maintenance sustainability. 2) Project implementation\n            shows that the engagement of a private consulting firm,\n            composed mainly of engineers who were formerly employed by\n            SOPTRAVI, facilitated project coordination and enabled the\n            provision of high-quality technical support. 3) The project,\n            with its strong emphasis on sector-wide reforms, implied a\n            departure from previous operations in the sector. Taking\n            advantage of the window opportunity, the project contributed\n            to carrying the reform message through two administrations,\n            albeit with varying degrees of success among sub-sectors.\n            The outcome proved successful in the aviation and road sub-sectors."}, "docdt": "2002-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
