{"cdata!": "The assessment rates the project outcome\n            as satisfactory based on its high relevance, substantial\n            efficacy, and substantial efficiency. The assessment rates\n            sustainability as likely, and institutional development\n            impact as substantial; it rates Bank performance as\n            satisfactory and borrower performance also satisfactory. The\n            key lessons from the project are as follows: Good\n            preparation is important, but must allow for a realistic\n            time frame. For policy/institutional restructuring projects,\n            it should set out the broad study direction and assist the\n            borrower to take full ownership of the process, which should\n            be fine-tuned as the project proceeds, with full input from\n            the key sector players. The project preparation plan should\n            include an assessment of possible risks. In the event that\n            the project experiences internal and/or external shocks\n            necessitating institutional restructuring, such\n            restructuring can best be expedited through a flexible\n            approach and good supervision. 0 Key elements of a\n            project's policy and institutional development agenda\n            may still be completed after a project's closing date\n            if the project staff and consultants have nurtured an\n            appropriate relationship for that agenda and remain engaged,\n            if possible, beyond project closing."}, "docdt": "2004-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
