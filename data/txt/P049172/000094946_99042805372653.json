inputs and\n            learning processes. Furthermore, the space utilization and\n            energy efficiency of educational facilities will be\n            improved, and institutional management capacity will be\n            strengthened. The main components are: a) to achieve\n            operating efficiency in school buildings, obtaining\n            substantial reductions from recurrent expenditures.\n            Essential repairs will generate savings in current\n            expenditures, allowing benefiting municipalities to\n            contribute a percentage of these savings for education\n            spending. Further improvements are expected in physical\n            facilities, in laboratories and equipment upgrading, as well\n            as in the provision of in-service teacher training; b) to\n            increase education quality, through the Ministry of\n            Education and Science (MES) capacity building, for assessing\n            and monitoring student achievements. Five sub-components\n            will support education quality: national content and\n            performance standards; national standardized assessment\n            instruments; communications strategy and public relations;\n            school self-improvement model; and, strengthening policy\n            capacity; c) to ensure project management efficiency,\n            consulting and training will be included in the project."}, "docdt": "1999-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
