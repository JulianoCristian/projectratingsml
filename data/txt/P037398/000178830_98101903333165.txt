ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BOARD
APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD POWE PROJECT
(TARBERT 4) 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
(i)       A loan of US$15 million equivalent is proposed for a Project
consisting of a 250 MW oil-fired generating unit at the Electricity Supply
Board's (ESB's) existing power station at Tarbert in Western Ireland. Two
60 MW oil-fired units are in use at Tarbert and the 250 MW No. 3 unit is
under construction. The proposed new unit, Tarbert No. 4, would be identi-
cal to No. 3. The Project includes associated works for transmission at
220 kV.
(ii)      The proposed loan would cover 64% of the Project's foreign
exchange requirements and 37% of its estimated total cost. It would be
the third Bank loan to ESB; the first, Loan 591-IRE was made in March 1969
for the Turlough Hill pumped storage project, and the second, 726-IRE, in
March 1971 for the Tarbert No. 3 unit. Both projects are proceeding
satisfactorily.
(iii)     Consumption of electricity in Ireland is expected to increase by
about 10% annually over 1972-78. The Project is an essential element in
the provision of new generating facilities required to supply the demand
in that period and constitutes the least cost solution. The total cost
of the ESB expansion program over the Project construction period (FY 1973-77)
is expected to be about L172 million (US$450 million), of which 9% is repre-
sented by the project's cost.
(iv)      The proposed loan would finance the equipment for Tarbert No. 4
Project, with the exception of the turbo-generator which is to be purchased
by a supplier's credit. The boiler has been ordered under option provisions
obtained when the Bank financed No. 3 unit equipment was ordered, under
international competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the Bank's
requirements. The Executive Directors have been kept informed of the progress
of procurement for No. 4 Boiler through the Monthly Operational Summaries.
(v)       All engineering, planning and supervision of the Project would be
carried out by ESB's staff, which has had considerable experience in the
design and construction of large generating units.
(vi)      In the past, ESB's financial situation has been generally satis-
factory because of the conservative manner in which the Act and the tariff
provisions contained in it have been applied by the Government and ESB.
During 1971 there has been indication that Government policy in future
might be to maintain tariffs at levels which would be lower than is prudent,
at the risk of no longer enabling ESB to finance an appropriate share of
its investment program from internal resources. In order to ensure that
future earnings are improved and maintained at a satisfactory level the



- ii -
Government and the ESB agreed during negotiations upon the acceptance of
a 40% minimum internal cash contribution to investment.
(vii)     The internal financial rate of return on the Project is estimated
to be about 16% based on benefits valued at rates expected to be in force
for the sale of power at the time the Project is commissioned.
(viii)    The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$15 million equiv-
alent, for a term of 17 years including a grace period of 5 years.

APPRAISAL OF THB THIRD POWER PROJECT
(TARBERT 4)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ireland, on behalf of the Electricity Supply
Board (ESB), has requested a loan to help finance a Project consisting
of a 250 MW oil-fired generating unit at Tarbert Generating Station together
with associated substation and transmission line equipment. Tarbert is on
the south bank of the Shannon estuary in County Kerry; two 60 MW thermal
units are in operation at this station, and a 250 MW thermal unit financed
by Loan 726-IRE is under construction.
1.02      The Borrower would be ESB. A loan of US$15.0 million equivalent
is proposed.  It would cover 64% of the estimated foreign exchange require-
ments of the Project, the total cost of which is estimated to be US$40.52
million equivalent, or about 9% of ESB's capital expenditure for the period
FY 1973-77. It would be the IBRD's third loan for power to Ireland. The
first loan, 591-IRE (US$14.5 million) was made to ESB in March 1969 to help
finance the 280 MW Turlough Hill pumped-storage project and the second,
726-IRE (US$20 million), in March 1971 for the 250 MW Tarbert No. 3 unit.
Progress under both loans is satisfactory.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission composed
of Messrs. J. Beach and K. Stichenwirth which visited Ireland in April 1971,
and a subsequent visit by Mr. Stichenwirth in August 1971.



1/
2.  THE SECTOR AND THE BORROWER /
Economic Background
2.01      The Republic of Ireland has an area of about 27,000 sq. mi.
and a population of approximately 3 million which is growing at a rate
of about 0.4% per year. An average real growth in GNP of 4% occurred in
the 1960s, slowing down to 1.5% in 1970. Factors contributing to the low
growth rate were labor disputes, the adverse effect of the troubles in
Northern Ireland on tourism, repercussions of difficulties in the U.K.
economy, and some loss of competitiveness caused by the rapid rise in
domestic costs and prices. The growth of GNP is expected to be about 3
percent in 1971 and probably somewhat higher in 1972. The anticipated
entry of Ireland into the European Economic Community in January 1973 is
expected to contribute to a growth rate of at least 4 percent in the mid
1970s.
2.02      A primary aim of development policy is to reduce unemployment
and emigration by promoting industrialization, tourism and agriculture.
From 1960 to 1969, output of the manufacturing and mining sector of the
Irish econorW increased at an average annual rate of 7%, and this sector
now accounts for about 38% of total GDP and about 50% of exports.
2.03      Rapid industrialization, and, to a lesser extent, the mechani-
zation of agriculture, have increased demand for electricity, but con-
sumption per capita (1,650 kWh) is still one of the lowest in Europe, being
about 40% that of the United Kingdom. Growth of about 10% per annum in
the use of electricity is expected for some years and projections indicate
that by 1978 per capita consumption should have risen to about 3,000 kWh.
Electricity Supply Board (ESB)
2.04      The Electricity Supply Board was established in 1927 by the
Electricity (Supply) Act 1927 to be responsible for the generation, trans-
mission and distribution of electrical power, and is the sole agency pro-
viding public electricity supply in Ireland. Its activities cover all
aspects of electricity supply, from construction of its power stations to
the sale of electrical appliances. ESB is Ireland's largest enterprise
in terms of assets and revenue, and second largest in terms of the number
of its employees (about 11,000), being surpassed only by the Government
transport companr.  ESB's organization and management are good and the
utility is well operated.
2.05      Although a statutory body, ESB is generally free from govern-
mental control except for its obligations to burn indigenous fuel (paras.
2.11-2.13), develop rural electrification, and obtain approval for tariff
1/ The history of the power sector and the Borrower, and their organi-
zation have been described in greater detail in the appraisal reports
for the previous loans.

changes and loans. The Cabinet appoints each of the seven members of the
Board, including the full-time Chairman, for up to five years; reappoint-
ments are customary, which contributes to the Board's high degree of
responsibility and continuity. Details of ESB's organization are shown
in Annex 1.
2.06      Since the Act constitutes the legal basis on which ESB operates,
the Loan Agreement for the proposed loan repeats the Loan 726-IRE stipulation,
that any change made in the Act of 1927 (as subsequently amended), which in
the Bank's opinion would adversely affect the execution of the Project or
the financial condition of the Board, would constitute an event of default.
Tariff Policy
2.07      The 1927 Act stipulates that electricity tariffs should be set
at levels to produce revenues which, together with revenues from other
services, cover, as closely as possible, the following:
(a) operation, maintenance, administration, taxes
and similar items properly chargeable to income;
(b) depreciation;
(c) interest chargeable to revenue, amortization of
debt, and allocation to the sinking fund reserve
(paras. 5.14-5.16);
(d) sums that the Board considers proper to set aside
for the reserve fund, extensions and renewals.
Tariff adjustments are subject to approval by the Minister of
Industry and Commerce.
2.08      An unusual feature of the Act's tariff stipulations is that ESB
is permitted to charge full amortization in addition to depreciation
(para. 2.07 c), which implies that the revenue portion equivalent to
depreciation is entirely at the Board's disposal. This, together with
allocations to various reserves (para. 2.07 d) enabled ESB to generate
enough revenue to finance a reasonable portion of its expansion program
out of such funds. For this reason rate covenants had not been included
in previous loans. Recent developments, however, seem to indicate that
inflationary and other pressures on the Government could change the situa-
tion, to the disadvantage of ESB's financial viability. Consequently, a
tariff covenant has been included in this loan (paras. 5.03 and 5.04).
Electricity Sales
2.09      Sales of 4,850 million kWh were recorded in FY 1971, an increase
of 9.9% (Annex 3), continuing the load growth trend experienced in recent
years. A maximum system demand of 1,203 MW was recorded. Electricity
generated was as follows:

100.0
ESB's Installations
2.10      At the end of FY 1971, ESB's generating capacity amounted to
1,436 MW:  220 MW hydro, 407 MW peat-fired, and 809 MW in thermal stations
fuelled by coal or imported oil. Generating stations and load centere are
interconnected by means of an extensive 220 kV and 110 kV grid. In FY 1971,
transmission and distribution losses averaged 11%, a satisfactory level.
Annex 2 gives details of existing generating stations, and the Map shows
the 220 kV and 110 kV grid as it is expected to be in FY 1978.
Use of Peat and the Future of Peat Stations
2.11      The Peat Board, a govermental agency, started intensive develop-
ment of the bogs some 20 years ago with the goal of lessening the country's
dependence on imported fuel. Two-thirds of Ireland's peat production (about
4 million tons annually) is consumed in power stations of the ESB; most of
the remainder is sold as briquettes for domestic and industrial uses. ESB
has to buy peat at rates fixed by the Peat Board, with the approval of the
Government. A recent survey indicated that there is enough peat on the
bogs to fuel ESB's peat-fired stations until the late 1980s.
2.12      In FY 1971 the average cost of fuel per kWh generated at peat-
burning stations wqas 0.362 new pence (0.9450). Fuel-cost projections
assumed that the cost of oil will rise after the end of 1971, when ESB's
present long-term fuel contract expired, from L5 to about 19 per ton,
and that the cost of peat will increase at the rate of 5% per annum. On
this basis, the comparative costs per kWh generated at peat-fired and
oil-fired stations will be 0.460 new pence (1.20¢) and 0.205 new pence (0.5354)
respectively in FY 1977. A dry summer brings a good harvest of peat, which
has the effect of increasing ESB's generating costs, because ESB has a commit-
ment to buy all the peat that is delivered to its power stations. But the
percentage of electricity generated by burning peat is declining - from 32.4%
in FY 1971 to an estimated 19.8% in FY 1977 - as system size increases.
2.13      ESB is installing a second 40 MW peat-fired generating unit at
its Shannonbridge station. This unit, together with existing peat-burning
stations is expected to utilize the remaining peat resources fully and no
further investments in new peat-burning stations are proposed.
Interconnection with Northern Ireland
2.14      An agreement setting forth the objectives and providing for an
interconnection between the grids of ESB and the Northern Ireland Joint
Electricity Authority (NIJEA) was made in 1967. The two 275 kV circuits



-5-
comprising the interconnection have a capacity of 300 MW. The interconnec-
tion is affording considerable economic advantages to both utilities, the
most notable being a striking reduction in reserve generating plant with
a consequent reduction in capital investment, and improvement in service
security. Moreover, it has assisted in maintaining proper service during
emergencies. Annex 6 shows the advantages to be gained by interconnection.
Program of Development
2.15      ESB's program for new generating plant until FY 1978 is shown
below.  All plant up to and including Tarbert No. 4 has been committed.

1977                Tarbert No. 4               1 x 250 MW   Oil-fired
1978                Erne No. 5                  1 x 25 MW    Hydro
1978                Pigeon House 'B' No. 3      1 x 250 MW   Oil-fired
The program beyond 1978 is uncertain. The nuclear power station shown in
1979 (Annex 5) is a possibility which is now under preliminary consideration.
2.16      The 220 kV transmission system is being extended by installing
single-circuit 220 kV transmission lines between Tarbert and Killonan, Tarbert
and Knockraha, and Knockraha and Dublin. The 110 kV transmission system
will be extended each year as required, and there will continue to be a
systematic expansion of distribution facilities. From FY 1972 until FY 1978,
ESB's total investment is expected to be L234 million: 33% for generation,
17% for transmission and 50% for distribution - a reasonable division.

3. THE PROJECT
3.01      The Project would consist of a 250 MW extension (No. 4 unit) to
Tarbert generating station. Construction has started recently on the
Tarbert No. 3 unit; No. 4 unit would be identical to it, consisting of an
oil-fired boiler and a tandem-compgound turbine-generator operating at steam
conditions of 2,350 psi and 1,000 F. The generator would be linked through
a 300 MVA transformer to a 220 kV outdoor switchyard. Its output would be
transmitted to ESB's grid at Killonan and Knockraha over about 100 miles
of 220 kV lines which are to be constructed as part of the Project.

3.03      The cost estimate was prepared by ESB about April 1971. This has
been updated to cover increases in costs since that time and known base
prices for the boiler and turbine generators, orders for which have since
been placed (para. 3.05). Civil engineering costs are based on unit prices
for similar works now being carried out for the extensions at Pigeon House 'B'
and other generating station construction. The estimated costs of other
equipment and transmission lines have been based on prices now being paid
for similar items elsewhere in ESB-'s system.  An allowance of 8%-has been
included for physical contingencies. This will be adequate considering
the experience with similar units. The boiler and turbine generator prices
are subject to escalation; there is a ceiling of 16% for the boilers, but
none for the turbine generator not financed by the Bank, under the provisions
of the options far their purchase (para. 3.05). Accordingly, an allowance
averaging about 20% has been included to cover price escalation for plant
(i.e. about 6% per year). The estimated total cost of the Project is US$40.52
million equivalent.  The estimated unit cost of Tarbert No. 4, eikluding interest



- 7 -
during construction, is US$140/kW. This is reasonable, reflecting in part
that site improvement and similar costs already committed for Tarbert No. 3
construction are not included in the cost of Tarbert No. 4.
Amount of the Proposed Loan
3.04      The amount proposed for the loan is US$15.0 million equivalent.
It would finance the boiler and miscellaneous thermal plant equipment,
substation equipment and transmission lines, and would cover 64% of the
total foreign exchange requirements.
Procurement and Disbursements
3.05      ESB has three identical 250 MW units in its program and has taken
advantage of the financial benefits from ordering more than one unit at a
time. When bids were invited in August 1970 for the boiler and turbine-
generator for Tarbert No. 3 unit (Loan No. 726-IRE), provision was included
for the simultaneous purchase of an additional boiler and turbine-generator.
Procurement was in accordance with international competitive bidding proce-
dures. With the Bank's concurrence, an order was placed in June 1971 with
M.A.N. of Germarn, the lowest evaluated bidder, for the Tarbert No. 3,
and No. 4 (the Project) boilers. It is planned to purchase the (Project)
No. 4 turbine-generator with a supplier's credit, in order to complete
the financial plan. The Executive Directors have been kept informed of
the status of procurement through the Monthly Operational Summary.
3.06      The remaining goods financed by the loan would be procured on
the basis of international competitive bidding, except for components
required to be compatible with existing equipment, and items of minor
cost for which such bidding would be impractical, the total cost of both
of which should not exceed US$500,000 equivalent. Irish manufacturers
would be permitted to bid for Bank-financed equipment with 15% preference.
The value of such orders is unlikely to exceed US$1,000,000 equivalent.  The
procurement arrangements are similar to those for the last loan, No. 726-IRE.
3.07      Disbursements would be made for the full foreign exchange costs
of imported equipment. For orders placed with Irish manufacturers, disburse-
ments would be made for 70% of expenditures in local currency, representing
the estimated average foreign exchange component of such expenditures.
3.08      Expenditure prior to the signing of the loan agreement would not
be eligible for reimbursement. Should the Project be completed for less
than the estimated cost, any undisbursed amount of the loan would be cancelled
unless there were good grounds for applying savings to related works. Estimated
disbursements, by quarters, are given in Annex 4.
Engineering
3.09      ESB's engineering staff has had considerable experience in design-
ing and supervising the construction of large thermal power stations - it
is undertaking engineering for Tarbert No. 3 unit - and is therefore capable
of undertaking the engineering for the Project without consultant's help.
The unit would be commissioned in calendar 1976.



-8-
Ecological Aspects
3.10      No ecological problems are expected.  Cooling water is available
from the Shannon estuary; the volume required would be small in relation
to the river flow, so marine life would not be affected. Sulphur dioxide
and other contaminants in the waste boiler gases would be dispersed by a
tall stack, the height of which is determined by the concentrations
tolerable at ground level when burning oil of average sulphur content.
Tolerable concentrations have not yet been universally agreed, and no
legislation on the subject exists in Ireland. The basis for the disposi-
tion of waste gases has been assessed from a study of international practice.

4.  JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Load Forecasts
4.01      Tarbert No. 4's generating capacity is necessary to meet market
conditions expected at about the time the unit would come into service,
with the generation security standard (as defined in Annex 6) set by ESB
and NIJEA.
4.02      For the decade ending 1980, ESB has projected an annual growth
rate of 10% (see Annexes 5 and 6), a forecast which is justified. Analysis
over successive five-year periods since 1957-1962 revealed a steady upward
trend ranging from 8.2% in that first period to 10.6% in 1965-1970.
4.03      Substantial increases in sales in the past three years (12% in
FY 1969 and 10% in FY 1970 and 1971) give every indication that this rate
of growth will be maintained. In fact, recent growth in industrial sales
and continuing enquiries from industrial consumers about future require-
ments indicate that the 10% forecast could be too low. However, growth
and accumulated error are reviewed annually and planning targets adjusted
if necessary.
Least-cost Solution
4.04      Following a determination by ESB and NIJEA of the generating
capacity required in their respective systems until FY 1978 (Annex 6),
ESB considered a number of alternative programs involving generating units
of various sizes, and existing or new sites. Cost analysis of the alter-
natives showed that the proposed program (para. 2.15) is the least-cost
solution on a present-worth basis using discount rates up to 12%.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
4.05      The internal financial rate of return (Annex 7) for Tarbert
No. 4 is the discount rate at which the present worth of its cost, in-
cluding operating charges but excluding taxes and depreciation, is equal
to the present worth of the revenues to be obtained over its life.
Charges include the cost of transmission and distribution attributable
to the Project. The revenues attributed to it are valued at the average
rates in force, 1.02 pence per kWh in FY 1977 and 1.01 pence per kWh
thereafter. On this basis, a rate of return of 16% is indicated. This
is satisfactory.



- 10 -
5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
5.01      Until FY 1971, ESB's financial position has been satisfactory,
This was attributable to the way the Government applied, in cooperation
with ESB, the tariff provisions of the Act (para. 2.07). ESB was able
to generate sufficient internal funds to finance between 30% and 40% of
its investment program, a satisfactory level. However, comparatively
unfavorable FY 1971 financial results, and anti-inflationary efforts of
the Government reflected in the inadequate rate increase allowed ESB,
have altered the prospect for continued application of the tariff pro-
visions of the Act as in the past. Undertakings in the proposed loan
which would ensure ESB maintaining a viable financial position in the
future were therefore agreed upon during negotiations (para. 5.04).
Past and Present Financial Situation
5.02      Due to a conservative management policy and adequate application
of the tariff provisions of the 1927 Act, ESB's financial situation until
FY 1971 was satisfactory. The FY 1971 results, however, were less favor-
able than the ones of the preceding years. The share of investment
financing through internally generated funds dropped from about 30% to
15%g  the rate of return on net fixed assets in operation decreased from
7% in FY 1970 to 5.7% and the operating ratio rose from 78% to 83%. This
was due partly to inflationary tendencies which resulted in sharp increases
in the cost of operation, maintenance and administration, and which could
not be totally offset by additional revenues from increased sales (Annex 9).
5.03      In spite of the unfavorable FY 1971 results, the Government, in
an attempt to dampen inflation, refused to permit ESB to raise its tariffs
by the 10% requested and granted only a 7% rate increase in July 1971,
indicating that future tariff applications would be examined in the context
of economic conditions and the Government's economic policy. This changing
attitude of the Government toward ESB could adversely affect ESB's future
financial position. An explioit rate covenant was therefore agreed upon
during negotiations.
5.04      A covenant based on a contribution to investment concept rather
than the more usual rate of return concept reflects most closely the
provisions of the Act (para. 2.07 d), lies within its framework, and,
accordingly, is preferred by ESB.  The Government and ESB, therefore, agreed
during negotiations to set tariffs so that, commencing with SSB's fiscal year
1973, 40% of ESB's development program over any consecutive three-years'
period consisting of one actual and two forecast years would be financed
by internal cash generation, including capital contributions (para. 5.07).
This would provide sufficient funds for investment from internal resources
to result in a well-balanced financial plan for development. The rates
of return implied by such a covenant would be satisfactory (Annex 9).

Total Capitalization                 185.7             100%
5.06      The equity consists of reserves built up from retained earnings
and of non-repayable Government financing of rural electrification, accumu-
lated surpluses realized through under-par repurchase of own stock, etc.
Government repayable advances were made prior to 1954 under the Act and its
amendments, and consist of 50-year loans at an annual rate of interest
averaging about 4.5%.  At that time the Government was essentially the
only source of credit for ESB, but the amendment of 1954 authorized ESB
to borrow money by issuing redeemable stock and other types of securities,
subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance. Since then, ESB has
borrowed about 1679 million on the local market at interest rates between
5% and 9.5%, 10 to 20 years' term. In addition to Bank Loans 591-IRE and
726-IRE (US$14.5 million and US$20.0 million respectively, two foreign
loans had been placed in Germany for 15.7 million and L8.5 million equiva-
lent, repayable over 15 years including a grace period of 9- years, with
interest rates of 6 3/4% and 7 3/4%, and three suppliers' credits totalling
L7.8 million, repayable over 5 to 10 years with interest rates between
5 3/8% and 6.6%. Recently, part of the before mentioned foreign debt was
converted into loans from the Irish Central Bank.
Financing Plan
5.07      Annex 10 shows the detailed financing plan of ESB for FY 1972
through FY 1978 which assumes the contribution to investment covenant
(para. 5.04) to be in force. A condensed version for the estimated project
construction period (FY 1973 through FY 1977) is given below:

5.08      During construction of the Project, internal cash generation is
expected to finance about 35% of the investment program. This amount is
expected to increase to about 40% when capital contributions are taken
into account. These contributions include rural subsidies (3% of the
financing plan), which are agreed upon with the Government. ESB expects to
obtain more funds from this source than in the past. The proposed loan
and the remaining balance of IBRD Loans 591-IRE and 726-IRE account for
about 7%. Long and medium-term redeemable stock issues, which are assumed
not to exceed L16 million per year, are expected to cover about 39%.
About 14% is expected to be financed by suppliers' credits and future loans.
Suppliers' credits, which in part are already contracted (portion not yet
drawn down L3 million), include a credit of L3.6 million assumed for Tarbert
No. 4 turbine-generator (para. 3.05).
Future Financial Situation
5.09      ESB's future financial outlook is satisfactory.  Revenues fore-
casts for FY 1972-1978 assume a further 7% tariff increase from April 1,
1972; an application for it will be filed by ESB which expects prompt
approval by the Government. Average revenue is expected to rise from
0.91 pence per kWh in FY 1971 to 1.07 pence per kWh in FY 1973, then to
fall gradual)ly to 1.01 pence per kWh in FY 1978 reflecting proportionately
higher sales in the lower tariff brackets.
5.10      ESB has been purchasing fuel oil covering 85% to 90% of its present
requirements at L5 per ton on the basis of a long term contract. The remain-
ing fuel oil requirements are being procured on a spot-price basis averaging
about L7 per ton, The long term contract expired on December 31, 1971
and a new contract is being negotiated. The financial projections have been
based on a price of L9 per ton reflecting expectations of the fuel price in
a future long-term contract.  The prices for coal and peat are based on
present figures increased 5% annually over the forecast period reflecting
price trends for them. Estimates for other operating, maintenance and
administrative expenses are projected on the basis of past experience and
include a 7% annual increase in salaries and wages. These assumptions are
reasonable.
5.11      The forecast ratio of current assets to current liabilities
averages 1.9 throughout the period under review. The ratio of long-term
debt to total capitalization, which was 78% at the end of FY 1971, is
expected to decrease gradually to a level of 68% in FY 1978, as retained
earnings increase. Debt service coverage by internal sources varies
between 1.3 and 1.6 during the period. No debt service coverage covenant
has been included in the loans with ESB since the revenues from sales of
power according to the Act (para. 2.07) have to be sufficient to cover
amortization in addition to depreciation, a stipulation which by itself
ensures the availability of sufficient internal funds for meeting debt
service requirements.
5.12      The return on average net fixed assets in operation is expected
to be 8.2% in FY 1972, a strong improvement over the 5.7% return of FY 1971.



- 14 -
It should be in the range of 9-9.5% during the forecast period (Annex 9).
Internal cash resources, including capital contributions, should contri-
bute 40% toward total expenditure on construction in the period, in accord-
ance with the tariff covenant.
Accounting and Audit
5.13      The Act requires that ESB's accounts be audited annually by
qualified auditors appointed by the Government. For several years, the
firm of Kennedy, Crowley & Co., chartered accountants of Ireland, has been
appointed, with the Bank's agreement, under the provisions of both previous
loans. Such arrangements will be continued, and the covenant repeated in
the proposed loan.
Sinking Fund
5.14      The terms of ESB's redeemable stock (35% of the FY 1971 capitali-
zation) require that certain sums be set aside annually from revenues and
allocated to a sinking fund. Purchases of sinking fund investments and
regular and premature amortization payments are being made from this fund.
5.15      Sinking fund requirements need to be carefully calculated in order
to accumulate sufficient funds for paying back redeemable stock at maturity.
Before 1958, ESB did not always observe this principle; for this reason
Loan 591-IRE required -- and Loan 726-IRE repeated for longer than 15 year
issues -- that charges should be made each year sufficient to ensure full
repayment of all stock issues, created after 1958, by their latest redemp-
tion dates. However, the situation on the domestic capital market became
tight after 1969; the Bank therefore agreed in Loan 726-IRE to ease this
covenant by permitting sinking fund allocations on a 15-year basis for
stock issues of 15-years or shorter maturity, provided the total of such
stock, which presently amounts to 5% of debt outstanding, does not exceed
20% of the total debt outstanding at any year. The relevant covenant of
Loan 726-IRE is repeated in the proposed loan.
5.16      Out of the redeemable stock issued before 1958, about 16.5 million
will fall due in FY 1976 and about .2.3 million in FY 1977 because of
insufficient sinking fund allocations. ESB, however, believes that it
will have no problem to in effect extend the maturity of such issues by
rolling them over for shorter term issues, without impairing its borrowing
power in the domestic market.
Depreciation
5.17      Depreciation charges are presently calculated using the sinking
fund method with a notional interest rate of 2.5%. For quite some time ESB
has been considering changing to the straight-line method and at the same
time reviewing the adequacy of the useful lives of its assets. A study in
this respect has been carried out within ESB, the results of which will be
submitted to the Government for approval shortly. Since ESB is confident
it will be permitted to introduce the new method and rates conmencing FI 1972
(see Annex 9), they have been used in the financial projections. Depreciation
charges thus computed would increase only by about 0.2% of the asset value.

6. AGREEMETS REACHED AND RECOMMENDAT IONS
6.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  the Government agreed to permit ESB to set tariffs at levels
sufficient to cover all operating costs, depreciation,
interest chargeable against revenues, amortization and
sinking fund allocations in excess of depreciation, if
applicable, and taxes, if any, and to provide together with
revenues from capital contributions, an average of at least
40% of the cost of expansion (including interest during
construction) during any three-year period consisting of
one actual and two forecast years, commencing FY 1973
(para. 5.04).
Furthermore, Government and ESB agreed to continue to live up to
the following stipulations:
(a)  any changes made in the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927 as
amended, which in the opinion of the Bank adversely affect
the Project or the financial condition of the Electricity
Supply Board would constitute an event of default (para. 2.06);
(b)  qualified independent auditors acceptable to the Bank shall
be appointed (para. 5.13);
(c)  adequate sinking fund provisions for the repayment of stock
issues, created by ESB after 1958 shall be made, by the
latest applicable redemption dates, except that for any
stock issue of fifteen years or less, the latest redemption
date for the purpose of the sinking fund shall be a date not
more than fifteen years from the date of issue (para. 5.15);
(d)  the total of stock issues of fifteen years or less shall not
exceed 20% of the total borrowings outstanding in any given
year without prior consultation with the Bank (para. 5.15).
6.02      The Project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$15 million,
for a term of 17 years including a 5-year grace period.

ANNEX 6
Page2  of 3 pages
Determination of Required Generating Capacity
Generation Security Standard
The ESB's generation security standard and that of the NIJEA are
based on a risk of failing to meet demand once in fifteen years. This means
that in the long run, once in every fifteen years there will be insufficient
plant capacity available to meet the daily peak even when all the spinning
reserve has been utilized. Load restriction is, therefore, inescapable on
that day.   Since the capacity of a generating unit could form an appreciable
proportion of the total system, it is not possible to maintain a constant
risk from year to year, and in the case of the ESB and the NIJEA the risk
averaged over five years is expected to meet the standard. For comparison,
the security standards adopted by some other countries are shown below:

Netherlands                    300 yrs.
Forced Outages
Probability analysis is used to assess whether a given plant
program will meet the generation security standard. In order to make this
assessment,a forced outage figure must be assigned to each generating unit,
specifying the probability that that particular unit will be unavailable to
meet peak demand on the particular day on which the trial is made.  Careful
records of plant outage are kept and, as a result, future forced outages
of existing plant can be estimated with some confidence.  For the 120 MW
and 250 NW units of which ESB has no direct experience it draws on the
experience of electricity authorities in Britain, France, Germany and the
U.S.
Determination of Required Generating Capacity
Until 1961, the total capacity needed in the ESB system was deter-
mined by the capacity of thermal plant needed to supply back-up energy for
the hydro and peat-fueled plants, both of which are weather-dependent.
Thermal capacity sufficient for this purpose was also sufficient to meet
peak demands. After 1961, as the proportion of hydro and peat-fueled
stations declined, peak demand became the criterion.  Since 1964, ESB's
System Operations Department (see Annex 1) has used a computer to develop
advanced procedures in the planning of its generation and construction
programs.

The method used for programming the construction of generating
capacity for the joint system of the ESB and the NIJhU involves a demand
forecast, using as input 10% growth in generation (kWh) and the historical
relationship between annual generation and the 50 highest peaks occurring
during the year. Generating plant is then fitted to the demand curve
using the historical outage data referred to above, until a system is
developed which has a probability of failing to meet peak demand on not
more than one day in 1 years.
The total generating plant required is shared between the
systems of the ESB and the NIJEL in such a manner that, should the inter-
connection between the systems become unavailable, there would be equal
risk of failing to meet the peak in the separate systems.

ANNEX 7
Internal Financial Rate of Return
The method followed to determine the internal financial rate
of returm on the Project consists of discounting the net cost/benefit
stream attributable to the Project, to find the rate at which the present
value of the stream becomes zero. In the calculation, the following
elements have been taken into consideration:
Costs
(i) capital investments, net of all duties and taxes, in
the unit and associated transmission and distribution
facilities necessary to convey the energy generated
by the unit to the consumers;
(ii) operating and maintenance costs (exclusive of depre-
ciation) for the unit and for the associated trans-
mission and distribution system;
(iii)  the cost of fuel used by the Project.
Benefits
Revenues attributable to the Project have been calculated at
the average sales price per kWh prevailing at the time it is commissioned
(1.02 p/kWh in FT 1977 and 1.01 p/kWh thereafter).
Return
On this basis, the equalizing discount rate is calculated to
be 16%.

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON INCOME STATEMENTS
1. Fuel
ESB has been purchasing fuel oil covering 85% to 90% of its present
requirements at 15 per ton on the basis of a long term contract. The remain-
ing fuel oil requirements are being procured on a spot-price basis averaging
about L7 per ton. The long term contract expired on December 31, 1971 and
a new contract is being negotiated. The financial projections have been
based on a price of W9 per ton reflecting expectations of the fuel price
in a future long-term contract. Cost of peat is based on the present prices
(M2.l9 per ton for milled peat and L4.05 per ton for sod peat) with the
assumption of annual price increases of 5% during the forecast period,
reflecting present pricing trends.
2.  Operation, Maintenance, Administration
The projections for the salaries and wages component included in
the operation, maintenance and administration costs, assume an annual increase
of 7%, which ESB thinks sufficient to cover the cost of additional personnel
and wage increases. Prices for material have been assumed to increase 5%
per year over the forecast period.
3. Depreciation
(a) The method presently used by ESB for computing depreciation
charges is based on the concept that the original cost of assets
is regarded as the value to be recovered by charging depreciation,
on the basis of an annual fixed sum which, if invested at a
theoretical 2.5% interest, would produce the original cost by
the end of the assumed life of the asset (sinking fund method).
The annual depreciation charge therefore consists of two elements,
an annual fixed charge, and a sum representing the interest deemed
to have been earned. Compared with the equal annual charges of
the straight-line method, the sum of the two elements gives a
lower charge during the early life of an asset which gradually
increases throughout its lifetime.
(b) It is furthermore the Board's practice to continue depreciation
contributions on assets which remain in service after the
expiration of their hypothetical lives.
(c) A study has been carried out within ESB aiming at introducing the
straight-line method for calculating depreciation charges and at
the same time adapting the useful lives of the various asset
categories according to internationally acknowledged standards.
The effect of adopting these would be to increase the average
annual depreciation rate by a small amount (0.2%), which would
result in a slightly higher internal cash generation. Following
is a comparison of asset lives presently used and the suggested
changes.

ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BOARD
NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON FORECAST
SOURCES AND APPLICATIONS OF FUNDS
1. Government Subsidies for Rural Electrification
The Government has directed ESB to pursue a policy of rural
electrification, and has agreed to subsidize part of the capital outlay
involved. According to the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act 1968,
ESB's total capital expenditures for rural electrification must not
exceed E, 50 million. At the present rate of investment, this limit is
likely to be reached during FY 1972, so that ESB has asked the Government
to raise the limit and to grant further subsidies to ensure completion
of the program. The Government has agreed to raise the limit by L6 18
million, of which it will subsidize b 10 million in equal instalments.
2. Sinking Fund
The terms of ESB's redeemable stock require sums to be set
aside from revenue each year for payment of interest to the stockholders
and to contribute to a sinking fund, from which purchase of sinking fund
investments, and payments for regular and premature repayments are made.
The terms permit purchase of stock before maturity if the market price is
at or below par. ESB has been using this opportunity of premature amor-
tization extensively, which explains the comparatively low value of the
sinking fund (I 2.8 million in FY 1971) in its books. For the projections
it has been assumed that the portion of the annual allocation remaining
after paying interest is totally used for the premature purchase of stock.
The figures for "Sinking Fund Reserve" and "Sinking Fund Investment"
therefore have been kept unchanged throughout the forecast period.
3. Contributions to Investment
ESB's tariffs should be set at levels which, commencing FY 1972,
provide, after covering all annual costs including depreciation, interest,
and amortization and sinking fund allocations in excess of depreciation,
together with capital contributions, an average of at least hO4< of the
cost of investment over any consecutive three-year period, comprising the
actual and two future years. The financial projections show that this
target is expected to be met during the forecast period as follows:
