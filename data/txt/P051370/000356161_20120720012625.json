   satisfactory; risk to development outcome was negligible;\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: strong government ownership is critical,\n            particularly with reform- oriented projects. Close\n            coordination and collaboration with Asian Development Bank\n            (ADB) and other agencies in supporting implementation\n            aspects of the program helped keep key activities on track.\n            Providing continuous guidance and actively engaging in the\n            overall policy dialogue in the sector was crucial in\n            ensuring consistency of the messages being delivered to the\n            government. Comprehensive and careful project design greatly\n            facilitates project implementation. Reflecting in-kind\n            government contribution as co-financing may lead to problems\n            when auditing the project, consequently creating repeated\n            issues with audit performance and acceptance of audit\n            reports. Efficient use of funds and technical expertise is\n            fully recommended and should be recognized."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
