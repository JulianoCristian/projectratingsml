                                    Restructuring Paper


1.      The closing date for the Project will be extended from June 30, 2011 until December 31,
2011 to provide time for implementation and completion of all activities supported by the Credit
and the Grant and to ensure continuity of the Project until such time as the Health System
Improvement Project (Health III), which was approved by the Board on April 7, 2011, will
become effective and fully launched. This will be the second extension of the project with a
cumulative extension of 18 months.

2.        A reallocation of the Credit and Grant proceeds is needed in order to accommodate
project savings occurred due to SDR-USD exchange rate variation and to reflect changes, which
took place during Project implementation. The proposed reallocation does not have an impact on
the environmental and social safeguards. The favorable appreciation (savings of SDR 1.16
million) gives an opportunity to procure information technology equipment and software to
strengthen the management information system (MIS) capacity of the MOH, which will improve
its decision-making capacity. The Project procurement plan has been updated and is found to be
satisfactory.

3.       The requested reallocation does not involve any changes to the Project Development
Objective (PDO) or associated outcome targets. The use of the cost savings is consistent with the
original project objectives. The proposed revised Disbursement Schedule of the Credit and the
Grant is included in Attachment 1. The extension and the reallocation have been requested by
letter of April 28, 2011 from the Borrower.

4.       The Project is making good progress and is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory” with
respect to Development Objectives (DO) and Implementation Progress (IP). There is continued
progress in achieving the PDO as evidenced by the latest update of Key Performance Indicators
as shown in Attachment 2. The extension is also consistent with OP/BP 13.30, namely that (a)
the Project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of the Borrower and
implementing agencies is satisfactory; (c) the implementing agencies have an action plan for the
completion of the Credit and the Grant satisfactory to the Bank; and (d) there are no outstanding
audit reports and financial management procedures are in compliance with Bank requirements.
Disbursements under the Credit have reached SDR 22.5 million (or 83.5 percent of the total credit
allocation). Commitments are estimated at SDR 1.5 million, which brings the
disbursement/commitment rate to 89 percent of the total credit amount. Disbursements under the
Grant have reached over SDR 0.3 million (or 75.6 percent of the total grant allocation).

5.      The main activities that are to be completed by the proposed closing date of December
31, 2011, under the Credit are: (a) procurement of IT equipment, including servers for the
Ministry of Health (MOH) and Sanitary and Epidemiologic Services facilities (SES) to monitor
infectious diseases; (b) capacity building for the MOH and the SES departments on the use of the

                                               3
developed infectious disease monitoring software; (c) procurement of biological safety cabinets
for laboratories of the SES; (d) procurement of laboratory, medical equipment and furniture for
health facilities (rural medical centers, central rayon hospitals, city policlinics); (e) procurement
of equipment, computers for training centers of medical institutes; (f) workshops on basic
management for financial managers and primary care center managers, economists, heads of city
health departments and pilot urban areas and on hospital rationalization for heads of oblast
departments; and (g) evaluation of the iron supplementation program.

6.       In addition, the following activities to support the Health III Project are also planned to
be completed by the proposed closing date: (a) surveys to collect baseline data for the Health III
Project; and (b) technical assistance for the development of hospital plans for construction and
rehabilitation. These activities were introduced as part of a Level II restructuring of this Project
that was approved in June 2010.

7.       Several technical assistance activities planned under the Grant have been financed by
other international partners (Attachment 3), resulting in an undisbursed balance of over SDR
97,000. Accordingly, it is proposed to use this savings to: (a) conduct additional training
activities of middle level medical personnel of AIDS centers; (b) provide technical assistance in
the area of prevention and care of HIV infection; and (c) produce HIV/AIDS specific teaching
aids for general practitioners. All other activities planned under the Grant have been completed.

              Following re-classification of rural and urban population in 2009 according to Cabinet of Ministry’s Decree of 2009, it is estimated that more than 3 million people are now considered part of the urban
            population. However, for the purpose of comparability, the original denominator (of more than 17 million people) for the total rural population remains.
            3
              See footnote 1. In addition, 2009 data should not necessarily be considered negatively against target given the emphasis on preventive screening programs (i.e. NCDs, reproductive and child health) being
            conducted in the country, which leads to earlier identification of diseases and therefore to hospitalization. Data on hospitalization of patients under said programs cannot be extrapolated from hospitalization
            cases from hospitals registries.

             Initial plan was to equip SVPs with communication devices under Health 2. However, in 2007, Government required its local regulatory bodies (khokimiats) to use their budget to supply SVPs with various
            modes of communication (wire, mobile, etc.). MoH should consider using Health 2 loan funds to finance the remaining need.
