CROWN LANDS DEVEIOPMENT
SUMThARY
i.        The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has applied for a Bank
loan to help finance the first stage of its proposed Crown Lands Develop-
ment Project, a settlement scheme which aims at increased domestic agri-
cultural production.
ii.       Agriculture, including forestry and fisheries, forms only a
relatively small proportion of the economy of Trinidad and Tobago, which
is based mainly on petroleum, and there is scope for a substantial increase
in output. About 100,000 acres of goverment land - so called Crown Land -
appear suitable for development.
iii.      The project is the development of about 12,000 acres of Crown
Land into about 1,800 dairy, pig, treecrop, vegetable, food and tobacco
farms, and the establishment of related facilities. About 1,800 farm
families, representing one percent of the total population, would be
settled on these farms on the basis of criteria agreed with the Bank.
iv.       This settlement scheme involves production and management
practices and techniques, particularly in livestock production, which
have not been fully tested in Trinidad. There is sufficient experience,
principally in Puerto Rico, however, to indicate that they can be
successfully applied in Trinidad.
v.        The cost of the project is estimated at US$ 11.L million.  The
foreign exchange component would be about 47 percent. The Bank loan would
cover 14 percent of the cost and the balance would be provided by par-
ticipating farmers, private enterprise, the Canadian Government and the
Government of Trinidad and Tobago, wJhich would be the borrower.
vi.       A Project Director, acceptable to the Bank, has been appointed.
He would be assisted by a staff of about 30 local agricultural technicians.
In addition, five technical experts and one agricultural credit expert
would be recruited.
vii.      The repayment of farmers' obligations for project development
costs would be channelled through a new division in the Agricultural
Credit Bank. The overall average annual net return to the economy of
Trinidad discounted over the life of the project would be about 16 per-
cent. The project wiould be suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 5.0 million
to be repaid in 23 years including five years of grace.

I, INTRODUCTION
1.        The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has applied for a Bank loan
to help finance the first stage of its Crown Lands Development Project, a
settlement scheme for bringing unused land into production, for developing
smallholder farm production systems and for training under-employed persons
as farm operators. It would increase domestic farm production and fruit
exports and would serve as demonstration for further development. An FAO
project preparation mission visited Trinidad in August 1965. This appraisal
report is based on the findings of a Bank mission to Trinidad in April 1966,
composed of Messrs. G.F. Darnell and LoC.H. Helmers (of the Bank), Mr. C.Y.
Hsu (consultant to the Bank) and Messrs. M. Benjamin and M. Groenewold (of
FAO), and a second mission in August 1966, composed of Mr. L.C.H. Helmers
(of the Bank) and Mr. C.P. McMeekan (consultant to the Bank).
II. BACKGROUND
2.        The islands of Trinidad and Tobago became a sovereign state in
1962. Trinidad has an area of 1,864 square miles, the average length of
the island being 50 miles and its breadth 37 miles. At its nearest point,
Trinidad is only seven miles from Venezuela. Tobago has an area of 116
square miles and lies approximately 20 miles to the northeast of Trinidad.
3.        Trinidad has considerable variation in rainfall and temperature.
Annual rainfall varies from 35 to 66 inches in the low rainfall and 86 to
157 inches in the high rainfall areas. Both areas have a distinct dry
season from January to April - with often less than three inches of rain
per month. The maximum average monthly temperature is 900 in February.
Tobago has a very similar climate but temperatures are lower due to the
sea breezes. Hurricanes are rare in Trinidad but slightly more frequent
in Tobago. Considerable damage was caused in Tobago by the last hurricane
(1963).
l.        Population in Trinidad is estimated at 950,000; in Tobago at
35,000. Annual rate of increase is. around three percent. Per capita
income of Trinidad and Tobago, estimated at about US$ 500 for 1965, is
relatively high. Rate of growth of GNP has slowed down from nearly nine
percent in the fifties to only three percent in recent years because of
the reduced rate of growth of refinery investment and oil production.
During 1955-196h, retail prices increased by 21 percent and wage rates
doubled. Unemployment is around 14 percent and under-employment affects
25 to 40 percent of the working population. Foreign exchange reserves have
declined in the last two years and amounted in 1965 to slightly over three
months' imports. The Governmentts current budget, which showed a surplus
during 1958-1962, was just in balance in 1965.



- 2 -
5.        Total lanc area of Trinidad and Tobago is about 1,267,000 acres,
of which Tobago acc ints for 74,000, or 6.0 perce±it.  Crops and pastures
account for about 2l percent of total land area, of which only approximately
four percent is down to grass. About 50 percent of the land is in forests
and secondary growth.  The agricultural area (crops and pastures) amounts to
0.37 acre per capita which is quite low.   The Government owns about 571,000
acres, of which 95 percent is forests and secondary growth. Of this about
100,000 acres appear suitable for agricultural development.
6.        AgricultLLre, including forestry and fisheries, forms only a
small proportion of the economr of Trinidad and Tobago.   Its contribution
to gross national product, though increasing in absolute terms, fell from
about 17 percent in 1953 to ten percent in 1965. Principal agricultural
export products are sugar, cocoa, tree crops, coffee, bananas, and coconuts
Sugar and cocoa contribute about 33 percent ancd eight percent respectively
of the value of agricultural output. In addition to the export crops, a
relatively small area is planted to vegetable crops in the areas closest
to the towns. Sugar, coconuts and tree crops are the only products grown on
large estates, which account for about two-thirds of total output of these
crops. The remainder is grown on small peasant farms. It is estimated
that about 90 percent of all farms are less than 20 acres, and in general
their productivity is low.
7.        Most livestock is reared on peasant farms.   The dairy industry
is still in its infancy. The number of cows for milk production is
estimated at about 15,000, 80 percent of which are on farms with less than
four cows. The number of half bred and pure bred dairy cattle probably
does not exceed 1,500.  Domestic milk production, for which reliable data
is not available, is probably about one-tenth of local consumption; the
rest, some 22.0 million gallons in terms of liquid milk equivalent (includ-
ing cheese and butter products), is imported at a cost of about TT$ 14
million annually. Total beef production is estimated at about 2.6 million
pounds. A considerable proportion comes from water buffalo, estimated to
number about 4,000 head. Imports of meat (beef and pork) are about
18 million pounds annually, at a cost of TT$ 9.5 million. In the last
three years, poultry imports have been replaced by local production
estimated at over ten million pounds of poultry meat per year. Pig produc-
tion is still very small, about two million pounds of pork per year.
80        About 21 percent of the working population is employed in
agriculture, forestry and fishery. Food imports, representi-ng almost
one-fourth of total imports (excluding crude oil for the refining industry)
are high. There is therefore considerable scope for substitution of imports
by increased domestic agricultural production.
9.        The objectives of the government program for agricultural develop-
ment are to diversify and increase output and to provide additional employ-
ment opportunities. It is the intention to establish efficient small and



- 3 -
medium sized farms aimed at the production of increasing quantities of
milk, pork, vegetables, root crops, pulses, tree crops and tobacco for the
local market. At the same time, the agricultu-ral program will also
benefit industrial development through local processing of such products
for home consumption and export. The Crown Lands Development Project is
a central feature of the Government's agricultural program.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
10.       The Governmentts original proposal, as endorsed by FAO, envisaged
development of 20,000 acres of government land - so-called Crown Land -
in twenty different locations. It called for land clearance, provision
of infrastructure and establishment of 2,400 dairy, pig breeding and
fattening, tree crops, vegetable, fooderop and tobacco farm units.   Some
700 dairy farms, with about 10,000 cows, would produce about five million
gallons of milk per annum. The Bank considers the dairy scheme too large
in relation to institutional capabilities, technical experience and
marketing facilities, and therefore proposes only 200 dairy farms to be
developed under this project. A second loan could be considered in ap-
proximately two years following a review of progress achieved.
11.       The Government would bring the land to any one of three distinct
stages of full, partial or basic development. Under full development
(dairy, pig and tree crops on uncultivated land) the Government would (1)
provide the infrastructure - water, roads and electricity; (2) clear the
land; and (3) carry out farm development work. In effect, the Government
would turn over to these farmers (mostly unemployed laborers) a going
concern planted with bearing trees or stocked with animals. Under partial
development (vegetables and food crops adjacent to existing holdings) the
farmers would carry out the farm development work with their own resources.
Under basic development (tobacco and food crops), the on-farm investments
would be financed by the tobacco companies or, in the case of food crops,
the farmers themselves leaving only the infrastructure to be financed by
the Government.

12.       Approximately 12,000 acres would be developed under the project
for the production of milk, pork, vegetables, food crops, tree crops and
tobacco, on about 1,800 farm units (see table above). Though small in
acreage, the dairy and pig units would have a higher production than
originally proposed by the Government. The project would directly benefit
about one per cent of the population. Locations of the project areas are
shown on the Map. Development plans would be subject to the approval of
the Bank.
13.       In order to supply the animals required, it is estimated that
4,000 head of dairy cattle would be imported. Of these about 600 head have
already been imported under a bilateral loan agreement with Canada and are
presently kept on Government farms. Another 600 head are still to be
supplied under this agreement. The rest would be purchased abroad. About
100 pigs would be imported to stock Government farms which would breed the
pigs required for distribution.
14.       In addition to this development work, various facilities would
be set up such as slaughtering and processing plants for pigs, collection,
processing and distribution centers for fresh milk, marketing units for the
vegetable and food crops, and a machinery pool for land clearing, development.

and maintenancs worlk. I ;ov-sion is also m -de foy experienced personnel
to give technical advice andi to inanage the marke ing Ullits. A separate
unit would be set ulp irn the Agricultural C: edit lank, under guidance
of an agriculttural credit expert, to record the :oans and to administer
the loan repayments by the farmers (paxagraphs 49-51)0
15.       Present legislation does not permit the transfer of Crown Lands
to private ownership. It is proposed that farmers be granted a probation-
ary tenancy until they have proved their ability to farm the units ef-
ficiently. They vwould subsequently be granted a 25-year lease with the
option of renewJal for an additional 25 years. These leases would be ter-
minated at any time if the tenant failed to follow the schedules of good
farming practices which would be included in the lease. Notwithstanding
these conditions, settlers are very interested in participating. In the
case of death of the farmer, the lease which cannot be subdivided would
be transferred to his successors.
16.       The phasing of the project is related to the ability of the
Government to provide the infrastructure and, where applicable, to carry
out the land clearance, the animal import program and the farm develop-
ment work. It is believed that the following phasing is realistic:

B. Technical Features
Dairying
17.       The dairy farming unit would have a minimum of 20 acres, about
five planted with elephant grass, fifteen with pangola grass and half
an acre reserved for buildings and facilities (see Annexes 1A and B).
The farms would be supplied in the first year with five Friesian in-calf
cows and 15 heifers. At full development in the fourth year, each
farm wiould have 20 cows and produce about 8,000 gallons of milk per annum;
it would also be able to sell about seven bull calves, four culled cows
and two breeding heifers every year (see Annexes 1A and B).
18.       About five farms would be established experimentally with
supplemental irrigation to determine w1hether such additional investment
would be worthwhile. All breeding would be by artificial insemination.
Storage for frozen semen and facilities for insemination would be provided.
Close technical supervision and advice would be essential to the proper
development of this dairy farming system.
Pig Breeding and Fattening
19.       The basic pig production unit would be a 5-acre farm with
adequate accommodation for sows and boars; farrowing, rearing and fat-
tening quarters; storage facilities; farmer's house, etc. Each farm
would be supplied initially with 12 locally procured gilts and one boar
about six months old. No further supply of breeding stock is contemplated.
Full herd development would be reached at the end of the second year with
two boars, 16 sows and eight gilts. Some 270 porkers, culled sows and
boars would then be marketed annually per farm. The total number of pig
farms to be developed would be 70. The projections are based upon a com-
bined breeding-fattening operation. However, if it is not possible to
select sufficient settlers capable of performing both breeding and fatten-
ing with the required efficiency, some farmers may engage in breeding alone
or fattening alone (see Annex 2).
20.       Gilts and boars for the 70 pig farms would be required as
follows:
Year 1   Year 2   Year 3   Year 4    Total
Gilts                  240      240      240      120      840
Boars                   20      20        20       10       70
Importation of 80 gilts and 16 boars would be sufficient to provide the
required foundation stoclc. Close technical control and advice would be



- 7 -
necessary to safeguard against losses due to mismanagement. For this
purpose, pig farms would be developed in blocks of 20-25 farms each,
with a sufficiently trained and experienced Field Assistancc conetantly
assigned to each block. Private firms would establish slaughtering,
storage and processing facilities and would buy the pigs produced on
project farms.
Tree Crops (Citrus)
21.       About 135 tree crop farms are contemplated, each a 10-acre
expansion of an existing farm. Half would grow oranges, the remainder
grapefruit. It would be five years before these farms come into pro-
duction. Yields per acre at full production, after the tenth year, would
be about 200 crates (80 lb. each) for oranges and 300 crates (90 lb.
each) for grapefruit. Detailed estimates are in Annexes 3 and 4.
Vegetable and Food Crops
22.       The total area under food and vegetable crops is expected to be
about 5,800 acres.  Of this, it is assumed that about 1,200 acres would
be in 3-acre vegetable farms and 4,600 acres in 5-acre farms producing
food crops such as yams, pumpkins, pulses and green corn (see Annex 5).
Acreage distribution is based on soil, topography, climate and market
potentials. The cropping pattern would be determined by the extension
service. The agricultural estimates and examples of the possible crop-
ping patterns are in Annex 5. Products would be sold through marketing
units, one for every 50 food or vegetable crop farms.
Tobacco
23,       Eighty 10-acre farms are planned. In any one year, due to crop
rotation, only five acres in each farm wvould be under tobacco, the re-
maining five acres being planted with food and vegetable crops. The West
Indian Tobacco Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the British-American Tobacco
Company, and the Federal Tobacco Co. Ltd., would (as for existing tobacco
farms) supply some of the on-farm investment (materials, barns, etc.)
and handle the technical supervision. Agreed produce prices would enable
the tobacco companies to recover their investment costs. Government in-
vestment would be in infrastructure only. Estimates are in Annex 6.
C. Cost Estimates
2h.       Total costs of the project are estimated at TT$ 19.5 million
(us$ 11.4 million) including ten percent contingencies. The following
table gives a breakdown by type of expenditure (figures rounded - see

The estimated foreign exchange cost of the project is TT$ 9.2 million
(Us$ 5.4 million) and amounts to about 47 percent of the total project
cost).
25.       The cost of land clearance, infrastructure, fencing and housing
is based on actual costs of work done in Trinidad. Pasture and orchard
development costs are based on agricultural estirmates provided in Trinidad
Livestock figures are based on CIF prices. The cost of the central
facilities such as the marketing units and machinery pool are estimated
according to a detailed breakdown of cost categories. The pig processing
facilities would be undertaken by private enterprise from their own
financial resources and the cost estimates are only tentative. The cost
of expatriate services which may be required is based on a four-year
development period. The cost estimates, subject to these qualifications,
are considered reasonable and the contingency adequate.
26.       A detailed breakdoin by cost categories and type of farm is
given in Annex 7B. The following table summarizes the breakdown which
includes a share of the cost of the investments in the marketing units
by type of production:

Total                  19,540       11,400      100
27.       The Government has started to develop the project areas and
11 pig farms and 11 dairy farms have been completed and contracts awarded
for 39 more houses in the Waller Field area. Work on access roads and
land clearing in the Victoria, Chatham, Fishing Pond and Palo Seco areas
have also been undertaken and eight dairy farms have been developed at
Carlsen Field. These items are not included in the proposed Project.
D. Proposed Financing
28.       The TT$ 19.5 million (US$ 11.4 million) estimated cost of the
project would be met as follows (in TT$ '000):

- 10 -
The proportion met by farmers and private enterprise is on the low side,
but is considered justified for a project designed to settle laborers and
peasant-farmers of limited means. The proposed Bank loan of US$ 5.0 mil-
lion would be repaid in 23 years, including a five-year grace period.
29.      The Government would be the borrower, would assume responsibility
for executing the project, and would develop the infrastructure for all
on-farm development works for the dairy, pig, tree crop and most food and
vegetable farms (some food farmers would clear the land themselves).
Repayment of farmers' obligations for these development costs would be
channelled through the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB). During the first
five years of the proposed project, the principal task of the ACB would
be to record the individual settler's debts to Government which would then
be treated as though they were loans to be repaid to ACB.
30.      All loans would carry interest of seven percent per annum.
Loans to dairy, pig and tree crop farmers would be repayable in 16 years,
including two years of grace for dairy and pig farmers and five years of
grace for tree crop farmers. Loans to vegetable and food crop farmers would
be repayable in six years, including a two-year grace period. Development
of the tobacco farms would be financed by the tobacco companies.
E. Disbursement
Xl.     The disbursement procedures would be as follows.   For Category A
(see paragraph 28), the Bank would disburse about TT$ 5.3 million and
Government would contribute TT$ 4.2 million during the first five years
and TT$ 0.26 million during years six to eight. In this manner, the Bank
would disburse about 56 percent of total expenditures in this category
during the first five years (the disbursement period) on the basis of
documents submitted by the Government. For Category B, the importation of
cattle, farm machinery and dairy equipment as well as expatriate expert
services, the Bank would disburse 100 percent of the cost of these items,
excluding the Canadian cattle. Estimates of cost have been prepared as
accurately as possible for the numbers of farms and the quantities of
livestock, machinery and other equipment required for the project as de-
fined. If costs have been underestimated the Trinidad Government would
provide additional funds; if they have been overestimated, unused balance
of the loan would be applied to finance other development of the same
kind in the Crown Lands subject to approval by the Bank.
32.      The Government would establish and maintain appropriate accounts
for the entire project. The Government would delegate to ACB the maintenance
of sub-account for individual settlers and loan collection, but would
retain the overall responsibility for project execution. Project accounts
would be audited annually by an accountant acceptable to the Bank.
F. Operating Results
33.      The expected financial results for the individual settler under
each type of farming are set out in the Annexes 1 - 6 and cummarized
in paragraph 61.



- 11 -
34.       The projection of operating results is difficult for three
reasons. First, land productivity in the proposed settlement locations
is based mainly on soil and land classification surveys but not proven
by adequate experimentation or actual farm operation. Second, the
assumed net returns and the proposed crop and livestock farming systems
are not supported by adequate research nor by comparable smallholder
operation elsewhexe in Trinidad. Third, the feasibility of training
persons who lack experience in technical and business aspects of pig
and dairy farming has not yet been proven.
35.       Taking these difficulties into account, the Bank has deliber-
ately chosen conservative production assumptions, but the margin of error
particularly in the livestock part of the project may be substantial.
There is sufficient experience, principally in Puerto Rico (with similar
tropical conditions) however, to indicate that the necessary production
and management practices and techniques can be successfully applied in
Trinidad.
36.       The expected financial results for the ACB are presented in
Annex 11. The farmers would repay their loans over a 19-year period and
the proceeds from these repayments would be used by the ACB to repay the
Government. The Government intends to utilize these proceeds to help
strengtllen ACB's credit operations and it has been assumed that repayment
to the Government would be over 23 years, includirg five years grace at
an interest rate of 6 percent. In this manner, the ACB would receive
a net income over the 23-year period which is estimated at TT$ 2.3 million.
IV. ORGANIZATION ANID MANAGEMENT
A. The Organizing Authority
37.       A Project Director would be responsible for executing the pro-
ject on behalf of the Government (see Organization Chart, Annex 8). He
would report to the Crown Lands Development Committee which would consist
of the following members: (1) Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of
Agriculture (Chairman), (2) Head of the Economic Planning Division,
(3) Manager of the ACB, (1) a representative of the University of the
West Indies, (5-8) the three principal technical officers, and the Senior
Economist of the Ministry of Agriculture and (9) the Project Director. In
addition to its advisory function, the committee would coordinate the
action of Government agencies involved in project execution - such as
the Industrial Development Corporation in relation to the establishment
of processing facilities, and the Na+ional Housing Authority in relation
to the building of farm houses - and would review project progress.
38.       A Project Director acceptable to the Bank, has been appointed
and his duties, responsibilities and authorities have been-agreed with
the Bank. The post of Project Director cannot be abolished nor can he be
replaced without the Bank's concurrence.



- 12 -
39.       The Project Director would be assisted by a Staff fdvisory
Committee, consisting of the Deputy Project Director, -the Technical
Officer for Development, the Project Accountant, the Farm Record Analyst,
all from the project staff, and an Agricultural Credit Expert from the
Agricultural Credit Bank. During the Project Development Phase, there
would be two sections of field staff (see Organization Chart, Annex 8).
One section headed by the Technical Officer for Development would plan
and supervise the physical development: land clearance, farm layout and
irrigation facilities, pasture and forage establishment, fencing and
construction of farm buildings. Farm houses would be built by contrac-
tors responsible to the National Housing Authority. When the farms are
handed over to selected settlers, the second section, headed by the
Deputy Project Director, would assume responsibility for guiding and
supervising the operation of individual farm units, of marketing and
other related project activities.
40.       Responsibilities of the Tecknical Officer for Development,
while substantial in the beginning, would diminish toward the end of the
capital investment period. He and his staff would become redundant. In
contrast, the responsibilities of the Deputy Project Director would grow
as more and more settlement units would come into production and would
remain important throughout the life of the project.
B. Technical Services During Operational Phase
41.       The Deputy Project Director would be assisted by about 30
Agricultural Officers and Field Assistants to build up the necessary
extension service. The extension field staff from the Ministry of
Agriculture would include six graduates from the University of the West
Indies and six graduates from the Eastern Caribbean Farm Institute, who
are under a five-year Government contract. The Government would take steps
to insure an efficient and satisfactory in-service training of the new
field staff in their fields of specialization, at suitable Government
institutions and cattle-holding grounds.
42.       All imported cattle would be kept for four months on Government
holding grounds. At present, facilities are available for holding 350
head of imported cattle until they have developed resistance to tick-
borne diseases. Cattle would then be distributed to dairy farms. Under
the control and technical advice of the Deputy Project Director and his
staff, one Field Assistant with the necessary technical training and
experience would be-assigned to each group of about 20 pig farmers or
dairy farmers. Necessary veterinary control measures would be the res-
ponsibility of the Senior Technical Officer in charge of the Veterinary
Services Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. In order to intro-
duce more experienced staff to the project, the following experts, in
addition to the Project Director, would be recruited for a four-year period:



- 13 -
a) Veterinarian;
b) Dairy husbandry expert with experience in
forage production and pasture management;
c) Pig husbandry expert;
d) One or two dairy stockmen;
e) Agricultural credit expert (see Annex 10, paragraph g).
lNo withdrawals from the Loan Account would be made for dairy farming until
a dairy husbandry expert and a stockman had been appointed; nor for pig
farming until a pig husbandry expert has been appointed. The other experts
would be appointed within one year after the date of the loan agreement.
43.       Provision has been made in the cost of the project for such
personnel on the assumption that these would all be expatriates; howiever,
it is possible that some of the experts may be recruited locally or pro-
vided under bilateral agreements with Canada and Israel. This would pro-
vide an additional margin in the financing.
C. Selection of Settlers
44.       Settlers would be selected on the basis of specific criteria,
agreed with the Bank, including previous experience in farming,
attendance of practical training courses, physical fitness, literacy,
age, lack of indebtedness and willingness to contribute to the develop-
ment work at a daily wage comparable to wages paid by private enterprise.
In the case of dairy farmers, acceptance should further depend upon the
willingness of the applicantts wife and other family members to cooperate
in farming activities and on the results of medical examinations of the
applicants and their families (tuberculosis). The Staff Advisory Committee
(see paragraph 39) would choose settlers on the basis of these criteria
and would remove those who fail to carry out their duties and responsibili-
ties. In the case of dairy and pig farmers, the settlers would be selected
when the farm development work starts and they would assist in the farm
development work and work also on Government holding grounds to obtain the
necessary experience in animal husbandry. Soecial courses for basic and
in-service training are planned for the prospective farmers and members
of their hLmxiJes and final acceptance for settlement would be subject to
satisfactory performance in these courses.
D. Credit Services
45.       There are at present four sources of credit available to farmers:
(1) commercial banks; (2) money-lenders, traders and pawnbrokers; (3)
the Agricultural Credit Bank; and (4) the Agricultural Credit Societies.



- 1h -
Rates charged to the farmer by commercial banks are from seven to eight
and one half percent per annum; those charged by money-lenders, etc.
range from four to five percent per month. The Agricultural Credit Bank
makes advances to individuals at a rate of four percent per annum. The
Agricultural Credit Societies receive their funds from the Agricultural
Credit Bank, :for which they pay three percent per annum, and charge seven
percent per annum to their members.
46.       The commercial banks have not been financing small farmers to
any appreciable extent. Loans made so far were on an individual basis
to the bigger sugar plantations or to the poultry industry. The commercial
banks are not interested in financing the farmers under this land develop-
ment project as the settlers would not have adequate security and the banks
are not organized to process the loans even if the Government would guaran-
tee them. The Agricultural Credit Societies have a small membership, are
poorly organized, cover only a low percentage of the total agricultural
population and suffer from defaults and lack of supervision by the Agri-
cultural Credit Bank and tha Cooperative Department. None of these
societies would be in a position to handle loan repayments by the farmers.
47.       This leaves only the Agricultural Credit Bank or a newly estab-
lished institution to undertake these activities. The Agricultural Credit
Bank was established in 1945 for the purpose of fostering agricultural
development and related activities. The bank has no equity capital, works
more or less as a department of the Government, is understaffed and has a
loan portfolio of which more than one-quarter is in default (see Annex 9).
As it is functioning now, the bank would not be able to service the proposed
project satisfactorily; but it would be easier to utilize this existing
institution, w*Tith some reorganization, than to establish a new one which
would have the same function. The Government is aware of the defects of the
Agricultural Credit Bank and a committee is currently considering reorgani-
zation measures.
h8.       Assurance, has been obtained during negotiations that the re-
organization of the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) would proceed as outlined
in Annex 10.
E. Repayment Obligations of Farmers
49.       Of the total project cost of TT$ 19.5 million shown in paragraph
28, the farmers and private enterprise would directly meet TT$ 3.6 million.
Of the balance of TT$ 15.9 million, to be met initially by the Government,
wfith the assistance of the Bank and Canadian Government loans, the farmers
would repay TT$ 8.2 million through long-term loans. Of the remaining
TT$ 7.7 million, TT$ 0.7 million wfould be working capital provided through
ACB and the balance would be recovered through rents, normal user charges
and general tax funds (see paragraph 51 and Annex 7C).



- 15 -
50.       The proposed amortization schedules for the TT$ 8.2 million
long-term loans provide for a 16-year repayment period, including two
years grace for dair-ying and pigs and five year grace for tree crops and
a six-year repayment period, including two years grace for the food and
vegetable crop farmers. The interest rate to be paid by the farmers on
these loans would be seven percent.
51.       For the investment in land clearance, the Government would receive
an annual return of TT$ 105,000 (TT$ 12 per acre), to be paid by the set-
tlers as rent. The investments in infrastructure and extension services
would be recovered through normal user charges and general taxation.
F. Marketing
52.       Provisions for marketing the expected project output are dis-
cussed in detail in Annex 12. The projected output of milk, beef, pork
and tobacco would be small relative to quantities imported at present
(see Table below). The projected output of food crops and vegetables
would represent a much higher proportion (approximately 75 percent) of
present imports. However, part of this output would be used as feed for
the dairy and pig undertakings of the project. The Government's iMarketing
Board, in cooperation with the project staff, would assume responsibility
for guiding settlers, particularly those producing perishable products,
in adjusting production to market needs.  For marketing their tree crops5 the
settlers would depend primarily on expanding export markets. The
value of full annual production from the project is conservatively
estimated at TT$ 7.7 million (ex-farm prices).

- 16 -
53.       Part of the expected milk production, estimated at 1i6 million
gallons annually, would be marketed as sterilized milk under a three-year
contract recently signed with Nestle. Under this contract, the company
would establish and operate the milk assembly stations when milk production
reaches about 100 gallons per day in a designated district arnd, in addition,
guarantee to buy the farmersl milk at fixed base prices with additional
premium payments depending on milk quality, Other companies are also inter-
ested in establishing facilities for pasteurizing and marketing fresh milk.
In order to insure the market for project production, assurances for the
timely establishment of these facilities have been obtained during negotia-
tions. The Government would be in a position to speed up such establishment
by granting pioneer status (tax exemption during five years, etc.) to in-
terested entrepreneurs.
54.       Pork-production, estimated at 2.4 million pounds carcass weight
annually, would be marketed through processing and storage facilities to be
constructed and operated by private enterprise. Assurances have been ob-
tained that the Government would cause the timely establishment of these
facilities. Several companies are interested and pioneer status could be
granted.
55.       Orange and grapefruit orchards would come into full production
after the end of the disbursement period. At that time the existing
Cooperative Citrus Growers' Association, which at present markets 95 per-
cent of the total citrus production, would expand its marketing and export
handling capacity. During negotiations, assurances have been obtained
from the Government that adequate marketing facilities would be provided
(see Annex 12).
56.       The Government have also given assurances that small marketing
units accessible to groups of about 50 settlers would be established in
the project areas. These would be responsible for the marketing of food
crops and vegetables and their cost is included in the project cost.
57.       Finally, the expected tobacco output would be purchased by
existing cigarette factories. At present these utilize local tobacco
for only five percent of their tobacco intake and they have agreed to
raise this to 22 percent by 1970.
G. Procurement
58.       Imported items valued in excess of US$ 25,000 (paragraph 24,
Item B and Annex 7A, section B) would be procured in accordance with the
Bank's requirements for international competitive bidding. Experience in
Trinidad has shown that the Holstein breed of cattle, and within the
breed certain types of it, are best suited to the prevailing conditions.
Certain countries are precluded from supplying cattle to Trinidad because
of sanitary regulations excluding animals from areas where foot and mouth
disease is endemic. As a result of this international competitive bidding
would not be appropriate for livestock procurement since the breed and
quality of the animals required can only be obtained in sufficient quantity
in a few specific regions in the world and the animals would have to be
individually assessed in the country of origin. As in previous Bank/IDA



- 17 -
livestock projects (e.g. Chile, Colombia) purchases of livestock from
abroad would be made through recognised livestock export organizations
and would be negotiated with the seller, subject to prior authorization
by the Bank as to source, type and number of animals, and the approximate
cost.
59.      The land clearance costs consist of the costs of surveying,
clearing, bumjxg levelling, ploughing and discing. Surveying would be
undertaken by an independent surveyor or Government surveyor; the
other land clearance work would be done by local contractors since the
volume of work is too small to be of interest to international contractors.
The invitation to tender would be published in the official gazette at least
14 days prior to the bid opening, and tenders scrutinized by the tender
board and awarded to the lowest pre-qualified bidder.
60.      The water and electricity works would be carried out respectively
by the Water and Sewerage Authority, and the Trinidad and Tobago Elec-
tricity Commission on an actual cost basis for special distribution lines
and at the usual fees for normal connections. For the road works, con-
tractors would be invited to submit bids to the tender board. Contracts for
buildings, barns, sties, marketing units, etc., would be awarded according
to the standard procedure of the tender board (paragraph 59), but housing
contracts would be awarded by the National Housing Authority on a fixed
price basis. This procedure is followed currently for all low cost
housing and has been effective in keeping housing costs low. Smell farm
implements would be bought from local suppliers on the basis of annual
tenders, also invited by the tender board.
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION

- 18 -
The Government would undertake the collection of farm budget and result
data from the individual farmers so that the results could be compared with
forecasts.
62.       Comparable net cash income figures in Trinidad are from TT$ 600
to TT$ 1,500 for the lower labor classes in agriculture3 The farmaer's
projected income, as shown in paragraph 61, is sufficiently high to provide
them with the necessary incentive to manage their units efficiently. After
loans have been repaid, the farmers, especially those with dairy and pig
enterprises, would have sufficient income to expand their operation

B. Economic Return
63.       Development costs, costs of additional facilities and services,
investments in working capital and payments of settlement allowances have
been taken into account in calculating the economic rates of return of
the various project activities. Net benefits have been calculated after
deducting the operating costs of farmers and of extension services.   No
deduction from benefits has been made for the returns to land and labor
in their original application and before they are transferred to the pro-
ject, as these returns are negligible.   The Waller Field area, for instance,
is an abandoned airbase and the other land areas have little productive
use. As the project will benefit unemployed or under-employed farm workers,
the benefits include the full return to the farmers' labor.
64.       The average life of the project structures - houses, buildings,
etc.- has been assumed as 25 years. In the case of pig breeding and fat-
tening, the investment in processing facilities has been included. The
value of the output of milk, beef pork, tree crop6, food .crops and tobacco is
a conservative estimate based on recent price 6rends. In the case of veg-
tables, it has been assumed that a vegetable farmer would be able to make
an income equal to the minimum income of a food crop farmer, that is,
TT$ 1X500 per year. This assumption is conservative. Annexes 1 - 6 give
the details for the various types of farms.
65.       The average annual net returns to the economy of Trinidad, dis-
counted over the life of the farm, are estimated as follows:
Percent
Dairying                     14 (12)
Pigs                         13 (12)
Oranges                      13 (10)
Grapefruit                   12 (9)
Vegetable and Food Crops     30 (15)
Tobacco                      14 (9)



- 19 -
The overall return is about 16 percent. If farmers' labor were charged
at a subsistence value of TT$ 600 per annum, the overall rate of return
would be about 12 percent, and the returns per type of farms as shown in
parenthesis. Dairy, pig and tobacco enterprises involve high initial
costs in buildings, stoct,and equipment; however, further expansion of
these enterprises would/be possible with substantially lower investment
cost per farm. The pr6posed project would provide net annual savings
in foreign exchange, after debt service of the proposed Bank and Canadian
Government loans (paragraph 28), of about TT$ 6.0 million. The rates
of return, as calculated, are sufficient to justify the project. In
addition, the project would directly benefit about one percent of the
population and help to ease the current and serious unemployment problem.
VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS
66.       The proposed project is the first stage of a long-term Crown
Lands Development program, a settlement scheme aimed at increased domestic
agricultural production. The savings in foreign exchange due to the pro-
ject would be substantial, and the rates of return to the economy of the
country indicate that the project is economically justified. Prospective
settlers are very interested in participating and the project is considered
to be technically and financially feasible. The project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$ 5.0 million, representing about 44 percent of the
cost of the project which would be repaid in 23 years, including five years
of grace.

CROANN LANDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Agriculturl) Credit Bank
1.        The Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) was established under an ordinance,
dated July 1, 1945, to foster and encourage agriculture and industries con-
nected therewith, commercial fishing, and to aid in the development, mainten-
ance and improvement of lands,O The IACB has also been used as the agent for
channelling special Government funds following the national hurricane disaster
in 1963.  The ACB's governinig body is a Board, consisting of seven members
appointed by the Government, The manager of the bank, also appointed by the
Government, is the secretary of the Board.
2,        There is no provision in the ordinance for any equity capital, the
possible funds of the bank being as follows:
(a) Sums made availab:le by the Government, but to be repaid to
the Government;
(b) Sums borrowed by the ACB from others;
(c) Sums as may be deposited (e.g. by Credit Societies); and
(d)  Sums as may accrue to the ACB from its operation.
The income of the ACB is exempt from income tax,
3.        With respect to agriculture, the ACB is authorized to make long-term
loans provided such loans are secured by a first mortgage on the lands in re-
spect of which the loan is made and if required by additional security0
Advances (short-term loans) may be made for a period not exceeding three years..
but the Board may from time to time postpone the date of repayment. Advances
are a charge on the lands in respect of which the advance is made and/or upon
the crops and produce from the land and have priority to all encumbrances ex-
cept debts due to the Government.
4.        In the case of loans made to Credit Societies where security other
than a first mortgage is provided, the loan should be repaid not later than
five years from the date of the making of the loan, but the Board may post-
pone this date, In case of default the bank may recover the sum advanced from
the members of the society.
5.        The interest rate which the Agricultural Credit Bank has to pay to
the Government is 2% per annum, and the rates charged to its borrowers are
as follows:
Agricultural Credit Societies           3%, max0 1 year
Individuals - Mortgages                 4%, max. 10 years
Individuals - Agr. Advances             4%, max. 3 years
Individuals - Fisheries                 5%, max. 5 years
Cooperative Societies   Ltd. Liability  3%, max, 10 years

The credit policy of the ACB is characterized by a passive approach, the
loans are made as requested on the basis of the security provided up to a
certain maximum. In the case of the Agricultural Credit Societies for
instance, the regulations stipulate that no loan to a society shall exceed
TT$28,000, the maximum loan for repairs to houses and buildings is TT$200,
and, depending on the crop, advances may be granted from maximum TT$25 to
TT$60 per acre. The purpose for which the loan is requested, the cost of
cultivation, the seasonality of the operation and the recovery of the loan
on the basis of the harvesting period are in general not taken into consider-
ation.
6.        The Agricultural Credit Bank had at the end of 1965 a loan capital
of TT$7.11 million as initially provided by the Government and TT$0.56
million also provided by the Government but under the condition that these
amounts had to be relent for specific purposes. Total advances and loans
outstanding amounted to $6.4 million and cash in hand to TT$1.42 million.
The surplus amounted to TT$131,261, the loss in the year 1965 to TT$28,980.
(See attached balance sheets and income and expenditures statements). It
should, however, be pointed out that because a substantial portion of loans
and advances are overdue and doubtful of recovery, presumably a substantial
amount needs to be written off for bad debts, which has never been done in
the past.
7.        The amounts overdue as of December 31, 1965, were as follows:
% of Defaulting
Outstanding   Defaulting   to Outstandings
Crop Advances                         183,490       6,721           3.7

8.        The total sanctioned strength of the ACB for 1965 was 33 posts of
which 18 are vacant. These posts include the key posts of assistant manager,
principal accounting officer and senior credit supervisor. This shortage of
staff should be considered one of the principal causes of the low recovery
rates of the amounts over due and the long time involved irn the loan process-
ing and sanctioning of the loans as has been the experience up to now.

CROVWN LA,NS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Proposed RPeorganization of Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB)
(a) ACB will operate as a share capital bank, with the purpose of developing
agricultural and related activities in Trinidad and Tobago.
(b)  ACB will operate in a financially sound manner; revenues will be
sufficient to cover normal operating expenses, depreciation and
interest charges and to provide funds for a bad-debts reserve.
(c) The existing Government loans to ACB will be converted to equity
capital. An all out effort will be made to collect thes portfolio
loans and advances in default. Uncollectable debts wi:Ll be written
off from surplus and equity capital.
(d) ACB and its branch offices will be properly staffed by qualified
persons. The staff of ACB will consist not of officers on second-
ment from the government for a temporary period, but those who
expect to make their career in ACB. A legal expert wi:Ll be employed
by ACB. The General Manager will, subject to existing legisla-
tion, have the power to hire and dismiss personnel, to establish con-
ditions of pay and conditions of service, to approve loans up to a
certain maximum and bear full responsibility to the Board of Directors.
(e) ACB will set up separate accounts in respect of the Project reflecting
the loans made by the Government to farmers, the amortization and
interest payments by such farmers, the indebtedness of ACB to the
Government, and the payments of principal, interest ancl other charges
by ACB to the Government. The officers of ACB will keep in close
contact with the farmers and paymients by the farmers at Post Office
savings banks will not be channeled through the Treasury Department
but directly credited to ACB.
(f)  The Agricultural Credit Societies, which are all very small in
size, will be strengthened by merger; societies eligible for ACB
loans will be obliged to maintain deposit accounts in ACB; interest
rates for loans to individuals will be in line with commercial
rates, and the differential between interest rates on loans to individ-
uals and loans to societies will not be more than the normal spread
that is necessary to cover operating expenses and a bad debt reserve
of a society engaged in active lending to small farmers.
(g) An expert in agricultural credit operations should be appointed with-
in one year after the date of loan effectiveness for a four-year
period to assist the management in the reorganization of the ACB.

CROWN LAIDS DEV'ORPi4ENT PROJECT
MARKETING OF THE PRODUCE
Dairying
1.        Total meat output per annum at full production of the 200 dairy
farms will be about 1,400 bull calves and 800 culled and surplus cows,
representing about 450,000 lbs. of dressed meat.   It is expected that the
existing abattoirs, which are under government inspection, can handle this
additional output. Marketing of the meat is not expected to present any
problem, although the meat has to be distributed immediately after slaughter
to the retail outlets as there is no refrigerated storage at the present
time. Total milk output of the 200 dairy farms at full production will be
about 1.6 million gallons of milk.
2.        About 200.,000 gallons of fresh milk are marketed through a new
Nestle plant, three smaller plants which buy fresh milk and process it for
sale, and one reconstitution plant.  The rest of the fresh milk output in
the country, about 1.4 million gallons, is consumed or retailed by the
farmers. In addition to the fresh milk output, about 13.2 million gallons
of fresh milk equivalent (excluding cheese and butter products) were imported
in 1964, the bulk being milk powder. Current retail price for sterilized
and pasteurized milk in Trinidad is about TT$2.00 per gallon. This compares
with a price of TT$1.80 to TT$2.25 in Eastern United States cities (US$1.00
to US$1.30).  The price per gallon liquid milk equivalent of milk powder or
condensed milk works out to about TT$1.45.
3.        In order to guarantee the sale of the planned increased production
of milk, the Government of Trinidad has negotiated in 1965 a three-.year
agreement with Nestle. Nestle undertakes to purchase all fresh milk of good
quality for sale from farmers at a basic price of TT$0.95 to TT$1L05 plus
an incentive bonus of TT$0.03 to TT$0.05 per gallon, depending on the quality
of the milk, and to establish milk collecting stations at designated districts
as and when milk production in each district reaches about 100 gallons per
day.
4.        It is expected that Nestle would be able to accept an additional
500,000 gallons of fresh milk annually for its production of sterilized
milk products. In view of the limited consumer's acceptance of the
sterilized milk, and the increasing milk output, it seems advisable to plan
increased marketing facilities for pasteurized fresh milk. Several inter-
ested parties, including Nestle, have expressed their willingness to make
the necessary arrangements and the government should, within the next two
years, take the necessary steps to ensure that the processing and marketing
of this pasteurized milk would be guaranteed.

Pig Breeding and Pig Fattening
5.        Total yearly output of pork would amount to 2.36 million lbs.
carcass weight basis and it is expected that an average price of TT$0.70
per lb. would be paid to the farmer. In order to ensure the marketing
of this meat, new slaughter, storage and processing facilities are being
negotiated. Various firms have indicated interest in establishing the neces-
sary facilities and the Government has given assurance that the establish-
ment of slaughtering, storage and processing facilities would be started
no later than the beginning.of 1967.
Citrus
6.        Total output from the project would be about 136,000 crates of
oranges and 204,000 crates of grapefruits. The prices received for grape-
fruits over the last five years ranged from TT$1r40 to TTl.60 per crate
for fruits used for segments and from TT$0,95 to TT$1.30 for culls used
for juicing. The proportion of fresh fruit is about 10% of total purchases
and is sold at higher prices varying with market demand. It seems, therefore,
reasonable to assume that the growers would receive an average of TT$l.bO
per crate for grapefruits. The price for oranges has varied from TT$2.25
per crate to TT3.00 per crate, a price of TT$2.50 being assumed in this
report for calculation purposes. It is envisaged that most of the produce
would be maiketed through the Cooperative Citrus Growers' Association which
markets at present an estimated 95% of the total citrus crop. The plant
facilities of this Association are restricted duie to site limitation. The
plant is at present operating at full capacity, and is not able to handle
the present output of citrus of the farmers. 1966 yeas a particularly
good season and estimates of crop loss because of the plant's inability to
accept all fruit range from 10 to 25%. The Citrus Growers' Association
has applied to the Government for a loan of TT$4.5 million to finance the
transfer of the old plant to a new site and for the purchase of some
additional equipment. There are also plans by some growers to set up a
completely new plant. Bearing in mind that it would take 5 years before
the new citrus plantings would be in production, the Government agreed to
take the necessary steps at the earliest possible date to ensure an
expansion of processing facilities.
Vegetable and Food Crops
7.        Total output from the 392 vegetable farms and the 926 food crop
farms would be about 9 million lb. of vegetables and 35 million lb. of
food crops, with a total value of about TT$3,2 million.   It is envisaged
that smal'l marketing units would be created in the project areas for every
50 food or vegetable crop farms, the cost of which is included in the project.
The Produce Marketing Board has at present 10 units where food crops from
the farmers are bought at guaranteed prices. Total volume in 1965 was about
13.2 million lb. with a value of TT$0.7 million. It is the purpose of the

government to expand the Marketing Board into a Central Marketing Authority
which would administer the marketing units, the transportation and the sale
of the crops in the new marketing facilities in Port of Spain and other
marketing centers.
Tobacco
8.        Of the 800 gross acres of tobacco farms in any one year, due to
the necessity of crop rotation, about 400 acres would be under tobacco,
producing about 300,000 lb. of tobacco. There are at present two cigarette
manufacturing companies in Trinidad, with a present annual use of about
2 million lb. of tobacco, of which about 95% on average has been imported.
The companies have agreed to use on average about 22% of locally-grown
tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes by 1970, which means that about
600 net acres of tobacco should be grown by 1969. About 100v-net acres are
at present under cultivation. The proposed project would take care of about
80% of the planned acreage. Average price paid to the farmers per lb. of
tobacco has been about TT$1.20 in the last few years. CIF price per lb. of
tobacco is about TT$1.45.
