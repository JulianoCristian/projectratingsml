Depending upon\n            suitability of the land, the farms will be developed for\n            dairying, pig breeding and fattening, tree crops, vegetable\n            and food crops and tobacco. Farm sizes will vary from 3\n            acres for vegetable farms to 20 acres for dairy farms. Farm\n            development works, which include the provision of\n            infrastructure, land clearance and on-farm development, as\n            appropriate, will be provided under the project. Ancillary\n            marketing and processing facilities for the output of these\n            farms will also be provided where necessary."}, "docdt": "1967-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
