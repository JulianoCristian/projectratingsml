To accomplish\n            its objectives, in addition to providing financing for Small\n            and Medium Scale Mining Enterprises (SMMs), the project will\n            support the following policy changes and institutional\n            reforms in the mining sector: (i) liberalizing private\n            sector access to land with mineral potential and releasing\n            state-held mining reserves; (ii) reducing barriers to\n            foreign investment in mining enterprises; (iii) implementing\n            a mineral rights policy that is conducive to an improved\n            allocation of resources; (iv) reforming the system of mining\n            concessions; (v) phasing out state ownership of enterprises\n            in the sector; (vi) modernizing the government agencies\n            providing support to small and medium scale mining\n            enterprises; (vii) establishing environmental standards for\n            the mining sector; and (viii) phasing out direct Government\n            financing of mining activities."}, "docdt": "1991-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
