         support a series of reforms aimed at improving the\n            investment climate.  The program's objectives will be\n            to establish a regulatory, incentive and institutional\n            framework designed to improve the local business environment\n            and to encourage both local and foreign promoters to\n            undertake investments in productive activities.  Specific\n            reforms targeted by the program include : 1) simplification\n            of the legal regulatory framework : streamlining enterprise\n            establishment and registration procedures, liberalization of\n            labor regulations and establishment of a legl basis for\n            private ownership rights on commercial buildings; 2)\n            enhancement of the overall incentive structure : improving\n            the effectiveness of the new tariff and investment regimes;\n            3) increased effectiveness of the institutional framework\n            for investment promotion; and 4) improving the policy and\n            operational framework in the financial sector : deepening\n            interest rate reforms, rationalization of credit markets,\n            establishment of an improved legal framework for banking\n            activity and strengthening the Central Bank's capacity\n            to monitor activity in the banking sector."}, "docdt": "1990-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
