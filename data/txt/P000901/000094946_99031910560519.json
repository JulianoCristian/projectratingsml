Key lessons learned\n            include: 1) Stable sector management is a necessary\n            condition for project success. 2) The assignment of local\n            financing obligations for capital works to a utility should\n            be informed by the utility''''s proven\n            capability and not on projected performance. 3) In terms of\n            project design, a positive innovation of the project was the\n            successful establishment and implementation of a\n            clearinghouse arrangement to settle\n            Government''''s current liabilities to\n            Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC). 4) It is only\n            by adequate customer identification and holistic packaging\n            that measurable results can be attained. 5) The Project and\n            Construction Management Unit structure functioned as planned\n            but had limited use and could not be easily integrated into\n            GWSC. 6) More innovative contracting methods are needed for\n            rehabilitation works on plants that must remain operational.\n            7) Reduction of unaccounted for water is a process involving\n            significant works components as well as improved commercial\n            management in addition to measures to stop commercial leaks."}, "docdt": "1998-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
