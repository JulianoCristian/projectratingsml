FIFTH WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                      Societe Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribu-
tion des Eaux (SONEDE).
Guarantor:                     Republic of Tunisia
Amount:                        US$25 million equivalent
Terms:                         17 years including 4 years grace; interest would
be at 7.9 percent per year.
Project Description:           The proposed project would support SONEDE's
investment program during the second half of the
current five-year plan (1977-81) by expanding and
improving access to piped water for the popula-
tion in selected urban and rural centers. It
consists of: (i) expansion and improvement of
primary distribution systems in medium and small
towns; (ii) provision of water supply systems in
rural centers; (iii) extension of distribution
networks into low-income areas of the cities;
(iv) supply of water meters; and (v) review of
SONEDE's future investment and financial plans
and policies. Benefits of the project would
accrue mainly to about 96,000 families, mostly
in low-income groups, whose dwellings would be
connected to the water network, and to families
in intermediate towns and agglomerated villages
who would be provided with safe water from public
taps. The project presents no special risks.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
SOCIETE NATIONALE D'EXPLOITATION ET DE DISTRIBUTION DES EAUX
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A FIFTH WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Societe Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE)
for the equivalent of US$25 million to help finance a Fifth Water Supply
Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace,
with interest at 7.9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        An updating economic mission visited Tunisia in June 1978; its
report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Tunisia" (No. 2201-TUN)
was issued on November 16, 1978. Country Data sheets are attached in Annex I.
3.        Tunisia is rather poorly endowed with agricultural resources.  Much
of the country is arid or semi arid. Agricultural activity is concentrated
along the coast, in the North West, and in a few oases, but continues to play
an important role in Tunisia's economic structure. During 1970-77 agriculture
generated some 17 percent of GDP and accounted for some 40 percent of total
employment. The main crops are wheat and olives. These crops are subject to
sharp annual output fluctuations because of irregular rainfall in the case of
wheat and a natural production cycle for olives. Tunisia's most important
raw materials are phosphates, petroleum and natural gas; except for phosphates,
known reserves are relatively small. Industrial development, although rapid,
has been hampered by shortages of industrial entrepreneurs, the limited size
of the domestic market and difficulties in marketing Tunisian products abroad.
The most important sector is services, which, during 1970-77, generated about
half of GDP, a quarter of that sector's contribution consisting of government
services. Tourism has developed rapidly during the 1970s. Workers' remit-
tances have become a significant item in the balance of payments, generating
about 10 percent of current account receipts during 1970-77.
4.        Tunisia's economy has performed remarkably well during the period
1970-77. Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 8.6 percent, nearly twice
as fast as during the 1960s. Per capita GNP in 1977 reached $860, which in
real terms is some 72 percent above its level of 1969. According to the 1978
World Bank Atlas, Tunisia was one of the few countries in the world whose per
capita GNP during 1970-76 increased by 6 percent and more.
1/   Substantially unchanged from President's Report No. P2485-TUN of March 7,
1979, on a Second Urban Sewerage Project.



- 2 -
5.        This performance was partly attributable to improved economic man-
agement and partly to fortuitous factors. During the 1960s, Tunisia's
policy orientation centered on an inward-looking investment strategy based on
state predominance in all important economic activities. Economic management
relied on a complex system of government regulations. In 1969, new policy
orientations were announced, which, during the 1970s, resulted in change
towards a more open and export-oriented economy in which private initiative
could play an increasing role. A number of decontrol measures were introduced,
albeit slowly. Overall, the new policy orientation proved highly beneficial
for the country. In addition, the economy benefited from favorable weather
conditions resulting in good agricultural crops while the change in world mar-
ket prices during 1973/74 brought sizeable windfalls as the terms of trade
improved sharply. This allowed domestic savings to increase to 22 percent of
GDP during 1970-77, compared with 15 percent during the 1960s. Tunisia's
dependence on external financing declined from about 32 percent of investment
in 1969 to 25 percent in 1977; the share was as low as 15 percent during
1973-76, when gains from the terms of trade were at their peak. The balance
of payments had been in continuous overall surplus since 1967, but after
1975 this was no longer the case as the terms of trade began to deteriorate
while imports continued to increase rapidly. However, Tunisia's debt service
ratio in 1977 was still a low 8.9 percent, compared with 20 percent in 1970.
6.        Rapid economic growth allowed Tunisia to make substantial social
gains during the 1970s. By 1976, primary school enrollment had reached 96
percent and secondary enrollment 20 percent of the relevant age groups.
Education is free virtually through university. Public health services have
been expanded, with many services provided free. A family planning program
has been introduced and since 1973 has met with substantial success. The
birth rate declined from 43.8 per thousand in 1966 to 36.4 per thousand in
1976 while the rate of natural growth declined from 3.0 to 2.6 percent in the
same period. Attempts have been made to correct regional imbalances and to
improve income distribution. The share of the population living in absolute
poverty declined from 30 percent in 1966 to 18 percent in 1975. However,
important disparities remain between income levels among individuals and
regions. In coping with the social aspects of development, Tunisia faces
strongly increased aspirations of its population in the face of limited
natural and financial resources.
7.        The most important problem facing the Tunisian economy is widespread
open and hidden unemployment. In 1977, about 13 percent of the labor force--
some 220,000 people--were unemployed. In addition, there is considerable
hidden unemployment in agriculture which employed about 35 percent of the
labor force in 1977. If one considers that about 40 percent of this labor
force does not have full time jobs, the effective unemployment rate is more
like 25 percent. An increasing number of young people born during the high
birth rate years are reaching working age and a growing number of women are
joining the labor force. About half of the registered unemployed are young
people seeking their first employment. These are mostly relatively educated
people whose job aspirations cannot be met.



- 3 -
8.        During 1970-77, agriculture provided about 40 percent of total
employment, 25 percent of merchandise exports and 17 percent of GDP. Food
processing accounted for another 4 percent of GDP and comprised 35 percent
of value added in manufacturing. During this period agricultural production
rose substantially, largely as a result of favorable weather. Large infra-
structure investments were made during the last decade. Current policy, which
emphasizes projects that make a rapid and direct contribution to production,
recognizes various constraints on agricultural development: insecurity of
tenure; inadequate access to agricultural credit; inadequate extension ser-
vices; insufficient agricultural education; and underutilization of irrigation
investments. Under the Fourth Plan (1973-76) about $140 million was allocated
to a rural development fund executed by the provincial administrations.
9.        During the 1960s, manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by
8 percent annually. This growth rate accelerated in the 1970s to 11 percent
annually, due in part to record years for the olive oil processing industry
and to favorable developments in the textile and chemical industries. The
early thrust of industrialization was supplied by large import substitution
projects. These suffered, however, from the limited domestic market and from
shortages of experienced staff and management. Since 1970, more emphasis
has been put on export-oriented private industries, particularly in food
processing, textiles, fertilizers and mechanical and electrical industries.
Foreign and domestic private investment is now stimulated by a comprehensive
incentive framework and facilitated by streamlined approval procedures of the
investment promotion agency.  Foreign investors are expected to contribute
know-how and overseas marketing capability.  Although an agreement between
Tunisia and the European Community signed in April 1976 provided for duty
free entry into the Community of nearly all Tunisian industrial products, new
restrictions have recently been imposed. The Government has established a
special fund to encourage growth of small industries and industrial decentral-
ization, and it has started a program to establish industrial estates.
10.       The development of tourism in Tunisia is relatively recent.  Foreign-
visitor arrivals reached 1 million in 1977, with an average annual rate of
growth during 1970-1977 of 12 percent -- sharply higher than that of the
Mediterranean tourism market as a whole. Since 1970, tourism has become a
major source of foreign exchange earnings, reaching $315 million in 1977;
this was slightly more than earnings from all manufacturing exports and was
exceeded only by petroleum exports. The rapid development of tourism in
Tunisia has unfortunately not been accompanied by adequate development of
infrastructure (particularly recreational facilities), trained manpower, or
related services. The Government is endeavoring to alleviate these con-
straints through a variety of measures including revised investment incentives,
increased marketing and training efforts, codes to enforce quality standards,
and more stringent zoning laws.
11.       The main objectives of the current Five-Year Plan (1977-81) are:
(i) full employment of the additional labor force; (ii) self-sufficiency in
major foodstuffs (defined as a balanced trade account for agricultural goods);
(iii) increases in the standard of living; and (iv) social stability through
incomes policies and wage and price harmonization. The Plan foresees an



- 4 -
average annual rate of real GDP growth of 7.3 percent. This is somewhat below
the 9.2 percent achieved during 1970-76, mainly because the fortuitous factors
prevalent during the early 1970s were not expected to continue. Investment
is projected at D 4.2 billion ($9.8 billion) in current prices during the
Plan. In real terms, average annual investment would be 54 percent greater
during 1977-81 than during the preceding Plan period. Nonetheless, the
targeted average annual rate of growth of real investment during the Fifth
Plan is only 4.1 percent, as this rate is influenced by the very high invest-
ment level achieved in 1976 in an effort to meet targets of the preceding
Plan.
12.       The Fifth Plan's strategy emphasizes in particular export-oriented
industrial development and agricultural growth. Special attention is given to
employment creation and to balance of payments considerations. Substantial
investments are to be made in hydrocarbons, manufacturing, water development,
transport and housing. The Plan prescribes increased domestic production and
processing of Tunisia's mineral resources (phosphates, petroleum) to export as
much value-added as possible. Extraction and distribution of newly discovered
offshore gas deposits in the Gulf of Gabes rank prominently in the list of
major projects.  This gas will substitute for petroleum-based fuels, freeing
the latter for export. Eventually, gas will also be used as an input for the
chemical industry. Private sector initiative is expected to dominate invest-
ment in textiles, mechanical and electrical industries, and tourism. It is in
these activities that the authorities expect most employment creation to take
place. Employability of the labor force is to be increased through education
and training programs.  Efforts towards regional development are to be pursued
through establishing regional planning structures, strengthening regional
administration and developing incentives for the decentralization of produc-
tive activities. The strategy proposed for the Fifth Plan does not represent
any major departure from the strategy pursued successfully during the preced-
ing Plan.
13.       Tunisia's existing resource base, its institutional and infrastruc-
tural framework, its good performance in the earlier part of this decade,
and the desire of the authorities to support further development with appro-
priate policy measures and institutions are fundamental factors pointing
towards continuing rapid economic growth during the Fifth Plan. The 7.3
percent growth target is in line with the possibilities of the economy. The
investment priorities formulated in the Plan are considered necessary to
support the sectoral strategies. There are, however, some less favorable
signs. Tunisia's development recently benefitted from the structural changes
in world market prices and from excellent weather conditions. As noted above,
it cannot be expected that these fortuitous factors will continue in Tunisia's
favor to the same extent as in the past. Hence, Tunisia will have to rely
increasingly on its own resources. As the resource base is relatively narrow,
available resources should be efficiently deployed. Achieving the Plan tar-
gets presupposes the timely introduction and successful execution of measures
to (i) strengthen the absorptive capacity for investment, especially for labor
intensive projects; (ii) promote exports; (iii) base economic management on
an efficient price and incentive system and improve productivity; and (iv)
mobilize the resources needed to realize the comprehensive social development



- 5 -
targets while maintaining domestic and external financial stability. The
Tunisian authorities have begun to introduce measures in these respects.
14.       Substantial efforts in domestic and external resource mobilization
in particular will be of crucial importance to finance the planned level of
investment. On the domestic side, there is a great need for increased savings
and improved financial intermediation. The Government sector, in particular,
will again be called upon to contribute substantially to the savings effort.
The Plan suggests that this should be done by prudent expenditure policies and
increased revenue collections (selective tax increases and better tax collec-
tion). In addition, the public enterprise sector will have to increase sub-
stantially its contribution to public savings through better management and
especially through cost-related increases in the sale prices of selected
enterprises. Externally, Tunisia would have total financing requirements
(disbursement basis) of some $2.8 billion during 1977-81. Given the country's
creditworthiness, Tunisia should be able to mobilize such financing without
putting undue strain on the country's debt servicing capacity (see below,
para. 16).
15.       Since the early 1960s, Tunisia has obtained large amounts of
official aid. A Consultative Group chaired by the Bank provided a forum
for aid-coordination among major donors in the past. During 1970-77,
annual loan commitments from public sources averaged $235 million, or about
$43 per capita. About 73 percent of these commitments came from bilateral
public sources, chiefly from France, Canada, and the Federal Republic of
Germany. About 17 percent came from oil-producing countries whose share
increased rapidly from 8 percent in 1970 to 29 percent in 1977. Commitments
from the Bank Group during 1970-77 accounted for 20 percent of total public
commitments. Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms; in 1977 the
average terms of borrowing were 5.8 percent interest and 20 years maturity,
including 6 years of grace. During 1970-77, Tunisia also received annually
some $43 million in grants. Loan commitments from private sources averaged
$34 million a year. While direct foreign private investment has been compara-
tively small, it has recently picked up momentum following increased activity
in the petroleum sector and new incentives offered to foreign investors in
manufacturing. Net direct foreign investment increased from $19 million in
1970 to $75 million in 1977.
16.       At the end of 1977, total foreign debt (disbursed and outstanding)
was estimated at about $1.6 billion, or 32 percent of GDP compared with some
40 percent in 1970. According to preliminary estimates, it has reached about
$2 billion at the end of 1978. The debt service ratio in 1977 was 8.9 per-
cent, compared with 20 percent in 1970. This significant decline in the debt
service ratio was mainly due to the sharp increase in export earnings follow-
ing the changes in world market prices in 1973/74. External borrowing at the
rate projected in the 1977-81 Plan (para. 14) would increase debt service
obligations in relation to exports to around 13 percent by 1981 and 17 percent
by 1986, according to current Bank projections. At these levels, the debt
service burden would be manageable, particularly when seen in the light of
Tunisia's long record of prudent and skillful balance of payments and external
debt management. Tunisia is therefore considered creditworthy for further
Bank lending.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
17.       Since 1962, Tunisia has received a total of thirty-three loans and
eleven credits amounting respectively to $497.0 million and $70.1 million, net
of cancellations. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1979, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. While disbursements of some loans and credits have
been slower than foreseen at appraisal, on the whole, project execution has
been satisfactory. As of December 31, 1978, total disbursements amounted
to 54 percent of initial appraisal forecasts, and to 67 percent of revised
forecasts. In a number of sectors, important institutional improvements have
been achieved and independent agencies have been created or strengthened.
18.       The Bank's lending strategy in Tunisia aims at supporting Government
efforts to (i) increase employment, (ii) encourage more balanced growth and
distribution of income among regions and income groups, (iii) promote export-
oriented policies and investments, and (iv) provide selective support for the
development of infrastructure and for institution building in key public serv-
ices. The main supporting feature of this lending strategy is to encourage
the Tunisian authorities in timely and well-coordinated preparation of proj-
ects, with emphasis on technical assistance. The Bank is also cooperating
with the Government in its efforts to increase the mobilization of domestic
and foreign resources, in part through encouraging project cofinancing; the
latter is particularly important in view of the extent of Tunisia's external
resource needs, the large size of many priority projects, and the limited
availability of Bank resources relative to the country's needs.
19.       Within this broad framework, past Bank Group lending has emphasized
support for long-term investments in infrastructure and social development.
Lending for urban and social development, including water supply, sewerage,
education, family planning and the Tunis urban planning and public transport
project has accounted for 31 percent of Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia since
1971. Lending for transport, power and tourism infrastructure has accounted
also for 31 percent. Agriculture and fisheries have received 16 percent of
total commitments. Industrial and hotel financing through the Banque de
Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) has accounted for 17 percent, and
the Gafsa phosphate development project received 5 percent of total commit-
ments.
20.       The Bank Group has financed four projects in the water supply
sector, and three projects in the sewerage sector in Tunisia, totalling $69.5
million and about $71.5 million respectively. In the water supply sector,
the first two projects aimed to support the work program of Societe Nationale
d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE) by financing water supply
works for Tunis, the Sahel Region and the rapidly expanding tourism areas.
Both projects have now been completed satisfactorily. The third and fourth
water supply projects further contributed to improving and extending water
distribution systems for Sfax, the second largest city, and to increasing
SONEDE's water production and distribution capacity in the five northern



Governorates and in Greater Tunis (para 31). The fifth water supply project
presented here would help expand SONEDE's water distribution systems in small
urban and rural centers. In the sewerage sector, part of the loan for the
Tourism Infrastructure project, currently nearing completion, aimed to upgrade
sewerage facilities in five priority tourism development zones. The first
urban sewerage project aimed to expand the capacity for sewerage treatment
and sewerage and storm-water collection systems in Greater Tunis. The second
urban sewerage project approved earlier in this fiscal year, will provide
additional treatment capacity and facilities for greater Tunis and for Sfax.
In both sectors, important institutional results were achieved with the
establishment in 1969 of SONEDE, the National Water Production and Distribu-
tion Company, and in 1975 of ONAS, the National Sewerage Authority. The
creation of a separate authority for sewerage was appropriate in view of the
backlog of work to be tackled, and close cooperation between ONAS and SONEDE
has been maintained.
21.        In addition to the second urban sewerage project and to the proposed
loan for a Fifth Water Supply project, loans for a second fisheries project
and a second urban development project are expected to be presented to the
Executive Directors in the current fiscal year. In the next and subsequent
fiscal years, Bank lending intends to support the two objectives set by the
Government to balance its economy, namely promotion of agriculture and of
export-oriented and employment-generating industries. Emphasis will be placed
on agricultural production projects in less developed regions, such as an
irrigation project in Southern Tunisia, an agricultural development project
in the Northwest, and continued assistance for agricultural credit. Bank
assistance to industry will focus on small-scale industrial enterprises,
mechanical and electrical industries and possibly rehabilitation of the
textile subsector; this assistance may also include financing for the Miskar
project for the development and distribution of Tunisia's offshore gas re-
sources. The program would also continue financing selected priority social
development projects, such as a second population project, a vocational train-
ing project and further assistance to education.
22.       The Bank Group accounted for about 20 percent of total public com-
mitments to Tunisia during 1970-77. The Bank Group's shares in total debt
outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1977 (including loans from private
sources) and in debt service during 1977 were 14 percent in both cases. The
Bank Group's share in Tunisia's disbursed external debt by 1986 is expected to
remain unchanged from about 14 percent in 1977, but its share in debt service
would decline to about 12 percent of total.
23.        IFC has invested in NPK Engrais (a fertilizer plant), in BDET, in
Compagnie Financiere et Touristique (COFIT, a company to promote and invest
in tourism projects), in Societe Touristique et Hoteliere RYM (a large hotel
development) and in Industries Chimiques du Fluor, which will produce alumin-
ium fluoride from local fluorspar for export, and in the Sousse-Nord inte-
grated tourism development project. IFC's net commitments in Tunisia total
$15.7 million. IFC's Board has approved the sale of IFC shares in NPK Engrais
to the Tunisian Government.

PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
Water Resources
24.       Water in Tunisia is a scarce commodity.  Most of the fresh surface
water sources are found far inland in the northern part of the country. The
bulk of the population, however, lives in the coastal areas. Tunis and Sfax,
the two largest cities, are supplied with water from surface sources located
more than 120 km away. Although some groundwater is found along the coast-
line, only a small volume can be extracted so as to limit the intrusion of
sea water into the aquifers. The salinity of most groundwater found in the
sourthern part of the country is so high that it cannot be used as such for
urban supply and is even unfit for irrigation.
25.       Presently about 64 percent of the total population is served with
public piped water supply systems, and about one third of the total through
direct service lines. About 96 percent of the urban population is served by
public systems, while only 29 percent of the rural population is provided with
such service. Some 70 percent of the urban population or 2.1 million people
have their dwellings connected to the water supply systems. The remaining
urban population and the rural population living in agglomerated villages are
supplied by standpipes. Only 12 percent of the latter are directly connected
to the systems. The average per capita domestic consumption for consumers
with direct service lines is about 80 liters/day, which is considered adequate.
26.       Demands for potable and irrigation water are expected to exceed the
total available supplies of fresh water by the year 2000. Beyond that time
it will probably become necessary to resort to more expensive production
processes such as desalination of brackish water and recycling of wastewaters
to meet the demands. The Government enacted a water code in 1975 to conserve
scarce water resources and regulate the collection and allocation of water
according to usage priorities. A National Water Committee and provincial
users associations provided for under the code assist the Government in
these tasks.
27.       The Ministry of Agriculture manages all water resources in the
country. The "Societe Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux"
(SONEDE), the Borrower of the proposed loan, is an autonomous public entity
managed on commercial principles. SONEDE reports to the Ministry of Agricul-
ture to ensure better planning and management of water resources and is
responsible for the production and distribution of potable water.
Sector Development Strategy
28.        The major constraint to rapid expansion of piped water distribution
systems in Tunisia is the remote location of scarce fresh water sources from
the urban centers. As a result unusually long transmission pipelines are
required which are expensive to build and operate. Thus piped water for
small villages becomes extremely costly. The Government has, therefore,
placed first priority on supplying the urban centers where it could serve
more people with its limited financial resources.



- 9 -
29.       As second priority, rural agglomerated villages are to be provided
with piped potable water from public taps. The scattered rural locations
have not yet received much attention because, due to their small size,
the installation of public water supply systems would entail very high per
capita investments and thus be uneconomic. These locations are supplied with
water from shallow wells, irrigation canals, cisterns or public taps at the
nearest center. To the extent possible, the Government supervises the quality
of these supply sources so that they can be considered relatively safe.
30.       The Government has prepared three master plans for water resource
development in Northern, Central and Southern Tunisia. In 1969, the Bank
made a technical assistance grant for preparation of the Plan for Northern
Tunisia, and acted as Executing Agency for the study. The Plan envisages
multipurpose development of water resources, with priority to development of
irrigation perimeters, and to potable uses. The Bank-financed Sidi-Salem
Multipurpose Project (Loan No. 1431-TUN) aims to contribute to implementation
of the first phase of this master plan. Preparation work is advancing for an
irrigation development project in the South, as part of implementation of the
Master Plan for the South. The Water Master Plan for Central Tunisia is
currently under review.
Previous Bank Involvement in the Sector
31.       Since 1968, the Bank Group has become extensively involved in the
sector and, up to now, financed four projects of SONEDE (through three loans
and a credit). SONEDE itself was set up in 1968 under the first Bank opera-
tion. The first loan (581-TUN) of US$15 million, made in January 1969, was
to finance water supply works in the regions of Tunis and Sousse. In June
1970 the International Development Association made a credit (209-TUN) of
US$10.5 million to assist in the financing of improvement and expansion works
in eight areas of the country. These first two projects were jointly financed
with the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA). A second loan
(989-TUN) of US$23 million was made in May 1974 to help SONEDE finance the
construction of water supply systems for the second largest city, Sfax, and 62
rural centers. More recently in June 1977 the Bank approved a loan of US$21
million to finance the construction of production and distribution facilities
in five northern provinces. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development is
co-financing this project. In addition, the Bank Group assisted in the
financing of a tourism infrastructure project (Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN
of September 28, 1972), which included water supply works of US$18.5 million
in priority tourism zones along the coast, and the Sidi Salem Multipurpose
project mentioned above (para. 30).
32.       The Project Performance Audit Report on the first two projects
(Report No. 1902 of February 13, 1978) concluded that they had met their basic
objective of providing water of acceptable quality for the increasing require-
ments of the population in urban and tourism areas. In addition, the develop-
ment of SONEDE into a mature, technically sound and financially viable public
utility company has been a major achievement of the projects. SONEDE's stand-
ards of management and of operation continue to be remarkably high, and the
company compares favorably with many similar operations in industrialized
countries.



- 10 -
33.        In the sewerage subsector, the Bank financed sewerage works amount-
ing to $16.6 million in the context of the Tourism Infrastructure project
(para. 31). The first Urban Sewerage loan of US$28 million (1088-TUN) was
made in February 1975 for the expansion of the sewer system and wastewater
treatment in Greater Tunis, and a second loan of US$26.5 million (1675-TUN) in
March 1979, for sewerage works in Greater Tunis and Sfax. In both cases, the
Government, as borrower, onlent the loan funds to ONAS, the national sewerage
authority.
Sector Program
34.       The Government is about midway in the implementation of its Fifth
Development Plan (1977-1981), which includes provisions for connecting 77
percent of the urban population with direct water service lines by 1981.
SONEDE's investment program is sound. It was reviewed and endorsed in the
appraisal report (no. 1532a-TUN) of May 9, 1977 on the fourth water supply
project.  SONEDE has met the plan targets for 1977 and 1978 and presumably
will do so in the remaining three years. Between 1979 and 1982, the company
is planning to invest about US$500 million (page ii) and to this end is
receiving, in addition to the Third and Fourth Bank loans, financial assis-
tance from other international lenders and bilateral aid programs. The
Government is also financing part of the water supply investments through
capital contributions to SONEDE. The proposed loan would close an existing
gap in SONEDE's current financing plan of its investment program.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The project which was first discussed with SONEDE in October 1977
and then appraised in October 1978 would be the Bank's seventh operation in
the sector. Negotiations were held in Washington in April 1979. The Tunisian
delegation was headed by Mr. A. Frih, Managing Director of SONEDE. A report
entitled "Staff Appraisal Report on a Fifth Water Supply Project in Tunisia"
(No. 2393a-TUN, dated April 23, 1979) is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. A Supplementary Project Data Sheet is attached as Annex
III.
Project Concept
36.       During the last three years, SONEDE has been developing a methodol-
ogy for establishing the feasibility of expanding the water supply services
in medium-size towns and rural villages. It has developed criteria that it
would follow to select the towns and rural villages (or subprojects) which
would provide it with the highest return on the proposed investments. The
proposed investment in any particular location would always be the least-cost
solution identified after evaluating all feasible technical alternatives.
The basic criterion that SONEDE would apply to select the towns and rural
villages under the project would be the discounted (at 10 percent) average
per capita capital and operating expenses of the proposed facilities. The
average per capita cost would vary according to population size, between



- 11 -
US$20 for settlements with a population in excess of 60,000 and US$91 for
settlements with 2,000 to 3,000 inhabitants. Any subproject with a per capita
cost lower than the average would automatically be eligible for financing
under the proposed loan without Bank approval provided its total costs are
below US$1.5 million. Subprojects costing more than US$1.5 million or,
exceptionally, with per capita costs exceeding the average could still be
eligible but the Bank would have the right of commenting on projects in the
former category and of approving, based on a detailed socio-economic justifi-
cation, projects in the latter category (Section 2.03 and Schedules 5 and
6 of the draft Loan Agreement).
37.       Based on SONEDE's past performance under Bank financed projects the
entity is now considered mature enough to make an objective appraisal of the
subprojects (para. 32). Furthermore, the number of towns and rural villages
involved in the project is high and it would be unrealistic to try to list in
advance the best subprojects and appraise each of them separately. For these
reasons, a sector loan approach has been adopted to delegate appraisal respon-
sibilities for subprojects to SONEDE.
Project Description
38.       The proposed project would consist of:
(i) the expansion and improvement of primary distribution systems
in about ten of the country's intermediate towns;
(ii) the provision of water supply services in about forty rural
centers;
(iii) the extension of the distribution networks to connect about
96,000 new customers (about 600,000 people), most of them
in low-income areas of the cities;
(iv) the supply of water meters; and
(v) the review of the current national water supply plan to
restate the sector's objectives and establish realistic
policies for the design, financing, construction and opera-
tion of water supply systems in the country.
39.       Items (i) through (iii) of the project would help to increase the
percentage of the total poulation served with piped water systems from its
present 64 percent to more than 70 percent by 1981, with at least 41 percent
of the population directly connected to the distribution networks. It is
also expected that through the rehabilitation and expansion of the primary
systems in the intermediate towns and rural villages, improved services would
be provided to the population presently served by these systems. At present,
the low income population living in the outskirts of the cities is generally
served through public standpipes. The proposed expansion of the networks
would provide this population with better access to piped water supply and
make it easier for them to install private house connections.



- 12 -
40.       The provision of meters (item iv) is considered necessary to help
SONEDE upgrade its metering of water production and sales so as to arrive at
a better evaluation of water losses, currently estimated at seven to ten
percent of production. Regarding the national water supply plan (item v), it
has become clear that a review of SONEDE's current policies and objectives is
required as the needed per capita investments for providing water supply
services are projected to increase substantially in the future, with the
result of higher rates and perhaps a slowdown in the expansion of the systems.
The proposed review would examine the suitability of SONEDE's policies and the
measures to be taken to ensure a steady expansion of the services. It would
also evaluate the affordability by low-income consumers of the forecast
tariffs.
Project Implementation
41.       The project would be implemented in the period mid 1979-81.  The
Bank has reviewed and agreed with SONEDE on the design criteria to be applied
to all subprojects. Detailed plans are completed for a variety of subprojects
whose execution should start once the loan is signed. The project execution
will be administered by SONEDE's engineering department which is well
organized and sufficiently competent to carry out this task. During nego-
tiations assurances were obtained from SONEDE that it will follow the proce-
dures outlined in Schedules 5 and 6 to the draft Loan Agreement for subproject
selection and for the review and approval by the Bank of the selected subprojects
(Section 2.03 of the draft Loan Agreement).
42.        SONEDE would also carry out the review of the national water supply
plan and policies (para 40). During negotiations, an understanding was
obtained on the terms of reference of the review. The company's staff, who
is competent to undertake this task, would work closely together with other
agencies, such as the Ministries of Agriculture and Equipment, particularly
in determining the available water resources and their allocation to various
uses.  To provide SONFDE with sufficient time to coordinate its schedule with
these agencies an understanding was reached during negotiations that SONEDE
will discuss and agree with the Bank, by December 31, 1979, on a timetable
for the execution of this review. Agreement was also reached with SONEDE and
the Government that the conclusions and recommendations of the review will be
discussed with the Bank and appropriate measures taken for their implementa-
tion (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement and Section 3.06 of the draft
Guarantee Agreement).
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
43.       The total expenditures on the proposed project amount to $72.0
million (D 28.4 million) with a foreign exchange component of $32.7 million
(D 12.9 million) or 45 percent of the total costs. These costs include
$7.1 million of customs duties and other taxes on imported equipment and
materials for the project, and provide for adequate physical (15 percent) and
price contingencies (7.5 percent per annum). The proposed loan of $25 million
would be made to SONEDE, with the Government's guarantee, to finance about 76
percent of the foreign exchange cost, or 39 percent of the total project cost



- 13 -
net of customs duties and taxes. SONEDE would assume the foreign exchange
risk. The balance of foreign exchange cost ($7.7 million) would be financed
by medium-term loans from commercial banks. The local costs or 55 percent
of total investments would be financed from SONEDE's cash flow (including
customers contributions).
Procurement and Disbursement
44.        Individual contracts for civil works and in particular for equipment
and pipes for subprojects will be grouped together to the extent possible to
attract both smaller and larger contractors and to speed up the procurement
process. Contracts for goods estimated to cost more than US$150,000 and
for civil works of more than US$550,000 will be awarded through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's Guidelines for Procure-
ment. Contracts for less than the above amounts up to an aggregate amount of
$3 million would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally and in accordance with SONEDE's procurement procedures which are
acceptable to the Bank (Schedule 4, C of the draft Loan Agreement).
45.        For bid evaluation purposes, a 15 percent margin of preference or
the actual customs duties, whichever is lower, would be allowed for equipment
and pipes manufactured in Tunisia. Foreign suppliers are expected to win the
contracts for equipment, water meters and two thirds of pipe supply. Local
contractors should win the remaining pipe supply and the civil works contracts.
46.        The loan would be disbursed against:  (i) the full CIF cost of
all direct imports for the project; (ii) 70 percent of the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured goods; and (iii) 40 percent of the total expenditures for
civil works construction. The loan would be disbursed over the next 3 1/2
years. The closing date of the loan would be December 31, 1982.
Organization and Management
47.        SONEDE's current practices and procedures are comprehensive.  Its
management is cost conscious and performance-oriented and its staff competent.
The management is being assisted by two specialized divisions responsible for
internal auditing, and organization and operational control. As part of the
fourth project, SONEDE made a study of its management information system and
computer activities, in order to streamline them with the continuing expan-
sion of the company. SONEDE also carried out a review of its organizational
structure and procedures, and ways to improve them. Revised procedural
guidelines have been issued by the company's internal audit division, which
is also introducing an improved reporting system.
Financial Performance of SONEDE
48.        In the past, SONEDE has consistently earned a surplus averaging
US$6.6 million (D 2.6 million) a year, and has met the covenanted rate



- 14 -
of return of 7.5 percent on its net revalued fixed assets in operation, after
deducting customers' contributions and assets in villages with less than 2,000
inhabitants. During that period, the operating ratio (operating expenses
including depreciation as a percentage of revenues) remained fairly unchanged
at about 72 percent. Over the past four years, SONEDE has financed about 51
percent of its investment programs out of internally generated funds and
customers' contributions and 26 percent through medium- and long-term loans;
the Government contributed the remaining 23 percent as equity capital.
SONEDE's cash balances were adequate for day-to-day operations in 1977 but,
in 1978, declined to less than US$0.5 million. Conversely, the value of
inventories exceeded 2 percent of the company's total assets in the period
1975-1978. The company is taking measures to increase its cash balances
and is reducing its inventories to more satisfactory levels. For the past few
years, the debt service coverage has always been higher than 2.
49.        SONEDE derives most of its revenues from water sales which are
nearly all metered, and from charges for meter rentals and co,lIertion main-
tenance. In addition, new customers pay the cost of their connections,
plus a contribution to the capital cost of the distribution network. SONEDE
grants credit facilities to new low-income customers for payment of their
connection cost and capital contribution. SONEDE's tariffs, which in 1978
averaged D 0.087/m3 (US$0.22/m3), were until then sufficient to finance
the company's operations and expansion programs, and to satisfy the rate
of return covenant.  With the effects of inflation since the implementation
of these tariffs in mid-1974, as well as new and larger programs to finance,
it became necessary for SONEDE to increase rates (to an average of D 0.125/m3
US$0.32/m3). The new rates went into effect on November 15, 1978.
50.       The new tariff structure is both fair and effective.  As in the
old one, a progressive rate is applied for domestic consumption. The basic
tariff remains unchanged so that low income consumers will suffer no increase
in their water bills, large domestic consumers, tourism and industrial
facilities thus bearing the brunt of the tariff increase. Howewer, this
increase has little impact on total operating costs of tourism and industrial
consumers, since water charges represent only a small proportion of total
costs.
51.       The current tariff levels are expected to be sufficient to meet,
through 1980, the existing rate of return covenant of 7.5 percent. Additions
to fixed assets and inflationary increases of operating costs will require
subsequent adjustments of the tariff levels to satisfy the covenanted return.
These tariffs, together with customers' contributions and borro'4i1igs, would
enable SONEDE to finance about 83 percent of its capital investments. At this
stage of its development, SONEDE'S own contribution to its capital require-
ments appears to be more than adequate. Consequently, assurances were obtained
from SONEDE and the Government during negotiations to maintain the present
rate of return covenant (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement and Section
3.05 of the draft Guarantee Agreement). SONEDE's financial performance is
expected to remain satisfactory in the next five years. The debt service
coverage is projected not to fall below 2.3.



- 15 -
52.       SONEDE bills its customers every three months for the water consumed
and, through a fixed charge, for meter rent and connection maintenance. As of
December 31, 1978, accounts receivable from private customers stood at about
one month of sales and from Government offices and municipalities at about
four months of sales. The existing understanding between the Government and
the Bank commits the former to take all necessary steps to enable SONEDE to
receive full payment for water consumed by national, regional and local public
bodies within 120 days of billing.
Monitoring Arrangements
53.       An assurance was obtained from SONEDE during negotiations, that
the company would submit quarterly progress reports on the implementation of
the project to the Bank for comment. In addition, agreement was reached on
a list of performance indicators which the company would use to monitor the
efficiency of its operations. The numerical target values for these indica-
tors for 1980 and 1981 would be agreed upon between SONEDE and the Bank by
July 31, 1979, and for 1982 through 1986 by July 31, 1982. By the end of
July each year, SONEDE would report to the Bank the achieved values of these
indicators for the preceding year and agree with the Bank on changes in the
forecast values, as appropriate, and on any remedial action to achieve them
(Section 4.04 of the draft Loan Agreement). In addition, as of the end of
June and December each year, SONEDE would report to the Bank the level of
arrears on water bills by category of clients. Agreement was also reached
during negotiations that within six months after the closing date of the
loan, SONEDE would prepare and submit to the Bank a completion report on the
implementation and initial operation of the project (Section 3.04(c) of the
draft Loan Agreement).
Environmental Impact
54.       By expanding the water supply systems in towns and rural centers
the project would improve the sanitary and living conditions in these areas.
At the same time, it would also lead to an increase of wastewaters which would
need to be disposed of properly. Construction of sewerage collectors and
treatment facilities in Tunis and Sfax is envisaged under the Bank-assisted
Second Sewerage project which was approved by the Board on March 22, 1979, and
in other towns under an EEC-assisted project.
Benefits and Risks
55.       The main beneficiaries of the project would be the 96,000 families
(about 600,000) people who would be provided with direct water supply services
after their dwellings are connected to the water network. A majority of
these families would be among the low-income population who would receive a
safer supply through more convenient means. Other direct beneficiaries would
be those living in the outskirts of the intermediate towns and in the rural



- 16 -
villages, and presently drawing their supply from unsanitary water sources.
These beneficiaries would have access to a safe supply, as a result of the
proposed expansion of the distribution systems and the installation of public
taps. Many of the existing customers in the cities where the project will
be implemented will also note a great improvement of the services, after the
expansion and upgrading of the primary distribution systems are completed.
Under the proposed project, about 1,400 jobs would be created, of which
150 would be permanent. Some 80 percent of the jobs would go to unskilled
laborers. The internal financial return on the proposed investments would
be about 8 percent. A more meaningful economic rate of return is difficult
to calculate, but would be certainly higher, in view of the unquantifiable
health and environmental benefits which accompany improved water services.
56.       Works similar to those plaliined have previously been successfully
completed by SONEDE. The implementation of the proposed project presents no
special risks.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.        The draft Loan Agreement between Societe Nationale d'Exploitation
et de Distribution des Eaux and the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement
between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, and the Report of thie Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii), of the Articles of Agreement
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Special condi-
tions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex III.
58.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
59.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. 238:    Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: December 29, 1971; Closing Date: (Original)
June 30, 1976; (Current) December 31, 1979.
Cr. 238-1: Population Project: US$4.8 million Supplemental Credit of
October 13, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: March 21, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Under the Government's new decentralized and integrated health
policy, the national family planning program continues to show good progress.
The last of the 29 MCH clinics are expected to be completed by mid-1979.
Three of the four maternity hospitals are close to completion, and the fourth,
at Bizerte, is scheduled for completion late this calendar year. Bids have
been invited for the procurement of furniture and equipment. The Avicenne
training school is completed, equipped, and functioning. Because of delays
encountered in construction, the closing date of the project has been extended
to December 31, 1979.
Cr. 270:    Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: May 24, 1972; Closing Date: (Original) December
31, 1976; (Current) September 30, 1979.
All the 190 boats ordered have been constructed. About 96 percent
of the Credit funds is disbursed, the balance is committed. The remainder
of the credit will be used to finance fishing gear, and it is estimated
that project completion can be achieved by June 30, 1979. However, the
recovery of loans provided under the project to the fishermen remains a
matter of concern as the recovery rate has been low and measures to improve
the situation were taken only recently. BNT has recruited seven recovery
agents in its branches along the coast whose main task is the collection
of installments in the places where fishermen land and sell their catch.
Ln. 858: Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan of September 28,
1972; Date of Effectiveness: June 29, 1973; Closing Date:
(Original) December 31, 1977; (Current) June 30, 1980.
The project has entered its final implementation stage. About 70
percent of project works is completed. The remainder is expected to be
completed by the end of 1979/beginning of 1980. Total project cost, including
price escalation allowances, is still estimated at TD 31.5 million. Of the
total Bank financing of $24 million (including the fully disbursed Credit
329), 70 percent, or $17 million, has been disbursed.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 881: Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: May 24, 1973; Closing
Date: (Original) March 31, 1978 ; (Current) June 30, 1979.
Ln. 1189: Sixth Development Finance Company Project; US$20 million loan of
January 26, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: June 7, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980.
The closing date of Loan 881 has been postponed to June, 1979 to
permit BDET to disburse the last $0.6 million in the Loan account toward a
few subprojects which encountered implementation delays. The utilization
of the loan has been generally in line with the appraisal report's projec-
tions, which foresaw the loan to be fully disbursed by March, 1977. Dis-
bursement on Loan 1189, which is also fully committed, reached $17.3 million
as of April, 1979, about 6 months ahead of the schedule projected in the
appraisal report.  BDET has shown consistent improvements over the past three
years in the key areas of management effectiveness, arrears recovery, finan-
cial practices and resource mobilization. The institution plays an increas-
ingly important role in financing industrial development, extending about
one-third of all term credit available to the industrial sector in Tunisia.
Ln. 937: Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432: million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973; Date
of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date: (Original)
December 31, 1976; (Current) December 31, 1979.
The major part of the project has been implemented and most of the
objectives have been met. The project helped establish and strengthen the
Tunis District, the first regional planning authority in Tunisia. Work
carried out by the District in the housing and transport sectors has been
instrumental in bringing about substantial changes in public programs and
policies, such as the adoption of measures to encourage the use of buses and
restrain the use of private cars.  The project also assisted the public
transport company Societe Nationale des Transport (SNT) in renewing its
bus fleet and railway rolling stock, improving its organization and finance,
and upgrading the maintenance of its vehicles with the construction of a new
bus depot. In parallel, the city of Tunis adopted a new traffic plan with
a one-way street system, reserved bus lanes and restricted parking zones,
which contributed substantially to the improvement of bus services in Greater
Tunis. This, combined with an increase in the SNT bus fleet, and improved bus
maintenance has led to an increase in the use of SNT transport facilities by
about 27 percent above the level which would have been achieved in the absence
of the project. The construction of the last project component, a bus depot,
is now scheduled to start in May-June 1979.

Most of the civil works programmed under the third project are
now completed. The project is expected to be fully completed by December
1979, about one year behind the appraisal schedule. Preliminary financial
results as of December 31, 1978 indicate that SONEDE has met the rate of
return covenants and debt service requirements for 1978. The proportion of
cash in SONEDE's current assets of 2.4 percent in 1978 is considered low.
However, it is expected that from 1979 onwards, due to tariff increases and
other contributions, cash will gradually increase to an adequate level. As
far as current assets are concerned, SONEDE agreed that attention would
continue to be given to inventory management in order to reduce stocks to a
more appropriate level. Good progress has been accomplished in the execution
of the works included in the Fourth Water Supply Project.  Final engineering
design of the project components, with the exception of the water treatment
plant, is completed, and laying out of the project facilities and soil tests
are under way. It is now expected that, except for the treatment plant,
procurement under the project should be completed by mid-1979.
Ln. 1029: Hotel Training Project; US$5.6 million loan of July 17, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: November 4, 1975; Closing Date: (Original)
October 31, 1978; (Current) October 31, 1979.
Civil works for the first two centers started in July 1977 and are
now expected to be completed by July 1979. Revised cost estimates indicate a
project cost of TD 7.8 million (US$17.8 million), 45 percent higher than the
appraisal estimate. ONTT has proposed that the third center be deleted from
the project and that residual funds (US$1 million) be applied to the first two
centers.  This proposal is being evaluated in the Bank.
Ln. 1042: Gafsa Phosphate Project; US$23.3 million loan of October 1, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness:  March 14, 1975; Closing Date:  June 30,
1979.
Underground mining operations using the longwall method were in-
tended to supply phosphate rock to the Sehib beneficiation plant to be commis-
sioned by the end of 1979. Following the failure of the related tests to
reach satisfactory production levels a partial reformulation of the project
will be carried out with the assistance of experienced consultants whose
services will be financed by the unused portion of the Bank loan.  The ser-
vices will include (i) a 9 months assistance in further testing the longwall
method, (ii) a feasibility study for open pit mining of an adjacent deposit,
and (iii) a review of the Gafsa company's five-year investment program with a
view to designing and implementing an improved cost control system. In the
next 5 to 6 years the beneficiation plant will be supplied with ore mined at a
small deposit nearby until a new and bigger deposit is ready for operations.

Ln. 1068: Irrigation Rehabilitation Project: US$12.2 million loan of
December 31, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 18, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Progress in construction and rehabilitation work in the Medjerda
sub-project area continues to be satisfactory, except for water supply to
farmers on which a common decision is expected by SONEDE and OMVVM, regard-
ing the latter's contribution to the investment costs. Some progress has
been made since May 1978 in enforcing the Agrarian Reform Legislation.
OMVVM continues to encourage large owners to improve cultivation of land
and marked progress has been reported in the distribution of medium- and
short-term. In Nebhana, the land consolidation program is developing
well and farmers have been settled on nearly 60 percent of the total area.
Progress in construction and rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and
road networks continues to be satisfactory.
Ln. 1088: First Urban Sewerage Project; US$28 million loan of February 18,
1975; Date of Effectiveness: August 15, 1975; Closing Date
December 15, 1979.
The project suffered considerable delay as a result of a number
of factors, some beyond the control of the project entity, ONAS. As a result,
considerable cost escalation has occurred, chiefly in local cost components.
However, bids for most of the works have now been received and construction is
under way on all major components. The project is expected to be completed in
mid-1982. One of its major benefits will be release of land for development
around the Lake of Tunis, which until now has been impossible because of the
pollution of the lake waters by untreated sewage. Consultants financed under
the project have produced a land-use plan for the area, and acquisition of the
land has begun by Government.
Ln. 1155: Third Education Project; US$8.9 million loan of August 13, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: March 1, 1976; Closing Date (Original
Project: June 30, 1980 (Amended Project) March 31, 1983.
Following a change in the educational priorities in Tunisia, the
government and the Bank have recently agreed to reformulate the project. The
proposed amendment of the project was approved by the Executive Directors in
March 1979 on a no-objection basis following submission of the amendment.  The
objectives of the original project have been maintained and the modifications
relate mainly to a decrease in the number of ITM centers to be built under the
project, an increase in facilities to train teachers for ITM and an increase
in the amount of the loan allocated for technical assistance. The total cost
of the amended project is estimated at $11.3 million and the Bank loan is
decreased by $0.3 million to $8.6 million, representing the full foreign
exchange cost of the amended project.

Ln. 1188: Second Highways Project; US$28 million loan of January 26, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: June 16, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1979.
Civil works of Lots 9 and 10 of the Tunis-Bizerte highway are behind
schedule although quality of works is generally satisfactory. Construction is
in progress on Lot 6; alternative bypasses of Nabeul, Hammamet and Korba are
under study by the Sous-Direction des Etudes. Construction works of Lots 5, 7
and 11 have not started yet due to lack of local financing and, in the case of
Sfax bypass, problems with expropriation. The local financing issue has been
discussed with the Ministries of Public Works and Planning and a satisfactory
solution is expected shortly. The draft final report of the transport coordi-
nation study is behind schedule, since the Government is still discussing some
of the initial recommendations with the consultants.
Ln 1340:  Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$12 million loan of
November 23, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: July 19, 1977; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980.
About 28 percent of the amount envisaged at loan signature was dis-
bursed by the end of March. The appraisal of subloans for small farmers is
now progressing and BNT has made the first disbursements. The funds earmarked
for SONAM are fully disbursed and prospects are good for the commitment of
funds for service cooperatives to small and medium size farms. Commitments
of funds made by BNT under categories 2 and 4 are progressing satisfactorily
but due to cumbersome administrative procedures and other technical problems,
subloan applications of SCMVS under category 3 have been delayed. To overcome
these difficulties, BNT and the Ministry of Agriculture have proposed new
procedures, and BNT is expected soon to notify the Bank officially of the new
standard loan conditions.
Ln. 1355: Second Power Project; US$14.5 million loan of January 12, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: May 4, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The Project has been almost completed, and is largely on schedule in
spite of some mechanical problems with three of the seven gas-turbine units.
The consultants for the price study are being selected and the study is
expected to commence shortly, after some delay.
Ln. 1431: Sidi Salem Multi-purpose Project; US$42 million loan of July 5, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: July 31, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
For the project as a whole, progress in implementation continues to
be satisfactory. However, construction of the two diversion tunnels is about
three months behind original schedule. Accelerated efforts are needed to
complete construction of both tunnels and cofferdam by the end of September
1979. Progress in implementation of the railroad substructure is also
slightly behind schedule. The land reform and consolidation program has
been developing on schedule.

Ln. 1504/1505: Industrial Finance Project consisting of Seventh Loan to
Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) and a Pilot
project for assistance to SSI; Loans of $30.0 million to BDET and
of $5.0 million to the Government, of January 25, 1978; Date of
Effectiveness: October 13, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The start up of the project suffered from difficulties in finalizing
legal arrangements concerning the SSI Pilot Project component, which delayed
effectiveness by about six months. Nevertheless, commitments under the loan
to BDET have built up rapidly after effectiveness, and $5.0 million have been
disbursed as of April, 1979, in line with appraisal estimates. Under the proj-
ect, BDET is giving priority in its financing to projects which are located in
the least developed regions, sponsored by new entrepreneurs, characterized by
high labor intensity or export-orientation. No commitments have been made,
yet, under the SSI pilot project; however, a number of suitable projects are
in the pipeline, and commitments and disbursements should soon build up also
under the loan to the Government. The commercial banks' initial reluctance to
utilize Bank funds for SSI financing is being overcome. Considerable progress
has been made by the Tunisian authorities toward setting up a network of
Tunisian and foreign technical assistance experts, specifically catering to
the needs of SSI, as agreed under the project.
Ln. 1601: Rural Roads Projects; US$32.0 million loan of July 24, 1978;
Date of Effectiveness:  April 30, 1978; Closing Date:  June 30,
1984.
The loan has only recently become effective mainly because of delays
in finalizing the subsidiary loan agreement between Government and BNT. This
has, however, not held up project implementation. Preparation of project
works in the first two of the provinces to be covered under the project is
progressing satisfactorily.
