half of the current\n            five-year plan (1977-81) by expanding and improving access\n            to piped water for the population in selected urban and\n            rural centers. It consists of: (i) expansion and improvement\n            of primary distribution systems in medium and small towns;\n            (ii) provision of water supply systems in rural centers;\n            (iii) extension of distribution networks into low-income\n            areas of the cities; (iv) supply of water meters; and (v)\n            review of SONEDE's future investment and financial\n            plans and policies. Benefits of the project will accrue\n            mainly to about 96,000 families, mostly in low-income\n            groups, whose dwellings will be connected to the water\n            network, and to families in intermediate towns and\n            agglomerated villages who will be provided with safe water\n            from public taps. The project presents no special risks."}, "docdt": "1979-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
