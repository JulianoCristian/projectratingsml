         SONEDE's investment program during the second half of\n            the current five-year plan (1977-81) by expanding and\n            improving access to piped water for the population in\n            selected urban and rural centers. It consists of: (i)\n            expansion and improvement of primary distribution systems in\n            medium and small towns; (ii) provision of water supply\n            systems in rural centers; (iii) extension of distribution\n            networks into low-income areas of the cities; (iv) supply of\n            water meters; and (v) review of SONEDE's future\n            investment and financial plans and policies. Benefits of the\n            project would accrue mainly to about 96,000 families, mostly\n            in low-income groups, whose dwellings would be connected to\n            the water network, and to families in intermediate towns and\n            agglomerated villages who would be provided with safe water\n            from public taps. The project presents no special risks."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
