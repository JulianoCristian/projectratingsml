It is designed to address\n            emergency urban problems, to have a substantial employment\n            and income generation impact, and to be implemented so that\n            disbursements will be completed within 18 months. The\n            project will: (a) meet immediate physical reconstruction\n            needs in six heavily damaged cities; (b) provide financing\n            for the rehabilitation of the small-scale\n            commercial/industrial sector in the cities affected by the\n            war; and (c) assist in alleviating the severe shortage of\n            public transport in Managua. Specifically the proposed\n            components are: municipal reconstruction, credits for\n            rehabilitation of small-scale enterprises, and\n            rehabilitation of Managua's public transport system."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
