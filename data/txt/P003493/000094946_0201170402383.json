The implementation of civil works was\n            delayed by the floods in Hunan and Guangxi in 1996. The\n            economic slowdown in Asia in 1997 - 1998 had a negative\n            impact on IWW traffic. Overall, the first Bank-financed IWW\n            project in China has been a success. The key lessons learned\n            include: China's deregulation of freight tariffs, in\n            particular in the inland water transportation (IWT) sector,\n            has advanced more quickly than expected. Shipping companies\n            must modernize their fleets to improve operational\n            efficiency. Ministry of commercialization has realized this\n            and is preparing policy guidelines to encourage and expedite\n            the IWT fleet modernization process. In contrast to the\n            situation of other transport modes, coordination between\n            agencies responsible for water resource management and\n            waterway transport is satisfactory. There have been no\n            specific conflicts between these agencies during the\n            implementation of any of China's IWW projects. Given\n            that a waterway may cross country borders, coordination\n            between countries is gaining importance in the environment\n            of trade globalization. China is working on this issue with\n            Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia for the Mekong River, and with\n            Vietnam for the Red River."}, "docdt": "2001-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
