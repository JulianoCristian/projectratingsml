                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation was back on track after counterpart funding issues were sorted out in March 2012 and successful in putting up impressive progress but soon these funds
                         were fully spent as backlog of payments were huge. Although Bank made further disbursements to a tune of Rs 70 Cr, the state government has not made any further transfer of
                         funds to the project and so project activities were literally stopped. Unsure of the likely time the money will be passed on to the project, all new procurements were put on hold and so
                         no progress for several months. However, as of June 12, total Water supply schemes commissioned are 2899 habitation against a target of 3000 (700 under IDA swap), and 923
                         more habitations are programed to be covered by the end of the project exceeding project targets. 133 villages have achieved 100% house connections and 11 of them achieved
                         24/7 metered water supply. Community sanitation (sewerage) works have been commissioned in three villages and completion of balance 90+ is the target before end of the project

                         (December 2013 ). Since shortage or lack of funds created a huge backlash and no funds are released even in November 12, the project will have to revise the targets that can be
                         archived by December 13 and accordingly, revise disbursement projections. The project was informed to carryout this and inform likely surplus IDA funds for cancellation.
