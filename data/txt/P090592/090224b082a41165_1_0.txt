 The Project is closed on December 31, 2014 on a positive note with physical achievements exceeding its targets; and is likely to end up with about US$ 9-12
 million savings as non-investment components recorded low spends. Water Supply schemes completed are 4068 which is 127% achievement for both IDA and
 non-IDA Swap. Performance Improvement water schemes completed are 582 which is 291% achievement and Sewerage schemes completed are 97 and one in
 progress (97%). Since most of the sewerage schemes are completed in the recent past, connections to houses are in progress which is the community
 responsibility.
 Apartment exceeding physical target, some good results as in the following have been achived which are not envisaged in the project design:
 1.          Perhaps, the first state to have zero NC villages; equal to 100% coverage of water supply.
 2.          Number of villages delivering water supply for over 10 hours a day – 109 No
 3.          Villages delivering continuous water – 24x7 – 90 villages.
 4.          Number of villages having water metered / volumetric tariff – 375 villages
 5.          Villages with 100% water connections – 780 villages
 6.          Villages with water connections between 70 – 99 % – 1612 villages.
 7.          Number of villages recovering full cost including power – IDA SWAp 1024 (of 1452)
 8.          Exemplary villages – best in management of service – 641 Villages

         The project has two streams - IDA SWAP and Non-IDA swap. Earelier indicator include service providers of both the streams. But since,
         only IDA Swap achievement is required, the same is now corrected
