                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make good progress. Outcome indicator targets are expected to be either fully or substantially achieved by the project closing date for: new or upgraded
                         water supply coverage; percentage access to improved water supply and sanitation; new and rehabilitated piped water connections; and rural population with access to water supply.
                         Project targets are likely to be exceeded on Water Supply - both new (4068 out of 3200) and Performance Improvement (318 against 200 villages). Sewerage schemes likely to be
                         provided to 98 out of 100 villages.
