                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project will close on 31 December 2014. Outcome indicator targets are expected to be either fully or substantially achieved by the project closing date for: new or upgraded water
                         supply coverage; percentage access to improved water supply and sanitation; new and rehabilitated piped water connections; and rural population with access to water supply.
                         Project achievements likely to exceed the targets on Water Supply - both new (4018 completed and 50 in progress; target is 3200) and Performance Improvement (350 completed
                         and 300 plus are in progress; the end-project target is 200 villages). Sewerage schemes likely to be provided to 98 out of a target of 100 villages.
