                         excess over the target. Under IDA-SWAp, target is 1200 villages and so far 940 are completed;soon, this will also exceed the target. The Community Sanitation component (Village
                         level Small Bore sewerage schemes: $ 31 m) envisages completion of 100 villages; so far, 5 are completed and total likely coverage is 98 villages/ schemes (98% achievement).
                         Another small component (Performance Improvement of 200 schemes at $ 6 million) recorded completion of 23 villages and 191 proposals have been approved.
