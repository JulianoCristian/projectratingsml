Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Project is on track to meet its development objective (PDO), which is to build an efficient and effective real estate cadastre and registration system.
 The targets on two out of four PDO indicators, namely (i) increased number of transactions in land and realestate, and (ii) increased number of
 mortgages using property as collateral, have already been exceeded. There is 59% increase in number of transactions and 108% increase in the
 number of mortgages vs. the target of 20% over the 2009 baseline figure. Customer satisfaction, which is the third PDO indicator, is to be measured
 through a final customer survey scheduled for early 2015. The previous survey conducted in 2012 shows average customer satisfaction (measured on
 the 1 to 5 scale) of 3.6 vs. 3.8 target, and 3.3 vs. 3.5 target for the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC) and the Authority for legal and Property
 affairs (ALPA), respectively. The progress on the use of digital records for the delivery of routine services (fourth PDO indicator) over the last 6 months
 has been remarkable. Currently, there is 63.9 % of the country's territory covered with digital maps vs. the target of 70 %. The electronic cadaster
 system (eKAT) has 600 professional users who made some 34,000 applications on-line, which is almost 50 percent of all applications submitted to all
 cadastre offices. Further progress on digitization and development of on-line services is currently at risk due the disbursement limit imposed by the
 Ministry of Finance on consultants services in particular - which hinders the progress on all activities conducted through engagement of high number of
 individual sort-term consultants. Overall, project activities are on track to be completed with targets achieved by the current closing date which is June
 30, 2015. Actions agreed during the previous mission have been all met.
