1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) describes the experiences, achievements and lessons
of the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project (RECRP or the Project). The Project was financed by
Loan No. 47680-MK, approved March 15, 2005 and closed December 31, 2010; and by an Additional
Financing (AF) – Loan No.79280-MK, with the same project development objectives and revised design
and implementation arrangements, approved May 11, 2010 and closed on June 30, 2015. The AF scaled up
the scope of project activities and investments in cadaster and geographic information infrastructure and
services and added support for the Agency for Legal Property Affairs (ALPA), with the goal of increasing
the impact of the Project.

1.1.2 The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a landlocked country covering an area of 25,710 sq.
km, and bordered by Kosovo to the northwest, Serbia to the north, Bulgaria to the east, Greece to the south,
and Albania to the west. It has a population of around 2 million, and a Gross National Income (GNI) per
capita of USD5,150.1 The frequent troubles on the country’s borders in the 1990s and early 2000s had an
impact on growth and economic development, with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and domestic
investment constrained. At the time of appraisal in 2003, uncertainty of real property rights was seen as a
major constraint to investment in the country. The lack of confidence in the registration and cadastre records
due to significantly out-of-date and/or incomplete property records was having negative effects on private
sector investment and development of the economy overall. Such constraints were especially evident in
urban areas where 60-70 percent of apartments were not registered. Property ownership was not registered
consistently in any central location, with notaries maintaining a non-public record of transactions, and
municipal courts used only to record mortgages and rarely for recording property transactions. Furthermore,
cadastre offices were widely perceived as places with widespread corrupt practices. Another direct
consequence of unclear property rights was the limitation on collateral and mortgage financing, making it
difficult for citizens to mortgage and transact property. The Real Estate Cadaster (REC) had been in the
process of being established for more than 15 years (since 1988), but only 45 percent had been completed
due to outdated and overly complex procedures.

1.1.3 Government’s Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The importance of a secure property
registration system for equitable and efficient property markets for economic growth had been recognized
by the Government, at a time when the country placed a high priority on integration with the European
Union. The Government’s strategy towards reform of the sector focused on implementing the existing legal
framework, and in particular the 1986 Law on Land Survey, Cadastre and Registration of Real Estate Rights
(LSCR), which mandated the completion of the REC for the entire territory and the establishment of a
single agency responsible for administering both real property registration and cadastre (State Authority for
Geodetic Works – SAGW, established in 1992). With the basic pre-requisites for a successful program
satisfied – a satisfactory law, a viable single agency, and high level government commitment, Bank support
for the Government’s overall program in the sector was justified as a catalyst to transition to a market
economy, and to support private investment and business creation. The Bank was already supporting a
number of land administration projects in the region, including in several neighboring countries, and
brought extensive experience gained in these land policy and administration interventions. Additionally,
the Bank played a catalyst role for donors’ involvement and coordination by providing a common
framework for project interaction.

  World Development Indicators, World Bank, 2014. At the time of appraisal, the country ranked as a lower middle
income country with a GNI per capita of around USD1,700.

                                                       1
1.1.4 Finally, the Project was consistent with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS – FY04-06 of
August 14, 2003) in (a) directly promoting private sector development and the creation of jobs through
supporting the completion of the real estate cadaster and building institutional capacity for land titles
transfer; and (b) tackling corruption by focusing on improvement of service standards and customer
satisfaction mechanisms. Similarly, the AF adhered closely to the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS
FY07-10 of March 2, 2007) by further responding to the challenge of improving public service provision
in a sector that has a direct impact on economic growth through securing and promoting the property market.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
1.2.1 The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to build an efficient and effective real estate cadastre
and registration system, contributing to the development of efficient land and real estate markets in the
territory of the Borrower.2

1.2.2 To achieve this objective, the Project was to (i) accelerate the establishment of the REC and the
registration of rights; (ii) improve business processes and procedures through re-engineering of office
functions and introduction of automation and IT technology; (iii) improve the institutional capacity and
human resources of SAGW through the development and implementation of a strategic management plan
and human resources development plan; and (iv) develop the government’s capacity to formulate policies
in order to achieve efficient property markets.

1.2.3 Key performance indicators (KPI) were:
     Increased number of transactions in land and real estate;
     Increased number of mortgages using ownership rights as collateral;
     Increased satisfaction of customers with improvement in service standards of cadastre and
        registration services;
     Increased utilization of digital records supporting registration and cadastre services (introduced to
        better capture the impact of investments under the AF).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
1.3.1 The PDO was not revised during the life of the Project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 The primary target population was the same for both phases. The direct beneficiaries were the property
owners and those who held rights to real property, the cadastre and real estate professionals such as
surveyors and lawyers, and those wanting to make use of information relating to real property, including
real estate professionals and investors, municipalities, banks, and more generally all prospective property
owners. Similarly, SAGW (which changed its name in 2008 to the Agency for Real Estate Cadaster -
AREC), the central government and its institutions and notaries were to benefit directly from the project’s
investments.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
1.5.1 The original project planned to finance four components:

    The PDO formulation is the one used in the legal agreements and is consistent with the one used in the PAD.


                                                           2
Component 1: Completing the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration of Rights supported the
completion of the REC and registration of rights in all of the country’s urban and peri-urban areas, where
the real estate market is most active. The component included operational support for base mapping,
cadastral re-survey, support for systematic adjudication and registration of real rights, rationalization of
registration procedures and public awareness campaigns.

Component 2: Institutional Development and Improving Service Delivery provided institutional
development and capacity building to SAGW and helped the government to provide an efficient and reliable
service to the public and the professional community. The component supported SAGW’s restructuring and
associated human resource development to transform it into a modern and efficient national cadastre and
registration agency. It also provided support to the nascent private survey industry, and focused heavily on
improving customer service for secondary transactions. The improvements to ICT and strengthening of
secondary transactions were expected to benefit all SAGW offices and therefore all real property owners.

Component 3: Development of Land Policy supported the government’s capacity to formulate and
develop policies needed to ensure the completion of the REC and the full functioning of the land and real
estate markets. It also provided resources for drafting of regulations once the policies were adopted.

Component 4: Project Management supported both management of the Project, supported by a Project
Management Unit (PMU), and the monitoring and evaluation of results.

1.6 Revised Components
1.6.1 Two new components were introduced under the AF in support of the additional activities:
     Component 5: the mass digitization of cadastral maps, the development of a Web-based
        geographic information system to provide on-line access to the digitized maps, the development of
        a Government Geo Portal, and the upgrading of the country’s geodetic reference infrastructure;
     Component 6: technical assistance and trainings for the new co-implementing agency (the
        Authority for Legal and Property Affairs - ALPA), upgrade of equipment and renovation of offices,
        automation of business processes, and creation of a digital record keeping system.

1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1 Additional Financing: The AF loan (EURO 9.0 million), approved in May 2010, was designed to
scale up the scope and financing to strengthen the impact of the well-performing Project, which had become
the centerpiece of the Government’s agenda for promoting investments in the real estate sector. While
preserving the basic design of the original project and maintaining the same implementation structures, the
AF was intended to further enhance registration and cadastre services by upgrading in digital form AREC’s
national data sets in terms of accuracy, completeness and accessibility. The REC had been completed
nationwide and AREC had built its capacity for ICT and for service delivery under the first phase providing
the necessary pre-conditions for the AF. The new, broader scope of the operation resulted in changes to the
intermediate outcome indicators, while implementation arrangements were adjusted to reflect the
Government’s interest in strengthening state land management, with the inclusion of a new implementing
agency, ALPA (along with AREC as the main implementing agency). Providing support to ALPA to
complete the privatization of urban land, and improve its capacity to manage state property assets would
improve access to land for investors and the country’s business climate, thereby contributing to the
development of efficient land and real estate markets. The AF was designed to facilitate the implementation
of ALPA’s activities under Component 6 with support from the PMU.

1.7.2 Restructurings: A first closing date extension was processed in November 2009 to extend the closing
date to May 31, 2010 in order to complete preparation of the AF. A second level project restructuring in
March 2010 further extended the original closing date to December 31, 2010 to ensure uninterrupted


                                                     3
support while the AF was processed and presented to the Board, and make use of EURO 1.1 million in
savings from the original loan to advance several AF activities (piloting of cadastre map digitizing and
upgrade of the geodetic reference framework). Funds were reallocated from the Mapping/Cadastre Services
category to the Goods category, and from Consulting Services to Adjudication Services. The disbursement
percentage for all categories was changed to 100% to adjust for limited Government budget funds and the
inability to ensure the agreed co-financing due to the on-going financial crisis.

1.7.3 A second (second level) project restructuring in July 2013 further extended the closing date by 18
months (for a total project extension of two and half years3) to compensate for the delays caused by the 18-
month loan disbursement ceiling imposed by the Government in 2011-2012 aimed at reducing public
expenditures (including those financed by loans) to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis on the
country’s economy (see section 2.2.6). Most of the other changes introduced were adjustments to the results
matrix aimed at better measuring the impact of the Project, specifically:
        (i) Promotion of an intermediary outcome indicator to PDO level to better capture the impact on
        the PDO of investments under the AF, and introduction of core sector indicators;
        (ii) Increase of the outcome targets related to number of transactions and number of mortgages to
        reflect the new closing date (from 10% over the 2009 baseline to 20% over the 2009 baseline);
        (iii) Reduction of the outcome target related to customer satisfaction from 4 to 3.8 (on the 1-5 scale)
        to reflect the trend of declining citizens’ satisfaction with all government services as a result of the
        prolonged impact of the global financial crisis;
        (iv) Changes to the intermediate outcome indicators for Component 6 to better capture the impact
        of investments; and
        (v) Revision of Component 2 design to include support for upgrading of existing software systems
        for improved registration service delivery and training for the implementing agency staff, as a result
        of savings under other components.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.2 Soundness of the background analysis: The analytical basis and justification for the Project rested
on the documented lessons from several previous or ongoing operations in the country and in the region
since the early 2000s. An electronic registration system was developed under Norwegian financing with
participation of the Central Register in 2005. Though this system ultimately was not rolled out in AREC
offices, it provided the first step in moving to a modern digital registration system. It also provided valuable
understanding of the needs and capacity of land administrators and the public. The Project was prepared
with the support of a large and experienced team of experts, using the Japan Policy and Human Resources
Development (PHRD) Fund, as well as several Bank team members with long and substantial experience
in land administration projects in the region. Support was provided in the areas of registration, law, ICT,
training, policy, cadastre, monitoring and evaluation, institutional and social development. Such support
formed the basis for the execution of the Project and helped identify key design issues.

2.1.3 Assessment of project design: Overall, the Project design was simple, focused, and tailored to the
Government’s needs, capacity, and expectations. It built on the existing experience and lessons learned
from ongoing Bank, donor, and Government efforts on land administration and international best practices.
In particular, the project design recognized the need to: (i) adopt simple institutional arrangements and the
single agency model for land registration; (ii) address the wider land policy issues together with the

  The total project extension of 2.5 years beyond the original closing date does not include the three year extension
for the additional financing loan implementation.

                                                          4
infrastructure aspects to achieve the broader project goals of promoting the development of efficient land
and property markets; (iii) address inefficiency issues of land registration through the definition of service
standards; and (iv) minimize corruption through the introduction of accountability mechanisms (e.g.,
customer hotline). The Project was also fully integrated with complementary donor interventions in support
of the Government’s overall reform program. The PDO was clearly formulated and remained consistent
with the Borrower’s priorities until final project closing. Outcome indicators were well -aligned with the
PDO and the components were clearly formulated and appropriate for achieving project objectives. Key
Indicators, however, did not fully capture the scope of the AF activities, and an additional indicator was
subsequently included and targets adjusted to levels that the Project could realistically achieve (both upward
and downward). While the original project focused on completing the REC and improving services through
training and streamlining of processes, the AF introduced some complexity to the project design with the
inclusion of large ICT developments and a new implementing entity (ALPA). These new elements however
were technically justified considering that AREC’s capacity had been considerably strengthened under the
original project and continued to be supported by a well-established and experienced PMU.

2.1.4 Adequacy of Government Commitment: The Project built on the Government’s existing work for
a reliable, transparent and customer-oriented real estate cadaster and registry system and the general policy
direction for improved business climate. As such, project design benefitted from high-level Government
commitment and ownership. The Government was fully committed to the project methodology, objectives,
and activities and it collaborated closely with the Bank to improve key design elements by setting clear
directions for AREC and ALPA to deliver reliable property records. This commitment flowed through into
implementation, enabling key policy, legal and institutional reforms to be carried out.

2.1.5 Risks: Risks were appropriately identified in the PAD based on previous experiences with similar
projects, with capacity (both institutional and private sector) being a key one. The risk analysis could not
have predicted the global financial crisis of 2008-10, which affected the entire Bank portfolio in the country
and was ultimately the major implementation bottleneck during the AF (see section 2.2.6 below). Mitigation
measures aimed at ensuring continued technical assistance and training to build AREC and then ALPA
capacity proved to be very effective in overcoming difficulties during implementation, especially for key
legal reform and ICT activities. Similarly, a targeted transitional plan, including direct contracting and
training, proved to be an effective measure to overcome the reluctance of AREC surveyors to leave the
organization and ensure a very successful transition to the private sector. Finally, risks related to lack of
coordination for land policy formulation did materialize at the beginning, but the appointment of a Land
Policy Advisory Committee (LPAC) with a flexible structure, coupled with the project’s evident benefits
across the relevant sectors, resulted into effective policy coordination.

2.2 Implementation
2.2.1 Project implementation was effective during the first phase and several factors contributed to its
success. Except as noted below (2.2.6), there were no factors either outside or within the Government’s
control that adversely affected implementation overall. A Mid-term review was conducted in December
2007 and found that overall project implementation was satisfactory, confirming that the project objectives
were still relevant and achievable, with many results already well above the performance indicators’ targets.
At the same time, it recommended to move forward with the approval of key legal reforms to further
expedite implementation and achievement of results.

2.2.2 Significant development of the legal framework, with two major new laws on real estate cadastre
(2008 and 2013) and over 40 bylaws approved, introduced numerous legal changes that significantly
improved and expedited implementation. The legal framework was constantly evolving in response
to AREC’s needs and innovative practices. The new laws led to faster and more efficient REC completion,



                                                      5
by introducing significantly streamlined registration procedures,4 making it easier for citizens to participate
and register and dramatically reducing the backlog of unregistered cases. It also transformed SAGW into
an autonomous agency (AREC) providing it with greater management control over staffing, salaries, and
revenues that in turn contributed to improved performance and client services. The benefits experienced
with the approval of the new law in 2008 quickly built a momentum for reform and boosted staff morale
that in turn led to sustained efforts to achieve more efficiencies through the 2013 legal reforms.

2.2.3 The Project successfully leveraged complementary financing, especially for Technical
Assistance (TA) and training, thereby providing synergies and ensuring continuity of support and
strategic focus during implementation. The Project was an integral part of a larger overall reform
program for property registration, supported by several donors,5 which included:
 A pilot office in the city of Kumanovo to develop revised registration procedures, provide training and
    improve the archives. This activity, worth EURO 0.55 million, was funded by the Government of the
    Netherlands.
 An institutional capacity building program, financed by the Swedish International Development
    Agency (SIDA), focused on the development of key strategic documents (ICT, HR), business plans and
    the provision of critical training and support for ICT development. The total financing from SIDA was
    EURO 5.7 million over the two phases.
The Project played a catalytic role in the reform process which resulted in the alignment of funds and full
integration of parallel financing with project activities, in particular of the SIDA-funded capacity building
project, which ran for a total of seven years. The TA provided proved to be a cornerstone of AREC’s success
throughout the project period, and without it, AREC is unlikely to have been able to replicate best practice
in so many of its operations. In addition, the strong synergies and efficient coordination achieved under the
Project, through the creation of a single coordination group within AREC, ensured continuous support for
key activities (institutional strengthening and IT development) when the Project suffered delays due to
elections or fiscal constraints.

2.2.4 While the first phase focused on the completion of the REC, the AF built successfully on the
existing ICT work and capacity to scale up ICT development activities and the new system’s
functionalities. These included the rollout of the e-Cadastre system nationwide, testing of a module for
notaries, the development and implementation of the Enterprise Resource Planning system, WebGIS,
GeoPortal within AREC, and the e-bidding system and Management Information System for ALPA. The
Government recognized that to continue service improvements and efficiency gains a focus on ICT was
required. At the same time, a phased approach to the development of the electronic system6 had allowed
for not only technical adjustments but also for slowly building staff support for the changes introduced.
Further, at the end of the original project, AREC ICT capacity had reached a critical mass and the ICT unit
was able to translate AREC strategic objectives into ICT language, promoting technical changes that
directly responded to the Agency’s business needs. Nevertheless, recognizing the complexity of ICT
software development, the project continued to leverage intensive TA support for management and



4
  The new law expanded the conversion process, dealt extensively with licensing of private surveyors, and introduced
improved procedures for public display (systematic registration) by setting time limits for the display period and
mobilizing mass media for inviting owners.
5
  The Government of the Netherland also supported (i) technical assistance for digital map production, business
development and IT Strategy; and (ii) capacity building and technical assistance for the development of an NSDI
Strategy. Other donor support included: (i) map digitization (Japan); and continuous supervision and remote technical
support through the World Bank-FAO Cooperative Program (CP).
6
  As mentioned in 2.1.2, the Government decided not to roll out the electronic registration system developed under
Norwegian financing, but rather to finance the development of a new system with basic functionalities with its own
resources. In its first phase, RECRP supported this effort through provision of hardware and TA.

                                                         6
coordination of ICT projects and provided quality assurance and control, while some activities were
outsourced. The combination of all these factors, together with the ability of AREC to retain ICT staff
through higher salaries, proved key to the successful completion of ICT activities.

2.2.5 The Project put a heavy emphasis on training to facilitate and expedite behavioral change and
adoption of the new technologies. Execution of the Project’s training plan, in coordination with the SIDA
program, was very successful with more than 600 trainings provided to staff in areas such as system
administration, business and graphical applications, human resource management, establishment and
maintenance of the REC, geographic information system (GIS), and implementation of the new laws.
Substantial training was also provided to professional users (notaries, municipalities, surveyors) on the use
of the new automated system. Training was conducted primarily in AREC’s own training center (created
in 2005 with SIDA support). Study tours to Scotland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Lithuania, and
Serbia helped senior SAGW/AREC managers and staff to broaden their perspectives and proved to be
highly valuable, directly feeding into the design and implementation of land administration activities.

2.2.6 In 2011 loan disbursement ceilings resulted in significant implementation delays. Project
implementation remained very successful until September 2011, when the Government imposed a loan
disbursement ceiling aimed at reducing public expenditures and mitigating the impact of the global financial
crisis on the country’s economy. As a result, the Project was halted for 18 months, leading to the
cancellation of the PMU non-core functions, cancellation of several contracts and procurement processes,
delays in payment processing, and ultimately to project restructuring in 2013 and extension of the closing
date. The ceiling was lifted in February 2013 and the Project got back on track quickly and performed well
until closing. However, some delays in payments occasionally occurred from 2013 to 2014. The situation
became especially difficult when the Project entered the last six months of implementation and the
disbursement shifted to the Special Account Recovery mode. The Bank team kept a continuous line of
communication open with the Ministry of Finance, which was able to identify and quickly allocate
additional loan funds to keep the Project alive, confirming that the Project remained an important element
of the country’s business development agenda.

2.2.7 Consistent high level political support across the entire period made it possible for the Project
to be as successful as it was. The Government set clear directions to AREC to deliver reliable property
records and it provided the necessary support for the Agency to have the resources and overcome hurdles.
AREC had direct access to both the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister’s office. Support also came
in the form of supporting laws submitted by AREC and ensuring that they were promptly enacted. Aside
from implementation issues mentioned above (2.2.6), overall the Government responded positively when
AREC made any request, ensuring loan funds were available.

2.2.8 Successful Implementation was built on strong project management. From the start, AREC took
ownership of the Project, appointing two of its most senior staff as Project Coordinators. The already
existing AREC collegium made up of all state advisors and senior management met regularly as the Project
Coordination Committee, chaired by the AREC General Manager; and this structure was maintained
throughout the 10 years of project implementation. This project management was supported by a small
group of well-motivated professionals – the PMU - whose interests were closely aligned to those of AREC.
The leadership of the PMU were AREC senior staff and they had direct access to the General Manager as
well as close and long working relationships with senior AREC staff. The PMU’s leadership and
membership remained relatively constant over the life of the Project, ensuring that institutional memory
and experience were not lost.7 The senior staff of AREC actively implemented all project activities with the



7
    A large part of the PMU consultants were later permanently employed in AREC.

                                                        7
support of the PMU. The PMU proved a highly effective conduit between the Bank and AREC and was
very responsive to the needs of both; and even with the addition of ALPA under the AF, the PMU
maintained its high level of service. The PMU’s reporting was to a high standard as were its planning and
fiduciary functions, and it has served as a best practice model for several other PMUs from Bank funded
projects in the region and elsewhere for its procedures and approach to managing the Project. The Project
Steering Committee and the LPAC also functioned well and consistently throughout the project period.

2.2.9 Engagement with stakeholders, particularly land market professionals, was effective in
fostering collaboration towards reforms. AREC took many positive steps to develop and foster relations
with notaries, surveyors, and local government authorities involved in land. It already had a close
relationship with surveyors (most of whom were former AREC employees), but AREC worked to
established a good working relationship with the Chamber of Notaries and also local government
authorities, particularly to disseminate property information to customers through remote access facilities.
This created a collaborative relationship that has permitted other reforms (such as online lodgment using
electronic signatures) to be introduced smoothly. It has also ensured that problems, as they were identified,
were overcome in a constructive manner.

2.2.10 The Project had a Quality at Supervision review a part of the Quality Assessment of Lending
Portfolio (QALP-1 in November 2008) that rated the Project supervision as Satisfactory, recognizing that
the development objective was expected to be substantially achieved. Overall, the review felt that the REC
would be built on a sound footing.” Some concerns were raised regarding the supervision of social and
environmental aspects, though it was considered that these were not to affect achievement of project
objectives. As a result, the Bank carried out a thorough safeguards review and no issues were uncovered.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 Design. The Results Framework and Monitoring annex to the PAD contains an extensive set of
monitoring indicators that match the elements of the PDO and activities under the components. The
indicators, which are clearly expressed in concrete terms, combine quantitative and qualitative measures,
and they were designed to be an important tool for both managing and assessing project progress. Further,
the results framework clearly envisaged how the data were to be collected, including through reports,
assessments and customer surveys.

2.3.2 Implementation. Based on the PAD’s indicators, plus a variety of other useful indicators that were
developed during the Project, data were routinely collected and reported throughout the project period. Due
to the lack of a centralized IT system, some of the data were difficult to obtain at first and were reliant on
the opinions of local office managers. However, the registration software was designed to include extensive
reporting functions, which resulted in high quality data being available in real time. A regular program of
customer and social surveys, which were conducted by private firms, also provided important quantitative
and qualitative information. Extensive reports could therefore be easily and quickly produced, including
the evaluations for the Mid-term Review and at project closing. Skills in M&E were also developed over
time and provided useful inputs to the development of AREC’s various strategies and policies. The Bank
supervision team members regularly advised on M&E issues and such advice was incorporated swiftly by
the experienced M&E staff in the PMU.




                                                      8
2.3.3 Utilization. The results of the M&E were closely considered and used by AREC, ALPA, the PMU
and Bank team, primarily as a tool to monitor and report on project progress, but also to identify issues and
develop remedies to ensure that progress remained on track. Over almost a decade of Bank sponsored M&E,
reporting and analysis of results became a mainstream management tool within AREC, particularly the
gathering and use of indicators generated through the registration software system and web-based services,
and the results are routinely used to track both existing and new initiatives with a view to introducing
changes were necessary, as well as a source of information for policy research and future business
development. This situation is expected to continue into the future. The M&E framework was proven
satisfactory when the AF was designed, and the new indicators built on the success of the prior M&E
program. It made the AF very easy to justify as natural continuation of the work previously done. This was
a very good example of how project M&E should function.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Safeguards/Environment. The Project’s compliance with the Bank’s safeguard policies was
reviewed at entry to ensure that all potential issues had been taken into account in the project design. The
review concluded that only the Environmental Assessment safeguard policy was triggered by the Project.
Based on the initial environmental assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01), the Project was classified as category B,
with no significant adverse environmental impacts expected. An environmental analysis was carried out as
part of the project preparation activities to identify potential associated direct and indirect environmental
impacts. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared and aimed at addressing the various
possible environmental impacts of project activities. An environmental safeguards review conducted at the
end of the Project concluded that all of the construction and rehabilitation/renovation civil works done
under both phases were implemented in compliance with the Bank environmental safeguards, with no
significant impact registered during the works execution or during the operation phase. Some
inconsistencies between the general EMP prepared for the Project and the national legislation were detected.
Nevertheless the local contractors’ experience in terms of environment and health and safety protection
measures was generally good for the works completed in all sites with no significant impact on the
environment and human health. Other than construction and renovation of office space, the Project did not
support other civil works, land conversion, resource extraction or any activities that could potentially
damage the environment. Finally, the land policies developed under the Project, in particular on land use
and development, generally included inputs from specialized environmental institutions.

2.4.2 Financial Management: Overall, the Project had adequate financial management (FM) arrangements
over the course of the implementation period. The in-year project financial reports, (quarterly Interim un-
audited Financial Reports-IFRs covering all sources of financing and components) and annual audit reports
were submitted to the Bank in an acceptable format and on a timely basis, and recommendations made
subsequent to the regular Bank`s implementation support missions were appropriately implemented. The
auditors issued clean opinion on the Project’s financial statements during the implementation period. The
last project audit for the first six months of 2015, plus any transactions incurred during the four month grace
period was submitted on November 2, 2015, earlier than the due date of December 31, 2015. During the
AF implementation, in particular in 2012, the Project faced difficulties in terms of (i) adequacy of the annual
budgetary allocations secured for the Project, and (ii) timeliness of processing through the project Treasury
mirror account of the payments to suppliers, and then documentation of the actual use of funds to the Bank,
which created arrears that were, on occasion higher than EURO 500,000, hindering smooth implementation.
Such issues were to a certain extent common to other IBRD-financed projects in the country given the tight
fiscal discipline and targets set by MOF, and were closely followed-up by both counterparts and the Bank
team. While delays were experienced in the implementation of certain activities and the Project had to be
restructured and extended, the situation eventually improved and the Project managed to access the funding
and successfully achieve its objectives.


                                                      9
2.4.3 Procurement. The procurement activities under the Project were satisfactory overall. Throughout
implementation, careful attention was paid to ensuring that an adequate number of trained personnel was
assigned to procurement to provide timely and simultaneous execution of a large number of activities, both
in terms of the content and processes. In particular, during the AF when the complexity of procurement
increased, the Project hired a procurement assistant to support or independently implement a number of
procurement procedures. Moreover, the agencies appointed staff responsible for each of the activities listed
in the procurement plan and for contracts monitoring (contract managers). Special attention was paid to the
preparation of technical specifications and terms of reference, which greatly contributed to the delivery of
high quality products. An important factor in achieving efficiency of procurement procedures was the
evaluation committees, which were composed of experts from relevant fields familiar with World Bank’s
procurement procedures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1 AREC has all the technical, managerial, and institutional arrangements in place to continue its
operations, having been transformed into a modern registration and cadastre organization over the course
of the Project. It has emerged as one of the leaders in the region in a number of areas, particularly e-
services.8 AREC continues to learn from other European cadastre agencies, primarily through participation
in conferences, such as the annual INSPIRE 9 conference. While its finances are solid, AREC’s budget
remains partially funded and therefore does not have full control of either its income or capacity to make
investments. While the Government is committed to maintaining the current financial, economic, and other
policies to ensure the effective operation and maintenance of the project outcomes, AREC would benefit
from a move to full self-financing so that it could exploit all the income derived from registration and
cadastre activities.10 This would assist AREC to budget for and provide the inputs needed for its ambitious
program of expanding the cadastre into mass valuation and other technical activities. Marketing will
continue through low cost mechanisms such as interviews, press conferences, open days, AREC web page,
further development of apps, as well as a small amount of higher cost media advertising (including banner
advertising). Similarly, the process for further enhancing the legal framework will continue into the future,
including through the operation of the LPAC. AREC already has plans in place to divide the Law on REC
into three new laws addresing geodetic work, cadastral procedures, and the various new registries that the
Agency is developing (construction land, infrastructure objects, etc.).

2.5.2 Given the advanced stage that AREC has reached, there is great potential for AREC to exploit the
digital information created under the Project for the next level interventions, which would focus on the use
of land registry and cadastre data for a variety of market economy enhancing digital services, fiscal purposes,
and further support to land policy reforms. For example, mass valuation for taxation, state land management,
leasing of government owned agricultural and forestry holdings, creation of special economic zones, and
expansion of government-wide e-services would all benefit from both AREC’s data and its track record in
project management.

   The 2007 Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) Directive aims to create a
European Union (EU) spatial data infrastructure for enabling the sharing of environmental spatial information among
public sector organizations and better facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe. Each year a
European INSPIRE conference is held to provide a forum for stakeholders from government, academia and industry
to hear about and discuss the latest developments of the INSPIRE Directive.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
3.1.1 The development objective of the Project was highly relevant when the Project was prepared, and it
remains highly relevant today, more than a decade later. Improving land administration through a reliable
and efficient registration and cadastre system is fundamental for encouraging a dynamic property market
and eventually for enhancing the business climate. The objectives also remain very much consistent with
the priorities identified in the 2015-2018 CPS (89556-MK): improving the business climate to attract
private investment in order to achieve sustained private sector led growth and job creation; and increasing
skills and improving inclusion through more efficient public and municipal services. Moreover, the Project
was one of the Government’s core investment instruments for operationalizing its investment promotion
strategy. The Government’s efforts to protect the Project during the fiscal constraints created by the global
financial crisis are evidence of the Project’s continued high relevance for the country. Project design, based
on a large amount of experience and analytical work, was also very relevant and fully aligned with the
country context at the time. In terms of implementation, the Project’s record of important accomplishments
provides many relevant lessons for the country as well as for the Bank’s engagement in the sector,
particularly on the need for a focused and incremental intervention (see Section 6).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1 The Project fully achieved its PDO, exceeding its targets, and did indeed contribute to the development
of the land and real estate market. The Project built an efficient and effective real estate cadastre and
registration system.

3.2.2 The Project focused on improving operational functions as well as institutional development for
AREC and then ALPA. Completion of the REC was successfully accomplished by the end of the original
project through extensive improvements to the property registration process (e.g., through the introduction
of the limited-period for public display and the expansion of the conversion process in rural areas) and
support for re-survey, basic mapping, systematic adjudication and registration of property rights. Efficiency
in service delivery was further achieved through the creation of a private sector surveying practice from
nothing, an incredible achievement for the country, 11 and the systematization and automation of key
services and work flows (upgrade of the e-Cadastre system, development of the e-Front Desk, Document
Management System, and Enterprise Resource Planning system). Public on-line access and use of registry
and cadastre data was enhanced by digitizing 83 percent of ownership and cadastral records and making
them available in the e-Cadastre system, developing the Government Geo-portal, creating a One Stop Shop
Portal12, and updating the geodetic reference system, which is now one of the most modern in the region.
In addition, work on the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) created an enabling environment for
enhancing the sharing and exchange of AREC’s and others’ geospatial data for better planning and decision
making at national and local levels, by raising the level of technical interoperability between the various
institutions holding geo-spatial data.

3.2.3 The institutional framework’s effectiveness was strengthened by the establishment of mechanisms for
complaints reporting (hot-line), streamlining of internal control processes, and targeted public awareness
campaigns to both the general public and professional groups such as real estate agents, surveyors, lawyers,
notaries and banks. Furthermore, there was substantial support for training and developing human
resources, strategic and business planning, policy development, monitoring and evaluation for informed


11
   At the end of the Project, there were 152 private survey companies operating in the country, with 249 private
surveyors (see Annex 2 – Output by component).
12
   The Government GeoPortal can be accessed at http://nipp.katastar.gov.mk/geoportal/catalog/main/home.page, and
AREC’s One Stop Shop can be viewed at http://ossp.katastar.gov.mk/OSSP).

                                                      11
decision-making, customer surveys, and project management. In particular, the land policy work supported
by the Project led to important legal reforms that improved access and use of land and real estate data and
information across the country (see Annex 2). Finally, one of the more lasting legacies of the Project is the
development of priority land administration infrastructure through renovation and construction of AREC
and ALPA offices,13 which, together with the REC legislation, are project interventions that will deliver
benefits for the long-term. Overall, the Project transformed AREC into a modern, business-oriented agency
able to maintain and provide real estate cadaster data and services to its clients in a transparent and efficient
manner, as demonstrated by high customer satisfaction ratings.

3.2.4 The revised procedures, digitizing of information, automation of work flows and services, and training
of staff resulted in a sizeable efficiency gain as a result of the project: a ten-fold reduction in the backlog
of applications,14 faster processing of an increasing number of new applications, and lower transactions
costs. The number of days to record the purchase or sale of property or mortgages dropped 96 percent from
30 days in 2005 to just one day in 2015. A reduction in time to register and greater volumes being processed
without increasing AREC staff numbers effectively lowered transaction costs to the government and the
public. Each client that has submitted an application in the REC can, free of charge, check the processing
of the application online and obtain information on when the result will be issued. The property information
is available for viewing through the AREC website, free of charge, 24 hours a day. The citizens and
businesses can perform various types of real property transactions through a notary office, without the need
to go to an AREC office.

3.2.5 The Project not only met, but exceeded its PDO and Intermediate Outcome targets, and there is also
sufficient evidence that it contributed to transformational change of the real estate market in general and
especially on the properties financed by mortgage loans, where the speed of processing the applications for
registration of mortgage and legal security in general are considered to be very important. The cadastre
system and AREC are now widely recognized as a valuable asset for the real estate market growth (see
section 3.6), demonstrated by the increase not just in the number of transactions but also in the number of
mortgages, both of which grew exponentially during the project: the number of property transactions more
than tripled (from 42,116 in 2005 to 147,319 in 2015), while the number of mortgages more than quintupled
(from 2,920 in 2005 to 16,794 in 2015). It is noteworthy that this increase in mortgage market activity has
occurred against the backdrop of an economic slowdown. The figure below shows the indexed increase in
the volume of mortgages vs. the Macedonian GDP. Between 2005 and 2015, the mortgage volume as a
percentage of GDP increased from just 6 percent to 74 percent. For details, see Annex 3. Hence, the
development impact, partly attributable to this Project, was significant.15




13
   A large number of AREC and ALPA offices were renovated or newly constructed, and supplied with modern
equipment. Staff and clients are particularly satisfied with large and well-designed customer reception areas, which
reflect enhanced efficiency of AREC employees.
14
   In 2005, there were some 22,000 cases unregistered, while by the end of 2015, the number had decreased to about
2,079 (see Annex 2).
15
    In recognition of its achievements, RECRP was one of twelve projects (out of 282) awarded under the Work Bank
contest "Improving the lives of people in Europe and Central Asia 2010" for having shown innovations and specific
and tangible results in the improvement of the property registration system and having an influence on the lives of its
people. In addition, over the past few years, official delegations from the Cadastre Agencies from Azerbaijan,
Montenegro, Honduras and Nicaragua have visited AREC to learn from its experience in land administration reforms
and in particular the development and use of information and communication technologies for delivering high quality
cadastral services to the private and public sectors.

3.2.6 In relation to the key indicators, the following results were achieved:

    Number of transactions in land and real estate more than doubled during the original project, against
     a target of 20 percent increase over the 2005 baseline, and further increased by 58 percent over the 2009
     baseline by the end of the project, well above the ‘20 percent increase’ target;
    Number of mortgages using ownership rights as collateral more than tripled during the original project,
     and further increased by 179 percent over the 2009 baseline by the end of the project, as compared to
     a ‘20 percent increase’ target;
    Satisfaction of customers with improvement in service standards of cadastre and registration services
     was exceeded by AREC with an average rating of 3.94 compared to an end target of 3.8. ALPA's end
     target of 3.5 was substantially met at 3.36.16
    Utilization of digital records supporting registration and cadaster services increased to 83 percent 17
     compared to a 70 percent target.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 Overall, the Project can be considered a highly efficient operation. Assuming a project period from
2005 to 2024 and a discount rate of 10 percent, the net present value (NPV) of the project over the 2005-
2024 period is estimated at USD40.49 million and the internal rate of return (IRR) over the same period is
estimated at 37.2 percent. Given the Bank’s share of financing, the NPV of the Bank’s contri bution is
estimated at USD29.04 million and the IRR of the Bank’s contribution is estimated at 46.8 percent. For
reference, the PAD estimated the NPV at USD12.50 million and the IRR was estimated at 18 percent. It is
important to note that many of the PAD’s assumptions were too aggressive (lower baselines, higher
percentage of benefits attributable to the project, etc.). These assumptions were rationalized in the ICR to
come up with a more realistic estimate given the actual data that became available through the Project. (See
Annex 3 for details). Another economic analysis was done during the 2010 Additional Financing. Among
the three scenarios presented at the time, the NPV and IRR of the best-case scenario were estimated at
USD27.68 million and 10.06 percent respectively.




16
   Considering that property registration and cadastre is sole responsibility of AREC and that 94 percent of loan
financing went to support AREC, AREC's results are considered to have prevailing impact on the PDO.
17
   As of October 9, 2015, 89 percent of records were available in digital form in the e-Cadastre system.

                                                            13
3.3.2 In other land projects of similar nature, the percentage of benefits attributable to the project are
assumed at 1 percent to account for other market forces and donor funding. For this Project, this percentage
was assumed at just 0.1 percent (ten times less) because the usual 1 percent assumption yields extremely
high NPV and IRR estimates. Once again, this has been done to remain on the conservative side while
estimating project benefits and the efficiency of the Bank’s financing.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
3.4.1 The overall outcome rating of Highly Satisfactory is based on: (a) project objectives, design and
technical approach were, and remain, highly relevant to improving the real estate market and ultimately
private sector development and the business climate; (b) an overall high efficacy with regard to achievement
of the PDO; and, (c) overall high efficiency. Overall, the Project provided a fundamental contribution to
the improvement of property market development in support of the business investment development
strategies, resulting in a fourfold increase in the number of transactions and a more than fivefold increase
in market turnover in 2015 (see Annex 3 – Economic and Financial Analysis).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
     (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.5.1 The Social Assessment and a special study on minority and gender issues carried out during
preparation pointed out a number of social issues relevant to the Project, including ethnic minorities, Roma,
many of whom live in poor informal or illegal settlements, and gender. Although the Project’s focus has
been to resolve land rights issues across the country and across all ethnic groups, it has been limited by law
to formal, legal housing, and development. However, AREC has used its public awareness campaigns and
customer surveys to reach minorities through a variety of media in Macedonian, Albanian, and Turkish
languages.18

3.5.2 Regarding gender, women’s rights to property (acquired during a marriage) are well protected by both
the law and practices. Although all activities and communications were gender neutral through most of the
project period, there were few pro-women activities. With the development of a regional focus on
promoting and protecting women’s property rights in Bank-funded projects in 2012-2014, the Project
played an active role in this area. AREC representatives took part in two major workshops, developed action
plans for improving the position of women, and raising awareness regarding rights and obligations towards
women. AREC also participated in the Western Balkans gender and IT study, conducted jointly with the
FAO. The data, however, still show a gap with women representing 17 percent of registered sole owners
and men representing 83 percent (thought it can be assumed a great number of these are jointly owned with
wives, etc.), which is a situation common in the region.19

    (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
3.5.3 Essentially, the Project could be described as a government-wide project that built and strengthened
public sector institutions at the national and municipal levels. Institutional growth was evident in the
evolving capacity of AREC and ALPA to implement complex activities with greater agility over time. By
mainstreaming the Project into the Government structures, the RECRP strengthened the capacity of staff in
project management and upgraded their technical skills, particularly on ICT operations. The provision of
the new ICT systems has changed the nature of how AREC does business and created an environment of



18
   Albanians are the largest ethnic minority in the country, while Turks are the third largest (25 percent and 4 percent
of the population respectively according to the 2002 census).

reform and greater possibilities. A further factor in terms of institutional change has been the development
of a greater client-service focus. AREC shifted from an organization focused on establishing the REC to
one responsible for maintaining the REC. As a result, today AREC is a modern, service-oriented agency,
focused on delivering high quality services and products to citizens and professional customers, with well-
trained staff, more respectful attitude towards clients, better information and more services. Moreover,
AREC is already carrying out or anticipating responsibility for property valuation, a prices and leases
register, address register, infrastructure cadastre and construction land register, and is leading the work on
NSDI. This development clearly demonstrates that AREC is seriously expanding its responsibilities to
related fields.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.4 The completion of the REC was a fundamental achievement that allowed AREC to do far more than
was anticipated when the Project started. The impact of creating the REC has been very beneficial to the
real estate market and has enabled AREC to start moving to the next level interventions, including
supporting the use of land registry and cadastre data for a variety of market economy enhancing digital
services. In particular, AREC is recognized as a progressive institution that has been pushing the envelope
on NSDI by building and piloting a platform that has encouraged other key institutions to follow AREC’s
example and share their data. Moreover, AREC and ALPA developed an exemplary inter-agency
coordination model, where AREC created a specialized service that enabled ALPA to access AREC’s data
online and achieve unexpected technology upgrades in a relatively short time.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1 In the ten years of project implementation, five customer surveys were carried out by an independent
consultant to assess public awareness of the reforms carried out in AREC and ALPA 20 and clients’
satisfaction with such reforms (see Annex 5 for details). Clients included citizens over 18 years of age and
professional clients (lawyers, notaries, banks, private geodetic companies, enforcement agents), as well as
AREC and ALPA employees.

3.6.2 The baseline in 2005 showed an overall client satisfaction with the cadastral service of 2.7 (on a scale
of 1-5). The first client survey, carried out in 2006, reported an increased average client satisfaction of 3.44.
The second survey included a total of 1265 respondents, with an overall client satisfaction of 3.45. The
third and last survey carried out under the first phase at the end of 2009 included more than 1588
respondents, and showed a further increase in satisfaction with a rating of 3.67.

3.6.3 Under the AF, two additional surveys were carried out to assess the quality, efficiency and
effectiveness of the services offered by AREC and ALPA, evaluate the degree of client satisfaction with
the conditions and the functionality of the front desk/reception area, employees’ attitude, the potential
presence of corruption, and the level of awareness and access to information. The fourth survey, conducted
in early 2012, showed that most respondents were satisfied with AREC and had confidence in this
institution. They found that the information provided by AREC was of high quality and delivered within
legally prescribed deadlines. The overall satisfaction for AREC in 2012 was 3.60, a slight drop from 3.67
in 2009. The fourth survey was the first and therefore the baseline survey for ALPA, where customers rated
overall quality of ALPA services 3.29 (on the 1-5 scale).

3.6.4 The fifth and last client survey, carried out in early 2015, showed a further increase in customer
satisfaction for AREC from 3.64 to 3.94. Both professional users and members of the general public praised



20
     ALPA performance was assessed in the last two surveys conducted under the AF.

                                                        15
AREC and gave the institution a high grade for its work, with little variation across the country, meaning
that all REC local offices perform well. The results for ALPA were also positive, with an increase in
satisfaction from 3.29 to 3.36. More specifically, respondents were most satisfied with the accuracy and
quality of information they receive from AREC (78.4 percent), the attitude of employees (80.7 percent) and
technical equipment (81.7 percent). Most respondents (95.6 percent) believed that the quality of services
they receive in the AREC today is better compared to the past years. As such, they expressed a high level
of confidence in the AREC as an institution, which they recognize as very important for the economic
development of the country. Regarding corruption, the number of cases in which an AREC employee asked
for money, gift or service for a service that should otherwise have been completed as an official duty
considerably decreased from 15 cases in 2009 to 1 case in 2015. Regarding ALPA, respondents were most
satisfied with the behavior of employees and the accuracy and quality of information received from the
institution (80 percent), while they were most dissatisfied with the time for processing applications and the
price of services charged by the institution. About half of the respondents said that they trusted the
institution. The qualitative data showed customers’ satisfaction with the efficiencies that the Project funded
improvements (such as ICT investments) had brought to ALPA.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
4.1 The sustainability of project outcomes appears to be quite strong overall. The Project achievements of
consolidating a stable and reliable ICT system for land administration, improving the legal and regulatory
framework, strategic planning, training of staff, improving of service delivery, information flows and
access, and promoting policy dialogue are fully integrated into AREC’s and ALPA’s operations or the
government’s and can be maintained with little costs. There is a strong income flow through registration
and other fees and their successes have created the conditions in which continued government support can
be expected. The efficient and effective real estate system is a central element of the government’s wider
program to promote investment in the country and there are therefore higher level policy and strategic
reasons for the government to provide support to sustain the project’s outcomes.

4.2 Similarly, the public and land market professionals recognize the importance of registering changes to
property ownership and boundaries, and actively do so as the increasing numbers of registered transactions
show. The online system for notaries has embedded registration in the notaries’ work and the growth of the
mortgage market has been another factor in promoting registration of transactions, as banks require both
the current owner to be registered and for mortgages to be registered. Overall, AREC’s capacity to continue
the reform program in the land administration sector has grown significantly and has been consolidated.
AREC’s finances are solid and the trend towards a fully self-financing agency will strengthen its position.21
Adequate levels of staffing, most of whom are long-term and highly experienced, a highly experienced
management team and ICT team, and a regular training program will ensure that AREC maintains the
human resources it needs to move forward.

4.3 Finally, some issues that will further strengthen sustainability of the new modern system are currently
being addressed as part of the unfinished Government’s agenda, namely the regularization of illegal and
informal constructions, which are still excluded from the REC, and the establishment of an indemnity fund,
which would be an important safeguard against unexpected large claims for compensation in case of errors
and fraud. Thus, overall, the risk to the development outcome appears negligible to low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.1 Project design was focused and fully consistent with the Government’s sector policies and priorities
and the Bank’s CAS. It reflected the core lessons of previous, similar operations as well as international
practices, representing an appropriate design based on the information and capacity available at that time.
However, the AF key indicators did not fully capture the impact of activities supported under the second
phase, a minor shortcoming that was then addressed through a project restructuring. Risks were correctly
projected and mitigating actions were realistic and effective especially with regard to the surveyors’
transition to the private sector.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
5.1.2 Supervision was characterized by: (i) regular, well-documented missions including multiple skill sets
providing well targeted advice and observations. In particular, partnership with FAO allowed for highly
qualified technical support and assistance with quality control and strategic direction; (ii) seamless
transition between the (only) two TTLs that managed the 10-year project, and timely provision of no
objections; (iii) considerable follow-up, especially with the TTL based in the region during the AF; (iv)
clear identification of capacity needs; (v) intense and pragmatic efforts to salvage the operation during the
impact of the global financial crisis. The Bank team continually maintained an open line of communication
with the client and provided a flexible response to accommodate the changing circumstances, including the
possibility of (at that time) an exceptional extension of the AF; (vi) quick diagnosis of implementation
problems and proactivity in seeking restructurings; (vii) successful leveraging of other donors’ funding and
regular donor coordination; and (viii) inclusion of activities that were not originally planned that increased
project impact (e.g., infrastructure cadastre). Overall, during supervision, Bank teams were conscientious
in working with the government and other partners in facilitating the implementation of the Project and
looking for opportunities to enhance its impact.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.3 The ICR rates the overall Bank performance as Satisfactory on balance, considering the Satisfactory
rating for performance in ensuring quality at entry and the Highly Satisfactory quality of supervision, in
view of the Highly Satisfactory overall project outcome.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.2.1 Overall, the Government provided strong support to the Project and its activities, including an
appropriate policy framework for the development of the market economy, promotion of investment, and
privatization of the survey profession. This resulted in the Project’s ability to achieve challenging policy,
legal and institutional reforms relating to the establishment of a reliable, automated registry and cadastre
system and the provision of efficient services. The Government further provided a clear direction and
agenda for both AREC and ALPA for the modernization of operations, and appointed a person with
adequate leadership to oversee the process. The government also ensured that there was consistency in
management, with the prompt appointment of capable managers. However, the restrictions in releasing loan
funds in 2011 and 2012, due to the wider macro-economic conditions and the Government’s responsible
attitude to debt, put the Project at risk with significant impact on its implementation.



                                                     17
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
5.2.2 AREC had a clear vision for the future, based on e-services, and the necessary skills in management
and access to resources to make that vision real. It had the determination to implement the Project and
showed consistently committed effort, even with obstacles from 2012 onwards, to collaborate with the Bank
team in moving the Project forward. For example, it was very responsive in restoring enabling conditions
for effective project implementation following the global financial crisis, by taking over financing of some
of the Project’s critical activities (quality control work) when loan funds became unavailable and going the
extra mile to catch up with works and compensate for the time lost during the introduction of the budget
ceilings. Strong, consistent leadership by the director generals, coupled with a highly experienced,
knowledgeable senior management team, ensured continuity and enabled consistent and efficient
management of activities.22 Moreover, AREC’s acceptance of modern management tools of planning and
a willingness to modify approaches and laws were instrumental for delivering results. ALPA’s performance
suffered initially from delays in decision making and approval, which resulted in slow implementation
progress. With a change in management early on, ALPA was able to shift gear and make major progress.
The Agency showed strong commitment to reforms and dramatically strengthened its capacity to meet the
project objectives. During the 10 years of project implementation, the PMU managed to grow into a reliable,
experienced management team that provided best practice support to the implementing agencies.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.3 Overall Borrower performance takes into consideration both the Government and the Implementing
Agencies’ performance during preparation and implementation. On the basis of the justification provided
above, the Borrower’s overall performance is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
6.1 The most important lessons learned were the following:

Technology can have a transformative impact on service delivery, even with smaller investments. As
AREC has provided various means of delivering its services remotely and through stakeholders (notaries,
surveyors, local government) over the last few years, and as ALPA begins lodging documents digitally, the
impact on local office operations have become obvious. Fewer and fewer people visit the offices and
applications can be processed anywhere in the country. The lesson being learned is that centralized
processing centers with numerous points of entry (AREC web page, stakeholders’ offices, stand -alone
AREC front offices without back office processing) are the future, particularly as they will reduce costs and
ensure greater consistency of service, while permitting a full range of options for people to access services.

An incremental approach to developing ICT system and adopting new technology in the e-commerce
and e-government areas proved to be more successful than a “big bang” approach. Unlike other
projects, in which all ICT solutions were designed to be delivered under a single contract, AREC adopted
an incremental approach to developing and rolling out technology. It also developed much of the technology
in house, rather than outsourcing. This staged approach proved effective from an uptake perspective too.
Staff and land market professionals were progressively introduced to new options as they were
progressively developed and rolled out over a period of five years. As a result, AREC did not encounter the




22
  There were only two changes to director general in ten years of project implementation, and little change in the
wider management team.


                                                       18
failures of ICT systems seen in other projects, managing to deliver the full range of options (including
online lodgement and use of electronic signatures) in a relatively short period of time, with extremely wide
uptake and without the expenditure of large sums.

While technology is an important tool, a clear government decision coupled with adequate financial
and technical support are necessary enabling conditions for achieving reforms and delivering an
improved service to the public. The Project showed that a country can deliver reliable property records
and improved tenure security in a relatively short time through building interest for and commitment to
land policy work and support to new laws. In particular, Government support was critical for moving from
completely public sector responsibility for surveying work to the private sector, simplifying the procedures
for achieving completion of the REC, initiating regularization of illegal buildings, and improving
procedures for access to, and sharing of, land and real estate data.

At the same time, willingness at the top level is required to transform the culture of an organization
from an inward looking to an outward looking, customer oriented agency that strives to deliver better
services more quickly and efficiently. Though its reforms to laws, ICT and office design were important,
AREC’s purposeful decision to reach out to its customers (both citizens and professional customers)
through new services, new technology, training for its staff, and new means of communicating with
customers, stemmed from a clear change of approach by top level management to make customers’
satisfaction the organization’s central focus. Further, the ability of the Project to show early results was
critical for building momentum for further reforms.

Project specific:

Conversion of existing property records is a low cost and quick means of conducting first registration.
Early on, AREC identified that conversion of old property records would permit large areas of the country
to be registered at low cost even if the quality of the data was not optimal. AREC also recognized that the
data would be progressively improved once it was in the new system. Therefore, conversion permitted the
country to quickly complete first registration, establish nation-wide records on parcels and ownership, and
roll out the system across the entire country, ensuring that the entire population received its benefits. It also
allowed AREC to quickly move to focus on improving the transaction registration system, which was
equally necessary if the property registration system was to operate efficiently and effectively. Similarly,
the digitizing of the indexes (which are essential for all staff to use in registering transactions) was
undertaken early on in implementation. This allowed for this information to be immediately put into use,
greatly increasing the efficiency of staff while at the same time greatly reducing cost in terms of time and
money.

Successful projects are an important source of South-South cooperation. The success of AREC’s
activities across the entire range of registration activities has prompted visits from other Bank-funded land
administration projects. There have been visits from Azerbaijan, Montenegro, Honduras and Nicaragua to
observe what AREC has done. AREC has also provided advice on reforming the legal framework to
neighboring Montenegro and Serbia. AREC provides a very suitable and relevant comparison and guide to
the future for countries with similar contexts and levels of development in which Bank funded registration
projects are underway.

                                                       19
With respect to the draft Implementation Completion and Results report of the Project "Real Estate Cadastre
and Registration", financed by two loans from the World Bank (IBRD 4768 MK and IBRD 7928 MK), the
Ministry of Finance, as a signatory of both Loan Agreements, and the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre and
the Property and Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Finance, as the agencies that implemented the project in
two phases (2005-2010 and 2010-2015), have no remarks/objections regarding the contents of the final
draft report.

At the same time, we express our gratitude to the World Bank’s assessment of the Project underlined in the
text of the submitted completion report. It is worth noting that the successful implementation of the Project
was due to the excellent cooperation that existed between the teams of the World Bank and the agencies
that implemented the project for the past 10 years. We hope that the cooperation with the World Bank will
continue in the future for implementation of future projects that are of great importance for our agencies
and our country in general.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Comments were provided by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands:

We miss reference in the ICR to the consulting service that the Dutch Cadastre carried out on the outreach
and capacity building as part of the overall activities for developing the Strategy for National Spatial Data
Infrastructure (NSDI) for the country.

We do not see a reference to two projects funded by the Dutch Government and related to the World Bank
project initiatives: a) technical assistance related to the process of Digital Map production, business
development and IT Strategy (September 2009-May 2010, 130.000 EURO); and (b) support for the
development of an NSDI Strategy (November 2010-November 2012, 200.000 EURO).

Team response: This important contribution has been reflected in the final ICR.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 – Completing the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration of Rights

This component was envisaged to support the completion of the REC and the registration of rights in all
urban and peri-urban areas in the country23, where the property market is the most active. The component’s
activities were mostly completed by December 31, 2010 (the revised closing date of the original Loan).

Through the Project, 197 cadastre municipalities (CMs) in the largest six urban areas of the country (Skopje,
Bitola, Kumanovo, Tetovo, Struga and Kicevo) were completed, along with an additional 660 CMs located
in urban and peri-urban areas. By December 2010, 99.5% of the real estate cadastre had been completed.
Nevertheless, at least 75% of the parcels, buildings and apartments did not have registered rights. The
establishment of the REC on 100% of the territory of the country was accomplished by the end of 2012 (see
Graph 1).

Activities were divided in two subcomponents:

Subcomponent 1. A - Operational Support for the Completion of the REC

1.A.i Base Mapping (State Survey)

The completion of base mapping activities (state survey) was supported by a large number of previously
conducted activities such as aero-photogrammetric survey of 190 CMs in the area of Gostivar for the
production of basic geodetic maps (total area 79,200 ha). The preparatory field work, prior to the aero-
photogrammetric survey, was supported by a previously carried out public awareness campaign under the
slogan “mark what is yours”. By the end of 2010, the Project produced 79,757 ha of base mapping.

1.A.ii. Resurvey and updating of cadastral maps

The objective of this sub-component was to re-survey or update existing base maps throughout the country.
Areas that were not covered with REC or Land Cadastre (LC) were divided in three main categories based
on development and prioritization criteria. In urban and peri-urban areas that were characterized as dynamic
land and property markets (Part A) a total of 30,275ha in 197 CMs was re-surveyed or updated in the
existing base maps. In residential areas in smaller towns and villages were the land market was not as active
(Part B), a total of 52,800ha in 660 CMs were surveyed using simple cadastral surveying methods
(reambulation). This work was tendered in small packages to local private sector firms, which provided the
impetus for a new private sector to emerge and for cost-efficiency. In rural areas where the land is mainly
used for agricultural and forestry activities or in mountainous areas of limited commercial significance (Part
C) the Project surveyed a total of 395,000ha. Maps were produced in digital form transferred in the local
offices for REC regular use and updating.

     The real estate cadastre had been developed primarily in rural areas and smaller municipalities prior to the Project.

1.A.iii Support for the Systematic Adjudication and Registration of Real Rights

In order to carry out the procedure for registration of property rights (public display of property data and
possible right holders), additional commissions comprised of lawyers, surveyors and administrators were
established, while additional training was carried out with the support of the SIDA-funded project. By the
end of 2010, the Project had adjudicated 237,017 parcels and 222,823 objects; 184,541 clients were invited
to commissions for review of their legal documents, of which 127,939 attended the commissions (69.33%);
there was a total of 197,754 properties with rights fully registered; and 94,771 properties where the property
was registered, but further documents were required.

The Project achieved the following results:


  Number of CMs with established REC (cumulative)                            1,735

  Urban CMs with established REC ( ha )                                      69,480
  % of urban CMs with established REC (cumulative)                           2.73%

  Rural CMs with established REC (ha)                                        2,159,551
  % of rural CMs with established REC (cumulative)                           88.58%

   % of the CMs with established REC (cumulative)                            91.31%

   Number of CMs with established REC - with conversion                      429

   Number of parcels with registered rights in all CMs with REC              4,202,000

   Number of objects with registered rights in all CMs with REC              425,800

   Number of apartments with registered rights in all CMs with REC           1,093,700
  Owners with unregistered rights in the CMs with REC                        8.8%

1.A.iv Rationalization of Registration Procedures

The objective of this sub-component was to improve the methodology and management of registration
functions. The Project provided short term local and international technical assistance to support and
document the rationalization and streamlining of procedures for various types of first registration and
secondary registration. It also funded technical assistance from international experts in order to improve
the registration processes, and supported the draft of the 2008 and 2013 Laws on REC and their relevant
by-laws.

1. Law on NSDI of 2014

What the rationalization of registration procedures meant in practice was that AREC was able to monitor
the set deadlines for processing the applications by clients and work towards the continuous reduction of

                                                      26
unprocessed/backlog applications. In the period between 2005 and 2013, the percentage of unprocessed
applications began to decrease in comparison to the applications received. In 2005, the percentage of
unprocessed applications in comparison to the total number of received applications was 6.79%, while in
2008 with the adoption of the Law on Real Estate Cadastre, the percentage of unprocessed applications in
relation to the total number of received applications was 0.64%, and in 2014 it was just 0.17%.

Subcomponent 1. B – Public Awareness

The objective of this sub-component was to build support for the systematic registration process amongst
the public, and thus their engagement in the process. An extensive public awareness program ran over the
course of the Project, based on a strategy developed by a public relations firm, which also ran much of the
program for AREC. The main objectives of the first public awareness campaign, under the slogan “know
who owns what”, was to support the completion of the REC. This first campaign focused on: (i) promoting
AREC as a transparent institution ready to communicate with the public; (ii) familiarizing the public on
AREC’s responsibilities, current activities and reforms, and fees for the services provide; (iii) promoting
reforms underway through citizens’ assistance, especially regarding elimination of corruption and increase
of efficiency. A second phase of the campaign, under the slogan “The Cadastre – a citizens’ service” was
focused on providing expert advice to the public for the resolution of properties issues for the REC
maintenance. In the final stages of the Project, AREC continued the public awareness program through the
promotion of a campaign under the slogan “Openly with the Cadastre”. A broad range of material and
activities were developed, including brochures and posters, radio and television commercials and interviews,
press releases, open days at local AREC offices, use of social media (Facebook) and apps, and other means
of providing information to customers. Various languages (Macedonian, Albanian and Turkish) were used
depending on the needs of the local communities. The public campaign was also focused on branding and
marketing. In the Center for REC – Skopje and in all 29 REC local offices, advertising billboards and User’s


                                                       27
Bill of Rights were placed which provide all required information on services offered and procedures
required. AREC continues such activities through its own public awareness program.

Component 2 – Institutional Strengthening

The original objective of Component 2 was to transform SAGW into a modern and efficient national
cadastre and registration agency and to improve service delivery of all local and regional offices with a goal
to complete the registration of transactions in one day by the end of the Project. Under the AF, a limited set
of activities was included aimed at supporting and improving AREC’s central functions (HR, FM, public
awareness) to further support the customer orientation of the Agency following outsourcing and AREC’s
shift to an organization focused on quality control and supervision rather than on executing the work. The
component also supported the continuation of the successful public awareness campaign with a focus on
the NSDI awareness and marketing of AREC services and data. This component further supported the
development of the private survey profession, which resulted in cost-efficiency for the completion of the
REC. At the end of the Project, there were 152 private survey companies operating in the country, with 249
private surveyors.

Subcomponent 2.A. Institutional Development of AREC

This sub-component provided the required planning, analysis and development of strategies in order to
enable AREC to reach its objective – becoming a self-financing agency with efficient, reliable and
customer-oriented service provision. During the first stage of the RECRP, AREC carried out the first
analysis for financial management and the financial capabilities of the agency and developed a strategy
framework and business plan. The Project also supported renovation of the offices with the objective to
provide a more professional working environment.

In 2007, the Main Strategic Business Plan was drafted for the period 2007-2010 and defined the vision,
long-term and short-term objectives, and strategies and activities required to meet those objectives. The
strategic plan has enabled a practical frame as well as a basis for annual planning by AREC. In 2010, AREC
produced a Strategic Plan for the period 2011-2015 and in 2013 it updated its Strategic Plan with new


                                                         28
priorities aimed at enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and safety of electronic geodetic – cadastre
information systems as well as the strengthening of institutional capacities. AREC also completed a new
draft Strategic Plan for 2016-2018 defining AREC priorities and further development. Finally, the Project
supported the preparation of a strategy for human resources management, a cost recovery strategy (with a
tariff list), an IT/IM strategy and an AREC marketing plan.

Subcomponent 2.B. Transparency and Accountability

This sub-component addressed some of the findings of the social assessment and assisted AREC in
becoming a transparent and responsive agency. In 2007, a client bill of rights in Macedonian, Albanian and
Turkish languages was issued both in paper and electronic format, which was promoted through posters in
AREC’s central Skopje office and in each of AREC’s 29 local offices. The bill of rights was made available
in brochure form for clients’ reference.

A hotline for reporting irregularities, complaints and misconduct was established in 2006, which was then
rebranded as the AREC Contact Center launched officially on May 12, 2014. The project-funded telephone
center at AREC uses software to manage and monitor the calls, and it operates as a single point of contact
for users (professional, internal and the general public) through a toll-free number Macedonian, Albanian
and English. At project closure, the Center was receiving over 2,000 calls per month. The Center also
responds to enquiries submitted by email from users. In addition to the general toll-free line, there are
dedicated phone lines for foreign investors, domestic business companies and professional users of the
electronic Front Desk and electronic (notaries, private geodetic companies, municipalities, enforcement
agents, lawyers, banks). The following graph shows the status of the total number of received calls via the
Contact Center, the total number of submitted questions by the professional users, the total number of
requested information as well as the total number of submitted questions for which the answer is currently
being prepared (as of August 2015).

Subcomponent 2.C. Improvement of registration services intended for the public

The objective of this subcomponent was to improve registration services to the public, mainly through
infrastructure improvements for AREC’s offices across the country for the better r eception of clients. The
renovation of all 29 local offices for REC was fully completed to the satisfaction of AREC employees and
the clients, especially the front desk area. For the Center for REC-Skopje a new building was constructed
and fully furnished with new furniture and office equipment. Starting in 2010, electronic devices for
payment with debit and credit cards (POS terminals) for the service fees were introduced, which simplified
the procedure for submission of applications by citizens.

Subcomponent 2.D. Development of automatized cadastre and registration system

e-Cadastre (e-Kat). The Project supported the update of the existing eCadastre system with a new module
for graphical display of real properties (cadastre parcels and buildings), which enabled faster and more
efficient maintenance and sharing of cadastre data with professional users, especially the private geodetic
companies. The new functionality allows for cadastre map copies to be issued at any front desk,
immediately after submission of an application. In addition, it allows citizens to request information on a
property located in another city at any AREC front desk counter, avoiding additional travel costs. The
system was further extended with a Registry of Prices module that was developed to capture sales price and
other valuation characteristics considered relevant for future mass valuation work in the country.

e-Front Desk. Electronic submission of applications by professional users was also introduced (e-Front
Desk). The e-Front Desk enables easy, fast, safe and efficient submission of applications and requests
electronically in order to process changes in the Geodetic – Cadastre Information System GCIS and issue
data from the GCIS. At the end of the Project, it had approximately 700 active external (largely
professional) users, with about 40 percent of all submissions received by AREC in digital form. The most
dramatic increase in digital submissions has been those made by surveyors (85% since this option was made
available to surveyors early in 2014). Other types of digital submissions have also increased, with 50% of
all sales contracts now digitally submitted as well as all mortgages from banks. Further increases in the
number of digital submissions are expected to occur as laws governing the operation of other government
agencies who register documents with AREC are changed to permit digital submission.

Document Management System. The Project supported the development of the Document Management
System (DMS), which covers all inward and outward mail and the distribution of documents within AREC.
The DMS is integrated with the existing systems in AREC (E-Cadastre, Enterprise Resource Planning -
ERP), which enables to directly takeover the documents generated from the existing systems and forward
them according to pre-defined procedures. The system has allowed for standardization of work;
improvement and reduction of processing time; the monitoring and archiving with centralized control,
monitoring and review processes; and a better ability to monitor and control documentation.

Enterprise Resource Planning. The Project supported the development of the new software for integrated
resource planning (ERP), which is now used by AREC for finance, human resources and payroll functions
(and the associated reporting). With this integrated system, AREC was able to replace six former
applications that had limited opportunities and were not interconnected i.e. did not had the ability to
exchange data and information. The ERP system is connected to the electronic cadastre, which automates
the calculation of the staff performance efficiency based on the achieved performance according to the
activities they perform on a daily basis.

During the RECRP implementation, a number of training courses were conducted in the AREC Training
Center on the following topics: (i) Management and Human Resource Development; (ii) Basic computer
skills, and (iii) Training for Geographic Information Systems. With the establishment of the private geodetic
practice, training was also provided to surveyors who established their own private companies, as a result
of the reambulation activities financed by the Project (see 1.A.ii). Training activities were carried out in
close coordination with SIDA’s capacity building program, which allocated substantial financial resources.

Training was also provided to professional users (notary offices, municipalities and authorized surveyors,
etc.) on the upgrade of the application for an e-Front Desk and e-Kat Front Desk, upgrade of the use of the
module e-Kat lite, the MAKEDIT software - module for infrastructure as well as the required
documentation that must be attached to a certain procedure, amount of administrative fees and the method
of calculation of the fee for certain services and training for MAKEDIT and e-Front Desk. A total of 241
notary offices, 252 municipal representatives, and 697 licensed surveyors were trained under the Project.

Component 3 – Development of Land Policy

This component was aimed at supporting the Government’s capacity to formulate and develop policies
needed to ensure the completion of the real estate cadastre and the full functioning of the land and real
estate markets through: (i) consultative processes; and (ii) formulation of specific land and real estate
policies and action programs. The component also provided resources for drafting of regulations once the
policies were adopted.

Subcomponent 3.A. Development of government’s capacity to formulate land policies and property policies

The main objective of this sub-component was to support the establishment of a mechanism to formulate
land policies, something that was achieved mainly through the work of the Land Policy Advisory
Committee (LPAC). The LPAC was established in 2005 to support the Government’s capacity to develop
policies and regulatory framework, to ensure the completion of the real estate cadastre and the registration
of property rights and to enable the full functioning of land and property markets. LPAC enabled

                                                        31
cooperation and coordination of all institutions responsible for creating and implementing the land policy.
It originally included representatives from eight institutions, but its composition was expanded in 2013 to
include the following institutions: AREC; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Transport and Communications;
Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Local Self-Government;
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Supply; Central Registry; Association of Local Self-
Government Units; Public Revenue Office; and the National Bank. Since its establishment, LPAC held a
total of 22 meetings.

Subcomponent 3.B. Formulate specific land policies and property policies

The following land policy studies were produced:

  Security of tenure and the Law on survey, This study focused on the legal basis for security of
  cadastre and registration of real rights  land tenure within the real estate cadastre (Law on
                                            survey, cadastre and registration of ownership rights
                                            dated 1986 and modified in 1991, 2005 and 2006)
  Access to land for investment;            This study provided an analysis of the current situation
                                            in reference to the access to land for investment as well
                                            as recommendations for the government on access to
                                            land for investment.
   Land Market Study                        The study provided data and information on the
                                            current status of the land and property market,
                                            including the economic condition, the history of the
                                            property market, the legal framework for property
                                            transactions, the factors influencing the demand and
                                            supply of properties in the country as well as
                                            recommendations for overcoming the obstacles and
                                            creating an efficient property market.
  Illegally built buildings and illegal This study provided the required information to
  development                               support the government in the resolution of the issue
                                            of illegally built buildings.
  Conditions for the Establishment of an This study analyzed the provision of the REC Law that
  Indemnity fund                            guarantees that data registered in the REC are
                                            accurate. This study researched the potential conflict
                                            of interest, the degree of responsibility of the state, as
                                            well as the potential compensation from the proposed
                                            indemnity fund.
  NSDI                                      The study provided recommendations for the
                                            development of NSDI activities.
  Establishment of mass valuation system    The study proposed a design and development of a
                                            system for mass property valuation
  Establishment of a scan center            The study proposed a design and development of a
                                            scan center.
  Establishment of registry of construction The study proposed a design and development of a
  land and a centralized system for urban registry of construction land and a centralized system
  plans                                     for urban plans.

The above studies led to: (i) the adoption of simplified procedures for establishing the REC under the 2008
REC Law; (ii) inter-institutional agreements for electronic data access and 100% completion of the REC;


                                                    32
(iii) the establishment of on-line connections for professional users; (iv) the adoption of procedure for the
legalization of illegal properties under the new Illegally Built Objects Law, which led to the legalization of
133,000 illegally built objects in the country; (v) adoption of the NSDI Law and action plan for its
implementation; and (vi) changes in 2013 REC Law to enable the establishment of the Registry for Prices
and Leases.

Component 4 – Project Management
This component provided support to fiduciary functions (FM, procurement) and monitoring and evaluation.
It also supported funds for audits, office rental, utilities, and equipment maintenance. The work of the PMU
and the support provided to implementing agencies during project implementation has been a best practice
case. The Unit was properly staffed throughout project implementation providing quality and timely support
to implementing agencies. PMU staff worked closely with AREC sector/department heads who were the
coordinators for their respective project components. Project reporting and M&E function were both
conducted in a timely fashion and with a very good quality. M&E reports, based on an integrated monitoring
and evaluation system, provided abundant information and served as mechanism not only to track the
progress but to identify key bottlenecks and areas requiring special attention.

Component 5 – Digital Cadastre Maps and Web-GIS

The objective of this component was to support the digitization and vectorization of the existing maps and
associated quality control (QC); to upgrade the digital cadastre map database and software for maintenance
and associated training; to develop the platform for data sharing and exchange with the public, private sector
and other government institutions; and upgrade the national geodetic reference infrastructure.

Subcomponent 5.A. Digital Cadastre Map

AREC conducted massive scanning and geo referencing of the Working Originals (through an external
contractor, for approximately 3000 WO, as well as using own capacities for about 6,000 WO). As a second
step, the production of DCM included mass vectorization of the archive originals (first phase) and
vectorization of changes from the Working Originals as needed. The next step in the process of DCM
production was performed within the Agency – quality control and finalizing all the changes from the WO.
For the process of scanning the WO and the quality control procedure, AREC enabled quick transportation
from the local offices, by purchasing two vehicles. AREC has also procured additional hardware and
software for storing large amounts of DCM and scans of WO and AO. After completing the update, the
maintenance of the DCM and routine service delivery was performed on the old platform (Microstation)
until the start of the implementation of the MAKEDIT application and the migration of data for the DCM
from Microstation to the central database. This procedure was really well designed and prepared, supported
by training for the users, migration of data and checking of the migrated data.

By project closing, AREC had imported and maintained in the central database (e-Kat) 1521 CM, of which
342 CM are digital and 1179 CM are analog cadastre municipalities or 83% of the entire territory of the
country. AREC also established a quality control and quality assurance system of graphic and alphanumeric
data from the cadastral maps in the process of digitization. The tailor-made software MakEdit for
production of digital geodetic reports in service of maintaining the REC was updated with a module for
production of digital geodetic reports for all types of infrastructure objects in service of
registration/recording and maintenance of the cadastre of infrastructure objects.




                                                     33
Subcomponent 5.B. Web-GIS

The main focus of this sub-component was the development and implementation of a web-GIS application,
which would be in compliance with the INSPIRE directive requirements and would provide online access
to the DCMs, orthophotos and topographic maps. The web-GIS would become accessible via the new
Government GeoPortal (to be developed under Sub-component 5.3) as part of the NSDI Strategy
implementation. The web-GIS database was created based on the new data model to be developed under
Component 3.

The AREC GIS portal supported under the Project is a preview for all geospatial data under the competence
of AREC. The GIS portal provides availability of cadastral parcels and buildings recorded in the real estate
cadastre, topographic maps, geodetic points, aerial images for the entire territory, infrastructure objects, all
information regarding the parcels, the buildings and their owners as well as locations for which construction
permits have been issued, including constructions underway with insight into the details of the future
building with all its parts. In addition, the GIS portal presents all points of interest, such as: locations of
notaries, geodetic companies, municipalities or all locations where the AREC services are available.

Subcomponent 5.C. Government Geo-Portal (NSDI)

In order to support the implementation of the NSDI Strategy, developed under Component 3, the Project
supported the development and implementation of a Government GeoPortal. Activities under this
subcomponent covered support to AREC to develop User and Technical requirements for the Government
GeoPortal, development and implementation of the Government GeoPortal, supply of hardware and
necessary communication equipment, user training, and supported AREC in managing the Government
GeoPortal development and implementation and in providing quality assurance and quality control. This
activity was conducted according to the NSDI strategy and with oversight from the Governmental NSDI
Coordinating Committee (established under Component 3). The spatial data of AREC became accessible
via the Government GeoPortal. To demonstrate the NSDI concept applying INSPIRE standards and
providing the data via the Government GeoPortal, more than one institution input data to the Government
GeoPortal.

NSDI effectively created the conditions for raising the level of technical interoperability between the
institutions, development of e-services for distribution of geospatial data, with the objective to exchange
and share data in service of better planning and decision making on national and local level. The draft Law
on National Spatial Data Infrastructure was adopted by the Parliament in February 2014 ("Official Gazette"
no. 38 / 2014). The management of the NSDI was defined in the Law, and in accordance with the legal
provisions and its governance structure consisted of the following: NSDI Council, NSDI Committee, and
four working groups. The NSDI Council chaired by the Vice-President of the Government in charge of
Economic Affairs was established in September 2014.

The Government Geo-Portal was completed in May 2015. The Geo-Portal enables searching and
publication of data and services, while the NSDI entities by using the metadata editor can create own
metadata. AREC placed on the Geoportal the data and the web services (CSW, WMS, WFS) that relate to:
state borderlines, statistical regions, local self-government units, settlements and the digital terrain model.
Besides the published data produced according to national standards, the Geo-Portal also provides the
availability of the standardized data on administrative units and the digital elevation model, produced
according to the technical specifications of the INSPIRE Directive.

Subcomponent 5.D Geodetic Reference Infrastructure

The subcomponent supported the upgrading of the national GRI, including:

                                                      34
          Acquisition, installation and training in the use of equipment required for an active GNSS network;
          Establishment of a passive GNSS network of 103 GNSS points (including 63 new points) and the
           publishing of the coordinates of these points;
          Determination of a transformation model based on about 3,000 points, the publishing of
           transformation parameters as well as making available an online software application to transform
           coordinates using these parameters;
          The establishment of precise leveling network of 1,114 benchmarks (1,098 new benchmarks) as
           well as 16 existing fundamental benchmarks involving 2189 km of leveling; and
          The establishment of gravimetric network based on measurements made at 2,310 detailed
           gravimetric point.


Besides the application in the geodesy, the results from the gravimetric measurements were extremely
important in the realization of other scientific endeavors. The data from the gravimetric measurements,
alone or in combination with other data, can be used: in mining (for research of mineral resources, natural
gas and oil), in geology (research of composition and density of the earth masses, for detection of
underground cavities, caves and pits) in hydrology (for locating underground water, for monitoring the
impact of tidal waves, the levels of natural lakes), in seismology (to monitor changes in earth masses during
tremors) in engineering (during design and construction of road and railway infrastructure, larger tunnels,
bridges, dams) and in meteorology and other fields.

Component 6 – Support for the Authority for Legal-Property Affairs

The objective of this component was to support the provision of technical assistance and training for ALPA;
procure equipment and networking to provide better service to clients; automation of business processes
and digitization of existing records for the creation of a digital archive; renovate and outfit offices to
improve customer reception areas; and financing certain operating costs for ALPA.

The Project provided technical assistance for strategic analysis24 and policy development in order to identify
possible future roles of ALPA, and supported the implementation of the policy dialogue relating to the
organization and structure of government bodies for state land administration. Moreover, the Project
supported regular (semester) training seminars for professional staff in the Ministry of Finance in respect
to new and existing legislation related to administrative procedures conducted by ALPA.

The Project further supported infrastructure upgrades for 25 ALPA offices, in order to support the
modernization of IT and office equipment in ALPA. All 34 regional offices of ALPA are linked to the
internet for on-line access to digital cadastral maps and ownership records available from AREC. This has
also strengthened the internal communication in ALPA, and improved the management and monitoring of
its services. The Project supported the automation of archive documents and records for privatization of
construction land in state ownership, and training for the staff to use the ALPA computerized archives and
records in everyday procedures. In addition, the existing documentation and archive records in paper form
were digitized in order to form archive search indexes for and making backup copies in paper form. ALPA
has now processed more than 180,000 urban land privatization cases, up from just 64,000 in 2010.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Project began in 2005 when the REC covered less than 43% of the country and only 30-40% of all
apartments were registered. The incomplete records and data inaccuracies led to a lack of confidence in the
country’s property rights system which in turn had a negative effect on private sector development, foreign
direct investment, housing finance, and credit market growth.

In 2015, the market looks entirely different. The REC has been expanded to cover 100% of the country’s
territory. The number of property transactions have increased 287% from 42,116 in 2005 to 163,18625
in 2015. At the same time, the number of days to record the purchase or sale of property dropped 96% from
30 days in 2005 to just one day in 2015. Similarly, the number of mortgages has increased 475% from 2,920
in 2005 to 16,794 26 in 2015. Despite the slowdown from the Global Financial Crisis, the volume of
mortgages has surged by a factor of almost 15 times from USD502 million in 200727 to USD7.5228
billion in 2015. The figure below illustrates the indexed volume of mortgages (in any given year) vs. GDP
at current prices, showing the accelerated development of the mortgage market under difficult economic
conditions. The volume of mortgages in a given year as percentage of GDP has increased from just 6%
in 2007 to 74% in 2015.

These are major achievements, which have made the system a model cadastral system globally and made
the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC, formerly SAGW) the subject of study under a South-South
Knowledge Exchange between Eastern Europe and Central America.

This annex looks into the economic and financial analysis of the Project. Like the PAD, the ICR analysis
examines incremental market turnover. Additionally, the ICR analysis explores the increased mortgage
market activity, self-financing at AREC, and reduced transaction costs. Additionally, the ICR also examines
the Web GIS services and the Geoportal—both of which were financed through the Additional Financing
in 2010.

In summary, assuming a discount rate of 10%, the net present value (NPV) of the Project over the 2005-
2024 period is estimated at USD 39.66 million and the internal rate of return (IRR) over the same period is
estimated at 36.9%. Given the Bank’s share of financing, the NPV of the Bank’s contribution is estimated
at USD 28.47 million and the IRR of the Bank’s contribution is estimated at 46.6%. While the PAD’s
analysis was limited and hence is not a like-to-like comparison, the NPV estimated at the time of the PAD
was USD12.50 million and the IRR was estimated at 18%. Another economic analysis was done during the
2010 Additional Financing. Among the three scenarios presented at the time, the NPV and IRR of the best-
case scenario were estimated at USD 27.68 million and 10.06% respectively.

Incremental Market Turnover

In the Economic and Financial Analysis Annex presented in the PAD, the NPV and IRR of the Project were
derived using a market turnover analysis. The main premise of this analysis was that as properties get
registered in the REC, the rights associated with them become more secure. This not only spurs more
transactions in the market but also increases the price of those properties that have been registered in REC.
Together, the greater number of transactions of properties that are worth more leads to an increase in the
market turnover. Accounting for market forces beyond the Project’s control as well as other donor activities
that could boost overall economic activity, a certain percentage of this incremental market turnover is
recognized as the benefits attributable to the Project. These attributable benefits are then analyzed against
project costs to yield NPV and IRR estimates.

The ICR follows the same logic to reconstruct the ‘with’ and ‘without’ project scenarios to calculate the
incremental benefits attributable to the Project. While ICR maintains the same premise, it has updated some
of the PAD assumptions as they were either too conservative or too aggressive. A table of the changes is

                                          AREC)                                    higher benefits than what was
                                                                                   actually realized during the Project

                                                                                   conservative than the usual 1%
                                                                                   assumption for similar land projects

Moreover, the ICR analysis does not adhere to the notion of an “active land market” represented by a fixed
number of 300,000 properties. This fixed number presented in the PAD represents a static view of the land
market with no room for increase in the total number of properties in the country’s active land market. The
ICR analysis relies on the actuals reported by AREC and is, therefore, more accurate and presents a dynamic
view of the property market.

Based on these assumptions, the market turnover ‘with’ and ‘without’ project are calculated. T he
incremental market turnover is the difference between market turnover in the ‘with’ vs. ‘without’ scenarios.
0.1% of this incremental market turnover is considered attributable to the Project. With these assumptions,
the number of transactions in the ‘with project’ scenario is estimated to exceed the number of transactions
in the ‘without project’ scenario by a factor of 3.9x in 2015. Similarly, the market turnover in the ‘with
project’ scenario is estimated to exceed the market turnover in the ‘without project’ scenario by a factor of
5.3x in 2015. The aforementioned analysis is presented in Table 1.

   Over the course of the Project, AREC reported the price per square meter for centrally located properties in Skopje
and Ohrid as well as price per square meter for apartments in outskirts. The average property price is calculated
assuming that (a) 50% of the properties are in Skopje and 50% in the rest of the country (using Ohrid as the proxy for
price); and (b) 60% of the properties are centrally located and the remaining 40% are located in the outskirts.
Commercial properties are not considered in this analysis to provide a conservative estimate. AREC prices are reported
in euros and converted to dollars using the exchange rate of 1.1 USD/EUR.

   The PAD references this as “incremental net benefits to transacting parties.” However, no rationale is provided for
calculating these net benefits. As a result, the ICR assumes this to be the effective benefits attributable to the Project.

Incremental Mortgage Market Growth

The PAD mentioned that one of the project’s benefits would be a “revamped mortgage market31.” However,
no analysis was done in the PAD to show the magnitude of this benefit. The ICR presents an analysis similar
to that of incremental market turnover but reflecting the growth in the mortgage market. The basic
assumption behind this benefit is that with increased security of tenure, the number of sales and purchases
of houses increase. With this increase, the need for housing finance (mortgages) goes up both in terms of
numbers and in terms of volume. Once again, ‘with’ and ‘without’ project scenarios are built and 0.1%
(assumption) of the incremental volume of mortgages is attributed to the project as a benefit. Only 0.1% is
assumed to be attributable to the project to remain conservative and to account for other channels of market
growth, including other donor projects and domestic economic growth factors.

For the ‘with’ project scenario, the ICR takes the number and volume of mortgages provided by AREC.
Note that AREC began to track the number of mortgages from 2005 and the volume of mortgages from
2007. Therefore, the incremental volume of mortgages is available starting 2007. For the ‘without project’
scenario, the ICR uses the actual data provided by AREC as the baseline for number of mortgages (2005)
and volume of mortgages (2007). Since this analysis was not done in the PAD, the ICR assumes the number
of mortgages to grow at the same rate as the Macedonian GDP at constant prices.32 Similarly, the volume
of mortgages is assumed to grow at the same rate as the GDP at current prices.33

With these assumptions, the number of mortgages in the ‘with project’ scenario is estimated to exceed the
number of mortgages in the ‘without project’ scenario by a factor of 4.2x in 2015. Similarly, the volume of
mortgages in the ‘with project’ scenario is estimated to exceed the volume of mortgages in the ‘without
project’ scenario by a factor of 7.8x in 2015.34 The aforementioned analysis is presented in Table 2.

   Constant prices do not account for inflation and serve as a reasonable proxy for growth in the number of
mortgages. GDP growth rate estimates are taken from IMF’s World Economic Outlook Database. IMF estimates
available till 2020, after which growth rate is estimated at 0% each year for 3 years (2016-2018) and at 0.5% each
year for 6 years (2019-2024).
33
   Current prices account for inflation and serve as a reasonable proxy for growth in the volume (price x quantity) of
mortgages. Current prices growth is typically greater than constant prices growth (except in cases of deflation) so
the assumption for the increase in the volume of mortgages is more aggressive than assumption for the increase in
the number of mortgages. GDP growth rate estimates are taken from IMF’s World Economic Outlook Database.
IMF estimates available till 2020, after which growth rate is estimated at -5% (average of growth rate for previous 3
years) for 1 year (2016), 0% for 1 year (2017), and 0.25% thereafter (2018-2024).
34
   Note: Since the mortgage analysis was not presented in the PAD, the ICR has re-engineered the ‘without project’
scenario using the actual number of mortgages starting in 2005 and the volume of mortgages starting in 2007 due to
the availability. This leads to a slight discrepancy where the average size of a mortgage in the ‘without project’
estimate exceeds the ‘with project’ actuals due to volume of mortgage data unavailability in 2007 and 2008. This
was probably not the case as the average size of mortgage has grown exponentially with the Project. However, the
ICR runs with this assumption as it is more conservative from the point of view of calculating project benefits.

Self-financing of AREC
The PAD had discussed AREC’s fiscal burden on the government budget. At the time of app raisal it was
noted that administrative tax collected by AREC could range from 50-100% of the actual fee earned by
AREC. This implied that if AREC were to reach 50% self-financing, its overall burden on public finances
would become nil. 35 Even though the PAD did not expect AREC to become a self-financing agency by the
end of the project period, it estimated that AREC would become self-financing during the implementation
period (going beyond the project closing date).

The project focused on institutional strengthening at AREC and the results can be seen with respect to
AREC’s self-financing. In 2005, only 24% of AREC’s budget was financed through fees raised through
various services. By 2015, the share of fees in AREC budget increased to 65%. Moreover, the administrative
tax collected by AREC for the Government has increased by a factor of almost 2.5x, going from USD
263,000 to USD 577,000 in 2014. Comparing the actual growth to a ‘without project scenario’ in which the
administrative taxes are assumed to increase at the same rate as GDP as current prices, the cumulative
incremental increase in administrative taxes collected by AREC between 2005 and 2015 is estimated at
USD 2.18 million. Despite this gains, this benefit is not modeled in the NPV and IRR analysis because
AREC is still not self-financing.

Additionally, AREC has prepared a strategic plan (2016-2018) whose implementation is expected to lead
to a fully self-financing agency.

Digital Cadastre Maps and WebGIS
The main aim of the Additional Financing was to enable AREC to
produce digital cadastre maps and offer WebGIS services. AREC has
successfully achieved both these goals. AREC’s various services are
available online through the web and also apps on the iOS and
Android platforms.

The e-Cadastre (“e-Katastar” or “e-Kat”) is an integrated database of
alpha-numeric and graphical information. All primary business
processes, including registration and maintenance of the REC, can be
done in e-Kat. An “E-Front Desk” is also available to notaries,
surveyors, and municipalities. Both applications and payments can be
submitted online and transactions are available with date and time
stamps. This has eliminated the need for unnecessary customer visits
to AREC local offices. This acts as an immense efficiency boost for AREC and for citizens engaging in
real estate transactions.

Between Q1 2014 and Q3 2015, the number of digital applications received by AREC increased by more
than a factor of 2.7x. By Q3 2015, the number of digital applications was almost 90% of the number of
paper applications. In some cases, the number of digital applications already exceeds the number of paper
applications. For example, in Q3 2015, the number of graphical data digital requests by private surveyors
was over fifteen times higher than the number of paper requests. Between Q1 2014 and Q3 2015, the number
of graphical data requests increased by a factor of 68x from 418 in Q1 2014 to 28,457 in Q3 2015.

In terms of revenue, AREC generated on average USD 150,000 for its e-services and WebGIS services in
2014 and 2015.37 In terms of these services’ benefit to the private sector (including but not limited to private
surveyors), it can be assumed that private users do not pay more than the service is worth to them. In other
words, AREC revenues from these services are a conservative proxy for these services’ value to the private
sector. Therefore, the overall economic benefit of these services is USD 300,000 per year. Despite the clear


37
  In 2014, AREC income from WebGIS services was USD 137,861. In 2015, this figure had increased by 20% to
USD 165,108. Looking at the monthly trends, USD 150,000 average revenue going forward is, therefore, a
conservative estimate.

increasing trend in the adoption of these services, the model assumes there is no increase in the overall
economic value of these services over the years and holds this value steady at USD 300,000 per year. This
is done both to remain conservative about the trajectory of the economic value generated by WebGIS
services and also to account for any decrease in revenue as paper-based services become less popular.

NPV and IRR Calculations
Based on the analysis presented in this annex, there are four main channels of economic and financial
benefits emanating from this project: (i) incremental market turnover; (ii) incremental volume of mortgages;
(iii) AREC’s reduced fiscal burden; and (iv) benefits from e-services and WebGIS services. Given these
benefits and project costs over a period of 2005 to 2024 as well as an assumed discount rate of 10%, the
NPV of the full project is estimated at USD 40.49 million and the IRR is estimated at 37.2%. The NPV and
IRR of the Bank’s financial contribution are estimated at USD 29.04 million and 46.8% respectively. The
details of the summary analysis can be found in Table 3.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A total of five public opinion and customer satisfaction surveys were carried out during the life of
the project (in 2005, 2007, 2009 under the OP, and in 2012 and 2015 under the AF).

These surveys used quantitative (field surveys and questionnaires) and qualitative (focus groups)
research methods. The first survey developed a standard methodology and questionnaires, which
were applied to subsequent surveys. It should be noted that prior to the project in 2005 the general
satisfaction of the clients–users of cadastral services was 2.7 (on a scale from 1-5). The surveys
included aspects such as staff attitude, quality of equipment, quality of services, price of services,
etc.

2006 Customer Survey. The first survey, conducted in 2006, surveyed 506 respondents (303 direct
users, 150 persons from the general population and 53 professional clients). The average
satisfaction rate in 2006 was 3.44 (on a scale from 1-5).

2007 Customer Survey. The second survey was conducted in November 2007 and its results were
announced in January 2008. This Customer Survey was intended to provide comparable indicators
and to indicate changes in the perception of the end users in terms of their service satisfaction,
awareness and knowledge of the cadastre, its role and functions. A total of 1,265 beneficiaries were
surveyed (685 direct users, 500 persons from the general population, and 80 professional clients).
The average satisfaction rate for 2007 was 3.45 (on a scale from 1-5).

2009 Customer Survey. The third customer survey was conducted between September and
December 2009. It surveyed a total of 1,588 respondents in four sub-samples (827 Macedonian
users of cadastral services, 560 Macedonians from the general public, 10 Roma citizens, 30
Internally Displaced Persons and 161 professional clients). The overall average satisfaction rate
was 3.67 (on a scale from 1-5).




Other than the customer surveys, the project used professional “Secret Clients” to conduct surveys
in situ. The satisfaction rates had a clear upward trend: 60.71% (2007), 68% (2008) and 72.04%
(2009).

2012 Customer Survey. The fourth Customer Satisfaction Survey was completed in 2012; this
was the first, and therefore the baseline, survey for ALPA. The questions in the fourth survey
related to AREC were more than 90 percent consistent with the earlier surveys which enabled
comparability of results over the previous 7 years. The survey of AREC customers included 1213
citizens – direct users of cadastre services and 133 professional AREC clients. There were also 178
citizens – direct ALPA service users whose satisfaction with ALPA services was assessed.

The survey results showed that most respondents were satisfied with AREC and had confidence in
this institution. They found the information provided by AREC was of high quality (80% of
respondents) with AREC delivering its service within legally prescribed deadlines (89% of


                                                 51
respondents). Also, the satisfaction of AREC customers with different aspects of AREC’s work
assessed individually and measured on the 1-5 scale (staff attitude; quality of the equipment; quality
of services; price of services, etc.) increased on average, but the results varied throughout the
different AREC offices. The most notable improvement in results relate to those obtained from
AREC customers in Skopje. At the same time, the overall satisfaction rate was 3.60 (on a scale
from 1-5), a 0.07 drop from the previous survey. ALPA’s customers were satisfied with the attitude
of ALPA staff (56% satisfied) and with the quality of information received (68% satisfied). At the
same time, many ALPA customers were dissatisfied (30%) with the functionality, overall
conditions, and technical equipment in ALPA. Overall, ALPA’s customers rated its services with
3.30 (on a scale from 1-5).

2015 Customer Survey. The last survey conducted under the project showed that most respondents
(83.6%) claim to be familiar with the AREC’s local offices’ scope of work. Over 70% of
respondents who turned to the AREC’s internet web page, said they were very satisfied with the
quality of information obtained. From all the respondents who turned to the informational desk at
the AREC local offices to obtain information about the necessary documents for submitting the
application, 62.9% said they were very satisfied, 26.5% partially satisfied and 5% said they were
dissatisfied with the quality of information obtained. Respondents were most satisfied with the
accuracy, quality of information they receive from the AREC local offices (78.4%), the attitude of
employees in those offices (80.7%) and the technical equipment (81.7%). More than three quarters
(80 percent) of the respondents (both citizens and professional users) believed that the Cadastre as
an institution is developing in the right direction and is characterized as a helpful and honest
institution. Most respondents (95.6 percent) believed that the quality of services they receive in the
Cadastre today is better compared to the past years. As such, they expressed a high level of
confidence in the Cadastre as an institution, which they recognized as very important for the
economic development of the country. Regarding corruption, the number of cases in which a
Cadastre employee asked for money, gift or service for a service that should otherwise have been
completed as an official duty considerably decreased from 15 cases in 2009 to 1 case in 2015.
Overall, the research of the level of client’s satisfaction with different aspects of the work of the
AREC local offices showed that in 2015 the level of satisfaction had increased compared to the
level of direct users satisfaction measured in 2012. With the exception of the level of satisfaction
with the prices which remains unchanged, the satisfaction from all the other aspects of the AREC
local offices’ service in 2015 showed increase. According to the respondent’s answers, the
customer satisfaction index is 124.95, which on scale from 0-140 can be interpreted as very high
level satisfaction.

With regards to ALPA, the majority of respondents associated ALPA with property regulation and
legalization. About one third of the respondents had negative associations (bureaucracy, queues,
crowding, waiting, fees, problems, anxieties and unprofessional behavior). More than half of the
respondents (68%) knew what documents are required to submit a request for their individual case
and most of the respondents (60.7%) were informed through the counters of ALPA local units.
Respondents were mostly satisfied with the behavior of employees, the accuracy and quality of
information received, while they were most dissatisfied with the price of services charged by the
institution. In relation to the respondents’ trust in ALPA, 55.4% of the respondents said that they
trusted the institution, while 10.9%, said they did not. 10.9% of the respondents answered that it
was very or somewhat likely to have to offer money or gifts to ALPA employees in order to have
one’s case resolved.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The GOM provided a detailed final evaluation report of the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration
Project that covers the period from June 2005 to June 2015. The executive summary of the
borrower’s completion report is presented below.

A.      Executive Summary of Borrower’s ICR

In the past fifteen years, the real property market has experienced a great boom in the transitional
countries. Along with the legislative changes, the real property market boom has put the land
administration system in the country, i.e. the real estate cadastre, under heavy duress that has
hindered the smooth real property market development, given the historic legacy of the cadastre
records and the low degree of the technological equipment applied.

The Foreign Investment Advisory Service – FIAS and the 2003 Country Assistance Strategy - CAS
indicated the uncertainty in the area of property rights as a limiting factor for investments in the
country. The trust in the registration and the cadastre records was small due to the fact that the
records were outdated while 60-70% of the apartments were not registered at all. The ownership of
property in 2003 was not consistently registered in one central location: the notaries kept records
of transactions in which they are involved but this information was not publicly available;
municipal courts registered the mortgages; SAGW (now AREC) maintained the Land Cadastre
(LC) while in 1988 started with the establishment of the Real Estate Cadastre (REC).

The lack of trust and the difficulties due to incomplete records had negative effects on the private
sector and the development of the economy in general. A large number of land transactions were
not registered while the cadastre and other records (courts, notaries) were incomplete and outdated,
which caused uncertainty and distrust in the property market. Another direct consequence from the
unclear property rights were the limitations in the financing on the basis of collateral and mortgage
which burdened the property transactions and the mortgaging of the properties.

The Government identified the importance of creating a secure system of property rights due to the
economic growth and the expansion of the economic prosperity. The Government started to address
these problems by establishing a single agency for cadastre and registration of properties – the
Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC).

In the end, the country has placed the EU integration as one of its greatest priorities. In order to
achieve this objective, equal and efficient property markets are needed as well as a functional
system for property registration.

Apart from the regular activities and numerous bilateral projects implemented in AREC, certainly
the most important part of the reform was the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project.

During 2004, international consultants engaged with funds from the Japanese Government Grant
(PHRD) assisted the RECR project preparation with their reports. The expert assessment and the
project implementation plan were produced.

The first phase of the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project was financed with a Loan from
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development – World Bank, approved in the amount
of EURO 10. 3 million and with planned participation by the Government in the amount of EURO
1.52 million, in compliance with the prescribed conditions applied for World Bank loans.



                                                 54
The Project implementation started on June 06, 2005. The planned deadline for the Project
implementation was extended from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2010.

With the establishment of the real estate cadastre on the entire territory of the country, the priorities
of the Government and the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC) were directed at additional
improvement of the services for registration and cadastre through updating the AREC national data
in terms of their accuracy, completeness, update and availability. On the basis of the analysis which
was carried out within the land policy component in 2009, the Government identified that there is
a need of additional strengthening of the state land management process as well as strengthening
of the state institutions which are part of this process. More specifically, the Government requested
the Executive Directors of the World Bank to approve an additional loan in the amount of EURO
9.000.000 intended for the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project (RECRP) МК 79280; and
included the Authority for Legal-Property Affairs under the Ministry of Finance in the
implementation of part of the project activities.

The implementation of the RECR Project Additional Financing (second phase) started in
September 2010. The planned deadline for the RECRP-AF implementation was extended from
December 31, 2013 to June 30, 2015.

The first phase of the RECR Project was implemented by AREC while the second phase of the
RECR Project-AF was co-implemented by AREC and ALPA-MF. Both executive agencies shared
the authority over the Project – additional financing.

In general, the RECR Project (in both phases) was funded by World Bank loans and grants from
several countries - donors.

Management Unit. The financing of these contracts was provided by the two World Bank loans,
the PHRD Grant from the Japanese Government and the donation from the Netherlands
Government for implementation of the pilot project for RECR in Kumanovo. The amount of funds
that AREC has received for implementation of all reform activities in the last 10 years has reached
32.12 million Euros.

The general and long-term objectives of the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project were to
support the Government Development Agenda for reduction of poverty, improvement of the
economic growth and increase of the investments in the private sector.

One of the main benefits of the Project is the improvement of security of property rights and the
performance of the property markets. This has facilitated the private investments and created an
opportunity for new jobs. At the same time, the time required for establishment of the real estate
cadastre was reduced by improving the service standards for registration of property transactions
in a time period from several weeks to even one day. These improvements together with the public
awareness campaign and the telephone hot-lines for citizen have enabled improvement in the
transparency and have accelerated the services during registration of changes in ownership.


                                                56
In order to achieve the above stated results, the Project carried out significant activities that were
related to the design of efficient procedures, methods and technical solutions for establishment and
maintenance of a real estate cadastre, including the modernization of the relevant laws and bylaws.

The activities from the additional financing were aimed at:

    a) Digitalization of the current cadastre maps and plans;
    b) Inserting of these graphic information in the geographic information system based on
       internet services (Web-GIS), which is to facilitate the access to such information for the
       citizens, the private and the public sector;
    c) Upgrade of the geodetic reference infrastructure with the objective to improve the accuracy
       and the efficiency of the survey; and
    d) Assistance for the government during the design of the NSDI strategy and the
       implementation of the NSDI.

The additional financing provided funds also for technical support and assistance for the Authority
for Legal-Property Affairs within the Ministry of Finances with the objective to provide better
services for the citizens.

The initial objectives of the RECRP in the first stage of its implementation (till 2010) are fully met.
In different areas and activities, the achieved results are even beyond the level of success indicators
which were set at the beginning of the project. The Government and AREC, through implementing
of the project activities, have created a well-functioning land administration system which has
enabled quality services for the clients and a guarantee for the ownership right. Today AREC is a
modern service oriented agency, with well-trained working staff, aimed towards the needs of the
clients.

The Government wishes to express its gratitude for the assistance and support offered by the World
Bank team and European partners during the past 10 years. This report summarizes the
achievements and resources used in the implementation of the Real Estate Cadastre and
Registration Project (2005-2015) as well as the achievements of the overall land administration
reform in the country. It also presents the main conclusions of the Borrower as well as the lessons
learned.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments were provided by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands:


(i)    We miss in the ICR reference to the WB project, the consulting service that the Dutch
       Cadastre carried out on the outreach and capacity building as part of the overall activities
       for developing the Strategy for National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) (Contract MK-
       RECRP-7928MK-SSS-C3-3-1)
(ii)   We do not see a reference to two projects funded by the Dutch Government and related to
       the World Bank project initiatives. They are certainly linked to the WB loan, as is described
       below.
       a) Further technical assistance related to the process of Digital Map production, business
           development and IT Strategy, Sept 2009 - May 2010, 130.000 EURO. (One of the
           achievements of the Dutch Cadastre was a feasibility plan for the finalisation of the
           digital map, which formed a basis for a new World Bank loan. The support focused
           also on digital map production, IT development, organisation of a NSDI and
           monitoring the strategic plan of AREC).
       b) Support for the development of an NSDI Strategy, Nov 2010 - Nov 2012, 200.000
           EURO. (From October 2010 to April 2012, the Netherlands’ Agency for International
           Business and Co-operation (EVD International) has provided funding to the
           Government for a project to develop a strategy for NSDI. AREC was the responsible
           organisation for the coordination of an NSDI. This included the legal framework, the
           organisational set-up and the general ICT-architecture. The project was supported by
           the Netherlands’ Ministry of Economic Affairs. One of the goals was to create
           awareness and knowledge about NSDI. This was achieved by a twinning approach,
           with the staff of the Agency for Real Estate (AREC) working closely together with
           Dutch experts. To meet the INSPIRE-requirements, a more structural approach was
           needed. Therefore, the initiative of AREC to start the NSDI-project was important. In
           the run of the project several Dutch consultants with legal, organisational, financial
           and technical expertise were made available; not only from Dutch Cadastre, but also
           from Alterra, TU Delft and KU Leuven. On the 29th of March 2012, the results of the
           project were presented at a national conference and in parallel workshops. Many
           authorities and about 90 participants attended the various gatherings. All in all, a well-
           elaborated strategy has been developed, covering all aspects of an NSDI. A crucial
           first step and a corner stone in the structural implementation of NSDI in the country..
