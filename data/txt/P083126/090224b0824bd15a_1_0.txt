                         progress on two out of four PDO indicators—increased number of transactions in land and real estate, and increased number of mortgages using property as collateral. The trend in
                         the increase of the two indicators remains strong and the targets have already been exceeded: 59% increase in number of transactions and 108% increase in the number of
                         mortgages vs. the target of 20% over the 2009 baseline figure. Customer satisfaction, which is the third PDO indicator, is to be measured through a final customer survey scheduled
                         for late 2014. The previous survey conducted in 2012 shows average customer satisfaction (measured on the 1 to 5 scale) of 3.6 vs. 3.8 target, and 3.3 vs. 3.5 target for the Agency

                         for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC) and the Authority for legal and Property affairs (ALPA), respectively. However, the progress on the use of digital records for the delivery of routine
                         services, which is the fourth PDO indicator —has been lagging due to the slow progress on the digitization of cadaster maps (DCM) which was the most important investment under
                         the Additional Financing for the project. Currently, there is only about 27% of the territory covered with digital maps vs. the target of 70 %. A revised action plan has been prepared
                         with realistic quarterly targets to enable better monitoring of the progress. Meeting the targets on digitization is at risk due to a complex quality control process in AREC which needs
                         to be reconsidered, but also due to the funding issue - disbursement limit imposed by the Ministry of Finance on consultants services in particular - which hinders the progress on all
                         activities conducted through engagement of high number of individual sort-term consultants, such as the digitization. Apart from the digitization process, all other project activities are
                         on track to be completed with targets achieved by the current closing date which is June 30, 2015. Actions agreed during the previous mission have been mainly met.
