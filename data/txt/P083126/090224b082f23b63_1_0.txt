Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Project has achieved excellent results and its development objective (PDO) has been met. The targets for three out of four PDO indicators have
 been substantially exceeded. The number of registered transactions (PDO indicator 1) increased 58 percent over the 2009 baseline, well above the
 targeted increase of 20 percent. In terms of mortgages registered (PDO indicator 2) the end target (20 percent increase over the baseline) has been
 exceeded 159 percent. This progress has been stable over several years reflecting the significant improvements in the real estate markets in
 Macedonia to which the Project contributed. The progress on the use of digital records for the delivery of routine services (PDO indicator 4) has been
 particularly impressive, with the target of 70 percent of the country's territory covered with digital records exceeded by 8 percent at the end of May 2015.
 It is expected that by June 30, 2015 (project closing date) the territorial coverage would be over 80 percent. As for the increased customer satisfaction
 (PDO indicator 3), the target was exceeded by the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre with the average rating of 3.94 vs. the end target of 3.8 (on 1 to 5
 scale), while the Authority for Legal and Property Affairs met its end target of 3.5 with 96 percent, receiving 3.36 average rating from their
 customers under the 2015 customer survey.
 Project activities have been mainly completed and the remaining ones are on track to be finalized by the Project Closing Date (June 30, 215).

         Established through customer satisfaction surveys. There were 5 surveys during the lifetime of the project for AREC and 2 for ALPA (2012
         and 2015), as this agency was introduced to the project only with additional financing. Target achieved and exceeded by AREC, partially
         achieved by ALPA (there was an increase in customer satisfaction but it remained below the target of 3.5)

 Overall Comments
 The targets for the PDO indicators have been met and exceeded, with exception of the average customer satisfaction rating for the Authority for
 Legal and Property Affairs (ALPA) which is 3.36 and thus slightly below the end target of 3.5 (on the 1 to 5 scale). As the real estate cadastre and
 registration system (PDO) is responsibility of the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC), where customer satisfaction target has been
 exceeded with an average rating of 3.94 vs end target of 3.8, it has a prevailing impact on the PDO. ALPA's authority is limited to management of
 state owned assets (with exception of the state owned agriculture land which is under responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture).

               Several types of transactions have been monitored under this indicator, such as: purchase/sale, mortgages; change of data in the cadastre
               registry book and cadastre plan (field survey); change in REC in maintenence. All. but one type of registration service (change of data in the
               cadastre registry book and cadastre plan (field survey)) and only in Skopje office, have been registered within the established service
               standard period. As changes to cadastral data make up only a small number of transactions, and the others noted above make up the bulk
               of the transactions, the 90 percent figure has been achieved.
