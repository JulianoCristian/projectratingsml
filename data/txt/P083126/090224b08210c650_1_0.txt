                         of Project support to include training to the Agency for Real Estate Cadastre (AREC) staff and development of new services (by upgrading the e-cadastre software with infrastructure

                         Authority for Legal and Property Affairs, as they completed renovations of 24 offices, contracted the delivery and installation of equipment and the networking, developed the
                         Management Information System and started the training of the staff.
                         On the other hand, the challenge of having the project uninterrupted funding ensured seems to remain. There are still serious budget constraints that impact project's day-to -day
                         implementation.
