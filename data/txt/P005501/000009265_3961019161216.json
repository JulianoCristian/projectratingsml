The\n            project will be concentrated in specific communities located\n            in thirteen selected provinces. It will consist of the\n            following five components: 1) increase in the access to and\n            retention rates of basic schooling; 2) reduction of the gap\n            between the school participation rates of boys and girls; 3)\n            improvement of education quality; 4) improvement of the\n            performance of government literacy programs; and 5)\n            provision of technical support to the Ministry of National\n            Education to operationalize and implement its Sector Action\n            Plan, which aims to reallocate resources to priority\n            programs and improve budgetary efficiency."}, "docdt": "1996-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
