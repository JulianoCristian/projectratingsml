The lessons learned indicate that the\n            decentralization undertaken in the framework of the Social\n            Priorities Program (SPP/BAJ) project was one of the most\n            positive aspects. Project decentralization re-energized\n            activities and allowed the qualitative activities to move\n            ahead more quickly. The use of lump-sum disbursements upon\n            proof of services is a rather uncommon practice and yet,\n            when it is well organized, as it was in the BAJ project, it\n            makes it possible to speed up or to facilitate the\n            implementation of the activities and the pace of the\n            disbursements. Ideal project teams should stay intact from\n            beginning to end of an operation so as to ensure\n            institutional memory, facilitate contacts, and allow a\n            climate of trust to grow. Before a project begins, it is\n            essential to undertake an appraisal of the capacities of the\n            implementing agency. This step is crucial in order to put\n            into place the assets need to develop and/or to strengthen\n            institutional capacities. The initial expectation that the\n            three BAJ project could be implemented in a synergistic\n            manner by three different ministries proved unrealistic and\n            did not survive the reality check. The SPP/BAJ program was\n            comprised of three projects. Together they did have an\n            interactive effect and led to greater interaction, such as\n            road construction apparently leading to greater girls' enrollment."}, "docdt": "2004-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
