Proper protection of the rights of indigenous people (ethnic minorities) may require the implementation of special project components that may lie outside the
primary project's objectives. These components can include activities related to health and nutrition, productive infrastructure, linguistic and cultural
preservation, entitlement to natural resources, and education. The project component for indigenous peoples development should include the following
elements, as needed
Legal              The plan should contain an assessment of the legal status of the groups covered by this OD, as reflected in the country's constitution,
Framework.         legislation, and subsidiary legislation (regulations, administrative orders, etc.);


                   The plan should contain an assessment of the ability of such groups to obtain access to and effectively use the legal system to defend their
                   rights.


                   Particular attention should be given to the rights of indigenous peoples to use and develop the lands that they occupy, to be protected
                   against illegal intruders, and to have access to natural resources (such as forests, wildlife, and water) vital to their subsistence and
                   reproduction
Baseline Data.     Baseline data should include (i) accurate, up-to-date maps and aerial photographs of the area of project influence and the areas inhabited by indigenous
                   peoples;


                   (ii) analysis of the social structure and income sources of the population;


                   (iii) inventories of the resources that indigenous people use and technical data on their production systems;


                   (iv) the relationship of indigenous peoples to other local and national groups. It is particularly important that baseline studies capture the full range of
                   production and marketing activities in which indigenous people are engaged. Site visits by qualified social and technical experts should verify and update
                   secondary sources.

                   When local legislation needs strengthening, the Bank should offer to advise and assist the borrower in establishing legal recognition of the customary or
                    traditional land tenure systems of indigenous peoples.
Strategy for        Mechanisms should be devised and maintained for participation by indigenous people in decision making throughout project planning, implementation,

                    (iii) ability of indigenous peoples' own organizations, local administration authorities, and local NGOs to interact with specialized government institutions;
                    (iv) ability of the executing agency to mobilize other agencies involved in the plan's implementation; and
                    (v) adequacy of field presence.

Implementation      Components should include an implementation schedule with benchmarks by which progress can be measured at appropriate intervals.
  Schedule.         Pilot programs are often needed to provide planning information for phasing the project component for indigenous peoples with the main investment. The
                    plan should pursue the long-term sustainability of project activities subsequent to completion of disbursement.
Monitoring and      Independent monitoring capacities are usually needed.
 Evaluation.        Monitoring by representatives of indigenous peoples' own organizations can be an efficient way for the project management to absorb the perspectives of
                    indigenous beneficiaries and is encouraged by the Bank.
                    Monitoring units should be staffed by experienced social science professionals, and reporting formats and schedules appropriate to the project's needs
                    should be established. Monitoring and evaluation reports should be reviewed jointly by the senior management of the implementing agency and by the
                 Bank.
                 The evaluation reports should be made available to the public

                 mechanisms for financial transfer and replenishment.
                 It is usually helpful to have as high a share as possible of direct financial participation by the Bank in project components dealing with indigenous peoples.
