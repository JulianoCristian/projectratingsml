financing, and management systems for the sustainable\n            maintenance of the road networks countrywide, based on the\n            successful experience of initiation, and piloting under the\n            first phase. The project components are as follows. By\n            adopting a programmatic approach, the preservation of the\n            road network will support in part, Annual Work Programs, in\n            periodic, and routine maintenance, including on selected\n            local roads network, and, strengthen quality implementation.\n            The capacity building component will support the\n            strengthening of the transport sector capacity in two core\n            business functions - management and financing of the road\n            infrastructure, and, management of road transport and safety\n            - as well as the general institutional capacity at both\n            national and sub- national levels. Finally, Project\n            administration, will support efficient administration of the\n            Program, through project monitoring, i.e., strengthening\n            project management, reporting, monitoring of project impacts\n            and safeguards, and preparation of future sector programs.\n            Furthermore, incremental operating costs, include modest\n            budget support for project-related activities at central and\n            provincial levels, while auditing includes financial and\n            technical audits to ensure the quality of project implementation."}, "docdt": "2004-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
