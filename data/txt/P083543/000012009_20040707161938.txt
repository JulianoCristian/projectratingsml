                         Road Maintenance Program (Phase 2)

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK –(ESSF)

Objectives. The ESSF aims to ensure that (a) the Project activities do not create or result
in serious adverse impacts on the local community and environment, (b) the mitigation
plan is carried out effectively, and (c) possible complaints from the local government
authorities and community are minimized. The ESSF has been developed based on the
lessons learned during supervision of RMP1 and it may be modified or revised when
necessary with close consultation with the Bank.

Strategies. To achieve these objectives, the following actions will be undertaken:
• All proposed subprojects will be screened by ESD through the screening process
    described below and the results will be documented and properly kept for review by
    the Bank.

•   Appropriate mitigation measures will be included in the bidding document (BD) and
    contract document (CD); compliance with these measures will be monitored, and the
    results will be documented and properly kept for review by the Bank.
•   ESD will supervise and monitor the overall activities and prepare a semi-annual
    report on the application of the EGRP and RCG guidelines and other frameworks and
    action plans during the planning, design, and construction phase of the project. ESD
    will also develop the reporting requirements and procedures to ensure compliance of
    the contractors; conduct public consultation and public awareness programs, and
    carry out periodic training for field engineers and contractors as appropriate. A semi-
    annual report on the implementation of the guidelines will be submitted to the Bank.

Assumptions. The screening is based on the assumptions described below. If this is not
the case, the Bank will be informed and consulted.
    • The main civil works to be carried out under RMP2 will be limited to activities
        typically defined as routine and periodic maintenance (resurfacing and bridge
        repairs; flood repairs or emergency maintenance; regular upkeep of safety features
        and road signs, etc.) and small rehabilitation works to strengthen the road, repair
        structural defects, restore the road to its initial condition, make small changes or
        improvements to alignment, and small construction of drainage and footpaths. If
        large-scale rehabilitation works are involved, DOR will inform the Bank before
        proceeding with the contract.

    •   The works will be carried out within the existing right of way (ROW) and will not
        involve relocation and land acquisition. If land acquisition and relocation is
        needed, the Bank will be informed, and the Resettlement and Compensation
        Guidelines (RCG) will be applied.

    •   The project-related impacts are site specific; few of the effects are irreversible;
        and appropriate mitigation measures can be developed and implemented by the
        contractors and MCTPC.
Screening procedures. The screening process is not intended to prohibit DOR from
carrying out maintenance-related works in sensitive areas but is meant to ensure that
proper mitigation measures are prepared and carried out effectively to avoid adverse
impacts on the affected population, natural environment and cultural heritage. If the
subproject is located in or near protected areas or other critical habitats or cultural
property, an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for the subproject will be prepared
and carried out in close cooperation with ESD and other concerned agencies and in
consultation with the Bank. The civil works contracts for office building and construction
of weigh stations will also be subject to this screening. The ESSF will be conducted by
the subproject administrator (RAD, LAD, DTCPC, etc.) during the screening and
preparation of the Annual Work Plan (AWP). Steps and actions for the screening are
presented in Table 1.

Key steps of the ESSF is shown in Figure 1.
