A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryand sector issues
The government's socio-economic development policy rests on three pillars: economic growth,
socio-cultural development and environmental preservation. The National Growth and Poverty
Eradication Strategy (NGPES) o f January 2004 i s a comprehensive framework for growth and
development, particularly focusing on the improvement o f the poverty situation in the poorest
districts. Poverty i s extensive, with an estimated per capita income o f US$310 in 2002, 39
percent (in 1997/98) below the national poverty line o f US$1.5 a day, and social indicators
among the lowest inthis region.

The population density i s low, 23 persons per sq. km. It has significant natural resources like
forestry, minerals and hydroelectric power, and agriculture i s the major sector o f the economy.
Though landlocked, Lao PDR is in the center o f the Mekong region, bordered by Thailand,
Vietnam, Southern China, Cambodia and Myanmar. In the 1990s, Lao PDR grew rapidly and
reduced poverty significantly. Real GDP grew by 5.8 percent a year during 1999-2003 period
since the East Asian crisis. Nevertheless, the country is still heavily reliant on external support;
in2002/03, donor funded programs accounted for 7 percent of GDP, 39 percent o f total public
expenditure, and 61percent o f the capital budget.

As a part of the modernization o f social and economic infrastructure, the main goal of the
Government for the transport sector is to fully integrate the economy both domestically and
intemationally, thereby providing an enabling environment for trade and commerce and access
for all Lao people to basic services. In the absence of a railway system and access to the sea,
Lao PDR depends primarily on road transport and to a lesser extent on river and air transport.
Therefore, the development o f an efficient transport system i s o f paramount importance for
regional integration and socio-economic development o f the country. During 1990 and 2002,
freight and passenger demand grew rapidly by 78 and 95 percent respectively. However, higher
transportation demand i s constrained by an inadequate road transport network, and limited in
coverage bythe physical condition o f the road infrastructure.

Road is the dominant mode o f transportation inLao PDR, carrying more than 60 percent and 90
percent o f freight and passenger traffic in 2002, respectively. Over the past 15 years, a high
percentage o f the Government's public investment program has been devoted to rebuilding the
road system. Of a total road system o f 31,209 km, the national road network (NRN) now
comprises 7,141 km, o f which 53 percent i s paved and 73 percent is in good condition.
However, in the local road network (LRN) (provincial, district and rural roads) comprising
24,068 km, only 3 percent is paved. Access constraints remain significant, with 26 percent o f
National roads and 34 percent o f Provincial roads experiencing closures over more than 3
monthsper year.

The Government has made a strong start towards achieving sustainable maintenance o f the road
system, as shown by the establishment o f the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) in 2001 and the
successful implementation o f three years o f maintenance programs with support from the Road
Maintenance Project. The RMP1,supported by a parallel financed Second Lao-Swedish Road
Sector Project (LSRSP-2), strengthened the technical and managerial capacity inthe Ministryof



                                                1

Communications Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) and in selected provincial
Divisions o f Communications Transport, Post and Construction (DCTPC).             The approach to
management and delivery o f maintenance was established through three successive annual work
programs for periodic and routine maintenance on the NRN and on the LRN in the selected
Provinces, and the participation o f the private sector through the development o f national
competitive contracting procedures and village-based contracts. The purpose o f the RMF is to
establish a steady and adequate domestic funding source for road maintenance based on the
substantial recovery o f costs from road users. The Government currently meets an estimated 45
percent o f road maintenance needs, o f which nearly one third i s sourced from the RMF, mainly
for national roads. The RMF is growing slowly and effort is now required to establish and
achieve a sustainable level, and to develop its role for the LRN. Steps have been taken to protect
the road assets by reducing the overloading o f heavy vehicles, but much more effort is needed
for improving the safety and administration o froad transport.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement
Continuation of Important Policy Initiative. Development andpreservation o f the road network
i s crucial to the national and regional integration o f this land-locked country.       A series o f
investment projects in the 1990s focused on rehabilitating about 3,000 km o f the arterial road
network and bridges, with an investment of about US$600 million which absorbed about half o f
the government's public investment plan and over 5 percent o f GDP. The 8-year two phase
Road Maintenance Program marks a major shift in focus, arising from the Government's
"Strategic Directions for Development o f the Road Sector" o f June 2000, from investment to one
of preservation and sustainable management o f the road assets. It aims to help establish a
maintenance culture in the country at both national and local levels, including the capacity and
tools for management, and the capacity for delivering services through the private sector. Under
their `one country, one system' policy, MCTPC is relying on IDA to lead the support on the road
maintenance initiative to be followed by other donors.

Achieve thefuU Program goal. The first Phase o f the RMP succeeded ininitiating the new road
financing system, developing an appropriate road management system to help budget and
prioritize the maintenance needs o f the road assets, initiated a local road management system,
initiated control o f heavy vehicle overloading, and implemented maintenance on substantial
portions of the road networks. Partnership was key, including Nordic Development Fund(NDF)
cofinancing for the technical assistance aspects o f RMP1, and Swedish International
Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) financing o f a parallel project (LSRSP-2) which led on
the local road aspects and expanded the coverage to seven Provinces (of 18). The second phase is
intended to (i) the road cost-recovery-based financing closer to a sustainable level; (ii)
                 bring
enhance the management systems and extend them to cover the management o f both National
and Local road networks over the whole country; and (iii)expand the coverage of heavy
transport control throughout the country. The benefits o f the first Phase will therefore only be
fully realizedthroughcontinuance withPhase2.

Criteriafor Phase 2 Satisfied. GoL has performed well on Phase 1 o f RMP and has requested
to proceed with Phase 2. The development objectives for RMP1 have been substantially met,
and all three trigger criteria for the second phase have been substantially met, (refer to B.1).




                                                  2

Substantial Financing Gapfor Medium Term. Although the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF)
established in 2001 has grown steadily, the current revenues o f estimated US$3.4 million in
2003/04 constitute only 17 percent o f the US$20 million estimated annual road preservation
needs, and the 6-fold increase in fuel levy (to about 3.5 c/L) needed to reach sustainable levels
by 2009 represents a substantial challenge. The Government, with foreign assistance, currently
meets an estimated 45 percent o f road maintenance needs, however counterpart funds are very
limited, often causing delays, so greater leveraging o f the Fundis a favored option underRMP2.
With the support from RMP for growth and efficient operation o f the Fund, other donors are
showing willingness to provide matching funds, making a programmatic sector-wide approach
feasible in the medium-term.       Funding for local roads (provincial, district and rural) is
particularly scarce compared with the needs, and an improved mechanism for sharing and
distributing funds needs to be developed and piloted under RMP2.

3. Higher levelobjectivesto which the projectcontributes
Inline with the main objective of the existing Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the proposed
project will support rural and national infrastructure development, including maintenance o f
national highway networks. It will support the CAS objectives by: (i)   reducing transport cost for
goods and passengers; (ii)  increasing travel mobility o f the population in general; (iii)offering
opportunities for travel time savings in productive and/or leisure activities for project
beneficiaries; (iv) improving access to markets, school and health centers; and (v) mobilizing
revenues to maintain roads.

The project will support enhancement o f the capacity of public and private sectors relating to
road transport and infrastructure in Lao PDR through a results-oriented program, and will
support decentralization through the strengthening o f capacity at provincial and district levels in
the sector.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. Lendinginstrument
The Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument was adopted inorder to facilitate support over a
long-term period for the development o f institutional capacity and systems that could only be
established progressively, with staged implementation and intermediate objectives which allow
an element o f flexibility. The objectives o f the first Phase and trigger criteria established for
progressing to the second Phase have been fully achieved on time:          (i)financial resources
allocated for road maintenance exceed 35 percent o f needs on NRN and LRN (achieved 45
percent in FY03); (ii)the third maintenance AWP (MP-3) prioritized using the new Road
Management System (RMS) (this was delayed but is being achieved for the MP-4 in FY04/05);
and (iii) disbursements from the IDA Credit are greater than 60 percent (79 percent in March
2004).   This second Phase would be implemented within the same Program objectives and
framework.

While the US$70.0 million scope o f Phase 2 is as originally planned for the Program, financing
has changed. The Government share i s 39% o f which 25% is from road users through the RMF,
the IDA-supported allocation is 39% including Japanese PHRD cofinancing for capacity
building, andother donors are proposingto contribute 22% (refer to C.1).

2. Programobjective and Phases
The goal o f the Program is the sustainable preservation o f road assets through the development
and implementation o f financing and road management systems. The Program includes two
phases:
0   Phase 1for Initiation and Development - Establishment o f a sustainable financing framework
    based on road user cost recovery and management o f a dedicated road hnd; development and
    initiation o f a road management system for National roads; development o f a road
    management approach for local roads and pilot application in four Provinces; initial
    implementation of road maintenance programs under the modified procedures; and initiation
    o f improved control on heavy vehicle overloading.
0   Phase 2 for Operation and Expansion - Scaling up o f the road financing mechanism to a
    sustainable level for meetingthe majority o f road preservation needs; operation o f systems to
    manage road maintenance efficiently; implementation o f sustainable levels of maintenance o f
    the NRN; expansion o f capacity for managing the LRNin all Provinces/Zone; and expanded
    operation o f heavy vehicle loading control.

3. Project development objective and key indicators
The second phase of the Road Maintenance Program (RMP2) will expand the operation o f
financing and management systems for the sustainable maintenance o f the road networks to all
18 provinces/zones countrywide, based on the successful experience o f initiation and piloting
under the first phase, with the following development objectives:
(a) National and local road assets are preserved to provide sustainable improved travel and
    access for road users and communities inmost areas countrywide; and
(b) Sustainable financing and management of roads is operational countrywide with improved
    institutional capacity at central and local levels inthe public andprivate sectors.

Achievement o f the objectives and Program goal would be assessed against the following
targets:
0   Improvement incondition o fnational and local road networks;
0   Mobilization o f financial resources for roadmaintenance inrelation to needs;
0   Enhancement o f capacities for dealing with road maintenance activities at central, provincial
    and local levels; and
0   Reduction o f incidence o f overloading o f heavy vehicles.

4. Project components
ComponentA. PRESERVATION OF THEROAD NETWORKS (US$59.1 million)
Adopting a programmatic approach, this will support a slice o f four Annual Work Programs
(AWPs) for periodic maintenance and routine maintenance on the National Road network
countrywide and on selected parts o f the Local Road network in all Provinces/Zones
countrywide, and strengthen the quality o f implementation.          In a shift o f focus based on
economic and social analysis o f needs, the Phase 2 program would devote nearly half the
resources (44%) to maintenance o f local roads, with particular emphasis on Provincial roads
(24%) due to the poor condition o f that network, and will contribute to substantial improvements
inthe quality of access to all districts, especially the 47 poorest districts. Due to a limitation on
resources, the fourth AWP may not be fully financed, unless the RMF revenues reach the full
target and other donors or Government funds are provided.

   A.1     Nationalroads: Support for the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation program at
           an average level o f US$6.3 milliodyear (estimated to be about 45 percent o f the
           sustainable level o f about US$15 milliodyear), by supplementingthe resources o f the
           Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) which is recovering an increasing portion o f costs
           from road users, and resources from other donors. All routine maintenance will be
           financed by counterpart funding, largely through the RMF, and all implemented
           through the private sector and mainlyvillage-based.
   A.2     Local Roads: Support for the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation o f about 30%
           o f the provincial road network at an average level o f US$4.10 milliodyear with costs
           shared by local government, RMF and external funding. There is the potential for
           additional external donor support for the District and Ruralroads inthe near future.
   A.3     Implementation Support: Assistance to central and provincial departments for
           improving the quality o f implementation o f the road preservation programs, including
           strengthened supervision o f technical aspects and monitoring o f safeguards aspects,
           especially at the provincial level.

ComponentB. CAPACITYBUILDING (US$lO.l million):
This will support the strengthening o f capacity o f the transport sector in two core business
functions (management and financing o f the road infrastructure, and management o f road
transport and safety), as well as the general institutional capacity at both national and sub-
national levels, through:
   B.l     Road Management and Financing- the establishment and operation o f appropriate
           procedures at central and provincial levels for planning, budgeting and implementing
           maintenance work programs on: a) National roads and bridges; b) Local roads and
           bridges (provincial, district andrural roads); and c) Support for scaling up the RMFto
           a sustainable level o f cost recovery and determining appropriate cost-sharing
           arrangements at the local level.
   B.2     Road Transport Management and Safety - hnprovements to road transport
           administration procedures and systems, expanding the heavy transport management
           program (HTMP) o f overloading control through the operation o f new load control
           facilities built under RMP1, and development and implementation o f a program o f
           road safety improvements.
   B.3     Institutional Capacity Building - Strengthening the capacity and perfonnance o f
           MCTPC and provincial DCTPCs through: a) Improvements to the organization and
           business processes, for upgrading key business functions including safeguards, and
           for effective perfonnance under a decentralized structure; b) Human Resource
           Development,      including results-oriented learning and training programs;           c)
           Information technology and communications, for upgrading the communication and
           computerization o f central and provincial offices; d) Facilities, for provision o f basic
           office facilities and transport to support operations at district level; e) Strengthening
           o f the transport business sector, including construction and transport industries, and
           consultant capacity; and f) Environmental and Social Safeguards Capacity, enhancing
           baseline information on construction resources, community right-of-way, and related
           activities.

Component C. PROJECTADMINISTRA TION (US$O.85million)
This will support efficient administrationo fthe Programthrough:
    C.1     Project Monitoring - Strengthening project management, reporting, monitoring of
            project impacts and safeguards, andpreparation o f future sector programs.
    C.2     Incrementaloperatingcosts-Modest budgetsupport for project-related activities at
            central andprovincial levels.
    C.3     Auditing- Financialand technical audits to ensure quality o fproject implementation.

5. Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe project design
Project Implementation is mainstreamed in MCTPC. The latest two projects were coordinated
by DOR through the Project Monitoring Division and the sub-components were managed by the
respective departments. This organization o f the functions enables improvement o f monitoring
and reporting, avoidance o f duplication, fostering donors' coordination and opportunities for the
staffs career growth and professional development. Also, DOR divisions now have the capacity
to produce investment and maintenance plans for the NRN and the LRN with only little
assistance. As a result, in recent years, the MCTPC successfully obtained specific budget
allocations for routine andperiodic maintenance from MOF.

Technical Audits are an effective instrument for enhancing quality. Timely and independent
professional opinion provided by auditors during implementation has allowed MCTPC to
identify and resolve any issues during the life of the project. The auditor provides comment on
the physical output and quality, the technical issues and the effectiveness o f MCTPC and donor
procedures.

Quality of maintenance works issues. Some o f the contractors are not completely following
specifications, some local DCTPC staff lack skills in contract management, procurement,
reporting, supervision o f contractors and quality control. The project i s designed to address these
constraints through the capacity buildingcomponent.

Continued contracting with the local construction industry. The previous projects contributed
to the commercialization o f all MCTPC construction and maintenance enterprises (SOEs) and to
the introduction o f competition-based procurement.        The capacity o f the local contracting
industry is still under-developed. The contractors lack managerial expertise and financial
resources. The same applies to the local consulting firms which are very few in number. The
RMP1 has identified a long-term development strategy which will be further enhanced and
implemented inRMP2.

Allocation for emergency maintenance. Lao PDR i s frequently affected by heavy rains that            .
cause land slides. Recently, up to 30-40 percent o f the routine maintenance program has been
required for emergency works on the maintainable sections o f the NRN and LRN, which is
exceedingly high for unplanned expenditures. A systematic approach to risk management,
including risk reduction at hazardous locations, needs to be adopted in MCTPC in order to
reduce these unplannedcosts.

Role of the provincial authorities.     The Govemors play a key role in the management o f the
provincial branches o f central agencies. While the DCTPCs are official branches of the central



                                                 6

MCTPC, they work under the day-to-day guidance o f the Govemor's office and senior staffing
decisions are made in consultation with the Govemor. Inaddition, the role o f the provinces has
increased in recent years due to the decentralizatioddevolution policy promoted by the
Government. This implies that the implementation o f a common strategy and system for the
maintenance o f the NRN and LRN under RMP2 will entail substantial consultations and
partnership with the provincial governments.

Results-oriented capacity building. Past experience has shown that capacity bottlenecks can
often jeopardize project outcomes, even when policy changes are satisfactory and financing i s
available. Narrowly focusing capacity building on training o f individuals and on technical
assistance alone will often fail to address fundamental issues o f institutional incentives, and
organizational accountabilities. Moreover, the outcomes o f capacity building interventions need
to be tracked. RMP1and other projects have shown that tying capacity buildinginterventions to
project results can help discipline the use o f project resources and achieve strong client
ownership. RMP2 will systematically involve beneficiaries in the identification o f capacity
building needs, and the design and implementation o f capacity building interventions, with
agreed set o fprogress indicators. (Refer to Annexes 4 and 11).

6. Alternativesconsideredandreasons for rejection
An Adaptable Program Loan (APL) approach seemed the most appropriate instrument to assist
inthe development of systems that can only be established progressively and over a long-term
period. An APL satisfies the GoL need for sustained long-term assistance. In addition, the
staged implementation with intermediate evaluation introduces an element o f flexibility in case
the project design needs to be adjusted.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnershiparrangements
Strong coordination and partnership o f donors with MCTPC has become central to support o fthe
sector in Lao PDR. Under Phase 1, the Project was structured with part parallel cofinancing and
part parallel financing o f a common overall Program, with the Government's recurrent cost share
included inthe total Project cost o f US$47.80 million equivalent, with IDA financing 52 percent,
GoL 35 percent, NDF 11 percent and Sida 2 percent, respectively.                Sida also financed
development o f the local roads aspects under a parallel project, the LSRSP-2.

For Phase 2, there was strong interest in adopting a full cofinancing structure in order to
promote a more unified programmatic approach based on the GoL program. RMP2 has been
designed with all expected donors included in the overall financing allocations with indicative
amounts - these are shown in Annex 5, Table 2. The core project is supported by current
financing sources, Le., the IDA Credit and PHRD cofinancing for capacity building. Due to the
timing of funding availability, the Sida, NDF and ADB financing was tentative at the time of
preparation, andwill be finalized withinthe first year o fPhase 2.

A substantial portion o f the institutional strengthening aspects o f the Project are proposedto be
cofinanced through a grant under the Japan PHRD facility for Project Cofinancing for Capacity
Building, amounting to US$4.8 million equivalent. Only consulting services and training, up to




                                                   7

75 percent o f the capacity-building component, are eligible expenditures under this facility, so all
goods andworks aspects are financed by other sources.

Implementation arrangements would be coordinated, including common financing ratios and
coordinated management o f funds. For example, for the road maintenance subprograms, donor
funds would be deposited in separate Special Accounts for each donor, but these would all be
managed and disbursed by the Road Maintenance Fund, thus providing the equivalent o f budget
support for a sector program subject to agreed criteria.

Monitoring and review/supervision o f the Project would be undertaken jointly by the donors,
with IDA taking the lead responsibility, as under Phase 1. A donor coordination meeting with
MCTPC will be conducted annually.

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements
Strategic review and oversight o f the Project will be provided through a Program Review panel
comprising key central and Provincial authorities which would be responsible for results on the
development objectives of: (a) sustainability o f the maintenance process; and (b) decentralization
and capacity-building; financial resource mobilization including cost sharing arrangements, RMF
revenues and allocations, and donor coordination.

Primary management and coordination o f the Project would be undertaken by a Project
Coordination Committee (PCC), chaired by the Director General o f Roads and comprising
Directors o f each MCTPC Division involved in RMP2, Head o f Secretariat o f the RMF, and
three Directors o f Provincial DCTPCs (representing the 18 Provinces/Zone participating in the
Project and appointed on a rotating basis).      The PCC would be collectively responsible for
successful implementation o f the Project. Although the PCC would be large (about 20), this
inclusive and participatory approach functioned well for RMP1, and would be enlarged to
include four DCTPCs on a rolling basis to ensure broad representation.

Individual components will be managed by the relevant Division Heads in DORYDOT and the
DCTPC's. The Project will be administered by the Project Monitoring Division(PMD) o f DORY
which will have a coordinating role, provide procurement support to implementing divisions, and
be responsible for overall reporting requirements and liaison with the donors.

The responsibilities for planning, procuring, implementing, supervising and accounting for civil
works would be the responsibility o f the DCTPC's, under coordination o f DOR-RAD for
National roads; DOR-LRD for local roads, DOR-BMUfor bridges, and PMD for equipment and
procurement assistance.     These arrangements and fiduciary requirements are detailed in a
Memorandum o f Agreement (MOA) to be signed between MCTPC and the Governor o f each
Province (similar to that for RMPl), to be condition o f effectiveness.

Overall Project financial management responsibilities will remain under the Disbursement
Division (DD) within Department o f Roads. The current Financial Management System (FMS),
which was assessed as adequate inRMP1,will be continued, butwith minor modifications inthe
reporting system, selection procedures o f the independent auditor, and the accounting
procedures. Each Provincial DCTPC would operate a similar FMS, and transfer accounting



                                                  8

details to DD on a monthly basis. Funds flow would be through three Special Accounts: (i)      for
MTCPC to cover share o f eligible project expenditures other than RMF activities; (ii)    for the
RMF; and (iii)for the PHRD Cofinancing Grant for capacity-building. Details are given in
Annex 7.

Environmental and social safeguards at implementation will be monitored and supervised
through the DTCPCs, while those at the Project level will be monitored and supervised by the
Environmental and Social Division (ESD) o f DOR. During the preparation o f the annual work
program, RAD, LRD, and the DCTPCs will conduct safeguard screening for the potential
adverse impacts. Ifissues are identified, ESD will be consulted, and appropriate actions will be
taken. ESD and DCTPC will beresponsible for information disclosure and consultation.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results
A set o f indicators for monitoring outcomes and results is shown in Annex 3. The monitoring
will be undertakenby the MCTPC through or underthe coordination o fPMD.

4. Sustainability
The primary objective o f the RMP2 i s to enhance the long-term sustainability framework for
maintainingthe NRNand LRNthrough the following initiatives:
        Grow and maintain a sustainable revenue source for preserving road assets;
        Continue to promote participation o f main stakeholders inproject design, implementation
        and operations to ensure ownership o fproject objectives;
        Improve MCTPC/DCTPC practices andrestructure them according to their
        responsibilities;
        Promoteroad maintenance activities that are economically, financially and
        environmentally viable;
        Enforce key regulations on roadtransport operations which affect the pavement life;
        Promoteroad users' participationboth inthe management and financing o f the sector; and
        Improve the capability o fthe local construction and consulting industry.

        will support the growth and efficient operation o f the Road Maintenance Fund which,
over time, would generate sufficient revenue to cover the full cost o fpreservingthe road network
in Lao PDR, by 2010. Moreover, the Road Management System will be further enhanced and
strengthened within the existing sub-systems.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economic andfinancialanalyses
The economic returns o f the road maintenance program, comprising 86 percent o f the Project
cost, were evaluated based on analysis o f the first year work program being financed by the IDA
Credit. The results o f the analysis for the 2004-05 preservation program are summarized below.
The program has a very high economic rate o f return, which i s typical o f such preservation
programs.

The economic evaluation for RMP2 was done using the MCTPC Road Management System
(RMS), supplemented by the HDM-4model applying conventional cost-benefit methodology, as
detailed in Annex 9. The investment activities can be placed into three broad groups: (i)       those
with a positive NPV which are economically justified using HDM-4; (ii)those which are not
justified using HDM-4 but are requiredto prevent the road asset deteriorating to the point when a
major investment would be required (called `Asset Preservation Works' (APW) by the MCTPC);
and (iii) safety works.

N o evaluation has been undertaken for the capacity building component, comprising 13 percent
of the Project cost. It i s expected to yield very high retums in the operation o f the sector and
human capital.

Financial and Fiscal Evaluation. Inrecent years the Government budget is facing a stagnating
share o f revenues in GDP with accumulating arrears, and this is limiting expenditure choices for
meeting the poverty reduction goals.        Capital expenditures have taken the major share o f
resources, generating more assets without adequate resources for maintaining them. The budget
allocated to MCTPC has been in the range o f 16-21 percent o f national budget for the past three
years, FYO1-FY03, but a large increase i s budgeted to 43.7 percent, or US$120 million, for
FY04. Over the period FYOl to FY04, capital expenditure on national roads averaged US$45


                                                  12

milliodyear while maintenance expenditures averaged only US$8.4 million. In the meantime,
Government revenue from transport has risen strongly, from US$14.8 million in FYOl to
US$25.4 million in FY04 - o f this, 50 percent derives from fuel taxes, 37 percent from vehicle
taxes and registration, and 13 percent from RMF revenues (from fuel levy, road tolls and fines).
Inthe current FY04, Government is contributing 68 percent o froadmaintenance expenditures o f
US$18.6 million, RMF 15 percent and foreign financing 17 percent. The optimal level o f road
maintenance needs has been estimated during preparation as US$30 milliodyear for all national
and local roads, and the proposed RMP program is US$14.7 milliodyear, about 49 percent o f
optimal levels. Currently the RMF revenues total US$3.4 milliodyear which i s only 15 percent
o f national road needs. The current fuel levy of LAK 60/Liter (US$0.006) is only 1.3 percent o f
the retail price and represents only 5 percent o f Government revenues from fuel. On this basis,
there is considerable scope for a larger share o f the fuel price to be devoted to road maintenance,
and a fuel levy o f Kip 400/L would raise the RMF revenues to US$16 milliodyear and fund a
nearlyoptimal program when cost-sharing for local roads is taken into account. Onthis basis, a
LAK 200/L fuel levy is considered a minimum level to be achieved during RMP2. Road tolls
and overloading fine revenues constitute about US$1.3 milliodyear o f the revenue, but
collection costs reduce this by about 35 percent - thus they are not an efficient source o f revenue
but have substantial safety and indirect benefits.

2. Technical
Maintenance Techniques. Periodic maintenance works involve mainly resealing and regravelling
techniques which are well known in Lao PDR and do not present any specific technical
challenge. Like RMP1, RMP2 will also promote the use of alternative maintenance treatments
such as slurry seal and asphalt overlay, and labor-based equipment supported methods.
Specialized consultant services will be provided under the project to assist DOR-RAD, LRD,
BMU and DCTPCs in selecting and designing the most suitable technical maintenance
techniques and in training the staff and contractors on how to implement these techniques. In
addition, a technical audit will be carried out annually to review the effectiveness o f the
maintenance programs.

3. Fiduciary
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), carried out in mid 2002 concluded
the overall fiduciary risk in Lao PDR is high despite the fact that there are elaborate built-in
controls within the government financial management system. Issues relate to the transparency
of public finances, public access to government financial information, internal controls, sub-
national financial management and auditing capacity.            To address these deficiencies, the
government has agreed to implement several recommendations o f the PER and CFAA for
Financial Management Capacity Building which are expected to bring the fiduciary risk to an
acceptable level. The financial management system inthe country for external funded projects i s
generally weak and needs substantial improvements inthe production o f financial statements, the
resources for financial management, and compliance with the rules and regulations. The annual
Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) identifies similar issues and weaknesses,
including inconsistent and inadequate financial management standards; management o f Special
Accounts by MOF; audit delays; inadequate staffing and equipment; poor internal control
procedures, inadequate financial management capacity at provincial and district levels; and




                                                 13

delayed government counterpart funds contribution. Recent unresolved Special Account issues at
MOFpose a risk indelays to the operation of all new Project Special Accounts.

These country financial management risks are considered to be manageable in the Project with
implementation o f the risk-mitigation measures which are already in place or are requiredto be
established before effectiveness. The financial management arrangements under RMP1 were
generally satisfactory, including the financial management system, the management o f Special
Accounts by MCTPC, and payment performance.             Aspects requiring improvement include
timeliness and format of reporting, capacity at Provincial level with expansion o f the Project
countrywide, and quality o f audits; and, in RMF, staffing and intemal controls. Under RMP2,
similar arrangements will continue and the Project is required to expand the financial
management system to the remaining four Provinces, strengthen the financial management
capacity o f the RMF and all Provincial DCTPCs, and appoint an independent auditor acceptable
to IDA and consistent with the Audit Peer Review conducted regularly by IDA.

Procurement.      Overall, the capacity o f the implementing units involved with procurement i s
"fair" and the associated risks are in the "average" category. Procurement implementation
arrangements under RMPl performed generally satisfactorily but with delays in DOT, and will
be continued with minor improvements for RMP2. Procurement will be undertaken: (i)          for
consultancy services and goods, by DOR, MCTPC which has good capacity and average risk;
and (ii) for works, by the DCTPCs which are provincial branches o f the central MCTPC, which
have fair capacity and higher risk. All DCTPC procurement under the Project i s prior reviewed
and monitored by DOR, which has worked smoothly under RMP1. The N C B documents used
by MCTPC andthe DCTPC's are acceptable to the World Bank and are usedby all donors inthe
road sector.    Recent National laws and regulations are consistent with Bank procurement
guidelines. Areas o f improvement include: contract administration,         computerization o f
prequalification, bid evaluation, staff knowledge and experience. Mitigationmeasures to address
the risks include: access to IDA procurement specialists inthe sub-region; intemal and extemal
training; provision o f specialized consultants with procurement experience; and DOR prior
review and monitoring o f DCTPC procurement activities. The procurement plan and detailed
procurement arrangements are presented inAnnex 8.

4. Social
Positive social development outcomes have been reported for RMPl and by other studies
focusing on the impact o f improved road accessibility inLaos PDR. Besides improved access to
markets and services which have helped inpoverty alleviation, RMPl has provided employment
and income opportunities and skills generation through the routine maintenance contracts
provided to villagers working on project roads., Most o f the works have been carried out along
existing alignments and have not involved any resettlement. A similar situation is expected for
RMP2 and, if resettlement and land acquisition is involved, the Resettlement and Compensation
Guidelines (RCG) which has been found to be satisfactory to the Bank will be applied.

As for ethnic minorities, there do not appear to be any specific concems that have arisen which
relate directly to any particular ethnic minority group. RMPl project experience generally
reflects the fact that project impacts are not ethnic group-specific but generally relate to
communities in the project area. However, given the nationwide nature o f RMP2, a framework



                                                 14

on Ethnic Minority Development Policy (EMDP) has been prepared and will be applied when an
Ethnic Minority Action Plan (EMAP) i s deemed appropriate. Safeguard screening (Annex 10) o f
subprojects will ensure that adverse impacts will be properly addressed. Inthe areas with ethnic
minority groups who are less assimilated into the mainstream o f national life and who may
require special attention to their needs, an Ethnic Minorities Development Plan or Strategy will
be developed inline with the EMDP.

5. Environment                                 Environmental Category: B
The Project is an expansion o f the RMPl and no major issues are anticipated. On February 27,
2004, MCTPC disclosed its intention to apply and comply with the RMP safeguard requirements
inthe national newspapers (inEnglish and Lao). RMPl experience has suggested that most of
the potential impacts during maintenance works will be localized, temporary, and can be
mitigated through the application of the Environmental Guidelines for Road Projects (EGRP)
and the Resettlement and Compensation Guidelines (RCG) adopted for the project. There are,
however, concerns on the supervision budget, capacity o f ESD and DTCPC, impacts in sensitive
areas, and compliance performance o f contractors, especially in the areas o f road safety, dust,
disposal o f wastes, location and treatment o f borrow pitdquarries, and consultation with local
communities. Other concerns relate to post-maintenance operations, including dust repression,
road safety, HIV/AIDS,community participation, and encroachment on road right-of-way.

Mitigation measures in RMP2:          The EGRP has been updated to address the impacts after
maintenance operations and a number o f standard operational procedures, including: (i)
monitoringheporting requirements and specific criteria for maintenance operations in sensitive
areas (ecologically and socially); (ii)  Screening o f all works subprojects for possible adverse
impacts (iii) Reporting on results ofthe safeguard screening and application o f the guidelines and
frameworks; (iv) Training on safeguard operations for central and provincial staff and
contractors; (v) Additional disclosure o f safeguards documents/information; and (vi) Awareness
and capacity building for senior management. To improve the implementation phase, technical
assistance will be provided to ESD and DCTPCs to strengthen: (i)   supervision and monitoring o f
safeguard compliance;       (ii)consultation with local communities and authorities; (iii)
mainstreaming o f safeguards into DOR operations, and (iv) knowledge related to construction
resource mapping, community inventory inthe road right-of-way, and related social activities. It
i s anticipated that additional assistance on the environment and social aspects will be provided
through other financing agencies (ADB, Sida). The actions to address the safeguard issues to be
under the Project are found to be satisfactory and inline with the World Bank safeguard policies,
The implementation performance will be monitored during the IDA supervision which include
environmental and social specialists as appropriate.

   LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC: RoadMaintenanceProgram(Phase 2)

Country and Sector Brief

The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) government's socio-economic development policy
rests on the following three pillars: economic growth, socio-cultural development and environmental
preservation. Through the consultative process, the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy
(NGPES) was approved by the national assembly in January 2004.                NGPES i s a comprehensive
framework for growth and development, which focus on the improvement o f poverty situation in the
poorest districts.

Lao PDR has a population of around 5.5 million, approximately 23 persons per square lulometer, the
lowest population density in the region. It has significant natural resources like forestry, minerals and
hydroelectric power. Agriculture remains the major sector of the economy, contributing around 51
percent of GDP and employing over 80 percent of the labor force; the industrial and service sectors
account for the rest (23 percent of GDP for industryand 26 percent for services). Though landlocked, Lao
PDR i s in the center of the Mekong region, bordered by Thailand, Vietnam, Southern China, Cambodia
and Myanmar.

Inthe 1990s, Lao PDR has grown rapidly and reduced poverty significantly. Real GDP grew by seven
percent during 1992-97 periods and by 5.8 percent a year during 1999-2003 period, with the intervening
years adversely affected by the East Asian crisis. Exports also grew at a rapid rate over this period.
Nevertheless, the country i s still heavily reliant on external support; in 2002/03, donor funded programs
accounted for seven percent of GDP, 39 percent of total public expenditure, and 61 percent o f the capital

As apart of the modernizationofsocial and economic infrastructure, the main goal ofthe Government for
the Transport Sector i s to fully integrate the economy both domestically and internationally, thereby
providing an enabling environment for trade and commerce and access for all Lao people to basic
services.

Inthe absence of a railway system and access to the sea, Lao PDR depends primarily on road transport
and to less extend onriver and air transport. Therefore, the development o f an efficient transport systemi s
of paramount importance for regional integration and socio-economic development o f the country. During
1990 and 2002, freight and passenger demand have rapidly grown by 78 and 95 percent respectively.
However, highertransportation demand i s constrained by an inadequate transport network, and limitedin
coverage by its physical condition.

The World Bank has nearly ten years of partnership with Lao PDR in the transport sector. RMP2 i s the
second and concluding phase of the Road Maintenance Program (an Adaptable Program Loan (APL))
which builds upon the initial Road Maintenance Project (RMP: Cr. 3481-LA; SDR19.2 million), and
follows a previous series of investment projects including the First, Second and Third Highway
Improvement Projects (Cr. 2218; SDR32.1 million; Cr. 2606; SDR21.8 million; and Cr. 2943; SDR34.6
million). All projects have been implemented satisfactorily, and the Government has requested continued
IDA assistance.

The first phase (Road Maintenance Project, RMP1: Cr. 3481-LA; SDR19.2 million) focused on initiation
of the road management system, establishing a national cost-recovery-based financing mechanism and
road management programming tools, implementing three annual programs of competitively sourced
periodic maintenance contracts on the National RoadNetwork (NRN), piloting maintenance contracts on
the Local Road Network, establishing village-based area contracts for routine maintenance, initiating
effective vehicle loading control, establishing vehicle weight control facilities, and strengthening
institutional capacity at the national level and selectively at the local level in four Provinces (Luang
Prabang, Luang Namtha, Champassack and Savannakhet).                Partnership was key - Nordic (NDF)
cofinancing for the technical assistance aspects of RMPI, and Swedish (Sida) financing o f a parallel
project (LSRSP-2) which led on the local road aspects and expanded the coverage to seven Provinces (of
18). The second phase i s intended to fine-tune the systems and extend them to cover the management of
bothNational and Local roadnetworks over the whole country.

Current Situation

Road i s the dominant mode of transportation inthe Lao PDR. About 75 percent of freight and 93 percent
of all passenger traffic is carried by road (river transport carries most o f the remaining share of freight).
The development and conservation of the road network are critical to national and regional integration
and to the socio economic development o f the country. Inparticular, it provides connectionbetween the
economic centers o f its three main regions: Luang Prabang in the north, Vientiane in the center, and
Savannakhetand Pakseinthe South.

The Lao PDR road network is estimated to have a length of 31,291 km (April, 2004), of which 14.5
percent is paved (see Table Al.1). About 40 percent of the total road network is in excellent to good
condition, although for Nationalroads this figure rises to 73 percent.

There are 1685 bridges with span lengths > 3 mon the National (70 percent) and Provincial (30 percent)
network, with a total length o f about 42 km. Bailey bridges (23 percent), box culverts (18 percent) and
timber bridges (15 percent) form the majority of the bridge types. For National roads only 10percent are
inpooribadcondition; andfor Provincialroads, 30percent.

On some roads, closures are frequent due to poor pavement or bridge condition, as well as landslides.
About 10 percent of all district centers do not have year-round access by road, and almost one thirdof all
villages are without road access at any time. As shown in Table A1.2, less than 66 percent of National,
and 52 percent of Provincial roads, are considered to have excellent access with few, mainly short, road
closures.

Inspite oftheproblemswith access, there hasbeena significant improvement inthe overall quality ofthe
core national road network inrecent years through support from the donor community. This i s illustrated
in Figure Al.l which shows the results of roughness surveys on approximately 3500 km o f mainly
national roads in2001 and 2004. It will be observed that there has been a marked increase inthe length o f
excellent roads, primarily through improving the fair roads.

The road network i s lightly traveled; only 12 percent o f National roads carry over 1000 vehicledday (see
Table A1.3). Provincial and rural roads generally carry traffic below 50 vehicledday. The low traffic
flows are a reflection o f the low levels o f vehicle ownership (7 vehicles/1000 people): in2002 there were
150,000 motorcycles, 30,000 cars and light trucks; and 10,000 heavy trucks and buses registered, the
majority o f these in Vientiane Municipality. The fleet i s growing rapidly; between 1990 and 1998 the
number o fregistered vehicles increasedby 128 percent.

Institutional StrengtheningActivities

Under RMPl the MCTPC operations were strengthened through a series of institutional activities
supported by IDA and other donors. This has enhancedthe MCTPC's ability to perform its core functions
of planning and managing the road network. A key component was the development of the Lao Road
Management System (RMS),              funded by the NDF. This integrates modules such as a pavement
management system (PMS), routine maintenance management system (RMMS), bridge management
system (BMS) and monitoring and evaluation system (MES). The R M S was implemented in 2003 and
became fully operational inearly 2004.

To populate the system a `Location ReferencingSurvey' was conducted in2001. A road centerline with
GPS co-ordinates, spatially located lulometer posts and other key features such as bridges, as well as
collecting data on inventory, roughness and pavement condition was created. This survey was updated in
2003/4 for National roads and supplemented with traffic volume, bridge condition, and socio-economic
data. All data were inputto the R M S and are available for planning and operational use.

The RMS canbe usedto prepare estimates of the future investment needsas well as generatingreports on
road, bridge and traffic conditions. Through linking to a GIs, the data i s available to a wide range of
users, even those with limited training. Although in RMPl its use was focused at the MCTPC
headquarters inVientiane, it i s envisaged that the system will be implemented in a number o f Provincial
agenciesunder RMP2 as part of the process o f devolvingplanningresponsibilities.

Maintenance Funding Requirements

The RMS was used in2003 to prepare a 10 year Strategic Expenditure Plan' for National and Provincial
roads and bridges. This was updated in May 2004, using the 200314 survey data in conjunction with
HDM-4 (as calibrated for RMS) to establish the investment needs under different budget scenarios,
excluding already committed projects. The database was analyzed and homogeneous sections with an
average lengthof 6.1 kmwere established.

An unconstrained analysis was done which gave the total funding requirements for the road network
based on the current condition and expected future deterioration. This was an `ideal' analysis which did
not consider the implications of budget constraints. The results are shown inTable Al.4 and indicate that
the total maintenance and rehabilitation needs for the National and Provincial road networks i s
approximately US460 million over 10 years. About 60 percent o f the funds should be allocated to
Nationalroads.

The analysis indicatedthe following:
         Routine maintenance needs are equally dividedbetween roads andbridges;
         The expenditure distributionover Nationalroads is uniformwhile for provincialroads almost 70
         percent of the expenditure was for upgrading gravel and earth roads;
         A substantial portion ofthe budget (14 percent) needs to be spent on `Asset PreservationWorks'.
         These arise becauseroads were unsealedwith traffic levels below those that are economically
         justifiable. Thus, these roads should have beenleft as unsealedroads instead ofbeingpaved.
         There is abacklog of works that canbe done, mainly due to ahighnumber of economically
         feasible upgradingandrehabilitation works.
         Bridgerepair costs are estimated to beUS$4.6 million andreplacements US$15 million, with all
         replacements beingonprovincial roads.

The unconstrained budget analysis predicted that the average road condition would be remain near its
current level of 4.5 m/kmIRIover the 10 year period, but that the upgrading program would significantly
reduce the length of roads with access constraints.

Constraining the budget results in a significant drop in the number o f upgrading projects. The funds are
instead spent on less expensive preservation work (sealing, overlays and regravelling), rehabilitation, and
bridge repairheplacement. The road lengthwhich i s maintained changes, and this has an impact on the
long-term network performance. For example, with a 10-year budget o f US$230 m (50 percent of the
unconstrained), the averageroughness would increase to 5.2 m/kmIRIfrom the current 4.2 andthe bridge
works would behalved. Importantly, there would be many roads still suffering from access constraints.

The Table Al.6 below shows the results under a budget constrained to the level of fundingavailable for
the 4-year period of RMP2, i.e US$12 milliodyr, plus a margin o f about 25-30 percent. The proposed
RMP2 program i s thus about 33 percent of the unconstrained case, and the al1ocation.between National
Provincial roads remains similar as 65/35. "Maintenance Needs" will be defined as routine, periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation needs. "Access Restoration Needs" includes rehabilitation and upgrading
ofearth to gravel. The "road maintenance needs" may thus be defined as follows for RMP2:
                                                  US$ milliodyear

RMP2 Activities
Under RMP2 the R M S will continue to be institutionalized and applied at the MCTPC headquarters. The
existing Consultant's contract calls for annual visits to assist the MCTPC in preparing its annual plan as
well as for updating system parameters and other software support. To leverage the R M S three activities
should be undertaken by MCTPC.

PreDarationof Asset MananementPlan
The MCTPC will develop a formal asset management plan for the National and Provincial roads. Asset
management i s the combination o f management, financial, economic, engineering and other practices
with the objective o f providing the required level o f service in the most cost-effective manner. The key
elements o f asset management are:
     0  Considering the implications o f investments over a long-term time frame
     0  Cost-effective management
     0  Providing a defined level o f service
     0  Ensuringa sustainable use o f available resources

The steps involved inasset management typically include:
     0  Establishinga desired level o f service
     0  Planning for future asset requirements based on projected growth and service levels
     0  Collecting and maintaining asset data for monitoring the performance and condition o f assets
     0  Creating, operating and maintaining assets
     0  Assessing investment requirements for maintenance and/or improvements to ensure the optimal
        decisions are taken
     0  Accounting for assets and determining the true cost o f the services provided
     0  Reviewing and continuously improving asset management data, information systems and
        processes

The goals o f asset management are to:


                                                         22

     0   Assiscthe organization to achieve its strategic goals
     0   To meet the relevant legislative requirements andcustomer (Le., road users) expectations
     0   To minimize the asset life cycle costs while providing a specifiedlevel o f service

This is achieved by producing an asset managementplan which outlines the asset managementprocesses
and activities to be undertaken. This plan i s then monitoredand updatedas appropriate.

SystemSustainability
The MCTPC will ensure that the system is up to date interms of data. The 2003/2004 condition survey
will suffice for another 2-3 years so the focus should beon improvingthe traffic count data.

Management andMaintenanceofDistrictandRuralRoads

The Provincial Road Maintenance Management System (PRoMMS) is used to prepare the Annual
Routine and Periodic Maintenance Plan for the District and Rural Roads (DRR) and its bridges.
Maintenance costs and maintainable lengthestimates for year 2004- 2005 are based on the road condition
survey data for the DRR of seven provinces included in the Lao Swedish Road Sector Program 2
(LSRSP2), and road reclassificationestimates for the remainder of the network. The total DRRnetwork
i s 15,294 kmof which 3,848 km (25%) i s inmaintainable condition.

The costs used by PRoMMS for routine maintenance are labor-based, equipment-based or emergency
works which are set at 10% o f the routine maintenance cost. The periodic maintenance is based on actual
cost, calculated and adjusted for regional differences. Routine maintenance and periodic maintenance for
culverts and small improvement works as installation of culverts are included in the cost estimates but
those for bridges and large improvement works as raising embankments are not included.

An unconstrained analysis provided the total funding requirement for the maintainable DRR. As
presented in table A1.6, the total DRR maintenance and rehabilitation needs for the year 2004-2005 is
approximately US$2.56 million. The needs for a longer period for routine and periodic maintenance,
including emergency maintenance -10% of the routine maintenance, i s predicted by using an historical
annual increaseo f the maintainable DRRnetwork of 10% across the nation.

of the LRN. InFY 2003/2004 about US$200,000 was available for 18 provinceshones or US$11,000 per
province. A comparison between the unconstrained budget, assuming that the average road condition will
slightly improve over the 10 year period and the upgrading would reduce the amount o f people without
year round access, shows a large gap between the needs and the actual funding for maintenance.
Typically local sources should cover a significant portion of the expenses. This has been evaluated inthe
RMP2 options based in the asset analysis and a realistic approach to the sustainable conservation of the
LRNandpursuedincooperation with the LSRSP-2 andthe upcomingLSRSP-3.

Community Road Model.             A new model (CRM) has been developed under the LSRSP-2 for the
sustainable development o f basic access inrural areas. The CRM is the result o f an effort to integrate the


                                                         23

various mechanisms developed at the LRDfor managingrural access ina participatory manner. Planning
i s based inthe IntegratedRural Accessibility Planning (IRAP), Construction uses labor-basedequipment-
supported methods, maintenance procedures using Village Maintenance Committees (VMC) are
followed.

The CRM is applied in new construction or improvement and on existing DRRs. The steps to follow
include: a request from the community to the District CTPC for assistance, dialog and prioritization
through the Participatory Rural Transport Planning (PRTP) approach, implementation of the road works
by the VMC, handover andtraining, and annualroutinemaintenance works performedbytheVMC.

The CRM is currently triedout on apilotbasis insevenprovinces, with encouraging results since several
District and Provincial authorities have volunteered to participate in the model. The next steps are to:
promote and gain govemment ownership for the proposals before dissemination, clarify ownership of the
roads to enhance the buy-inof the communities into the model, and evaluate and refine the model and its
financial scheme. Scalingup would then take place inall provinces under a carefully crafted actionplan.
This is an ambitious undertakmg considering the multi-year efforts needed for capacity building in the
initial seven provinces. However, a national strategy for rural transport would facilitate implementation
and provide a framework for sustainability of the conservation of the DRR.

Integration of Road Management Systems. It i s important for MCTPC that the road
management approach is well integrated at bothcentral and local levels. The three management
systems outlined above all address separateparts o fthe road network management, and the
following outlines how the systems would operate ina complementary way, Le.:
   R M S will be used for strategic planningandbudget allocation for national andprovincial roads
   R M S will be used for programming ofpreservation works for national roads
   R M S will be usedfor budget allocations for provincial roads and will provide indicative programmes

Road Transport Management

Road Traffic Administration (RTA). Vehicle registration and inspection matters are the responsibility of
the Vehicle Management Division (VMD) of DOT, while the Road Traffic Safety Division (TSD) of
DOT i s responsible for driver license regulation and control functions. Both divisions work in
collaboration with the Transport Offices of the Provincial DCTPCs. In 2003 there were about 254,000
registered vehicles in Lao PDR, growing at about 9.3 percent annually. Fifty-five (55) percent of the
vehicles were registered in Vientiane municipality. A basic computerized system o f vehicle registration
and driver licensing was introduced in the Vientiane Municipality during 2000. The system is not fully
integrated and uses a fairly limiteddatabase, which lacks information on legacy vehicle records, annual
vehicle payments, compliance o f mandatory vehicle inspections, details o f heavy vehicles, driver safety
records, etc. Other provincial offices use manual recording systems.

Heavy Traflc Management (HTM). Overloading o f trucks has until fairly recently been a significant
factor responsible for rapid network deterioration. Limited axle load data available in2000 indicated that
around 96 percent o f all commercial vehicles carried loads exceeding legal limits. The Heavy Transport
Management Study (2000) undertaken during RMP1 preparation, proposed a program comprising: (i)
legislative amendments; (ii) axle load control system; (iii)
                               an                               institutional and policy actions; and (iv) an
awareness program. The program, largely adopted by MCTPC with support provided under RMP1, has
made good progress: (i)     the legal axle load limit was raised to 9.1 tons; (ii)  overloading fines were
revisedupwards, and contributed about US$230,000 (9 percent) to RMFrevenues during 2002-03; (iii)           a



                                                     24

Transport Control Division was formed within DOT,along with Transport Control Unitsinthe provinces;
(iv) the axle load enforcement program on the national roads steadily expanded from 14 (in 5 provinces)
to 27 sites (in 14 provinces) between 1999 and 2003, with the number of trucks being weighed annually
increasing from 76,000 to 241,000. Reports indicates that the program has resulted in a very significant
reduction in the incidence2 and severity3 of vehicle overloading. The weigh stations and weigh scales
financed under Phase-1 are expected to be operational by August 2004. Meanwhile, both Thailand and
Vietnam have moved to a 10 ton axle load limit. The international road transport regime affecting Lao
PDR could change significantly in coming years due to adoption of various multilateral agreements4,
currently under negotiation.

Road Safety (RS). The road accident rate in the Lao PDR is of the order of 17 fatalities per 10,000
registered vehicles. Road fatalities have risen sharply since the early 1990s, attributable to various factors,
including a sharp increase in the number of vehicles and inexperienced drivers on the road, as well as
increased speeds resulting from road network improvements. The annual growth in the number of road
accidents reported during 1998-03 was about 7 percent, down from 21 percent during the preceding 5
year period. Some 5,180 road traffic accidents (6,700 injuries and 430 deaths) were reported in 2003, of
which 58 percent occurred inVientiane Municipality. Initial estimates suggest that Lao PDR i s incurring
about US$ 13 million in annual losses due to road accidents. Inrecent years, as sections of the national
and provincial road networks have been improved, some rural communities have moved down from
remote mountain homes, and settled alongside the roadway edge. This exposes such communities,
particularly younger children, to significant risk.

Under the RMP1, MCTPC has procured equipment for traffic safety education and enforcement,
comprising vehicles, testing and audio equipment. In recent years (i)         DOT has entered into partnership
with an international NGO (Handicap International) to undertake a Road Safety Awareness Campaign
targeting young motorists; (ii)    received assistance through a UNESCAP project that has included staff
exposure to comprehensive accident data systems and training in accident analysis; and (iii)     undertaken a
road safety audit o f 80km on National Road 8, with Sida assistance. MCTPC has also prepared a multi-
year draft Road Safety Action Plan, with ADB assistance.The Plan, which is expected to be finalized this
summer, is divided into 15 areas of action, and follows a multidisciplinary partnership approach to
encourage all sectors to contribute to the reduction of road fatalities and injuries. Road Safety i s a policy
concern in the NPEP. Specific goals are the establishment o f a National Road Safety Council and the
introduction of low cost highreturn safety measures.

   LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC: RoadMaintenanceProgram(Phase 2)

OBJECTIVESOFPHASE2
Lao PDR's vision for the road sector i s to make the road network trafficable all year-round between the
center, the provinces and the districts in order to support production, distribution, provisions of services,
national integration and security. The strategy for accomplishing this vision was defined inthe "Strategic
Directions for the Development of the Road Sector" adopted by Lao PDR's MCTPC inJune 2000. The
Road Maintenance Program, established by the "Letter of Development Program" (January 10, 2001),
was designed to support key measures of that strategy with the goal of "the sustainable preservation of
road assets through the development and implementation of financing and road management systems".
The Program was structured in two phases to be implemented over nine years, from April 2001 to
December 2009, with support from donors operatingwithin a single common framework.

The first phases,focused on initiation and development, achieved the following: (i)     establishment of the
Road Maintenance Fund as a national financing mechanism based on recovering costs from road users
and direct financing of road works;        (ii)development ofthe RoadManagement System(RMS) for
planning the efficient allocation o f funds across all road networks and for programming preservation
works on national and provincial roads, and a complementary Provincial RoadMaintenance Management
System (PRoMMS) for programming maintenance and rehabilitation of local roads; (iii)           implementing
three annual programs o f competitively sourced periodic maintenance contracts on the National Road
Network (NRN), piloting maintenance contracts on the Local Road Network, establishing village-based
area contracts for routine maintenance; (iv) initiating effective vehicle loading control, including the
establishment of vehicle weight control facilities; and (iv) strengthening institutional capacity at the
national level and selectively at the local level infour Provinces.

Phase2: Project developmentobjectives andstructure
The second phase has the purpose of `Operation and Expansion', including: Scaling up of the road
financing mechanism to a sustainable level for meetingthe majority o f road preservation needs; operation
of systems to manage road maintenance efficiently; implementation of sustainable levels of maintenance
of the NRN; expansion of capacity for managing the LRNinall ProvincedZone; and expanded operation
of heavy vehicle loading control.

The following development objectives are set to support the strategic vision inthisphase:
(a)      National and local road assets are preserved to provide sustainable improved travel and access for
         road users and communities inmost areas countrywide; and
(b)      Sustainable financing and management of roads i s operational countrywide with improved
         institutional capacity at central and local levels inthe public andprivate sectors.

The Project is structured around these two development objectives intwo primary components and a third
supporting component, as follows:

    A.       Preservation of the Road Networks - supporting a balanced expenditure program of
             maintenance and rehabilitation of the road and bridge assets on the national, provincial,
             district and rural road networks, prepared with the assistance of the road management
             systemswhich facilitate an efficient use of the budget and achieve the performance targets of
             improved travel and access;

                                                       32

     B.     Capacity Building for the Road Sector - aimed at enhancing the institutional capacity of
            the central and local agencies, firstly intheir two core business functions, namely the efficient
            management and financing of the road and bridge assets and the effective operation and
            safety o f road transport, and secondly in equipping the agencies with adequate slulls,
            organization and facilities to operate ina business-like manner; and
     C.     Project Administration - aimed at efficient use o f the project resources, ensuring
            achievement of the development objectives, and strengthening cooperation.

Implementation Period.      Phase 2 (RMP2) will be implemented over four years from October 2004 to
September 30,2008, with a further six months duration of the IDA Credit and PHRD Grant to March 31,
2009. The road works fundingwill be spreadover four maintenance periods (MP-4 to MP-7), although at
about US$ 9 milliodyear this i s a lower rate than the RMPl average of US$ 11milliodyear, due to a 35
percent reduction in the available IDA allocation from US$35 million to US$22.65 million equivalent.
The full Program period will thus be 8 years, nine months shorter than the original RMP, which was
scheduled to cover nearly nine years from April 2001 to December 2009.

ComponentA. PRESERVATION OF THEROAD NETWORKS (US$59.1 million)

This component will support, on a programmatic basis, a slice of four Annual Work Programs (AWPs)
for Routine Maintenance (RM), Periodic Maintenance (PM) and limited Rehabilitation (Rehab) on the
National Road network (NRN) nationwide and on selected parts of the Local Road network (LRN)inall
Provinces/Zone countrywide. For the NRN, by supplementing the resources of the Road Maintenance
Fund(RMF)which will be recoveringan increasingportion of costs fromroadusers, the component will
help sustain the P M and Rehab program at about US$6.3 milliodyear, although this will still be well
below the sustainable level estimated to be about US$20 milliodyear. All RM will be financed by
counterpart funding, largely through the RMF.

For the LRN, the Project will supplement the resources of the GoL and the RMFfor PMand Rehab of the
Provincial Roads (PR), and will expand the program nationwide to US$3.5 milliodyear in all
Provinces/Zone, compared with the RMPl level o f US$1.3 milliodyear in selected provinces (Luang
Namtha, Luang Prabang, Champassak, Savannakhet, Phongsali, and Bolikhamsai). All RMo f PR will be
financed by local counterpart funding, with some contribution by the RMF and the remainder by the
provincial budgets. For the District and Rural Roads (DRR), maintenance and improvements on selected
sections would be supported by Sida, following the procedures established under LSRSP-2 inparallel to
RMP1, under proposed financing arrangementsthat are expected to be finalized byMarch 2005.

Al.     National RoadNetwork NJS$32.3 million)

Onthe NRN,RMP2will support: (i)        emergency works (accident removal, landslide clearing); (ii)  routine
maintenance works (vegetation control, clearing drainage, potholes patching, edge repairs, grading), (iii)
periodic maintenance works (regravelling, resealing, thin asphalt overlay, bridge repairs, road marking,
road signs); and (iv) rehabilitation works.(thick asphalt overlay and pavement reconstruction), under
various financing and implementation arrangements which relate to the type of works. These works will
cover roads as well as bridges.

Al.1 Routine maintenance NRN. Routine maintenance will be implementedon 100 percent of NRN
length annually, i.e. 7,140 M y e a r (98.1 percent was achieved in MP-3). Since emergency works and
routine maintenance works are recurrent innature, GoL will finance this sub-component entirely through
both the RMF and the consolidated budget, as for RMP1. Routine maintenance is procured through
village-based or equipment-based contracts.



                                                      33

Implementation Arrangements. The routine maintenance works on the NRNwill be implementedjointly
by the DOR-RADand the DCTPCs. Under the leadership o f the DOR-RAD,the DCTPCs will prepare,
procure and supervise the contracts.   DOR-RAD will prepare the annual work program based on
information submittedby the DCTPCs and monitor the implementationo f the program. All contracts will
be financed through the Road Maintenance Fund which will have the final authority in allocating
revenues, reviewing and accepting the annual work program and issuingpayment.

Procurement Arrangements. Experience under RMP1 showed that procuring the majority o f routine
maintenance works under village-based contracts was very successful, and 821 contracts covered 5,675
km(average 6.9 Wcontract) inMP-3 at an average cost of LAK 1.2 m i l l i o W y e a r (US$llO/km/year)
-typically, these contracts were negotiated from base rates.    NCB procedures were followed for 62
percent o f equipment-based contracts.   Similar procedures will be followed under RMP2 with the
following modifications. Based on nature o f the tasks, four types o f contracts based will be used: (i)
emergency works - carried out by medium size contractors through direct contract negotiations; (ii)
vegetation control, drainage cleaning and edge repairs - village-based contracts through direct contract
negotiations with various local communities, based on a daily wage "acceptable" to the communities
(currently estimated at about LAK 15,00O/day); (iii)potholes patching - carried out by small and medium

per year; and (iv) grading o f gravel roads - carried out by medium size contractors, through NCB
size contractors, through NCB procedures usingsimplified biddingdocuments - one contract per province

procedures using simplified bidding documents, one contract per province.       All the work would be
contracted out.

A1.2    Periodic maintenanceNRN. Regravelling of unpaved roads, resealing or thin asphalt overlay
o f paved roads, bridge maintenance and road safety works will be undertaken on about 1,800 km o f the
NRN countrywide.       Each AWP would typically include 1-2 contracts for road safety improvements,
including marking and traffic signage, and about 6 percent o f program value in bridge maintenance.
Contracts to be executed during the first year, MP-4, are identified and evaluated in Annex 4. The
selection o f contracts on the NRNwas based on the 10-Year Rolling Periodic Maintenance Plan prepared
usingthe RMS for the second phase o fthe RMP and evaluated usingthe Bank-endorsed HDM-4model.

Implementation and Procurement Arrangements.         The periodic maintenance o f the NRN will be
implemented by the DCTPCs under the guidance o f DOR-RAD. DOR-RADwill: (i)             prepare the annual
work program, using the R M S with the assistance o f PTD to identify the road subprojects, commencing
with the MP-5 (FY06) AWP; (ii)review the designs and procure specialized services for detailed
pavement investigationwhen necessary; (iii) provide prior review o f all procurement activities carried out
by the DCTPCs; and (iv) monitor the implementation o f the program. With the support o f the DOR-
RAD, the DCTPCs will prepare, procure and supervise the contracts. P M works for bridges will be
implementedjointly by the DOR-BMUand the DTCPCs, with the BMUtaking on responsibilities similar
to RAD for roads.       BMU will arrange for surveys, detailed investigations (when necessary), and
preparation o f designs and contract documents for P M works on bridges         through reputable firms
specializing in this type of work. The RADIBMUprior review responsibilities are described under the
Memorandum o f Agreement (MOA) between the MCTPC and the Province under Annex 12. All
contracts will be financed through the RMF which will have the final authority in allocating revenues,
reviewing and accepting annual work programs and issuingpayment. All contracts will be procured in
accordance with NCB procedures acceptable to IDA, similar to RMP1.

Financing Arrangements.       The IDA Credit will finance about 48% (US$9.l million) o f the periodic
maintenance program, disbursingat a rate o f 70 percent with counterpart financing o f 30 percent from the
RMF. Other donors will finance the remaining works at the same financing ratios under parallel
arrangements which are to be confirmed.         Consulting services provided to RAD/BMU for the
management o f the works on the NRNwill be financedby NDF at 100percent.


                                                   34

A1.3     Rehabilitationof NRN. An estimated 500 km of the NRNwarrants rehabilitationwithin ten
years. To assist in extending the maintainable length of network, up to 25 percent of the AWP budget
(equivalent to about 30 Wyear) may comprise rehabilitation works, amounting to about 120 kmunder
RMP2. Contracts to be executed during the first year, MP-4, are identified and evaluated in Annex 4,
based on the 10-Year RollingMaintenance Plan. DOR-RADwill provide for IDA'Sreview, starting 2005
(MP-5), awell-engineered and suitably packagedrolling program of engineered rehabilitationworks to be
implementedduring the project. Implementationand procurement arrangements will be similar to those
for Periodic Maintenanceon the NRN.

A2. LocalRoadNetwork(US$25.8 million)

Preservation o f the Provincial roads will be supported primarily by the IDA Credit under procedures very
similar to those for National roads, includingroutine maintenance implementedand financed by GoL, and
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation financed by IDA and GoL/RMF.            Provincial roads are in
generally poor condition and about 48 percent have severe accesdpassability constraints. For District and
Rural roads (DRR), all preservation works are proposed to be financed by Sida, following procedures
developed under the previous LSRSP projects, as adapted and integrated through the B.l Road
Management capacity-building component of the Project. The coverage will expand progressively from
the seven pilot provinces under Phase 1 to ultimately cover District and Rural Roads in each of the 18
Provinces/Zone by the endof project.

A2.1 ProvincialRoads(US$14.2 million).
(i)RoutineMaintenance. Routinemaintenancewillbeimplementedon100percentofthelengthofthe
Provincial roads annually, Le., about 6,475 Wyear. The DCTPC will prepare and procure the contracts,
and the District CTPC will supervise the contracts under guidance of DCTPC. The DCTPC will prepare
the AWP based on information submitted by the District CTPC and monitor the implementation of the
program.     LRD will also prior review the procurement activities carried out by the DCTPCs.
Procurement would be as for National roads, i.e., routine maintenance through village-based contracts;
emergency works through direct contracting; equipment-based pavement patching and repair through
small-medium sized firms and NCB; and grading o f gravel roads through small-medium sized firms and
NCB (ref, A.l.l). Overall at least 50 percent of the volume of work should be contracted out. Routine
maintenance and emergency works will be financed fully by GoL - for contracts fully or partially
financed through the RMF, the RMFAB will have the final authority in allocating revenues, reviewing
and accepting the annual work programand issuingpayment.

(ii)     Periodic Maintenance and Rehabilitation.        Periodic maintenance and rehabilitation will be
implementedon a total coverage of about 2,000 km or 30 percent of the Provincialroad network during
the Project. Periodic maintenance works will include regraveling o f unpaved roads, resealing or asphalt
overlays of paved roads, bridge repairs, and safety improvements. Rehabilitation works will include
upgrading of earth roads to gravel, and pavement reconstructionon pavedroads. About 25 percent of the
program may comprise rehabilitationworks, and up to 6 percent inbridge repairs. The program and cost
estimates will be identified through use of the Road Management System (RMS) by PTD and LRD at a
central level, and the DCTPC will review and verify the projects usingthe PRoMMS method. The works
will be procured, implemented and monitored by the DCTPC, with prior review and guidance by LRD.
Procurement will be through NCB inpackages inthe amounts o f US$O.lO to US$O.SO million. Financing
will be 70 percent IDA and 30 percent GoL, including up to 20 percent from the RMF (when the
regulations governinguses o fthe RMFfunds are adaptedto allow increased funding of local roads).

Procurement Arrangements. Considering the nature of the works, the contracts for Provincial roads will
be mostly executedby motorized equipment, and procuredthrough NCB or direct contracting. Inorder to


                                                    35

increase income and employment in rural areas, selected provinces will award some Labor-Based
Equipment-Supported (LBES) contracts where appropriate, each year. This technology requires the
contractors to favor and maximize the use of local labor over motorized equipment. Although the LBES
contracts under R M P l were successful only under limitedconditions, they shouldremain an option where
appropriate under RMP2.

A2.2 DistrictandRuralRoads@RR) (US$11.6 million).
Preservation works on the District and Rural roads will be managed under an integrated program of
routine and periodic maintenance, and improvement works, following the procedures established under
the LSRSP projects in the seven pilot provinces under RMPl and LSRSP-2. The routine and periodic
maintenance expenditures would be managed together under the Province Road Maintenance
Management System (PRoMMS) developed for managing the maintenance of local roads.

Routine maintenance of the DRR is expected to be implementedannually on the maintainable portion of
the DRRnetwork, i.e. 4,000 M y e a r . Rehabilitation and improvement works will cover about 1,800 km
over four years (MP-4 to MP-7). Preparation o f the work program will be based on operation of the
ProvinceRoadMaintenance Management System (PRoMMS) by the DCTPC.

For the DRR, the procurement arrangements for routine maintenance works would be flexible, based on
the experience from the parallel Sida-financed LSRSP-2.        It is envisaged that a mix of shopping
procedures, direct contracting with small contractors and force account will be used for routine
maintenance works. Where enough interested small contractors exist, shopping procedures will be used.
Otherwise, direct contacting with small contractors or force account by the district and/or village
authorities will be used. Efforts will be made to create small contractors and village road association
(Village Maintenance Committee) through provision o f tools, training and financial assistance (ref.:
LSRSP-11).

It is proposed that the DRR program be financed by Sida in a 50/50 cost-sharing arrangement with the
local governments, after any contribution which may come from the RMF. Details of these arrangements
will beworked out duringpreparation ofthe proposed Sida component.

A3.      ImplementationSupport (US$l.O million)

For Nationaland ProvincialRoads. Specialized contract administration, construction supervision, and
environmental and social monitoring consultants will be provided under RMP2 to support the DOR-
RAD/LRD/BMU, the DCTPCs and the District CPTCs, in implementation o f the road preservation
program, from the initial programming stage to supervision and monitoring. This includes supervision
and monitoring of the contractor's perfonnance on the safeguards and assistance to the Environmental
and Social Division (ESD) of DOR to perform its function under the Project. These consultants will
provide on-the-job training to relevant implementingagency staff.

For the LocalRoads. Specialized consultants will be provided under RMP2 to assist DOR-LRD with
the overall planning and supported by local consultants with the implementation, maintenance, evaluation
and capacity building and on the job training. These consultants would help the selected provinces
prepare detailed engineeringand bidding documents, and assist the procurement and the supervision of
the routine and maintenanceworks financed under RMP2.

ComponentB. CAPACITY BUILDING (US$10.1 million)

This will support the strengtheningof institutional capacity inMCTPC's two core business functions and
in various support functions, including those related to safeguards, at national and sub-national levels,


                                                    36

through technical assistance in: (i) Management and Financing; (ii) Transport Management
                                       Road                                      Road
and Safety, and development and implementation of a program of road safety improvements; and (iii)
Institutional Capacity Building, strengthening organizational functions and upgrading key business
processes, human resource development including results-oriented learning programs under a
decentralized framework, installation of information technology and communications network, provision
of office facilities and transport at district level, and strengthening of service delivery with increasing role
for the private sector.

B1. RoadManagementandFinancing(US$1.80million)

This sub-component aims to build capacity at central and Provincial levels for managing the regular
preparation of annual road preservation programs and budgets on all the road networks, through the
provision o f appropriate procedures and training-by-doing. The scope includes (a) the enhancement and
implementation o f sustainable procedures for planning, budgetingand implementing maintenance work
programs on roads andbridges on the National, Provincial, District and ruralroads, including community-
based approaches; and (b) Support for scaling up the RMF to a sustainable cost recovery level and for
establishing appropriate cost-sharing arrangements with Provincial and District agencies.

B1.l Road Management System Operation. Technical assistance will be provided to help MCTPC
make the planning procedures and the road management systems developed under Phase 1 fully
operational at the central level and in the Provincial DCTPCs, with enhancements as required. The
procedures cover the whole process of planning, preparation, implementation and monitoring, which are
involved in the management o f road assets (described in more detail in Annex 1). The three systems
developed include:
    (i)     Road Management System(RMS) - to be used for strategic planning, including estimation of
            road and bridge needs under various funding scenarios, allocation of preservation funds
            across the national and provincial road networks, and for the preparation of a 3-year rolling
            program and Annual Work Program (AWP) o f maintenance and rehabilitation works for the
            National road network including bridges, and an indicative AWP for provincial roads and
            bridges;
    (ii)    Province Road Maintenance Management System (PROWS) - to be used for the
            preparation of routine and periodic maintenance programs on the maintainable lengths (ML)
            o f Provincial, Districtand Ruralroads within a suppliedbudget.
     (iii)  Community Road Model (CRM) - a framework for managing rural and community roads
            through community-based activities, supported by DCTPC Districtoffices.

This activity will have a dual focus inboththe scope andthe implementingagencies, e.g.:
     (i)    At MCTPC, it will a) have a coordinating role, ensuring the integration o f the procedures so
            that all parts function well and produce a complete annual budget and program; b) further
            enhance the RMS, adapting it from lessons learned under the initial usage inFY2003/04; c)
            enhance the bridge management function in RMS; and d) develop procedures for each unit
            involved, such as PTD, RAD, LRD,BMUand ESD.
    (ii)    At the DCTPCs, it will - a) develop capacity to manage road information on the condition,
            traffic, structures and environment of the networks, to prepare routine and periodic
            maintenance programs and budgets, and to monitor and evaluate performance against
            specified indicators; b) establish the PRoMMS system in each DCTPC and provide training
            on the field surveys and operationo f the system; c) establish and support trial implementation
            o f the CRMmodel for the management of community roads.

It will support the organizational processes which are needed to make the road management function
perform well, through: (i)  reviewing the planning processesat MCTPC and confirming responsibilities of


                                                        37

different parties, when activities need to be undertaken, requiredoutputs, etc. (ii) establishing an `as is'
model of the MCTPC structure and operations reflecting current operations; (iii)     establishing a `to be'
model representing streamlined operations of the MCTPC and the devolution of key planning activities to
the Provinces; (iv) assisting the MCTPC and the Provinces to transition to the new model of operations;
and (v) determining the long-term data needs for planning, how data should be collected, the frequency,
and responsibilities.

B1.2    Road MaintenanceFund Support. Support for the Secretariat to the Road Maintenance Fund
would address: (i)   Assistance on scaling up the RMFrevenuesto a sustainable cost recovery level, and in
adjusting the structure of road user charges; (ii)   Improved business and operational procedures; (iii)
Enhancedtransparency and accountability of financial management; (iv) improvedpublic dissemination,
including publication of annual performance report on road sector and RMF program in the public
domain; and (v) Awareness-raising among road users. An individual consultant specialist would be
selected for up to six months of support. Fundingwould be provided for workshops or training visits to
exchange experience onroad fund managementwith other countries inthe region.

In addition, support would be continued through consultant services for the operation of the RoadFund
Secretariat for no more than a 2-year period, 2005-2006, untilsuch time as the review of the RMF, and its
organization and administration has been completed and implemented. Thereafter, the full costs o f the
Secretariat would be borne by the RMF.

Implementation and Procurement.         A consulting firm comprising international specialists and local
consultants, would be selected through QCBS procedures to provide all the B1.1 services and part o f the
B1.2 services. The firmthat was employed to develop and establishthe RMS has an ongoing contract for
providing intermittent support to PTD for operation and enhancemento f the system-this firmwould be a
nominated sub-consultant to the principal firm. An international specialist on the operation of road funds
and financing would be selected as an individual consultant to undertake the RMF review outlined in
B1.2.   The three current contract-based staff operating the RMF Secretariat would be retained as
individual consultants through December 2006, or such earlier time as the RMF review will have been
implemented.

B2. RoadTranseortManaPementand Safety (US$1.50 million)

RMP-2 will support strengthening of Road Transport Management and improved operation of traffic on
the road networks, through (i)    technical assistance designed to support the full scope of the transport
subcomponent B2; (ii)procurement o f more load control equipment; (iii)        construction o f more weigh
stations and laybyes on National roads; and (iv) implementingactions under the national road safety plan,
as follows.

B2.1 RoadTransportManagementand Safety. Technical assistancefor:
    (i) Improved Road Transport Administration - through consolidation of road transport
             administration responsibilities, improvements inbusiness processes, updating and integration
             o f current partly computerized systems o f vehicle registratiodrenewal and driver licensing at
             DOT and at Vientiane Municipality, and the expansion of these improved systems and
             procedures to the provinces;
    (ii)     Effective Heavy TransportManagement - update HTM strategy with a view to (i) the    sustain
             improved compliance with the legal load regime recorded inrecent years, and (ii)    expand the
             HTM program to cover additional high impact activities. These will include: effective
             operation o f the new weight control facilities built under RMP-1; development and adoption
             of a standard operating manual for axle load enforcement; training o f staff in operational
             procedures including data recording; establishment of a central database and data analysis


                                                     38

              capacity to improve targeting of gross offenders; piloting of operations at 1-2 weigh stations

              partnership with the road transport industry- to encourage self enforcement; improved M&E
              through the private sector; updating of the penalty regime to deal with repeated overloading;

              arrangements; fiscal measures to encourage gradual conversion to multi-axle vehicles; and
              phased harmonization of the legal axle load limits with neighboring countries; etc. RMP-2
              may also finance a limited expansion of the axle load control network to currently un-served
              border crossings and other sections of the national road network with significant heavy
              traffic. The final decision regarding this will be based on a detailed assessment of the
              operation of the load control facilities provided under RMP-1 by Dec 2005, by a HTM
              specialist satisfactory to IDA. The assessment will establish whether there i s a need for
              further expansion ofthe loadcontrolnetwork;
    (iii)     Support to selected aspects o f the National Road Safety Action Plan - This will include: (a)
              preparation of legislationlregulations concerning motorcycle helmets, drink-drive limits and
              speed limits to enhance safety by ensuring effective operation of the safety equipment
              procured under RMP-1, and provision o f additional safety equipment; (b) mainstreaming of
              road safety engineering audits within MCTPC, by building in-country audit capacity,
              developing a program of hazardous location improvements (to be implemented as part of the
              P M activities); and developing and implementing a community road safety education and
              awarenessprogramtargeting roadside communities along project reaches - particularly on the
              national roads; and (c) building up MCTPC capacity to effectively coordinate road safety
              activities supported by various donors, provide road safety training to road users, and
              supervise optimum utilization o f designated RMFrevenues earmarked for eligible road safety
              programs. The road safety subcomponent will be closely coordinated with the programs of
              other donors working on road safety issues, including ADB, which i s currently preparing a
              Road Safety Project for Lao PDR.

B2.2 Load ControlEquipment. Slow motion dynamic weigh scales, estimated at US$36,000 each,
will be installed at up to the two permanent weigh stations. Eight sets of mobile scales with all-weather
processing units estimated at US$19,000 per set will be provided6. Pick-up vehicles to transport the
mobile scales and motorbikes to monitor axle load compliance will also beprovidedunder activity B3.4.

  LAO PEOPLE'SDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC: RoadMaintenanceProgram(Phase 2)


Management Activities. Individual components will be managedby the relevant Division Heads inDOR,
DOT and the DCTPCs. The Project will be administered by the Project MonitoringDivision (PMD) of
DOR, which will have a coordinating role, act as secretariat of the PCC, and be responsible for overall
reportingrequirements and liaisonwith the donors.

Procurement and Implementation.            The responsibilities for planning, procuring, implementing,
supervising and accounting for civil works would be the responsibility o f the DCTPCs, under
coordination with DOR-RAD for National; with DOR-LRD for local roads, and PMD for equipment.
These arrangements and fiduciary requirements are detailed in a Memorandum o f Agreement (MOA) to
be signed between MCTPC and the Governor of each Province (similar to that for RMPl), to be a
condition o f effectiveness.

Implementation o f the programwill involve the followingorganizations:

Program Review Panel. Strategic review and oversight o f the Projectwill be provided through a Program
Review panel comprising key central and Provincial authorities which would be responsible for: results
on the development objectives of (a) sustainability of the maintenance process; and (b) decentralization
and capacity-building; financial resource mobilization including cost sharing arrangements, RMF
revenues and allocations; and (and) donor coordination. The panel would comprise the principal agency
heads, namely Vice MinisterMCTPC, Directors-General o f Roads, Transport and Personnel inMCTPC,
Director-General Department of Planning and Cooperation (DPC), Chairman o f the Road Maintenance
FundAdvisory Board, Director ofExtemalFinanceinMFA, andtwo ProvincialVice-Governors.

MCTPC. The MCTPC will implement the Project. It will be achieved in a manner to maximize capacity-
buildingthrough the use of existing internal resources and administrative structures. No special unit will
be created to manage the project. The Department of Roads (DOR), the Department of Transport (DOT),
the Department ofPersonnel (DP) andall MCTPCprovincialDivisions (DCTPCs) will be involved.

Project Coordination Committee (PCC). Primary management and coordination o f the Project would be
undertaken by a Project Coordination Committee (PCC), chaired by the DG Roads and comprising
Directors o f each MCTPC Division involved in RMP2, Head o f Secretariat of the RMF, and three
Directors o f Provincial DCTPCs (representing the 18 Provinces/Zone participating in the Project and
appointed on a rotating basis). The PCC would be collectively responsible for successful implementation
of the Project. Although the PCC would be large (about 20), this inclusive and participatory approach
functioned well for RMP1, and would be enlarged to include four DCTPCs on a rolling basis to ensure
broadrepresentation.

DOR-PMD. The Project Monitoring Division (PMD) was established to monitor the implementation of
all foreign-assisted projects. Therefore, this unit will have the overall project monitoring function and will
be responsible to report on all project activities. Inaddition, the PMD will have the overall responsibility
for achieving the procurement schedule, and assisting and facilitating procurement by individual
Divisions.

DOR-RAD. The Road Administration Division (RAD) will: (i)plan routine maintenance works of the
NRNusingthe RoutineMaintenance Management System(RMMS); (ii) andmaintainthe Bridge
                                                                              operate
Management System (BMS) for the NRN; (iii)prepare detailed designs and bidding documents for



                                                      46

periodic maintenance works on the NRN; (iv) provide technical guidance and training to the DCTPCs for
the procurement and day-to-day management of maintenance works on the NRN, including monitoring,
using the Monitoring and Evaluation System (MES); and (v) provide training to the local contracting
industry.

DOR-PTD. The Planningand Technical Division(PTD) will be responsible for developing, operating and
maintaining the Road Management System for the NRNand LRNincluding the location referencing and
inventory surveys, periodic road condition surveys, traffic surveys, traffic management system, road
database, and pavement management system. It will liaise with the Sida-supported PCU and Local Roads
Division (LRD)for the development aspects of the RoadManagement System for the LRN.

DOR-DD. The Disbursement Division (DD) will be responsible for the administrative and financial
management o f the project activities.

DOR-LRD. The Local Roads Division (LRD) will be responsible for identification of the maintenance
and rehabilitation AWP for Provincial roads eachyear, and for prior review o f the procurement activities
carried out by the DCTPCs for the periodic and routine maintenance of the LRN.

DOR-ESD. The Environmental and Social Division will be responsible for ensuring that: (i)those
affected by any sub-projects are compensated, resettled and/or rehabilitated in accordance with the
Resettlement Compensation Guidelines which have been updated duringpreparationo f RMP2. ESD will
provide an annual report on the environmental and social impacts of the works carried out under the
program and ensure all road maintenance works are at all times carried out in conformity with the
Environmental Guidelinesfor Road Projects in a manner which ensures that any adverse environmental
impact i s effectively mitigatedina timely and satisfactory manner.

DOT-TCD. The Department of Transportation - Transport Control Division (TCD) and its provincial
arms, the Transport Control Units(TCU) within the DCTPCs, will be responsible for the implementation
of the Heavy Transport Management Programcomponent of the project.

DCTPCs and Districts.The DCTPCs and their districts will: (i)     program and plan the maintenance works
on the LRN; (ii)   procure and supervise the maintenance programs on the NRN and LRN; (iii) to  report
DOR-RAD on the financial status o f the project activities that they will implement; and (iv) provide
technical assistanceto local communities involved inthe planning and delivery o f maintenance programs
on the LRN.

DP. The Department of Personnel will beresponsible for the preparation, implementationand monitoring
of human resource development activities financed by the project.

RMFAB and Secretariat. The Road Maintenance Fund will be managed by a Road Maintenance Fund
Advisory Board (RMFAB) and Secretariat which initially will report to the MCTPC Minister. The
Secretariat will consist o f a small team comprising a Secretary, an Audit-Review Manager, and a Finance
Manager that will manage the day-to-day operations o f the RMF.These staff will be hired locally under
local market conditions. For a limited period they will be assisted and trained by a highly experienced
consultant.

Sida-PCU Implementationand enhancement of a financing and management system for the LRNwill be
supported through the Sida-assisted Project Coordination Unit. Consultant services will be provided to
assist the DCTPCs, districts and villages in this regard. The Sida-financed consultants will also help the
DCTPCs and the districts prepare, procure and supervise maintenance works on the LRN financed by
IDA underRMP.


                                                     47

Financial management. Financial management responsibilities will remain under the Disbursement
Division within Department of Road. The current FM system will be continued, but with minor
modifications inthe reporting system, appointment of an independent auditor, and accounting procedures,
to meet acceptable standards. This systemwas assessedto be adequate inthe first phase of the project and
it has been gradually improved during implementation. Each Provincial DCTPC would operate a similar
FM system, and transfer accounting details to DD on a monthly basis. Funds flow would be through
three Special Accounts: (i)for MTCPC to cover share of eligible project expenditures other than RMF
activities; (ii) the RoadMaintenance Fund(RMF); and (iii) PHRD CofinancingGrant for capacity-
               for                                           for
building.

Environmental and Social Safeguards. Environmentaland social safeguards at the subproject level will be
monitored and supervised through the subproject administrator (DTCPC) while those at the Project level
will be monitored and supervisedby the Environmental and Social Division (ESD) o f DOR. Duringthe
preparation of the annual work program, the subproject administrator (RAD, LRD,DCTPC) will conduct
safeguard screening for the potential adverse impacts and if found and in consultation with ESD, take
appropriate actions to address them. ESD and DCTPC will be responsible for information disclosure and
consultation.

    LAO PEOPLE'SDEMOCRATICREPUBLIC: RoadMaintenanceProgram(Phase 2)

Summarv ofFinancialManagement Assessment

Country Issues. The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), carried out in mid 2002
concludedthat the overall fiduciary risk inLao PDR i s considered to be highdespite the fact that there are
elaborate built-in controls within the government financial management system. There is insufficient
transparency relatedto public finances and the general attitude towards fiscal discipline i s not strong. The
budget process i s not yet transparent and public access to government financial information i s limited.
These weaknesses are compounded by an inadequate awarenesso f modem practices of internal control in
the public sector. The government's decentralization initiative needs to be supported with a sufficiently
robust institutional framework that clearly defines the new responsibilities at lower levels. Technical
capacity o f staff at these levels needs to be strengthened. The oversight functions and the National
Auditor Office need improvements. The accounting and auditing profession and institutions remain
under-developed.        To address these deficiencies, the government has agreed to implement several
recommendations o f the PER and CFAA. The Financial Management Capacity Buildingproject and the
government initiative supported by ADB are expected to bringthe fiduciary risk to an acceptable level.

Strengths and Weakness. The financial management system of the country for the externally-funded
projects remains, in general, weak and needs substantial improvements. A major challenge of
improvements will involve the human dimension and financial management capacity, which include
several constraints such as; 1) the lack of skills in producing and understanding financial statements; 2)
the lack of resources available for financial management; and 3) the lack o f motivation and commitment
incomplying with the rules and regulations. The annual Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR)
also identifies similar issues and weaknesses, including: i)inconsistent and inadequate financial
management standards, procedures and software in each PIU; ii)delays to project implementation
resulting from management of Special Accounts by MOF; iii)delayed audit and lack o f consistent
external audit standards and procedures; iv) PIU accounting departments that have been poorly staffed
and equipped at start-up; v) poor internal control procedures and absence of internal audit in line
agencies; vi) lack of financial management capacity at provincial and district levels; and vii) inadequate
and delayed government counterpart funds contribution. However; these risks are considered to be
manageable due to the risk-mitigation measures which will be established in the project based on the
assessment o fthe FMarrangementsbelow.

ImplementingEntitv. InMCTPC, the structure for overall financial management functions remains the
same as for the first phase. The coordination of all foreign-funded projects inthe road sector is undertaken
by a the Project Monitoring Division of the Department o f Roads (DOR-PMD) of MTCPC. The
Disbursement Division of the same Department (DOR-DD), which supports all foreign-funded projects in
MCTPC, will support all the financial management activities o f the Project, including those undertaken
by the Department ofTransport, Department ofPersonnel, andthe Provincial DCTPCs. Since the system
i s integrated, it i s possible for management to manage investment by sector with information for the entire
sector and each specific project available inthe system. This integration also supports the production of
sector financial statements and audit.

The RMF continues to be responsible for managing the revenues collected through road user charges,
including making payments for eligible road maintenance expenditures in Provinces throughout the
country. Under the Project, the RMF will also be responsible for managingdonor funds to be disbursed
against road maintenance subprojects through separate Special Accounts designated for each donor,
including IDA, Sida and NDF. RMF uses the same accounting and financial management system as


                                                      49

DOR, with technical support from DOR-DD. Their FM capacity has been average for the three years of
operation to date, but several inadequacies can be identified and their staffing and overall capacity will
needto be strengthened to managethe considerable increase infunds flow over the period of the Project.

Funds Flow. IDA funds would be channeled through two US$ Special Accounts to be maintained
respectively by the MTCPC Department of Roads and the secretariat o f the Road Maintenance Fund.
Payments to recipients will be made according to component and funding source, as follows: (i)For
National road expenditures, by the RMF through the IDA RMF-SA and through an RMF sub-account in
the Province where the work i s executed; (ii) Provincial road expenditures, by DOR-DD from the
                                               For
IDA SA, by RMF through an RMF sub-account inthe Province, and by the Provincial Government; and
(iii) allotherexpenditures,byDOR-DDthroughtheIDAMCTPC-SAandfromtheMCTPCaccount
    For
for counterpart contributions.When the RMFi s authorized to finance Provincialroads, payment under (ii)
may be treated similarly to (i), would require adjustment ofthe allocation.
                                 which

Fundingof the RoadMaintenance Fund (RMF). Revenuesto the RMFinclude a fuel levy paid at the
border by the importer directly to the Treasury and transferred to the RMF, and road tolls and road fines
(for overloading) which are collected by Provincial DCTPC and paid into the RMF Provincial
subaccount. Revenues amounted to LAK 26.4 billiodyear in FY2002/03 and are estimated to be LAK
35.8 billiodyear in FY2003104; during the Project, they are expected to rise to LAK 85 billiodyear by
FY2007/08 (of which, LAK 63 billion would derive from the fuel levy if it is raised to 200 Kip/L by
October 2006, as planned).

Fundinp of the provincialgovernment Budpet for Road maintenance. The Provincial Govemments
receive budget transfers from the central Government based on sector programs and budget proposals
submitted and reviewed during the period from March to June each year. In FY2003/04, the road
maintenance budgets averaged LAK 77 billiodyear. Provincially-sourced budgets are relatively small,
except in `surplus' Provinces. Additionally, the RMF allocates 10 percent of annual revenues for the
maintenance of Local Roads, which i s transferred to the RMF Provincial subaccounts based on an
allocative rule which i s under review.

Staffing. DOR-DD are adequately staffed for supporting and managing the majority of MCTPC
expenditures, including externally-funded projects.     The current staff has adequate accounting and
financial management skills and experiences to support the project implementation. The RMF i s staffed
by an executive Director and one accountant, which is inadequate for supporting the substantial rise in
fundingwhich is anticipated and for addressingits ownweaknesses.

Accounting Procedures. The Financial Management and Administrative Procedures Manual, which
describes flow of funds, responsibilities and delegation of authorities, disbursement procedures, internal
controls, accounting system and financial reporting already exists and is applicable for the project.

The ACCPAC software i s being usedand the assessment of the software inthe first phase was considered
to be adequate and acceptable. However, the Financial Monitoring Reports and Annual financial
statements currently generated from the system need considerable revision in term o f the format and
configuration.

InternalAudit. DOR-DD will perform internal financial audits on the Provincial DCTPCs on a sample
basis in conjunction with training support. In general, the internal auditing process in MCTPC needs
strengthening, and improvements to FMcapacity will be one function o f the Project's Capacity Building
component.




                                                    50

External Audit. The latest audit report was audited by a local firm, which was not of acceptable
standard. Although the audit opinion was clean, the audit opinion and the financial statements were
incomplete and the report format was inadequate. Under the second Phase, the project i s requiredto
appoint an auditor acceptable to IDA, which may be for a multi-year term. The selection criteria should
be basedon the result ofthe Audit Peer Review, which IDA would carry out regularly and would produce
the list of acceptable auditors to MoF and departments. The sector financial statements with a separate
annex summarizing the use of IDA funds will be acceptable as long as the statements are audited by an
auditor acceptable to IDA.

Reportinv and Monitoring. All IDA-financed projects appraised from January 1, 2002 are requiredto
provide the Association with Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The format o f the reports will have
to be agreed with IDA duringNegotiations. The reporting format will be designed and discuss with IDA
whenproject design is finalized butbefore negotiation.

Informationsystems. The ACCPAC accounting software is customized commercial software whichhas
been installedin 14Provincial DCTPC's, the MCTPC and RMFunder Sida support duringRMP1. The
software would be installedinthe remaining4 Provinces under RMP2, namely Vientiane municipality
(requiringspecial adaptation), and Vientiane, Sayaboury and Xiangkhoang Provinces. The software is
currently operated on stand-alone computers. Under the B3 Institutional Capacity subcomponent o f
RMP2, the computer and communications technology throughout the MCTPC and DCTPC's will be
substantially upgradedincluding the installation of LocalArea Networks (LAN)insome offices whch
will facilitate better transmission o f dataand sharing ofdatabases.

Impact of Procurement Arrangements. The assessment of Overall Procurement Riskis considered to
be Average. The proposed frequency of procurement supervision missionby IDA'Sregional staff i s once
every six months, given that the procedures were established under RMP1, and includes annual
procurement supervisionfor post-review/audits. The threshold for Prior Review will be as follows
         0    All works contracts procured through NCB costing more than or equal to US$700,000 and
              the first contract of small works under price comparison for eachyear;
         0    All goods contracts procured through ICB and IAF'SO, and first goods contract procured
              through shopping;
         0    All consulting contracts costing more than or equal to US$lOO,OOO for firms, the first smaller
              consultant contract, and US$50,000 for individuals.

Disbursement arrangement. Disbursements from the IDA Credit will be made based on the traditional
system, that i s from the Special Account with reimbursements made based on full documentation and
against Statementsof Expenditure (SOE), and direct payments from the Credit Account.

Overall assessment and Action Plan. The financial management assessment was carried out during
preparation mission in April 2004, overall project financial arrangements were adequate and in place.
The RMP1 system is operating well. This system was assessedto be adequate inthe first phase and ithas
been gradually improved duringimplementation. The Disbursement Division which will carry on overall
project financial management activities has adequate capacity, skills and experiences. Under RMP2,
similar arrangementswill continue and the Project i s requiredto expand the financial management system
to the remaining four Provinces, strengthen the financial management capacity of the RMF and all
Provincial DCTPCs. Aspects requiring improvement include timeliness and format of reporting, capacity
at Provincial level with expansion o f the Project countrywide, and quality o f audits; and, inRMF, staffing
and intemal controls.

According to the assessment above, the risks are considered to be manageable due to the risk-mitigation
measurestaken including the following actions:


                                                      51

        (ii)upgradingofthefinancialmanagementcapacityoftheRMFbySeptember30, 2006onthe
              basis o f an institutional strengthening plan for RMF to be agreedwith IDA by December 31,
              2005.

Supervision plan. The supervision of the project will include close monitoring o f the FMrelatedaspects
implemented by the DOR-DCTPC's and RMF. Quarterly FMRs for both DOR-DCTPC's and RMF are
to be submittedto IDA within 45 days after the end of each quarter. IDA supervisioni s planned twice a
year.

2. Audit Arrangements

DOR will be responsible for ensuring that the annual financial statements are audited and forwarded to
IDA. The audit would be carried out by an independent auditor appointed under terms of reference
acceptable to IDA. As the audit environment inLao PDR has been classified as weak, a qualified private
international auditing firm shouldbe selectedto conduct the audit of the project accordingto international
auditing standards. This auditing firm would have to be acceptable to IDA and selected through a
competitive process following the World Bank's procurement guidelines. The contract may be multi-year
to facilitate efficient continuity.

The auditor will be required to express opinions on: (i) opinion on the projectlentity financial
                                                               regular
statements; (ii)  special opinion on the operation of Special Account and the SOE and appropriate use of
the project funds. The management letter addressing internal control of the project is required inaddition
to basic opinion on the financial statements. The audited financial statements and management letter will
be submittedto IDAwithin six months after the endo feachfiscal year.

3. Disbursement Arrangements

Disbursements from the IDA Credit will be made based on the traditional system, from the Special
Account with reimbursements made based on full documentation and against Statements o f Expenditure
(SOE), and direct payments from the Credit Account.

The proposed Credit will be disbursed against the project components shown inTable C. It is expected
that the proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed over a period of 5 years.

Use of statementso f expenditures (SOEs):

Some of the proceeds of the Credit are expected to be disbursedon the basis o f Statementsof Expenditure
as follows: (a) civil work contracts costing less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent each; (b) goods contracts
costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each; (c) service contracts for individual consultants costing less
than US$50,000 equivalent each and service contracts for firms costing less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent
each; (d) training and workshops; and (e) incremental operating costs.

Disbursements for services and goods exceeding the above limits will be made in accordance with
respective procurement guidelines and provisions in the Credit Agreement against submission of full
documentation and signed contracts.

The documentation supporting SOE disbursementswill be retainedby DOR duringthe life of the project
and one year after the receipt o f the audit report for the last year inwhich the last disbursement was made.
These documents will be made available for review by the auditors and IDA supervisionmissions.

 Special account:

To facilitate timely project implementation and credit disbursement, IDA funds would be channeled
through two US$ Special Accounts to be maintainedand managed respectively by the MTCPC DOR and
the secretariat o f the RMF. PHRD funds would be channeled through one US$ Special Account to be
maintainedand managedby the DOR.These accountswould be denominated inUS dollars. The MCTPC
Project Special Account (MCTPC-RMP2-SA) would have an authorized allocation of US$1.10 million,
with an initial withdrawal o f US$0.5 million equivalent to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and
deposited inthe SA, which would be increased to the authorized allocation when the amounts withdrawn
from the Credit totals SDR 2.0 million equivalent. The MCTPC PHRD Special Account (MCTPC-
PHRD-SA) would have an authorized allocation of US$0.4 million, with an initial withdrawal of US$0.25
million equivalent to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited in the SA, which would be
increasedto the authorized allocation when the amounts withdrawn from the Credittotals US$l.O million
equivalent.   The RMF Special Account (RMF-SA) would have an authorized allocation o f US$2.0
million with a full initial withdrawal. The Special Accounts should be replenishedon a monthly basis to
assure liquidity o f funds or when the account i s drawn down by 20 percent o f the initial deposit,
whichever comes first.      All replenishment applications will be accompanied by reconciled bank
statementsfrom the depository bank showing all transactions inthe Special Account.

At negotiations, the Association notedthat two special accounts for other projects inthe Ministryof
Finance had unresolved issues, and includedinthe legal agreementsprovisions that allocations to the
RMP2 SA'Swould not be made available untilthe issues hadbeen resolvedsatisfactorily (details are in
the Minutes ofNegotiation, June 4,2004).

  LAO PEOPLE'SDEMOCRATICREPUBLIC: RoadMaintenanceProgram(Phase 2)

A. General

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the
provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different expenditure categories
are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the Credit, the different procurement
methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan.
The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

Procurement of Works:Works procuredunder this project would include: (i)         Periodic maintenance and
rehabilitation works on about 2,000 km of National roads and about 2,000 km o f Provincial roads
(amount o f US$32.3 million); (ii)  Routine maintenance works on about 7,100 kdyear of Nationalroads
and 6,500 kdyear o f Provincial roads (US$9.6 million); (iii)    Construction o f about 2 vehicle weighing
stations and about 7 laybyes (US$0.48 million); and (iv) Construction of about 92 District offices
(US$l .lmillion). The procurement will be done usingNational standardbiddingdocuments agreedwith
and satisfactory to the Bank. The NCB documents used by MCTPC and the DCTPC's were prepared
under the previous Third Highway Improvement project (THIP), updated under RMP1, and are usedby
all donors inthe road sector. There will be no ICB procurement o f works. N o procurement i s carried out
by communities.

Works: about US$53.1 million(LAK 5.06 billion) includingcontingencies

National Competitive Bidding (NCB). All periodic maintenance and rehabilitation contracts on the
national road network (NRN), amounting to between US$0.14 million and US$1.0 million for a total of
US$25.05 million including contingencies, will be procured through National Competitive Bidding
(NCB) acceptable to IDA. NCB procedures are favored over ICB procedures becausethe small value of
these contracts i s unlikely to attract foreign competition. However, foreign contractors will not be
excluded from participating. Between20 to 30 contracts per year will be executed with an average size of
about US$0.25 million. The contracts to be executed duringthe first dry maintenance season are defined
under Annex 9. About 61 percent ofworks (US$15.3 million) will be financed by IDA at 70 percent and
GoL (RMF) at 30 percent, and the remaining 39% would be funded by ADB and NDF under proposed
cofinancing at the same financing ratios.

All periodic maintenance contracts on the localroadnetwork (LRN),inamounts betweenUS$70,000 and
US$600,000 for a total o f US$14.2 million including contingencies, will be procured through NCB
procedures acceptable to the IDA. NCB procedures are favored over ICB procedures but foreign firms
will not be excluded from participating as for National roads. About twenty (20) contracts per year will
be executed giving an average value of US$O.lO million. The contracts to be executed duringthe first dry
maintenance season are defined under Annex 9. The works will be financed by IDA at 70 percent and
GoL at 30 percent (expected to be 20 percent RMF and 10percent Provincial budget).

The construction of the 92 District offices estimated at a total o f US$1.1 million including contingencies
will be procured through NCB procedures.         Fourteen (14) contracts varying from US$35,000 to




                                                    54

US$90,000 with an average of US$78,000, one in each selectedprovince, will be executed. The works
will be financed by IDA at 70 percent and GoL at 30 percent.

Routine maintenance works amounting to US$9.6 million including contingencies will be financed fully
by GoL andprocuredusingdirect contracting, shopping or NCB according to the nature ofthe tasks, e.g.:
(i)Vegetationcontrol, drainagecleaningandedgerepairswillbepackagedinmanysmallvillage-based
contracts -procured through direct contract negotiations with various local communities, basedon a daily
wage acceptable to the communities (currently about 15,000 Kip/day), involving about 800 contracts/year
each for about 5 M y e a r and $500/year per contract, usingabout 70 percent o f the budget; (ii)
                                                                                               emergency
works will be carried out by medium-size contractors - procured through quotations obtained and
evaluated from at least three qualified contractors with award to the lowest priced responsive bidder, or
by direct contract negotiations, involving about 5 contracts/year and about 20 percent of the budget; (iii)
Pothole patching and equipment-based work will be carried out by small and medium size contractors -
procured through NCB using simplified bidding documents acceptable to IDA, involving about one
contract per province and about 5 percent of the budget; and (iv) Grading o f gravel roads will be carried
out by mediumsize contractors - procured through NCB usingsimplifiedbiddingdocuments acceptable
to IDA, involving one contract per province and about 5 percent of the budget. All the routine
maintenance work will be contracted out. The works will be financed at 100 percent by GoL (fully
through RMFon National roads, and mainly through RMF on Provincial roads).

The construction of 2 permanent axle load control stations and the 7 laybye sites will beundertakenunder
about three contracts o f equal value for a total o f US$0.48 million including contingencies. Considering
the small value o f these contracts, National Competitive Bidding(NCB) procedures will be used. Foreign
contractors will not be excluded from participating. The works are proposed to be financed by NDF at
70 percent and GOL at 30 percent.

Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include: (i) 7 mobile vehicle
                                                                                    About
weighing scales (US$0.25 million); (ii)   Various items of road safety equipment (USSO. 17 million); (iii)
Information and communications technology, including computer hardware and software, computer
peripherals and accessories, computer communication networks, specialized computer application
software (US$l.lO million); (iv) About 52 utility motor vehicles (US$0.53 million); (v) About 200 light
motorcycles (US$0.27 million); and (vi) Office equipment (US$O.10 million). The procurement will be
done using the Bank's SBD for all ICB and National SBD agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank.
Intemational shopping will be used for some o f the road safety items. Local shopping will be used for
most of the office equipment.

Goods: about US$2.24 million, including contingencies.

International CompetitiveBidding (ICB) procedures would be used to procure goods with an estimated
cost of more than US$lOO,OOO equivalent, i.e.: (i)    mobile weighing scales totaling.about US$0.25 million
(financed by IDA at 100 percent); and (ii)     a package of information and communication technology,

communicationnetworks, specialized computer application software (US$l .10 million) (financed by IDA
comprising computer hardware and software computer peripherals and accessories, computer

at 100%).

International Shopping procedures in accordance with Articles 3.5 and 3.6 o f the Guidelineswould be
used to procure goods with estimated cost less than US$lOO,OOO per contract. This would comprise: (i)
road safety equipment totaling about US$O.17 million (proposed to be financed by NDF at 100 percent);
and (ii)other goods (faxes, photocopiers, office supply goods), totaling about US$O.lO million, to be
financed by IDA at 90 percent ina maximumof 4 packages, for efficiency purposes.



                                                      55

United Nations Inter-Agency Procurement Office (IAPSO).           All vehicles (motorcycles and 4-wheel
drive pick-up vehicles), totaling about US$0.80 million, will be procured through the United Nations
Inter-Agency Procurement Office (IAPSO). All vehicles will be financed by IDA at 100 percent of
foreign expenditures, 95 percent of ex-factory expenditures or 90 percent o f local expenditures.

Selection of Consultants:Procurements include:(i)     Provincialimplementation support (US$1.O million);
(ii)Road management and financing capacity-building (US$1.80 million); (iii)Road transport
management and safety (US$0.60 million); (iv) Institutional capacity building (US$ 1.70 million); (v)
Project monitoring (US$0.30 million); (vi) Financial audit (US$0.05 million); and (vii) Technical audit
(US$O.lO million).     Short lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO
equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines.

Quality and Cost BasedSelection (QCBS). Consultingassignments amounting to US$4.8 million will be
procured using Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method. These assignments include: (i)         A.3,
implementation support to the national and local roads works; (ii)B.l, advisory services for road
management and financing capacity building; (iii)   B.2, advisory services for road traffic administration,
heavy traffic and safety; and (iv) B.3, advisory services for organization and business process
improvement, and private sector strengthening.

Least-Cost Selection Method. Consulting Services for financial auditing services with an estimated
contract amount less than US$lOO,OOO (amounting to about US$0.05 million including contingencies)
will be financed by IDA at 88 percent. Because of,theirroutine nature, non-complexity and small size,
these services will be procuredusingthe Least-Cost Selection Method.

Selection of Individual Consultants. One consulting assignment for advisory services to project
monitoring will be based on Selection of Individual Consultants based on consultant qualifications
(amounting to US$0.3 million including contingencies). This method is favored because the contract is
small.

Training, workshop and study tours (US$1.70 million) will be financed by PHRD at 100% for a first part
inthe amount ofUS$1.10 million, andbyNDFat 100percent for a secondpart inan amount ofUS$0.60
million, and procured according to normal business principles. A detailed Annual Training Plan o f
activities includingcost estimate will be submitted eachyear to IDA for prior review.

OperatingCosts: About US$0.40 million (LAK 4.2 billion)

Incremental operating costs relatedto project implementationactivities, including supervision field visits;
vehicle rental, fuel and maintenance; office supplies and project-related meeting travel expenses, but
excluding Government officials' salaries, would be financed by IDA on at 40%, and procured according
to normal business principles.

Others:

The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well as model
contracts for works and goods procured, are presented in the Project Implementation Plan, prepared by
MCTPC, cleared indraft at Project appraisal, and issued infinal form by Project approval.

B. Assessment ofthe agency's capacityto implementprocurement

Procurement activities will be coordinated and facilitated by DOR-PMD and carried out by various
implementingdivisions (RAD, LRD, PTD, PMD inDOR), DOT-TCD and DCTPCs (Provincial Branches
of MCTPC). For road works, the Director o f each DCTPC would be responsible for procurement under
guidance and review from RAD (for National roads and weighing stations) and LRD (for local roads).
For goods and consultants' services, the Deputy Director-General DOR would be responsible for
procurement through a committee comprising Directors o f PMD, RAD, LRD, PTD and PAD of DOR,
DOT-TCD, and DOP, facilitated by PMD. The procurement function i s staffed by engineering staff in
central and provincial level of MCTPC, most o f whom are civil engineers with either national or overseas
university training but only some o f whom have had procurement training. Under RMP1, most of the
procurement capacity and support came from DOR-RAD and PMD; under RMP2, this capacity will be
broadenedthrough training and support.

An assessment o f the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions for the
project has been carried out by Chinnakorn Chantra, Procurement Specialist from COSU in EASCM on
May 25, 2005. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for implementingthe project and
the interaction between the project's staffresponsible for procurement Officer and the Ministry's relevant
central unit for administrationand finance.

The overall project riskfor procurement i s Average.

Summary of ProcurementCapacity Assessment. World Bank procurement accredited staff carried out
an assessment of the implementing agencies and units. The assessment (available in project files) was
discussed and agreed with the implementing agency MCTPC from May 21-25, 2004. The main findings
are as follows:

     0  Overall, capacity o f the implementing units involved with procurement i s "fair" and the
         associatedrisks are inthe "average1'category.
     0  Procurement of all consultancy services and goods financed by IDA will be undertaken by
        respective implementingunits with assistance and facilitation by DOR-PMD. DOR-PMD has
        benefited from direct technical assistance by experienced foreign consultants under past and
         ongoing Bank-financedprojects. Most of the staff are civil engineers, with experience inproject
        management and sufficient proficiency in English language to handle international procurement
        procedures. However, due to turnover of staff, the current staff inPMD have limited experience
         with WB procurement for goods and consulting services. Therefore, it is noted that procurement
         skills of this unit still need strengthening, and an intensive training course in WB
        procurementkontract management for goods and consulting services shouldbe provided to PMD.
     0   InaccordancewithGoLdecentralizationpolicy, mostoftheprocurement activities for workswill
        be undertaken by the DCTPCs which are the provincial branches o f the central agency MCTPC.
         The DCTPCs represent a higher risk. The DCTPCs began to handle procurement for World
         Bank-funded activities under the previous ThirdHighway Improvement Project (THIP, Cr. 2943)
         and on-going Road Maintenance Project (RMP, Cr. 3481). Initially their capacity was quite
         weak, but after four years of experience inhandling NCB under THIP and RMP, the performance
         has improved. To mitigate the risk and to improve their performance, all procurement activities
         carried out by the DCTPCs have been under the direct monitoring o f DOR-RAD for NRN and
         DOR-LRD for the LRN, which prior reviews all important steps in the procurement process.
         This has allowed smooth implementation under the RMP, and similar arrangements are planned
         for the proposed RMP-2. RAD and LRD have benefited from direct technical assistance by
         foreign consultants under Sida and World Bank-THIP and RMP on procurement, contract
         administration for civil works assignments. Their capacity i s good and they represent a low risk.


                                                    57

         Since similar technical assistance i s planned under the project, their performance should remain
         good.
    0    Construction of the vehicle weighing stations would be procured through NCB procedures by
         Traffic Control Division (TCD) in DOT. This unit has some experience with the WB
        procurement procedures for construction of the weighing stations under RMP, but only with the
         substantial assistance and advice o f DOR-RAD. Therefore, similar arrangements for RAD
         assisting TCD in procurement of the weighing stations shouldbe planned and adopted for RMP2.
    0    The NCB documents usedby MCTPC and the DCTPCs are acceptable to the World Bank. They
        were developed under the THIP and RMP. All donors in the road sector are using the same
         documents. For better understanding by the contracting industry and the local supervising staff,
         the documents have beentranslated into the Lao language.
    0    The Government's current public procurement regulation is the very recent Prime Ministerial
         decree no. 03PM issued on January 9,2004 and the current IRR no. 0063MOF dated March 12,
         2004. The new decree marks a significant step inthe evolution of the procurement process inthe
         country, introducing a competitive process and various reforms that result in part from Bank
         assistance since 2002. Following a Bank review on June 2, 2004 it was determined that the NCB
         procedures in the new regulations were acceptable to the Bank, and thus no Supplemental Letter
         or Annex is requiredina Project legal agreement.
    0    Areas requiring improvement include: (i)     contract management, including claims and dispute
         resolution records; (ii)consolidation and availability of procurement laws, regulations and
         directives; (iii)
                        bidevaluationreports; and (iv) staffing knowledge andexperience.
    0    Mitigation measures to address the risks include: (i)   easy access to World Bank procurement
         specialists based in Bangkok and Vientiane; (ii)intemal and external training (e.g.: Asian
         Institute o f Management in Manila); (iii)provision of specialized consultants with excellent
         procurement knowledge and experience; (iv) a detailed PIP including operational guidance with a
         chapter on procurement should be provided by effectiveness; (v) a procurement staff in each
         DCTPC, DOR-PMD, DOR-RAD, DOR-LRDand DOT-TCD shouldbe identifiedby negotiation.

C. ProcurementPlan

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation which identifiesthe
procurement process and schedule for each Project activity. The first 18-month Procurement Plan,
covering the period July 2004 to December 2005, was developed duringappraisal and agreedbetweenthe
Borrower and the Project Team on June 4, 2004. The Plan is available in the PIP and DOR-PMD, and
will also be available in the project's database and the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan
will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project
implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

D. Frequencyof Procurement Supervision

Inaddition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity assessmentof
the ImplementingAgency has recommended supervision missions once every six months to visit the field
to carry out post review ofprocurement actions.

EconomicAnalvsis.

The economic evaluation of the Project focused on the road preservation component which comprised 84
percent of the Project cost, of which $32.3 million (46 percent of Project cost) i s amenable to quantifiable
economic analysis. The analysis was performed on the first year's work program comprising $9.71
million.

The economic benefits derive from savings invehicle operating costs, including savings in fuel, vehicle
maintenance and travel time, computed over the life cycle period of road maintenance and expressed in
present value. These were computed through the HDM-4 model adaptedto the Lao PDR roadnetwork.

The economic evaluation for RMP2 was made using the MCTPC Road Management System (RMS),
implementedinlate 2003 under RMP1, supplemented by the HDM-4' model applying conventional cost-
benefit methodology. Data for the analysis was collected during January-March 2004 through surveys
undertaken by local consultants over most of the national and provincial road networks. The data
comprised: road condition (visual surface condition and measured roughness); bridge inventory and
condition; traffic volume; truck overloading; and socio-economic data.

The unitcosts for the different works activities are giveninTable A9.1.

The vehicle operating costs were calculated using the default vehicle characteristics as used in the RMS.
These characteristics are given inthe Table A9.2.




The HDM-4analysis considered a range of maintenance treatments. These were selected to be consistent
with the R M S analyses, but with some limited refinements. The analysis had two components: (i)                        a
capital investment in the first year and (ii)     a long-term maintenance strategy which applied afterwards. In
all cases the reference case was a `do nothing' strategy, consisting o f routine maintenance only. Table
A9.3 shows the strategies used inthe analysis.

4-vear Rolling Preservation Program. The R M S was usedto derive an unconstrained needs assessment
for the national and provincial networks over a 10 year plan period*. The unconstrained needs including
preservation and upgrading works averaged about US$30 milliodyear for the national network, and
US$17 milliodyear for the provincial network. Bridge works accounted for about 10 percent of these
needs. The unconstrained preservation needs averaged US$21 milliodyear for national roads and US$
8.6 milliodyear for provincial roadsg, a total of US$ 29.6 milliodyear. This was followed by a budget
constrained network analysis, undertaken separately for the national and provincial roads, at about 34
percent o f the unconstrained fundinglevels.

Table A9.4 indicates the conditions for the road network at the end of a 10-year period, predicted by the

The budget constrained analysis helped MCTPC*developa 4-year rolling preservation program covering
national roads (US8.2 million'year) and provincial roads (US$4.7 million'year), which i s about 43% of
the total unconstrained preservation needs.

Details of the 2004-05 Work Program (MP-4). For the National Road network, the budget constrained
analysis using the RMS helped identify a long-list of candidate roads for periodic maintenance and
rehabilitation. These roads were then analyzed with HDM-4, plus a multi-criteria approach (MCA) which
considered the economic, poverty and environmental dimensions", to come up with the final list of road
works for inclusion in the 2004/2005 work program (MP-4). These are indicated in Table A9.6, along
with their cost, Net PresentValue (NPV) and internalrate ofreturn(DUX).

The planned investment activities can be placed into three broad groups: (i) with a positive NPV
                                                                                those
which are economically justified using HDM-4; (ii) which are not justified using HDM-4 but are
                                                       those
required to prevent the paved road asset deteriorating to the point with a major investment would be
required (called 'Asset Preservation Works' (APW) by the MCTPC); and (iii)safety works.
Rehabilitationworks have been capped at 25% of the total cost of periodic maintenance andrehabilitation
per year.

Table A9.6 shows 20 km of roads without NPV or IRR values. These roads were selected as requiring
'Asset Preservation Works' (APW). APW activities are requiredwhen a road has deteriorated to the point
where further deterioration will render it un-maintainable, or requiringa major re-investment to improve
the condition. Conventional cost-benefit analyses with HDM-4, based on consumer surplus methods, do
not identify these roads as beingeconomically justified for improvements. The R M S applies a minimum
level o f service or access standardinthis instance to ensurethat maintenance i s performed.

For the provincial road network, a multi-criteria approach was applied to the long list of road sections
identified through the budget constrained network analysis, to come up with a prioritized list o fprovincial
roads for consideration under the project. While finalizing the list o f provincial roads for periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation works during 2004/2005 (MP-4), the lengthof roads within the 'budget-
surplus' provinces was restricted, to provide an increased share to the budget-deficit provinces, with
significant unmet road preservation needs. The final list of road preservation works planned on the
provincial network during2004-2005 i s indicated inTable A9.7.

The first year provincial program consists mostly of re-gravelling (732 km 99% o f total length), and
                                                                                -
only 7 km (1%) of upgradingto gravel roads. Because of the M C A approach, upgrading sub-projects get
postponedto later years.

The overall results for the entire 2004/2005 program are summarized inTable A9.5. The
program has a very higheconomic retum which is typical of such periodic maintenance and
rehabilitationprojects.

Note: For re-gravelling, the RMS analysis generates highNPVIC ratios, as the traffic on many provincialroad
sections is rather high, and the re-gravelling cost is low (compared to the benefits). The highNPVIcost for (gravel)
road construction/ rehabilitation is due to the calculation o f suppressedtraffic, where distance to market and hence
the benefits has a significant influence. Roads inthe program have distance to markets o f the order o f 20-30km.
This approach to the analysis will be reviewedandrefinedifneeded for MP-5.

Fiscaland Financial Analvsis

Introduction. The purpose o f this analysis is to evaluate the fiscal impact o f the Project and the Road
Maintenance Fund (RMF) on GoL finances and the sustainability o f the proposed road maintenance
financing arrangements. The analysis takes into account: (a) the Government's current fiscal situation; (b)
sector related expenditure, revenue and the resources required to maintain road assets; (c) revenue
mobilization that will result from the program; and (d) the fiscal and financial aspects o f the RMF. In
particular, the analysis aims to assess the ability of the RMF to play a greater role in funding road
maintenance, both duringand after the project.

Government Revenue and Expenditure Review. Since 2001, the Government of Lao PDR revived its
public expenditure reform, inrespect o f both expenditure policies and allocations, as well as inrespect o f
public expenditure management processes. With the share o f revenues in GDP stagnating, and arrears
accumulating, the spending choices are becoming more challenging in order to achieve the country's
poverty reduction objectives. Phased payment o f arrears i s needed, as i s a better balance between
recurrent and capital expenditure. Table A9.8 shows the fiscal operation o f the government for FY 1998-
2004. Lowered revenue for FY2002/03 was due to the reduction in tax revenue and timber loyalties.
Current expenditures have declined from the peak o f 10.2 percent o f the GDP in FY1995/96 to 7.6
percent in FY2002/03. On the other hand, capital expenditures have taken the majority share o f the
government resources. Therefore, more assets have been generated without adequate resources for
upkeep, leading to even more capital expenditure needs in the future. The government aims to gradually
reverse this trend starting in FY2003/04 when the share o f current expenditure rises to 8.8 percent o f the
GDP.

        The FY 2001102 data in Table A9.9 show an increase in actual spending shares for the social
sectors, especially health and education: health expenditure rose from 3.7 percent o f total spending in FY
2000/01, to 5.0 inFY 2002/03; education went from 7.4 percent to 10.7 percent. InFY 2002/2003, it was
estimated that the budget allocation for health would further increase to 5.9 percent, the education share
lowered to 10.0 percent of total spending. The budget allocated for the Ministry o f Communication,
Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) has returned to about the FY 2000/01 level (21.1 percent in
FY 2002/03) after itwas cut to 16.0 percent inFY2001/02.The approvedMCTPCbudget for FY2003/04
called for US120 million12or 43.7 percent o f the total government budget13.

Road Sector Revenue and Expenditure. Expenditure by the national and provincial governments
through MCTPC fell from 22.8 percent of their total outlays in 2000/2001 to 15.7 percent in 2001/2002.
The fall intotal expenditure through MCTPC of 21.5 percent between these years compared with a 13.9
percent rise in total government outlays. Over the period 1996/1997 to 2000/2001, capital expenditure
through MCTPC was an average of 63 percent o f all central government capital outlays. In 2001/2002,
capital spendingby MCTPC fell by 59 percent innominal terms, with the share falling to 29 percent of all
central government capital spending.

These fluctuations have been less evident in expenditure on roads in recent years, as indicated in Table
A9.10. Spending on national roads fell in 2000/2001, and then remained relatively steady for several
years before a budgetedrise of 82 percent in 2003/2004. The latter rise was led by a substantial increase
in central and provincial government outlays and a more modest rise in external financing. The rise in
outlays was especially strong for maintenance o f national roads.

Government spending on roads i s substantial by comparison with revenue generated by road users. Most
o f the revenue secured from motorists is directed to the Government's general revenue. The fuel levy,
road tolls and overloading fines that are directed to the RMF for expenditure on road maintenance and
rehabilitation are expected to be only 13 percent o f total revenue obtained from motorists in 2003/2004.
Even so, total revenue obtained from both general and specific imposts on motorists are markedly lower
than expenditure on roads; for example, for the years 2002/2003 and 2003/2004, total revenue generated
from motorists of US$47.2 million i s less than a third o f total infrastructure expenditure o f US$148.1
million, and i s less than government outlays from domestically generatedrevenue.

This reinforcesthe needto increaseuser chargeson motorists to: (a) generate additionalrevenueto ensure
that necessary maintenance is undertaken to sustain assets developed through past investment; and (b) to
encourage motorists to make travel decisions that reflect the costs they impose on governments from their
use of the road system. It also emphasizesthe needfor a greater focus on maintenance of current assets.

RMF FinancialMechanismsand Sustainability. Given budget constraints, the Government has had
difficulty generating sufficient additional funding for roadmaintenance or reallocatingfundingfrom other
sources. Accordingly, the Government established, under the RMP1 project. The RMF became
operational in2002, with fiscal 2002103 being its first full year of operation. The RMFwas endowed with
revenue from: (a) a new levy on fuel (set initially at LAK40 per liter, and raised to LAK 60 per liter on 1
October 2003); (b) redirection and enhancement of previously limited revenue from road tolls; (c)
redirection and enhancement o f previously limited revenue from fines imposed on overloaded vehicles;
(d) a new annual surcharge on heavy vehicles to reflect, inpart, the damage they cause to roads; and (e)
new fees on international road traffic transiting the country. The latter two fees have not yet been
implemented. Revenue from the first three has risen markedly, from US$O.9 million in the first partial
year (8 months) of operation to an expectedUS$3.4 millionin2003104.

The principal source of revenue o f the Fund i s the levy on fuel. The current levy o f US$0.006 per liter
compares with other the total value of other taxes (import duty, customs excise and turnover tax) of
US$O.114 per liter for regular gasoline. The levy i s expected to generaterevenue o f USSl.7 million inthe
2003/04 fiscal year. The Government committed to raise the levy by 50 percent per annum during the
term o f RMP1. Only one of the two increaseswas achieved, with the missedincrease beingattributable to
general economic circumstance in the country
at the time it was due in October 2002. The        I       FigureA9.1- Cost of regular gasoline
Government has indicated that it will commit to            0.50
increasing the levy, to LAK 100 per liter on 1             0.45
October 2004, LAK 150 per liter on 1 October           8   0.40

decline inthe resource cost of fuel would allow
a compensating the RMF fuel levy without
increasing the retail price of fuel.

The RMF is currently collecting tolls at 28 locations in 16 provinces. In2002/03, the cost of collecting
the tolls was 24 percent of the revenue raised, though this i s expected to decline to 22 percent in2003/04.
The Government has indicatedthat it will examine its toll collectionpolicy inan effort to increase the net
revenue yield from toll collection. This could include a combination of increasing tolls and not imposing
tolls where the revenue i s low compared to the collection cost.

The program o f inspecting heavy vehicles to detect overloading initiated under RMP1 has been
successful, both in terms o f reducing the share of vehicles that are overloaded and generating income
from fines. Extensionof this programunder RMP2 should further discourage overloading, though success
indoing so will reduce the opportunity for a substantial rise infuture income from this source. While the
cost o f the inspection program is high with respect to the revenue raised (36 percent of revenue in
2002/03), the program yields other benefits to the RMF by way of avoiding excessive road damage and
thusreducingfuturemaintenanceobligations.

A rise in the fuel levy to LAK 300 per liter in 2008/09, the year after completion of the RMP2, will
endow the RMFwith sufficient revenue to be able to sustain the average level o fmaintenance expenditure
undertaken during the project. Forecast income and expenditure for the RMF with the RMP2 and other
current and anticipated projects i s shown inTable A9.12.

It is expected that transit fees will be imposed on international traffic passing through Laos inthe future.
While the fees are not expected to generate substantial income because of the likely limited amount of
transit traffic in the term of the project and constraints imposed by protocols on taxation o f through
traffic, they will serve to avoid distortions caused by the potential for such traffic to pass through the
country without purchasing fuel and therefore contributing to the upkeep o f roads. Implementation of
these fees will be advanced in the course o f consideration of tolls for National Road No. 3 that will link
China and Thailand via Lao PDR.

The project will include technical assistance to support the RMF to develop its capacity to manage the
projected buildup in its activities and to further develop the system o f user charges. The former will
include consideration o f staffing, accounting, auditing, information systems, roadworks programming,
and the relationship of the RMF to MCTPC.Development o f the system o f user charges will address: (a)
introduction o f a registrationcharge (inthe place o f the heavy vehicle surcharge) for all vehicles as part o f
a balanced road use charging system that complements the fuel levy and which should further supplement
the resources o f the RMF; (b) optimizing the use o f road tolls; and (c) formulation o f appropriate fees for

   LAO PEOPLE'SDEMOCRATICREPUBLIC: RoadMaintenanceProgram(Phase 2)

Summary. A strategic assessment of the potential impacts of RMP2 was conducted and a Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA) was prepared. Based on the lessonslearned from RMP1, the mitigation
activities are designed to: (a) prevent or mitigate the adverse social and environmental impacts of project
works, including ensuring adequate disclosure and consultation; (b) facilitate mainstreamingof safeguard
procedures and guidelines; (c) enhance capacity of the Environment and Social Division (ESD) of the
Department o f Roads and the Ministryo f Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC);
and (d) identify priority programs to improve DOR capacity to address the safeguard issues. Fundingfor
the activities have been providedunder the Project. Effective execution of the mitigation plan will ensure
that the Project meets with the requirements o f the Bank's safeguard policies and will also significantly
increase DOR capacity to address the environment and social issues related to road development. This
will also demonstrate DOWMCTPC commitment towards sustainabledevelopment o froads.

LessonsLearnt from RMPl

Compliance with theBank Safeguard Policies.
Safeguard category and arrangement. In RMP1, the project was assigned a category B since it was
assessed that the project had few environmental or social risks associated with it. Environmental issues
associated with the project were deemedto be temporary and localized innature. Mitigation measures for
maintenance activities are known and if applied in practice would eliminate most environmental risks.
The maintenance programwas only be on existingroads, the incremental inducedeffects were assessedto
be minimal. The assigned environmental category was deemed to be consistent with Bank practice and
was fully consistent with Annex B o f GP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment.

No separate environmental assessment was prepared because of the nature o f impacts as well as the
programmatic nature of the Credit. It was proposed that ESD will screen all the maintenance activities to
ensure that no adverse impacts occur and will oversee the implementation, including submission of the
monitoring report. An Environmental Guidelines for Road Projects (EGRP) was prepared and considered
as a plan to mitigate the potential negative impacts on the environment. Although land acquisition and
relocation were not expected, as a safeguard measure, a Resettlement and Compensation Guidelines
(RCG) was also prepared in cases where land acquisition and resettlement may be required. Given an
understanding that ADB will provide technical assistance to ESD, there was no budget allocation from
RMPl to ensure effective implementation of the guidelines or to buildcapacity o f ESDand MCTPC.

Social safeguards triggered. For RMP1, no specific triggering of the Bank's OP 4.12 on Involuntary
Resettlement and OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples (Ethnic Minorities) was reported. The maintenance
works have been conducted along existing alignments and have not involved any resettlement. There was
one case on land acquisition where a small plot o f land was required. Review o f documents and records
confirmed that the RCG was satisfactorily applied. With regard to ethnic minorities living inthe vicinity
o f the project area, there does not appear to have been any specific concerns that have arisen which relates
directly to any particular ethnic minority group that has required the development o f an Ethnic Minorities
Development Plan or Strategy. Issues raised by local communities were observed to be adequately dealt
with by the project guidelines relating to resettlement standards, environmental protection, and the
contractual provisions imposed on contractors. Experience from pilot provinces generally reflects the fact
that project impacts are not ethnic group-specific but relate to all communities inthe project area.

Implementation constraints. Limitedcapacity of ESD and the lack o f budget allocation for the safeguard
supervision and monitoring are identified as key implementation constraints, and the issues will have to


                                                      73

 be seriously addressed. Awareness and understanding o f project managers and field engineers on the need
 to ensure full compliance with the safeguards i s also weak. While specific requirements to mitigate the
 environmental and social issues are included inthe contracts, no records on monitoring and supervision i s
 available. Capacity enhancement on environmental and social safeguards monitoring at the local level in
 all 18 provinces represents a substantial challenge inthe second phase o f the Program. There i s also need
,to ensure that the environmental and social requirements are fully integrated into DOR's operational
 procedures. It i s the responsibility o f MCTPC (not only ESD) to ensure effective implementation o f
 potential negative impacts at all stages (planning and pre-construction, construction, and operations).

 Improving. regulaton, framework. Despite the weaknesses discussed above, it is recognized that
 significant improvement has been made in the area o f regulations both at National and MCTPC levels.
 The Government i s currently processing enactment o f the RCG, including a policy to address the issue
 related to ethnic minority, to be part o f the body o f national regulations. Within MCTPC, a ministerial
 regulation on EA procedure has been established and ESD i s under a process to develop guidelines and
 procedures to facilitate effective execution o f this regulation. ADB technical assistance will assist ESD
 and the national environmental agency (STEA) in the preparation o f the guidelines related to the EM
 process, including consultation and training.

 Impacts and Needsfor Improvement
 Social impacts. Generally, positive impacts along improved roads was observed. This was evidenced by
 villagers moving closer to live alongside the road and benefiting from better access to social and
 economic services. Reports o f positive impacts were corroborated by villagers and by mass party and
 civil society organizations, such as the Lao Women's Union and Lao Front for Reconstructionthat have
 representatives at the village and local levels.

 Besides improved access to markets and services which have helped in poverty alleviation, RMP1 has
 provided employment and income opportunities and skills generation through the routine maintenance
 contracts provided to villagers working on project roads. These village road maintenance contracts are
 much sought after. Given the limited length o f roads and the many villages living alongside, only some
 villages have been able to benefit from this important source o f supplementary income.

 Other social concerns raised during supervision o f the RMP1, which are not o f a specific safeguards
 policy-relatednature, include:
         0        Impact o f construction camp activities such as collecting timber for fuel or utilizing
                  materials from rivers usedby villagers;
         0        Formerly isolatedvillagers who have moved closer to roads lack awareness o f safety and
                  other road user issues arising from the infrastructure;
         0        Project team's lack o f knowledge o f languages and cultures o f some ethnic minority
                  groups living along the road leading to less sensitivity to their concerns and needs;
         0        General concerns about the increased volume o f traffic using improved roads and safety
                  issues arising from speeding vehicles;
         0        Failure by the authorities to strictly implement right-of-way regulations has led to
                  villagers setting up their houses close to the edge o f roads. This raises issues o f safety as
                  well as possible problems with landrights and access;
         0        Ensuringthat villages can benefit equitably and fully fi-om routine maintenance contracts
                  and to avoid concerns over possible inefficiencies or leakages; and
         0        Lack of monitoring on the social and economic impact o f the project at local level.

 These concerns are being addressed by the set o f preparation studies being undertaken for RMP2 and the
 new project activities aimed at strengthening safeguards management capacity and improving public



                                                       74

information disseminationand consultation. Giventhat activities of RMP2 will cover all the provinces in
the country, as a safeguard measure, a framework for Ethnic Minority Development Policy (EMDP)
would be necessary.

Environmental impacts. Although adverse impacts are not observed, a number of issues were raised
duringthe supervision of RMP1and the Bank safeguardreview for RMP2. Main concerns are relatedto
management o f borrow pitdquarries, potential impacts on natural habitats and other sensitive areas,
compliance performance of the contractors, and capacity o f ESD and field engineers to supervise and
monitor the safeguards. Locations and extraction methods of many borrow pits and quarries are not
environmentally appropriate. Ifthe project sites are located near the protected area, natural habitats, and
other sensitive areas, the negative impacts during maintenance operations can be significant. There are
also concerns on health impacts due to dust re-suspension,road safety, HIV/AIDs and other issues related
to the improved road conditions. Many of the local roads inRMP1 and RMP2 are earth or graveled ones,
resultingina highlevel o fdust exposure to villagers livingalongside the roads.

To reduce the impacts during maintenance operations, compliance performance of the contractors should
be ensuredand capacity of DTCPC and ESDmust bebuilt.Specific guidelinesor criteria for execution of
the maintenance operations inthe sensitive areas (ecologically and socially) should also be developed and
effectively applied during the RMP2. To reduce the impacts due to extraction o f natural resources,
treatment o f borrow pitdquarry sites, MCTPC should provide clear guidelines regarding to acceptable
locations, extraction methods, and closure conditions, at least for the RMP activities.

A separate study is beingconducted on heavy traffic management androad safety, and the results of the
study will provide recommendations on enhanced safety measures (sign, speed control, fencing,
elimination o f black spots, enforcement, etc.) as part o f RMP2 work. To reduce the problem of dust re-
suspension, efforts should be made to incorporate the dust suppression measures into the subproject
design and dust impacts on human health should be periodically monitored. At the same time, efforts
shouldbe made to improve road safety given due attentionto increase awarenessand cooperation o f local
communities. MCTPC should also work closely with the provincial/local authorities and the local
communities to ensure compliance with the road law regarding the right-of-way management and road
safety. It i s also important to increase awareness and understanding o f stakeholders on other key social
and environmental issues, especially on HIV/AIDS, gender, and protection o f natural resources,
biodiversity, and natural habitats.

Public Information and Compensation
According to RMP1, the implementing agency would ensure that all districts and villages are properly
and in timely fashion informed of the road maintenance activities to be carried out. The implementing
agency was also to ensure that the provisions of the Guidelines, including the Resettlement and
Compensation Guidelinesspecifying eligibility and entitlement principles, are effectively disclosed to the
population living along the roads targeted by the project by means o f a public information campaign.
Communities along the roads targeted by the project were to be consulted by means o f ad hoc meetings
regardingtheir priorities and needs inmatters of roadmaintenance.

During supervision, it was observed that while dissemination of information on the project had taken
place at the level o f the district and provincial development committees in which village leaders
participated, this activity was constrained by a shortage o f staff and resources to carry out the information
dissemination and consultation exercise more effectively at village and community level. This
shortcoming has been addressed through inclusion of this requirement in a technical assistance contract
for supervision o f safeguards.

Actions to be Carried Out for RMP2

Safeguard screening and information disclosure.
Safeguard category. For RMP 2, it has been assigned a "Category B" since it i s the second phase of the
maintenance program, and will only take place on existing roads and not undertake any new road
construction. MCTPC proposed to apply the EGRP and RCG similar to those applied to RMP1 and
publicly disclosed its intention to comply with these guidelinesinRMP2 inthe nationalnewspapers(both
in Englishand Lao language). Given the countrywide nature of RMP2 and the lesson learnt discussed
above, ESD (assisted by consultants) has conducted a strategic environmental assessment of the potential
negative impacts for RMP2, include development o f a safeguard screening process (details are given in
Section IV, ESSF) to avoid unexpected adverse impacts of the subprojects. The screening process has
been conducted for the subprojects identified in the 2004-05 Annual Work Plan (AWP) and will be
applied to all the subproject involved civil works. As part of this effort, a Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA) report has been prepared for RMP2 (see Section 3.2 below). The SEA report will be
submittedto STEA for endorsement and will be disclosed to the public.

The issues related to the project impact on some ethnic minorities have received greater attention. ESD
assisted by consultant has also conducted a social assessment which will propose ways and means of
enhancing positive impacts and mitigating negative ones. The study has been undertaken using
participatory and inclusive approaches where data on vulnerable stakeholders and their views on project
impacts will be collected to guide the design of improved safeguard measures. A framework on Ethnic
Minority Development Policy (EMDP) for RMP2 has been developed and will be used as a basis for
development of the Ethnic Minority Action Plans (EMAP) when deemed appropriate. The EMDP will
also be disclosed to the public. Through the safeguard screening process, the concerns on ethnic minority
for the subproject with ethnic minority groups who are less assimilated into the mainstream of national
life and who may require special attentionto their needs, can be identified and appropriate actions can be
undertaken through the development of an Ethnic Minorities DevelopmentPlan or Strategy.

UDdated guidelines. It has been recognized that maintenance operations may potentially affect the
environment in a number of ways, but most of them are localized, short-term, and mitigate-able. A no
maintenance policy has created adverse environmental implications and i s considered not an option. The
EGRPusedfor RMP1providedtechnical recommendations and appearedto focus only on the mitigations
o f impacts that may occur during the maintenance operations (construction phase). The EGRP has been
updated to address the impacts due to the improved road access and to include the needs for consultation,
information disclosure, and close supervision and monitoring of the contractor performance and the
quality of the environment and natural habitats as appropriate. A number o f standard operational
guidelinedmanuals appropriate for each type of contracts have also been prepared to facilitate effective
application o f the EGRP. Given limited experience in using the RCG and EMDP, updated of these
guidelines i s considered not necessary. However, operational guidelinedmanuals will also be established
duringthe implementationofRMP2.

To ensure willingness to comply with the safeguard requirements by the contractors, MCTPC proposed to
consider the safeguard compliance performance during the bid prequalification and/or evaluation process
and to include it in the performance bond arrangement. Training will be provided to increase the
knowledge and awareness o f site engineers and the contractors to ensure effective implementation o f the
guidelines.

The EGRP, RCG, EMDP, andthe SEA report will be made available (both inEnglishand Loa languages)
to both the public and the project staff. Details on the operation procedures or guidelines and specific
criteria, including monitoring and reporting requirements, will be developed as part o f an action plan for
implementationof mitigation activities.

Mitigation Plan (SEMP) and Implementation Arrangement
SEMP. Based on the lesson learned mentioned above, a mitigation plan has been designedto achieve the
following objectives: (i)improve MCTPC performance on the implementation of the mitigation
measures, (ii)  improve capacity of ESD to supervise and monitor the effectiveness of the guidelines and
mitigation measures, (iii)improve consultation and cooperation with local communities and local
government, and (iv) build capacity of MCTPC to address the safeguard related issues. Key elements
include, (a) application of the ESSF to all the subproject involving with the civil works, (b) measures to
ensure effective implementation of the guidelines and policy frameworks (EGRP, RCG, EMDP, and
ESSF), (c) capacity building of ESD, (e) capacity building and mainstreaming o f safeguards into DOR
operational procedures, and (f) activities and programs to increase participation o f local communities and
local authorities, especially inthe areas related to road safety, right-of-way management, HIV/AIDSand
other healthimpacts, and protection o fbiodiversity, natural habitats and other naturalresources.

Implementation arrangement and budget. Under RMP2 and for periodic maintenance o f national road, the
RoadAdministration Division (RAD), inconsultation with the provincial offices (DTCPC), i s responsible
for identification and preparation o f the subprojects to be implemented under the annual work program.
RAD is also responsible for preparation of bid document while DTCPC will evaluate the bid and make
recommendation for the winner. RAD will review the evaluation result and make recommendations to
MCTPC for approval. DTCPC will sign a contract with the winner, monitor, and supervise the execution
o f the contract. RAD and DTCPC appeared to be the administrator o f these subprojects. For routine
maintenance and those related to local road and other small civil works (office building and weigh
stations), the road administrators can be LAD,DTCPC, etc.

On safeguards, RAD and other road administrator, in consultation with ESD, will be responsible for
conducting the ESSF and inclusion of the safeguards requirements into bid document. DTCPC, in
consultation with ESD, will be responsible for consultation with key stakeholders (contractors, local
government, local community) and ensure commitment of the contractors, including supervision and
monitoring of contractor's performance. ESD will provide the technical and operational guidelines and
provide training to the project staff. ESD will also take the lead in the implementation o f other programs
and activities of the mitigation plan, including ensuring close coordination among various donor agencies
withrespect to the environment and social issues.

Givenexisting and future workload o f ESD, it i s necessaryto provide technical assistance to ESD to (a)
ensure effective supervision and monitoring of the Project safeguard performance, (b) ensure adequate
consultation with local community and authority, (c) facilitate mainstreaming o f safeguards into DOR
operations, and (d) conduct pilot studies related to construction resource mapping, community inventory
in the road right-of-way, and related social activities. A budget of US$O.l5 million for a specialized
consultant to conduct (a), (b), (c) is included in the Project (subcomponent A3). A draft TOR for this
technical assistance has been prepared and will be finalized as soon as possible. Under the Capacity
Buildingcomponent, trainingand capacity buildingactivities will also include those relatedto safeguards.
A separate budget of about US$0.25 million has been allocated from this component for the specialized
consultants to carry out pilot studies identify in (d) above. Funding from these activities will come from
PHRD grant and TORSfor these studies will beprepared as soon as possible.

It is anticipated that additional assistance on the environment and social aspects will be providedthrough
other financing agencies (ADB, Sida). Sida has expressedits willingness to provide a fund of about US$1
million for the capacity buildingand special programs/studies related to social aspects, especially on local
community participation, HIV/AIDS, and gender. Details o f the Sida program will be finalized in early
2005.

Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (ESSF) for RMP2

Obiectives. The ESSF aims to ensure that (a) the Project activities do not create or result in serious
adverse impacts on the local community and environment, @I) the mitigation plan i s carried out
effectively, and (c) possible complaints fi-om the local government authorities and community are
minimized. The ESSF has been developed based on the lessons learned during supervision of RMP1 and
it may be modified or revisedwhen necessarywith close consultation with the Bank.

Strategies. To achieve these objectives, the following actions will be undertaken:

         0       All proposed subprojects will be screened by ESD through the screening process
                 described below and the results will be documented and properly kept for review by the
                 Bank.
         0       Appropriate mitigation measures will be included in the bidding document (BD) and
                 contract document (CD); compliance with these measures will be monitored, and the
                 resultswill be documented and properly kept for review by the Bank.
         0       ESDwill supervise andmonitor the overall activities andprepare a semi-annual report on
                 the application of the EGRP and RCG guidelines and other frameworks and action plans
                 during the planning, design, and construction phase of the project.       ESD will also
                 develop the reporting requirements and procedures to ensure compliance of the
                 contractors; conduct public consultation and public awareness programs, and carry out
                 periodic training for field engineers and contractors as appropriate. A semi-annual report
                 on the implementationof the guidelines will be submitted to the Bank.

Assumptions. The screening i s based on the assumptions described below. If this i s not the case, the
Bank should be informed and consulted.

         a       The main civil works to be carried out under RMP2 will be limitedto activities typically
                 defined as routine and periodic maintenance (resurfacing and bridge repairs; flood repairs
                 or emergency maintenance; regular upkeep o f safety features and road signs, etc.) and
                 small rehabilitation works to strengthen the road, repair structural defects, restore the
                 road to its initial condition, make small changes or improvements to alignment, and small
                 construction of drainage and footpaths. If large-scale rehabilitation works are involved,
                 DOR will inform theBank before proceeding with the contract.
         0       The works will be carried out within the existing right of way (ROW) and will not
                 involve relocation and land acquisition. If land acquisition and relocation i s needed, the
                 Bank will be informed, and the Resettlement and Compensation Guidelines (RCG) will
                 be applied.
         e       The project-related impacts are site specific; few of the effects are irreversible; and
                 appropriate mitigation measures can be developed and implemented by the contractors
                 and MCTPC.

Screening procedures. It shouldbe notedthat this screening process i s not intendedto prohibit DOR from
carrying out maintenance-related works in sensitive areas but is meant to ensure that proper mitigation
measures are prepared and carried out effectively to avoid adverse impacts on the affected population,
natural environment and cultural heritage. Ifthe subproject i s located in or near protected areas or other
critical habitats or cultural property, an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for the subproject will
be prepared and carried out in close cooperation with ESD and other concerned agencies and in
consultation with the Bank. The civil works contracts for office building and construction of weigh

                                      Annex 11:CapacityBuilding
  LAO PEOPLE'SDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC: RoadMaintenanceProgram(Phase 2)

Lao stakeholders recognize that achieving financial sufficiency in the maintenance o f the Lao road
network will require more than just policy change; financing the development o f competent Lao
organizations inthe public and private sector and skilled Lao professionals i s also necessary to ensure a
maintenance culture. This emphasis on nurturing national capacity i s therefore a major focus of this
project.

The project has three major components, all of which embody Capacity Building interventions. For the
purpose of this project, capacity i s seen as a means to an end and for this reason it does not feature as a
higher order outcome inand of itself. Capacity enhancement constitutes a set o f intermediate results to be
achieved under the project and which contribute to the higher order outcomes. (see Results Matrix in
Annex 3)

The project takes an integrated view of capacity building,as shown in Table A11.1depicting three levels
of capacity. This approach takes account of the role of institutional incentives("rules of the game" which
constrain organizational competencies), the critical functions of key organizational actors which have to
produce specific project related outputs, and the individual skills necessary to achieve target levels of
organizational performance.

At the institutional level, the Capacity Building strategy is predicated on continued linking of road
maintenance financing to cost recovery from users through the road maintenance fund and clarity in
decentralization policy. Progress indicators focus on specific organizational competencies which will
feature inthe capacity building interventions.

At the individual level, specific training programs will be identified inthe Capacity Buildingstrategy to
underpin the development of organizational competencies. The aim is to go beyond measuring the
numbers of people trained to assessing impact of training on performance and integrating into a human
resource development strategy for the overall organization.

The institutional capacity building subcomponent (B2.3) has five elements which integrates a resource
perspective on organization capacity (facilities and technology) with a functional view which supports
key business processes. Cofinancing arrangements which support this component are aligned with this
integrated perspectiveon organizational development.

A key feature o f monitoring and evaluation arrangementsfor capacity buildinghas beenthe client driven
assessment, undertaken during project preparation, of baselines in key functional areas. This assessment
also includes client target performance levels prioritized by the MCTPC and DCTPC which should be
attained inthe course o f the project implementationand which shouldbe linkedwith project outcomes.

The emphasis on developing national capacity to solve problems and perform functions has also led to
project interventions supportingthe increasedrole of local institutions including Lao consultants, training
institutions and transport industrycontractors inproject implementation.
