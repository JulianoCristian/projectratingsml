1.
Country and Sector Background
The World Bank has nearly ten years of partnership with Lao PDR in the transport sector.  RMP
-
2 is the second and concluding phase of the Road Maintenance Program (an Adaptable Program 
Loan (APL)) which builds u
pon the initial Road Maintenance Project (RMP: Cr. 3481
-
LA; SDR 
19.2 million), and follows a previous series of investment projects including the First, Second 
and Third Highway Improvement Projects (Cr. 2218; SDR  32.1 million; Cr. 2606 ; SDR 21.8 
million
; and Cr. 2943; SDR 34.6 million).  All projects have been implemented satisfactorily, 
and the Government has requested continued IDA assistance.  
The Government has made a strong start towards achieving sustainable maintenance of the road 
system, as sho
wn by the establishment of the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) in 2001 and the 
successful implementation of three years of maintenance programs with support from the Road 
Maintenance Project.  The RMP
-
1, supported by a parallel financed Second Lao
-
Swedish Road
Sector Project (LSRSP
-
2), strengthened the technical and managerial capacity in the Ministry of 
Construction Transport, Post and Communications (MCTPC) and in selected provincial 
Departments of Construction Transport, Post and Communications (DCTPC).  The
 approach to 
management and delivery of maintenance was established through three successive annual work 
programs for periodic and routine maintenance on the NRN and on the LRN in the selected 
Provinces, and the participation of the private sector through 
the development of national 
Page  2
competitive contracting procedures and village
-
based contracts.  The purpose of the RMF is to 
establish a steady and adequate domestic funding source for road maintenance based on the 
substantial recovery of costs from road user
s.  The Government currently meets an estimated 
45% of road maintenance needs, of which nearly one third is sourced from the RMF, mainly for 
national roads.  The RMF is growing slowly and effort is now required to establish and achieve a 
sustainable level,
 and to develop its role for the local road network (provincial, district and rural 
roads).  Steps have been taken to protect road assets by reducing the overloading of heavy 
vehicles but much more is needed for improving the safety and administration of r
oad transport.
2.
Objectives
The second phase of the Road Maintenance Program (RMP
-
2) will expand the operation 
of financing and management systems for the sustainable maintenance of the road networks to all 
18 provinces/zones countrywide, based on the succe
ssful experience of initiation and piloting 
under the first phase, with the following development objectives:
(a) 
National and local road assets are preserved to provide sustainable improved travel 
and access for road users and communities in most areas c
ountrywide; and
(b) 
Sustainable financing and management of roads is operational countrywide with 
improved institutional capacity at central and local levels in the public and private 
sectors.
In line with the main objective of the World Bank’s CAS, the 
proposed project will support rural 
and national infrastructure development, including maintenance of national highway networks.  
The second phase of the APL will continue to assist with the long
-
term development of an 
effective road management system at t
he central and provincial levels for the maintenance of 
both the national and local road networks. The proposed grant activities will complement a 
US$22.65 million IDA credit and other cofinancing for goods and services with a results
-
oriented capacity
-
enh
ancement program which aims to achieve a sustainable maintenance 
management and financial management systems for the entire network.
3.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
Rationale
:  GoL has performed well on RMP
-
1 and has requested to proceed with Phase 2.  The
development objectives for RMP
-
1 have been substantially met, and all three trigger criteria for 
the second phase have been substantially met, i.e.:  (i) financial resources allocated for road 
maintenance exceed 35% of needs on NRN and LRN (achieved 45% i
n FY03); (ii) the third 
maintenance AWP (MP
-
3) prioritized using the new Road Management System (RMS) (delayed 
but will achieve for the MP
-
4 in FY04/05);  and (iii) disbursements from IDA Credit are greater 
than 60% (79% in March 2004).  Under their ‘one c
ountry, one system’ policy, MCTPC is 
relying on IDA to lead the support on the road maintenance initiative to be followed by other 
donors.
Development and conservation of the road network is crucial to the national and regional 
integration of this land
-
lo
cked country.  A series of investment projects in the 1990s, along with 
other donors,  focused on rehabilitating about 3,000 km of the arterial road network and bridges, 
with an investment of about $600 million which absorbed about half of the government’s
 public 
investment plan and over 5 percent of GDP.  The three IDA Highway Improvement projects 
have been implemented satisfactorily, ending in 2003.  Despite this improvement to the national 
Page  3
network (NRN), much of the 24,000 km network remains under develo
ped, with just 22% paved 
and 45% all
-
weather.
The 8
-
year two phase Road Maintenance Program marks a major shift in focus, arising from the 
Government’s “Strategic Directions for Development of the Road Sector” of June 2000, from 
investment to one of prese
rvation and sustainable management of the road assets.  It aims to help 
establish a maintenance culture in the country at both national and local levels, including the 
capacity and tools for management, and the capacity for delivering services through the 
private 
sector.  
The first phase (Road Maintenance Project, RMP
-
1: Cr. 3481
-
LA; SDR 19.2 million) focused on 
initiation of the road management system, establishing a national cost
-
recovery
-
based financing 
mechanism and road management programming tools, 
implementing three annual programs of 
competitively sourced periodic maintenance contracts on the National Road Network (NRN), 
piloting maintenance contracts on the Local Road Network, establishing village
-
based area 
contracts for routine maintenance, init
iating effective vehicle loading control, establishing 
vehicle weight control facilities, and strengthening institutional capacity at the national level and 
selectively at the local level in four Provinces (Luangprabang, Luangnamtha, Champassack and 
Savann
akhet).  Partnership was key 
–
 Nordic (NDF) cofinancing for the technical assistance 
aspects of RMP
-
1, and Swedish (Sida) financing of a parallel project (LSRSP
-
2) which led on 
the local road aspects and expanded the coverage to seven Provinces (of 19). Th
e second phase is 
intended to fine
-
tune the systems and extend them to cover the management of both National and 
Local road networks over the whole country.  
The Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) established in 2001 has grown steadily but slowly with only 
one 
increase in the low initial fuel levy and over
-
reliance on road tolls 
–
 the current revenues of 
estimated $2.5 m in 2003/04 constitute only 15% of the $16 m estimated annual road 
preservation needs, and the 6
-
fold increase in fuel levy (to about 3.5 c/L) n
eeded to reach the full 
target by 2009 is challenging to GoL.  The Government, with foreign assistance, currently meets 
an estimated 45% of road maintenance needs, however counterpart funds are very limited, often 
causing delays, so greater leveraging of t
he Fund is a favored option under RMP
-
2.  There is 
pressure to release more of the funds for rehabilitation, currently limited to less than 20 percent 
of RMF or RMP. 
Funding for local roads (provincial, district and rural roads) is particularly scarce, a
nd an 
improved mechanism for sharing and distributing funds needs to be developed and piloted under 
RMP
-
2.  The new local road management model developed under the parallel LSRSP
-
2 is being 
reviewed before expanding its use to national coverage.  This will
 focus on clarifying the roles of 
Provincial District and village levels in managing rural infrastructure, which will be coordinated 
with the parallel IDA projects Provincial and Rural Infrastructure (proposed) and Poverty 
Reduction.  Poverty impacts will 
derive from improved all
-
weather access and increased local 
employment.  Considerable effort will be needed to strengthen the technical and managerial 
capacity in all the provincial Departments (DCTPC) to implement the preparation, procurement 
and supervis
ion of works.  In road transport, a significant reduction in incidence of overloading 
on heavy vehicles from over 90% to about 32% was made with targeted enforcement, now 
Page  4
training will be needed for operation of the pending new weighing stations.  Much mor
e is 
needed for improving the safety and administration of road transport.

Description
Component A.  PRESERVATION OF THE ROAD NETWORKS (US$60.7 million)
Adopting a programmatic approach, this will support a slice of four Annual Work Programs 
(AWPs)  for
  periodic  maintenance  and  routine  maintenance  on  the  National  Road  network 
countrywide  and  on  selected  parts  of  the  Local  Road  network  in  all  Provinces/Zones 
countrywide,  and  strengthen  the  quality  of  implementation.    In  a  shift  of  focus  based  on 
economic 
and  social  analysis  of  needs,  the  Phase  2  program  would  devote  nearly  half  the 
resources (48%) to maintenance of local roads, with particular emphasis on Provincial roads 
(30%) due to the poor condition of that network, and will contribute to substantial i
mprovements 
in the quality of access to all districts, especially the 47 poorest districts.   
A.1
National roads
:  Support for the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation program at 
an  average  level  of  US$6.4  million/yr  (estimated  to  be  about  45  percent  of  th
e 
sustainable level of about US$15 million/year), by supplementing the resources of the 
Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) which is recovering an increasing portion of costs 
from road users, and resources from other donors. All routine maintenance will be 
finance
d  by  counterpart  funding,  largely  through  the  RMF,  and  all  implemented 
through the private sector and mainly village
-
based. 
A.2
Local Roads
:  Support for the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of about 30% 
of the provincial road network at an average lev
el of US$4.10 million/yr with costs 
shared by local government, RMF and external funding.  There is the potential for 
additional external donor support for the District and rural road networks in the near 
future.
A.3
Implementation  Support:
    Assistance  to  cent
ral  and  provincial  departments  for 
improving the quality of implementation of the road preservation programs, including 
strengthened supervision of technical aspects and monitoring of safeguards aspects, 
especially at the provincial level.
Component B
.  CAPACITY BUILDING (US$10.1 million):
This  will  support  the  strengthening  of  capacity  of  the  transport  sector  in  two  core  business 
functions  (management  and  financing  of  the  road  infrastructure,  and  management  of  road 
transport  and  safety),  as  well  as 
the  general  institutional  capacity  at  both  national  and  sub
-
national levels, through: 
B.1
Road Management and Financing
-
 the establishment and operation of appropriate 
procedures at central and provincial levels for planning, budgeting and implementing 
maint
enance work programs on: a) National roads and bridges; b) Local roads and 
bridges (provincial, district and rural roads); and c) Support for scaling up the RMF to 
a  sustainable  level  of  cost  recovery  and  determining  appropriate  cost
-
sharing 
arrangements a
t the local level. 
B.2
Road  Transport  Management  and  Safety
-
  Improvements  to  road  transport 
administration procedures and systems, expanding the heavy transport management 
program (HTMP) of overloading control through the operation of new weight control 
Page  5
faci
lities built under RMP1, and development and implementation of a program of 
road safety improvements. 
B.3
Institutional Capacity Building
–
 Strengthening the capacity and performance of 
MCTPC and provincial DCTPCs’s through: a) Improvements to the organizatio
n and 
business processes, for upgrading key business functions including safeguards and 
strengthening 
organizational 
functions, 
and 
for 
effective 
operation 
under 
a 
decentralized structure; b) Human Resource Development, including results
-
oriented 
learning 
and training programs; c) Information technology and communications, for 
upgrading  the  computerization  of  central  and  provincial  offices;  d)  Facilities,  for 
provision of basic office facilities and transport to support operations at district level; 
e)  Str
engthening of the private sector, including construction and transport industries, 
and  consultant  capacity;  a
nd  f)  Environmental  and  Social  Safeguards  Capacity, 
enhancing baseline information on construction resources, community right
-
of
-
way, 
and related a
ctivities.
Component C.  PROJECT ADMINISTRATION  (US$0.85 million)
This will support efficient administration of the Program through: 
C.1
Project Monitoring
-
 Strengthening project management, reporting, monitoring of 
project impacts and safeguards, and pr
eparation of future sector programs. 
C.2
Incremental operating costs
–
 Modest budget support for project
-
related activities at 
central and provincial levels.
C.3
Auditing
-
 Financial
and technical audits to ensure quality of project implementation.
The project s
cope of approximately US$71.7 million is slightly larger than the originally planned 
scope of US$70 million because of the inclusion of all the local road network and thus a larger 
apparent share by the government.  The IDA allocation of US$22.65 million a
vailable for the 
second  phase  is  less  than  the  US$35  million  planned.    Other  financing  has  been  tentatively 
planned to meet the financing gap, but this would also be eliminated if the RMF targets for road 
user cost recovery are fully met.

Implementation
The unit responsible for overall financial management functions will remain the same, which is 
Disbursement Division within Department of Road. The current FM system will be continued 
with minor modification in reporting system,
 arrangement of audit and accounting procedures to 
Page  6
be up to acceptable standards. This system was assessed to be adequate in the first phase of the 
project and it has been gradually improved during implementation. Currently, it is functioning 
well. Since t
he division was established to handle all foreign fund financial activities in the road 
sector and the system was unified to capture records of all foreign fund projects in a single 
database, this would benefit for sector financial statements and audit if 
the client wish to move 
the sector agenda along. 
As for funds flow, 
there would be two Special Accounts similar to the current project; one for 
MTCPC to cover eligible share of project expenditures other than RMF activities and the other 
for 
Road Mainten
ance Fund
 (RMF) secretariat. The proposed funds flow arrangements are 
presented in the attached chart.
7.
Sustainability
The  basic  objective  of  the  RMP
-
2  is  to  enhance  the  long
-
term  sustainability  framework  for 
maintaining the NRN and LRN through the followi
ng initiatives:  
a)   Maintain a sustainable revenue source for preserving road assets; 
b)
Continue to promote participation of main stakeholders in project design, implementation 
and operations to ensure ownership of project objectives;
c)
Improve MCTPC
/DCTPC practices and restructure them according to their 
responsibilities; 
d)
Promote road maintenance activities that  are economically, financially and 
environmentally viable;
e)
Enforce key regulations on road transport operations which affect the pave
ment life;
f)
Promote road users' participation both in the management and financing of the sector; and
g)
Improve the capability of the local construction and consulting industry. 
RMP
-
2 will support the continued efficient operation of the Road Maintena
nce Fund which, over 
time, would generate sufficient revenue to cover the full cost of preserving the road network in 
Lao PDR, by 2010.  Moreover, the Road Management System will be further enhanced and 
strengthened  within the existing sub
-
systems. 
8.
Less
ons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector
Project Implementation is mainstreamed in MCTPC
.  
Coordinated by DOR through the Project 
Monitoring  Division,  this  organization  of  functions  enables  improvement  of  monitoring  and 
reporting,  avoidance  o
f  duplication,  fostering  donors’  coordination  and  opportunities  for  the 
staff’s career growth and professional development.  The RMP
-
2 project will be implemented by 
the MCTPC’s departments with all the functions incorporated into MCTPC.   
Technical Audi
ts are an effective instrument for enhancing quality
.  
Timely and independent 
professional opinion will be provided by auditors during implementation to allow for MCTPC to 
identify and resolve any issues early in the life of the project.  The auditor has t
he mandate to 
comment  on  technical  issues,  the  implementing  agency’s  procedures,  as  well  as  the  Bank’s 
contribution and effectiveness during implementation.
Continued  contracting  with  the  local  private  construction  industry
. 
Previous  projects 
contributed 
to the commercialization of all MCTPC construction and maintenance enterprises 
Page  7
(SOEs) and to the introduction of competition
-
based procurement.  RMP
-
1 established a long
-
term development strategy and supported its implementation and will continue to do so 
with this 
project. 
Allocation for emergency maintenance
.  Lao PDR is frequently affected by heavy rains that 
cause land and road slides.  The project includes financing emergency (about 15% of the planned 
routine maintenance) and routine maintenance work
s on the maintainable sections of the NRN 
and LRN through the RMF and the consolidated budget. 
Role of the provincial authorities
.   The Governors play a relevant role in the management of the 
provincial branches of central agencies.  While the DCTPCs ar
e official branches of the central 
MCTPC, they work under the day
-
to
-
day guidance of the Governor's office.  In addition, the role 
of  the  provinces  has  increased  in  recent  years  due  to  the  decentralization/devolution  policy 
promoted by the Government.  Thi
s implies that the implementation of a common strategy and 
system  for  the  maintenance  of  the  NRN  and  LRN  under  RMP
-
2  will  continue  to  require 
substantial consultations and knowledge sharing.
