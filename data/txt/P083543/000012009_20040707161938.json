However, minor infrastructure, or the use of\n            some areas as deposits, may result in unexpected low-level\n            impacts to parcels of land or buildings, and, road\n            maintenance activities may require the temporary occupation\n            of plots, potentially causing crops, and income losses to\n            settlers along the roads. Nonetheless, the project has been\n            assigned an environmental category B. Therefore mitigation\n            measures include: the need for setting design standards as\n            appropriate for road, traffic, and terrain. This should\n            further include an appropriate number of bridges and\n            culverts, taking into consideration widening of only one\n            side of existing roads, so as to retain trees. Areas where\n            roads may affect wildlife, forests, or cultural heritage\n            sites, should be avoided as possible in the engineering\n            design, and, include protective barriers as needed.\n            Moreover, the design shall include restrictions and safety\n            warning signs, safe crossings and fences to control\n            livestock as necessary. Drainage systems shall be adequately\n            designed to control hydrological regimes, potential\n            flooding, and irrigation systems, as well as to prevent soil\n            erosion, and, in addition septic tanks, and solid waste\n            disposal systems should be installed. Adequate wastewater\n            treatment facilities should be installed at service areas,\n            to prevent water contamination, while air pollution control\n            measures shall include regular spraying of construction\n            areas, and vegetative propagation to abate as possible dust emissions."}, "docdt": "2004-06-01T08:02:04Z"}
