{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Western Savannah\n            Development Project for Sudan were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, project sustainability was uncertain, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            deficient. Some lessons learned included: complex project\n            design with too many components complicates project\n            implementation, particularity in coordination, and should be\n            avoided. However, to the extent that related developments\n            are needed in a number of different areas, it is important\n            to analyze the relationships among those and ensure that\n            linkages are understood and maintained throughout\n            implementation. Cost recovery for the water yards could be\n            further improved if the service was made more reliable.\n            However, full cost recovery of water supply from deep\n            boreholes for human and animal consumption remains illusory\n            if the drain on families' cash income may be as high as\n            30 percent. Insistence on this will cause concentration of\n            populations on the areas where free water is available,\n            leading to land degradation. To the extent that the benefits\n            of water yards are largely environmental, an element of\n            subsidization is warranted."}, "docdt": "1995-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
