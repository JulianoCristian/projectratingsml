or to be developed under Western Savannah\n            Project II; (c) increase output from livestock by creating\n            an effective veterinary service; (d) conserve range and\n            develop pasture; (e) adapt farming systems to arrest the\n            ongoing degradation of soil and range; and (f) introduce\n            land tenure."}, "docdt": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
