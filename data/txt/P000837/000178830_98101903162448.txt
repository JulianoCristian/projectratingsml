REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$1.3
million to the Republic of Ghana to assist in financing a fisheries proJect.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed project was identified during the course of a Bank
identification mission in October/November 1966 and was prepared with the
help of an FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission in June 1967.
3.        In August 1968, the Government requested the Association's assis-
tance in financing the proposed project, which was appraised in September/
October 1968. Negotiations were held in Washingtn in April 1969. The
riegotiators for the Republic of Ghana and the other Ghanaian parties were
His Excellency E.M. Debrah, Ambassador of Ghana to the United States; Mr.
I. Ackom-Mensah, Managing Director, Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation,
Mr. J.N.N. Adjetey, Chief Fisheries Officer, Ministry of Agriculture; and
Mr. A.D. Tagoe, State Attorney, Attorney-General's Office; and Mr. J.E.
Yeboah, General Manager, Agricultural Development Bank.
4.        The followning is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
to Ghana as of Aug. 31, 1969:

5.        The Volta Project, financed by Loan No. 310-GH, was completed
in early 1966 about a year ahead of schedule and at considerable savings
on    the original cost estimates. The construction works for the power
distribution project, financed by Credit No. 118-GH, is progressing satis-
factorily. The Electricity Corporation of Ghana had had difficulties on
its accounting and financial side, but has now taken remedial measures
suggested by IDA, including employment of a firm of consultants and a
qualified chief accountant.
6.        The proposed credit would, therefore, be the sixth Bank group
financing in Ghana. Appraisal for a cocoa rehabilitation project is
currently taking place and a proposal for a credit of about US$6 million
is likely to be presented to the Executive Directors towards the end of
Fiscal Year 1970.
PART_II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.        BORROWIER:        The Republic of Ghana.
BENEFICIARIES:    The Agricultural Development Bank and Ghana
Industrial Holding Corporation.
PURPOSE:          To assist in financing the foreign exchange
cost of fishlng vessel construction through
credits to fishermen and to finance the
foreign exchange cost of technical assistance,
spare parts and studies for fishing port
development.
AMOUNT:           US$1.3 million.
AMORTIZATION:     In 50 years, including a 10-year period of
grace, thrcugh semi-annual installments of
1/2 of 1% from December 15, 1979 through
June 15, 1989 and of 1-1/2% from Dccember
15, 1989 through June 15, 2019.
SERVICE CHARGE:   3/4 of 1% per annum.
RELENDING TERMS:  The Borrower wo,bId relend a substantial part
of the credit to the Agricultural Development
Bank at 6-1/2% per annum for about 9 years,
including a 3 year grace period, and a small
amoiunt to the Ghana Industrial Holding Corpora-
tion for technical assistance andspare parts
at 6-1/2% per annum.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Ghana - Fisheries Project" (PA-7)
is attached.
9.        The project is the first stage of an overall longer-term program
for expansion of fisheries in Ghana which, in addition to the increase in
the number of fishing vessels, would involve expansion and modernization
of port and marketing facilities. The project includes: the construction,
equipping and operation of about forty purse seine fishing vessels for
:Lflshore fishing; technical assistance, including the provision of a naval
architect and production manager, to the Boatyards Division (BD) of the
Ghana Industrial Holding Corporaticn (GIHOC); and harbor studies for future
fishing port development.
:10.      The total project cost is estimated at US$2.3 million, of which
local currency expenses equivalent to approximately US$560,0oo would be
provided by the Government and GIHOC and approximately US$430,000 would
be provided by the fishermen as down payments under hire purchase contracts
and as working capital for operation of the vessels. The foreign exchange
component of the project, amounting to US$1,3 million, would be financed
out of the proceeds of the credit. This would cover the purchase of engines,
nets and gear and other equipment and the foreign exchange cost of consul-
tants' services and technical assistance.
11.       The proceeds of the credit relating to the construction and equip-
ment of the fishing vessels (US$825,000) would be relent by the Government
to the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB). The ADB would in turn onlend
these proceeds to approved purchasers of fishing vessels as part of the hirc
nurchase arrangements, and GIHOC would, on behalf of the purchasers, undertake
procurement of materials and equipment and the constructicn of the vessels.
12.       An amount of US$175,000 would be relent by the Government to
GIHOC ^or the purchase of hand tools and minor equipment for BD and spare
parts required for the maintenance and repair of vessels. Part of this
amount could be used, if needed, to supplement technical assistance to
BD wihich is being provided by the UIRP.
13.                     An amount of tJS$230,000, will be utilized by the
Government for financing the foreign exchange cost of consultants' services
for conducting harbor studies at Tema for improvement of the existing fishing
port and preliminary studies at Elmina and lumnford, followed by a detailed
study of one of these two ports with a view to the possibility of constructUJx;
an additional fishing port to handle the future expansion of the fishing fleot.
14.      The ADB has competent management, and, while it would in the initial
period depend on BD's expertise in the screening and evaluation of loan app'1-
cants and collection of installments, it is expected that in due course it
would gain sufficient familiarity with these operations to handle the entire
function on its own and administer the loans effectively. The BD has had cc:n-



siderable experience in boat construction. A naval architect will finalize
a new, simpler and somewhat cheaper design which would permit more effectiv;
uses of timber and skills available locally, and a production manager would
improve overall production efficiency.  Both of these experts have recently
been engaged under a UNDP/SF project.
15.       Procurement of items financed under the credit (other than con-
sulting services) would be on the basis of international competitive biddinc,
and disbursements would be made only for the actual foreign exchange cost ol
materials, equipment and services.
16.       Ghana, which is one of the largest producers and consumers  of
fish in tropical West Africa, currently has an annual deficit of about
20,000 tons of fish which has to be met by imports. The expansion of the
fishing fleet resulting from the proposed project tould increase fish
production by about 9,000 tons per annum -- the landed value of vhich
amounts to about $1.3 million.  In addition to this, tho project would
establish the framework for further development in the field of fisheries
by strengthening BD to enable it to produce modem, technically improved
vessels, by providing institutionalized credit for the purchase of vessels
and by providing a basis on which decisions on future fishing port develop-
mnent could be made.
17.       The project is well conceived and is technically and economically
sound. Assuming a ten-year operating life for the fishing vessels, the
financial rate of return on the vessels would be 30 per cent -nd the economic
rate of return is expected to be about 50 per cent.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMEI3TS AN'D AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Ghana and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and GIHOC  the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed development credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
19.       The draft Development Credit Agreement and draft Project Agree-
ment generally follow the pattern of other agreements for fisheries project:.
Section 2.07 of the Project Agreement limits the sales price of the project
fishing vessels to N0 44,000 ($43,120) each plus amounts acceptable to the
Association on account of increased costs of the Boatyards Division.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       A rpport on "The Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ghana" (Aw-6a), and a subsequent updating economic memorandum dated June
12, 1969, were circulated to the Executive Directors on May 7, 1969 and
Jutne 19, 1969, respectively. A basic data section containing sone recerit-
information is attached to this report as an annex.



21.   The salient features of Ghana's economy were discussed in
the "Report and Recommendation of the President to the Executive
Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Volta River Authority with
the Guarantee of the Republic of Ghana" (P-703) dated Milay 22,1969.
Its main conclusion was that even to make a modest growth in
GDP of the order of 4 per cent per annum possible, Ghana would
require a substantial inflow of resources to finance an increase
in investment, particularly in agriculture, power and road
transport. W-ith heavy maturities of past borrow ings to be met
and with large amounts of fresh money to be raised, it is
important that Ghana borrow a substantial part of its
requirements on concessional terms,
22.   Political developments are encouraging.  A constituent
assembly, convened under the auspices of the Iational Liberation
Council, promulgated a new constitution in August 1969. As a
result of elections held in late August, a cabinet responsible
to the National Assembly and a Presidential Commission which would
discharge the functions of the President as an interim arrangement
took office a week ago8 Given political stability, and re.aistic
economic policies specifically regarding the main export, cocoa,
and some consolidation of the external debt, there is reason to
expect a gradual improvement in Ghana's economic position.
PART VI   COIIPLIANCE. WTITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
23.     I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
PART VII - I--0iJ4-LITLi-i.TICI T
24.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed development credit.
