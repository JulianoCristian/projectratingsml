RAJASTHAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1046-IN)
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Rajas-
than Water Supply and Sewerage Project in India. An US$ 80.0 million Credit
to assist in the financing of the project was approved in June, 1980. The
Credit was closed in December, 1988 more than three years behind schedule.
Parts I and III of this PCR were done by the Infrastructure
Division of the Technical Department of the Asia Regional Office. Part II is
a summary of comments received from the Beneficiary of the Credit on Parts I
and III which were made available to them in the course of the preparation of
this PCR. No formal Borrower Completion Report has been received.
The PCR is based on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),
the President's Report (PR), all legal documents on the project including the
Loan, GuaLantee and Project Agreements, Bank supervision reports, records and
files, interviews with Bank staff familiar with the project, and the findings
of a completion mission in January 1989.

PROJEC'  C0MPLETION REPORT
INDIA
RAJASTHAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 1046-IN)
EVALUATION SUMMhRY
Obiectives
The project was to provide safe water supply to about 2,000
villages, improve and extend ithe water supply in Jaipur. Jodhpur, Kota and
Bikaner, ard extend the sewerage system in Jaipur. Jodhpur and Bikaner. In
addition, the project was to help to establish and staff up operations and
maintenance units in urban and rural areas and to introduce proper billing and
revenue collecting systems for water. The latter would make the Rajasthan
Water Supply and Sewerage Management Board fInancitlly self sufficient (para.
4).
Implementation Experience
The project was carried out substantially as expected. It was
restructured along the way to increase the number of villages that would
benefit from it, in the end 4,329 instead of 2,000 villages had been provided
with varying schemes of water supply (paras. 11 and 12).
Project Results
This ambitious project ran into two formidable difficultiest lack
of counterpart funding, and a prolonged and severe drought that altered cir-
cumstances in Rajasthan.l/ Still, the project served the state well by
bringing water to drought stricken people. Yet, it did not exactly do what it
set out to do institutionally; attempts to initiate institutional improvements
met with resistance and the results on this objective were minimal (paras. 13
to 19).
Sustainability
The project is likely to maintain an acceptable level of benefits
throughout its economic life (parss. 20 to 23).
Findings and Lessons Learned
Project results highlight the need for increased project super-
vision and to accept the fact that Implementing Agencies need to go through a
learning process before they can perform adequately ( this underscores the
over optimistic assumptions made during project preparation and appraisal).
Also, financial targets should be set more realistically, in tune with the
achievement potential of the Executing Agency (paras. 27 and 28).
1/    From 1983 through 1987 rainfall in most of the state averaged about 6-
per annum instead of the normal 18". The 1988 rains were enough to
break the drought in most areas.

B. BACKGROUND
Sector development objectives
2.          The long-range sector objective (SAR) is to provide satisfactory
water supplies in all urban and rural areas and sewerage systems in congested
urban areas. Priorities were established to address the urgent need for water
supplies in rural areas (problem villages) and in rapidly growing major
cities.
3.          The project was designed to take a significant step toward meeting
long range sector objectives and thus, improve public health standards which
were, at the time, below Indian average. Infant mortality was high; there was
a high level of dysentery and infectious hepatitis; high levels of fluoride in
the water caused widespread skeletal fluorosis; there were areas where guinea
worm infection was prevalent, and many villages were using water that was
hazardous to health.
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
4.          The Project objectives were:
(a)   to provide safe water supplies to about 2,000 problem
villages and to facilitate further rural development;
(b)   to improve and extend the water supplies in Jaipur (the
state capital), Jodhpur, Kota, and Bikaner, thereby achiev-
ing total coverage of the population; increasing the
population served by connections from 67Z to 78Z, and
providing for industrial expansion;
(c)   to extend the sewerage systems in Jaipur, Jodhpur, and
Bikaner thereby increasing the population served by connec-
tions from 18Z to 34Z;
(d)   to establish and/or strengthen operations and maintenance

D. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
7.          The project, as appraised, was a substantial undertaking and
although geographically extensive it's various elements were straightforwa.d
and well within the competence and experience of PHED engineering staff. The
physical components were understood and appreciated by all concerned in GOR,
PHED, and IDA. The project was well prepared and although the rural com-
ponents were not fully pinned down they were simple and straight forward and
therefore did not constitute a risk to the success of the project.
8.          But the project soon ran into difficulties that revealed that the
scale of the works to be undertaken was beyond the funding capacity of GOR.
The roles and responsibilities of the institutions and agencies responsible
for the project were clearly defined, however, there appears to have been a
difference in understanding the roles to be played by the respective agencies.
Shortly before appraisal, GOR created the Rajasthan Water Supply and Sewerage
Management Board (RWSSB).  This semi-autonomous state government organizatiorn
together with PHED, was made responsible for all sector activities including
operation and maintenance for both water supply and waste disposal works. GOR
was to retain power to: (a) borrow funds for capital investments in water
supply and sewerage schemes (priorities based on RWSSB's recommendations); and
(b) sanction water supply and sewerage tariffs (based on RWSSB recommenda-
tions).
9.          The SAR indicated that GOR control would be exercised through a
Committee of Direction. RWSSB would utilize the facilities and staff of PHED
to prepare, execute, and operate schemes for water supplv and sewage disposal;
review and advise GOR on tariffs; enter into contracts; advance lo&ns to cus-
tomers; and incur expenditures appropriate to their responsibilities (within
budget limitations). PHED was to be responsib'e for project planning and
design, construction, works operation, finance, and administration. The local
view of the organizational set-up appears to have differed from IDA's. The
situation over a very long period had PHED operating as a department of GOR.
The creation of RWSSB initially may have had some significance, however, it
would appear that the earlier regime reasserted itself and now RWSSB is little
more than a label. The hope for operational viability was charged to RWSSB,
but its withering has resulted in PHED returning to its traditional role of
developing and opera.ing engineering projects on the basis of funding short-
falls made good by GOR.
10.         The project was seriously affected by the need for restructuring
in order to respond to the changes in priorities caused by five years of
drought. But, in retrospect, the project was also too ambitious and the or-
ganizational structuring was not visualized in the same manner by IDA and the
beneficiary.

E. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
11.         The SAR identified project funding (by GOR) and cost recovery in
rural areas as the most likely risks. What could not have been foreseen was
five years of drought and the serious effects in had on the western parts of
the state. For example, at its worst, the city of Jodhpur was getting water
for only about two hours every second or third day. The falling ground water
level meant that amany tubewells were no longer deep enough to draw water.
Reservoirs were empty and cattle grazed on their beds. IDA agreed to GOR's
request to change the emphasis of the project to benefit the sorely stricken
rurc.l areas by cutting back on the funding for the four cities. This could be
done without a great deal of difficulty, since because of the shortage of
counterpart funding, the works program for the cities was far behind schedule.
12.         There are two important parts of the project that have not been
completed:  One, in Kota, is a main that would provide water to a developing
area on the side of the River Chambal, opposite the city proper. This is in
hand, proceeding satisfactorily, and should be completed by mid-1989. The
second, in Bikaner, is the completion of a raw water reservoir. Work has been
del&yed while PHED is investigating different types of lining for the reser-
voir interior in an effort to reduce costs. The work has not yet started but
assurances have been given that the work will be completed by mid-1990 and
that adequate funding will be available.
F. PROJECT RESULTS
13.         The project was restructured and the physical objectives of the
restructured project have been substantially achieved. The changes were made
so that the number of village's benefitting from the project could be in-
creased thereby bringing them relief from the drought. Emergency measures
were also introduced for the cities, for example, a new wellfield was deve-
loped and 80 Km of transmission main laid to Jodhpur, at a speed which does
credit to PHED and its contractors. Overall, in the four cities the number of
people served by connections has increased from 1,303,700 to 1,809,000 (39Z).
14.         The project has had an impact in a number of ways; most important-
ly, by far, in drought relief. However, in the 'problem villages" the benefi-
cial effects have been twofold. Prior to the project, many women were walking
up to five miles every day to fetch water and now these women are free to
perform other tasks where they can earn money on a regular basis.
15.         Guinea worm was a widespreae health problem in Rajasthan but the
provision of piped supplies has reduced dependence on the wells which in many
cases were the sources of infection.
16.         As a result of restructuring, the target (at appraisal) of about
2,000 problem villages was raised to 3700 and, by December 1987, 4,329 problem
villages had benefited; individual villages had been provided with varying
schemes raiging from handpumps to tubewells or surface source developments
with mains supplies to public standpipes.



5
17.         The project took waste prevention and leak detection into account
and provision has now been made to pursue an appropriate program. However, in
an arid area such as Rajasthan the importance of such a program is much
greater than where water is more plentiful. Therefore, the issue of water
loss deserved to be addressed as a first priority; instead, the advance to the
present position took place less than urgently.
18.         Staff Appraisal Report identified cost recovery in rural water
supply as one of the most likely risks. As it turned out, introduction of per
capita wate: charge of Rs. 1.0 per month to cover operation and ma-intenance
proved futi e as collection proved almost impossible and GOR continues to
provide necessary funds.
19.         Ambitious financial impruvement goals were set for urban area
water supply and sewerage operation. Significant improvements have been made
toward these goals: introduction of systematic and transparent accounting
system, introduction of sewerage charges, substantial increase in tariffs (502
in 1985 and 30? in 1987), and increased collection efficiency to 95Z. However,
these revenue enhancement achievements fall short of 32 (revised down in 1987
from the original 72), and the revenues are not expected to even operation and
maintenance costs fully. One may interpret these results either as a success
or a failure; either as an argument for more modest targets or for ambitious
targets as motivational strategy. But there clearly was a case of an overly
ambitious financial strategy not coordinated with a sound water resource
management system.
G. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
20.         The project will probably maintain an acceptable level of benefits
throughout its economic life. The principal risk lies in the local unwilling-
ness to recover the cost of providing water, thereby leading to a reliance on
GOR to provide larger and larger amounts of money for operation and main-
tenance. This it is unwilling to do as there are so many other demands on its
financial resources. Consequently, maintenance and the quality of service
suffers.
21.         There is, in any case, a far greater interest on the part of
PHED's staff in the creation of new capital works than in operating and
maintaining these works when they have been completed and have started
operating.
22.         These risks might best be addressed by breathing new life into
RWSSB -- giving it extended powers and, concomitant with those powers,
increased responsibility.
23.         PHED reported that an effect of the revision of tariffs, in 1985
and 1987, was a reduction in the number of connections of the industrial and
commercial categories. These consumers installed their own tube wells and
stopped buying water. Another reason may have been the scarcity of mains
water caused by the drought. There is a clear need for GOR to institute
controls over the abstraction of ground water and for water resource utiliza-
tion to be a key consideration in plenning controls. This means to probably
create a water resources department authorized to grant licenses to abstract



6
water. GOR already has a hydrogeological survey department and a Ground Water
Board so it should not be difficult to extend their functions.
H. BANK PEP.FORMANCE
24.         The Bank, at the heart of the restructuring process, recognized
that GOR faced many difficulties in executing the project. As a result, in
the physical sense, the project has produced substantial benefits on a state-
wide basis.
25.         The adoption of commercial accounting in the four cities by PHED
was facilitated by the efforts of visiting Bank-staff missions. It was
recognized that the financial rate of return (ROR) envisaged at the time of
appraisal was quite beyond the state institutions in the short term and at the
time of project restructuring the target ROR was reduced from 82 to 32
(after meeting the operating and maintenance cost including depreciation).  At
the project end ROR was still negative (-10Z for the four towns consolidated).
26.         At appraisal, the Bank's judgement of what was achievable in the
project period was over-optimistic but, given the budget constraints, Bank
staff performed efficiently and sympathetically during the supervision phase.
27.         The staff input in the field amounted to about 32 staffweeks up to
appraisal and about 75 for supervision -- the la ter, over a period from 1980
to 1988. What appears to be a small input for a project having difficulties
may be due to internal constraints but the effort which went into preparation
and appraisal (including Division Chiefs' and Assistant Directors' time)
could, with benefit, have been reflected in provision for supervision.
28.         Lessons learned:
(f)   For first-time projects it should be recognized that the
beneficiary will have to go through a learning process and,
accordingly, the project should be on a scale that will not
overburden the executing agency; either in funding capacity
or staff capability; and
(g)   Financial targets should be realistic in terms of local
achievement potential.
I. BENEFICIARY'S PERFORMANCE
29.         The Beneficiary's main strength lies in the expertise of PHED
which demonstrated its ability to complete capital works quickly and effi-
ciently given the necessary and timely allocation of funds. Its main weakness
lies in its inability to make the funds available.
30.         The project went through three phases --  during appraisal and the
early part of implementation the Beneficiary performed well; at mid-project
there was an hiatus; and, towards the end, the Beneficiary again performed
well, resuming their early enthusiasm. This was probably due to changes in



7
senior directors of the project; but it may be noted that GOR was alive to the
need for stronger leadership and provided it.
31.         The Beneficiary's expertise in designing and building capital
works is not reflected in PHED's maintenance standards. For example, at one
water pumping station in Jodhpur the back cover plates on clectrical panels
were all open -- an unsafe practice that evidently had been going on for some
time as bees were nest building inside the panel box; at Kota the new chemical
house was in need of cleaning because of spillages of alum; and only about 30Z
of windows were unbroken on the filter house at Kota's older water treatment
plant; etc.
32.         The views held in Rajasthan before the project are still in place.
PHED staff regard the subsidization of water supply finances as a GOR pre-
serve; that negotiating a lower price with the lowest bidder for a contract is
a reasonable process which offsets the effect of collaboration between con-
tractors; that, as India can produce all the requirements for a water supply
project, therp is no need for international competitive bidding (ICB).
33.         On the technical side PHED employs civil and mechanical engineers
and chemists but the application of their skills, at least among the en-
gineers, does not appear to maximize the benefits of their background and
training. There is plenty of specialized work for mechanical engineers (and
for that matter electrical engineers although none is on PHED staff) but it
appears that both sorts of engineers are regarded as interchangeable hence
mechanical engineers are involved in civil construction work. There are
indications that political patronage is a cause and as a result there is
disaffection among staff.
34.         On the financial side, although ROR is still negative, the four
project cities have adopted commercial accounting. As this method of account-
ing is extended, GOR will be provided with the information needed to make
sensible allocations of funds between maintenance and capital works.
35.         The Beneficiary has introduced computers and they are now being
used to monitor physical and financial targets for water supply schemes,
storekeeping, and drill rig performance. PHED also employs private agencies
that use computers in connection with billing and collection; some difficul-
ties have affected this arrangement and it is likely that PHED will try to
increase its inventory of computers so that billing and collections can be
dealt with 'in house."
J. PROJECT RELATIONSHIP
36.         On the evidence of two recent (1988 and 1989) visits to Rajasthan
it is clear that, at least over the final years of the project, relations
between Bank Staff and Beneficiary were excellent. This was probably the case
in the earlier years, but in the middle years relations were less than
satisfactory. The reason for this is not clear, but probably arose from Bank
dissatisfaction with progress in conjunction with the realization on both
sides that radical measures were needed to deal with an ailing project and the
circumstances surrounding a severe and prolonged drought. Once the restruc-
turing was determined, and new PHED leadership had been provided, good
relations were restored.

K. CONSULTING SERVICES
37.         Consultants assisted RWSSB and PHED satisfactorily on project
formation and planning and, at the implementation stage, on the design of
reinforced concrete structures for water treatment plants.
38.         Contractors' performance was disappointingly slow although the
quality of their work was adequate. Material suppliers (both local and
foreign) were also c.iticized by PHED for slow delivery.
L. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
39.         The legal agreements were quite adequate despite the fact that SAR
provided a useful framework for the project only for the early years of
execution. Latterly, it bore little relationship to what was going on under
restructuring.
40.         Enough data was available to meet most of the needs in the
compilation of the project completion report. This was despite the difficul-
ties that arose as a result of most of the PHED staff being on strike during
the completion mission.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
RAJASTHAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(CREDIT 1046-IN)
PART II
UUICIAY'S CON4Z3TS i/
1.          The factual information contained in Part III of the Project
Completion Report is accurate and all the relevant information indicated
therein is also adequate.
2.          The Bank's analyses contained in Part I of the PCR is also
confirmed, except Part IV--Project Design and Organization (last paragraph
dealing with creation of RWSSB). It is stated that RWSSB, functioned quite
independently through the media of its different committees (e.g., Committee
of Directions, Policy Planning Committee, Stores Purchase Committee, Finance
Committee, Technical Committee, Staff Committee etc.). The board could accord
administrative and financial sanction for execution of Urban Water Supply and
Sewerage Schemes and Rural Water Supply Schemes much quicker than earlier
arrangements of PHED.  With the setting up of Board, the observation of
various sanctions and formalities required by PHED at the Government level
were avoided and various tasks of approving tenders for purchases of stores
materials and execut.on of civil works, sanctioning staff, etc., became
simpler. The only d-wback with the Board was to arrange the counterpart
funding for which the Board had to depend on the Government of Rajasthan.
Similarly, the revision of tariff on water rates could not be done by the
Board it must be an act of Government of Rajasthan. Under Project sustainabi-
lity, there is a need for the Government of Rajasthan to institute control
over the abstraction of ground water, and for water resource utilization to be
a key consideration in the exercise of planning control, therefore, the state
government, after considering the social aspects of the situation, is serious-
ly thinking of initiating legislation along these lines.
3.          The Bank has performed quite well during the evolution and
implementation of the project. The Bank immediately agreed to: (a) the
Beneficiary's proposal for restructuring the project, (b) increasing the
percentage of reimbursement under different categories, and, also, (c)
granting extension of the time limit set for execution of the project. The
reimbursement of claims has been quite prompt, however, a few suggestions
follows
(a)   The World Bank should not insist on breaking even on
maintenance expenditures, on maintenance of the scheme, with
the revenue realized from its beneficiaries. In the case
where the state government wants to subsidize the main-
tenance expenditure, it should be allowed to do so under
certain social obligations.
(b)   In the matter of deciding the bids for procurement of
material and civil works, negotiations with the tenderers
should be permitted so as to do justice with non-IDA tenders
regarding rates.
1/    The following is a summary of comments received from the Beneficiary
on Parts I and III of this Report.



10
(c)   The procedure for approval of bid evaluation report from
Washington should be streamlined.
4.          The lessons to be learned for future, as given in Part I, para. 8
under the heading, "Bank Performance," are for our guidance. These lessons
should formulate guidelines for us in implementing the existing project as
well as for future projects posed before Bank for favor of financing.
5.          Our own performance as evaluated by Bank and as given in Part I at
para. 9 is agreed. There are some constraints in arrangement of funds for
special repairs and maintenance and more care shall be taken in the better
maintenance of machineries, and in civil works. Regarding giving respon-
sibilities to the Engineers based on their background, the department is
taking steps to do just that.
6.          Regarding negative ROR on the financial side, this cannot be
helped much as the revision of tariff of water rates, to cover the cost of
production, depends upon the state government who has its limitations in view
of its civil responsibilities for providing safe drinking water to the public
without much burdening financially as a social aspect.
7.          The relations between the Bank and the Beneficiary during the
evolution and implementation of the Project have been cordial throughout and,
in the last two years, could be termed as excellent.

Proiect Results
Direct Benefits
The restructuring of the project in 1985 changed the emphasis of the
project by shifting funding away from the urban areas towards the rural areas
as shown in the following table:
At appraisal              After restructuring
Funding for                     Rs crores                   Rs crores
Rural areas                        53.4                          94.3
Urban areas                        84.3                          43.4
Total                        137.7                        137.7
As a result of the great change in the target beneficiaries,
indicators selected at appraisal have, mostly, little relevance to the actual
results. However, at appraisal it was considered tE .t the (financial) rate of
return for the urban areas would move from the negative in 1980 to 9 or 102 by
1988. ROR in 1983-84 was about negative 242. It has reached about 102
(negative) in 1989 for the consolidated results for the four IDA towns.
Economic Impact
An economic R.O.R. was not evaluated at appraisal and so a comparison
cannot be made. However. the economic impact has been most significant in the
rural areas through improvements in health as a result of abandoning well
water in favor of a piped supply; in addition, time previously spent in
fetching water over a distance of as much as 4 km. is now used profitably.

The financial targets have not been met but the four cities included
in the project have at least moved into the position of knowing where they
stand financially by having adopted commercial accounting. GOR is made aware
of how much it has to provide from general taxation to supplement what is
needed for operation and maintenance of water supply installation, for the
provision of water thrc,ugh public standpipes and for subsidizing domestic,
commercial and industrial supplies.
