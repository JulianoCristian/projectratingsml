improved and expanded in four rapidly growing cities in the\n            State of Rajasthan, and the sewerage system extended in\n            three of these cities. New piped water supplies would also\n            be provided to about 2,000 villages. These facilities would\n            enable an additional 242 million liters of water per day\n            (mld) to be supplied to the 2.4 million people in the four\n            cities and provide about 1.7 million people in the 2,000\n            villages with improved water supplies by 1985. The project\n            would also develop RWSSB as an institution capable of\n            planning and implementing sectoral development programs in\n            Rajasthan. The needs of the urban and rural poor would be\n            met through water from standpipes supplied at a modest\n            charge. Credit would also be provided on easy terms to\n            facilitate sewer connections and basic plumbing installation\n            by the economically weaker sections of society. The project\n            faces risks of possible delays in implementation, and\n            possible revenue shortfalls in rural areas on account of the\n            untested cost recovery measures proposed. These risks are\n            expected to be minimized through provision of consultant\n            assistance, and a GOR undertaking to make up any shortfalls\n            in revenue collection in rural areas."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
