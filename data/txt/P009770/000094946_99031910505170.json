"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The evaluation found that while the\n            various schemes are helping to reduce the deficit in rural\n            water supply and increasing water coverage, they have done\n            little to foster local organizational capacity. Involvement\n            of users in developing, implementing, and operating and\n            maintaining water supply systems has not yet been sufficient\n            to achieve a desirable level of sustainability. Women,\n            because they are the primary water collectors in most rural\n            households, have the most interest in ensuring that the\n            water and sanitation service is designed to match their\n            needs and performs well and they need to be more involved\n            than they have been. The study finds that project designers\n            need to adjust the approach to service delivery according to\n            existing levels of social capital; special efforts may be\n            necessary to motivate and mobilize community members.\n            Factors such as water committee participation in multiple\n            community, participation in system design and construction,\n            improved beneficiary health, and women's participation\n            in the water group are all positively related to\n            above-average financial management and cost recovery and\n            should receive special attention during water and sanitation\n            project design."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
