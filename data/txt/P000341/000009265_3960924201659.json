To reach its objective, the project was to: (a)\n            strengthen the planning unit in the Ministry of Agriculture\n            and strengthen and equip a new directorate of production\n            services in Union des Cooperatives de Cafe Arabica de\n            l'Ouest (UCCAO); (b) establish a seed farm and\n            construct 10 new rural service centers and 220 village water\n            points; (c) develop about 400 ha of bottomland; (d)\n            introduce better processing equipment; and (e) establish a\n            training center, a monitoring and evaluation unit, and a\n            revolving credit fund. Lessons learned include: (a) the\n            difficulty of addressing a key national policy issue in the\n            context of a regional project. Low coffee producer prices\n            (relatively and as a share of export price) made coffee\n            relatively unattractive; (b) insufficient attention was paid\n            to linking and conveying the applied research unit findings\n            (field trials and demonstrations) to the extension service.\n            This resulted in the latter not having enough messages to\n            convey to farmers, and extension did not effectively convey\n            farmers-priorities and problems to research; and (c) given\n            the complexity of the technical issues in this type of\n            project, regular visits by an agronomist are essential."}, "docdt": "1987-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
