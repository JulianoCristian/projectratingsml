pest\n            control, seed production, training, and field demonstration\n            and trials; (b) establishing a training center; (c)\n            improving field storage facilities for inputs, coffee, and\n            foodcrops by upgrading 25 existing and constructing 10 new\n            rural service centers; (d) establishing a revolving credit\n            fund to finance seasonal inputs and small farm tools and\n            equipment; (e) constructing about 220 water points to\n            provide 18,000 rural families with safer and more convenient\n            water supply; (f) constructing simple water control works to\n            enable about 400 ha of currently uncultivated bottomlands to\n            be put into productive use by some 1,300 rural families; (g)\n            increasing the mechanical coffee grading capacity of UCCAO\n            from 7,000 tons to 14,000 tons per year and introducing\n            machines capable of improving coffee quality; (h)\n            establishing a project monitoring unit which will record\n            changes in a limited number of performance indicators as an\n            aid in improving project implementation and monitoring the\n            impact of project actions; and (i) strengthening the\n            Planning Unit in the Ministry of Agriculture."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
