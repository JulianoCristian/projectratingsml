         Credit (PFSC) Project for Senegal were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory; and borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            despite a being stand-alone operation, such a Development\n            Policy Operation (DPO) can have a significant development\n            impact particularly if it is following-up on a series of\n            prior DPOs and other Bank operations, and even more so if in\n            turn it is followed by DPOs and other operations, which\n            deepen the actions undertaken under the stand-alone DPO by\n            building on the reform momentum helped create. Public\n            Finance Management (PFM) modernization measures included in\n            the PFSC provided a solid basis and impetus for further\n            reforms; but those are likely not be fully achieved unless\n            the government is fully committed to implement such a long\n            term action plan, and if possible with further donors\n            support. Having a multi-sectoral group of Bank staff which\n            worked as real team very closely together across sector\n            boundaries, allowed to produce rapidly a coherent\n            multi-sectoral operation in which the different measures for\n            the different policy areas jibed well. Without proper\n            oversight, public agencies and other parastatals can rapidly\n            become poorly performing entities, run into a difficult\n            financial situation and cause significant fiscal burden on\n            the state. The stance taken by Bank country teams in a\n            number of countries that systemic privatization and/or\n            liquidation of parastatals will basically solve the problems\n            of performance of these entities, has often proven to be unrealistic."}, "docdt": "2010-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
