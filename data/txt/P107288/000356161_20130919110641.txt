1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

From the mid-90s unti I 2005, Senegal had one of the best economic performances in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Real GOP grew annually at an average rate of about 5 percent and poverty decl ined
rapidly 1• The regional monetary arrangement- a cuJTency union, managed by the supranational
Central Bank of the West African States- provided a framework of monetary and price stabi lity.
On the fiscal pol icy front, the authorities have generally pursued a broadly stable track, enhancing
revenue mobilization and maintaining control on current expenditures, while allowi ng for a
gradual increase in capital and pro-poor spending. Senegal also benefitted from the HlPC
initiative, reaching completion point in 2004, and from the MDRI in 2005.

Senegal has also benefitted from a broadly stable political climate. President Wade won his
second term with the 2007 elections. The local elections of March 2009 saw the victory of
opposition parties in several key urban centers. A new cabinet was nominated but key ministers,
including the Min ister of economy and finance stayed. Still, the relative victory of the opposition
suggested that policies and refo rms on which a broad consensus has not been forged could be
more difficult to implement.

The authorities laid out their poverty reduction program first in the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP-1 ) for 2003-05. This PRSP aligned with the Millenium Development Goals (MDG)
focused on : (i) wealth creation through economic reform and private sector development; (ii)
capacity building and development of basic social services; and (ii i) improving living cond itions
of vulnerable groups. The PRSP-2, covering 2006-201 0. was articulated around four pillars (of
which the first three were consistent with those of PRSP-1 ): (i) wealth creation and pro-poor
growth; (ii) improvi ng access to basic social services; (iii) protecting vulnerable groups against
catastrophic exogenous shocks; and (iv) greater transparency and better governance combined
with participatory processes. This fourth pillar was added to strengthen the effectiveness of
public spending through efiicicnt budgetary procedures and control.

The Bank group provided support to both poverty reduction strategies (PRS) PRS- J and PRS-2
through a series of three one-tranche development policy operations (DPO) implemented over the
2004-07, PRSC I. TI and Ill. As set forth in the Bank' s 2003-2006 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Senegal (Report No. 25498-SN). the PRSCs were seen as critical instruments to
support the PRSP agenda. The reforms supported by these operations were to help Senegal
implement its poverty reduction program by helping to: (i) to ma.Lntain economic growtb and
improve living conditions for the Senegalese; (ii) enhance ownership and fu nctionality for the
Government in policy planning and budget management, and thereby help the country achieve
progress towards the MDGs; and (iii) promote coordination and collaboration within the
Government and among donors. which would lead to a comprehensive approach to the delivery
of basic social services. The PRSCs provided support to the Government in five priority areas.

    The fraction of the population tbc poverty line declined from 68 percen t in 1994/95 to 5 1 percent in 2005/06.
Two 2 of those areas are to be highlighted with respect to the follow-up DPO - the Public Finance
Support credit (PFSC) reviewed by this lmplementatjon Completion and Results Report (ICR):
(i) strengthening budgetary and financial procedures and procurement processes and systems; and
(ii) the decentralization process, by securing financiaJ transfers to local Governments, as well as
disseminating and implementing the Poverty Reduction Strategy agenda at the local level. T he
ICR for the three PRSCs (Report No. ICR0000669) rated the overall outcome of each of tJ1ese
operations as moderately satisfactory.

In 2006 and 2007. Senegal's GOP growth fell to respectively 2Y2 percent and 4% percent as a
series of shocks buffeted the economy. First the run up in oil prices and the surge in food prices,
weighing down on the economy, driving up inflation, and contributing to a widening of the
external current account deficit. Second, problems of the parastatal power company, SENELEC
resulting among other things in high costs and blackouts, poor rains leading to a fall of
agricultural output and a sharp slowdown in activities and tinancial difticuJti es of the largest
exporting ftrm, the phosphate mining and phosphoric acid production finn ICS.                 Still,
performance remained strong in the construction and services sectors, particularly
telecommunications, and investment expanded 3 fueled by a continued robust growth in
remittances, a steady expansion of public works and forei gn direct investment.
ln June 2007. the Bank' s Board discussed the FY07-0 I0 CAS for Senegal (Report No. 36608-
SN).     This CAS had three pillars: (i) accelerated growth/ wealth creation; (ii) human
development/shared growth; and (iii) rural and urban synergy. In order to address the challenge
of weak governance in SenegaL it was also structured around a governance filter- aiming inter
alia at: (i) improviJ)g transparency and efficiency in the usc of public resources; and (ii)
increasing public sector accountabil ity. Its objectives follow Senegal's national priorities as set
out in the PRSP-1 and 2. It did mention a number of downsi de risks for the medium term but did
not foresee a context of external shocks and ri sks of the magnitude experienced in 2008-2009.
With the onset of the global recession, 2008 came out as an unusually stressful year for Senegal.
GDP growth declined to 2 1   .1:! percent and - while Senegal has long prided itself for strong
macroeconomic management - fiscal performance turned out unusually weak. Budget slippages
emerged early in the year, reflecting the interpl ay of external shocks and internal policy facto rs:
the fiscal impact of exogenous shocks, difficulties in accessing financing. and weaknesses in
fiscal policy and public fmancial management. Faced with a continued surge in o il and food
prices the authorities enacted early in the year unbudgeted tax cuts and s ubsidies equivalent to
about I Y2 percent of GOP. The iJlitial fi scal policy response proved inadequate- attempts by the
authorities to tighten commitment controls already by May could not rein in overall spending to a
commensurate degree. At the same time, the Treasury faced growing cash constraints. Access to
domestic tinancing through short- and medium-term paper issues in the local and regional money
markets fell short of budget plans by a sign ificant margin 4 • The fi scal slippages lead to an
accumulation of unpaid bills by the Government to domestic suppliers equivalent to 3~ percent

  The other three being: (i) health serv icl:$, wit h a focus on improving information, ftnancinl and human resources
management in the sector, as well a~ increasing access to basic health services; (ii) wealth creation: and (iii) irnproviog
lh ing conditions of the most vulnerable groups.

of GDP by October 2008.        Construction and commercial activity slowed sharply with the
combined effect of substantial payment delays to suppliers and the negative impact of surging oil
and food prices on the demand for domestic output.

A 2008 audit carried out by the Min istry of Economy and Fi nance (MEF) Inspectorate in the
context of the Senegal' s program under the IMF's Policy Support Instrument (PS I) identified
weaknesses in Publ ic Financial Management (PFM) which reflected part of the difficulty in
controlling overall s pending. lt exposed extra-budgetary expenditures - for a cumulative total of
about 1\4 percent of GOP -carried out over 2006-08 mainly by Senegal's numerous autonomous
agencies, and a frequent recourse to cash payments ("treasury advances'') under emergency
procedures for non-emergency items. By the end 2008, in the context of the IM F-supported PSI
program, the authorities adopted a plan of strong corrective actions. These included a cut in
planned spendjng of about 2 percent of GOP and the elimination of fuel and food-related tax cuts
and subsidies to stem the accumulation of further arrears and make room for their repayment, the
presentation of a Supplemental Budget in which previous treasury advances were also regularized,
and steps to elim inate the use of treasury advances in thei~r current form and narrow the scope for
exceptional spending procedures strictly to genuine emergencies. The authorities also revised
various budget plam1ing and execution procedures so as to strengthen control of spending
envelopes.


With the completion of the PSJ program review5 , the Government was able to secure financing
from various sources to effect a rapid repayment of domestic arrears. By end-December 2008,
the Government managed to secure about % of the fu nds needed. f undi ng included substantial
support from donors (counterpart funds of projects. budget support. and a large non-conccssional
loan from France). This prompt domestic arrears clearance proved to be a key element of the
policy response to the crisis. The stock of domestic arrears was reduced from 3% percent of GOP
to less than % percent by the end of February 2009. The repayment of a large fraction of
domestic arrears 6 constituted a significa nt injection of liquidity in the economy, contributing to
strengthen private sector balance sheets, increasing bank liquidity and providing stimulus to the
local economy and also helped restore the State's credibility.

By early 2009, as the country was striving to emerge from its 2008 fiscal problems, further effects
of the growing st ress in the gl obal environment on Senegal bec-ame increasingly likely. Being a
very open economy, Senegal' s exposure to the global crisis is significant - with major channels
of transmission of the global economic recession to the Senegalese economy being exports,
remittances. tourism and foreign direct investment. With the transmission of the global crisis
being felt increasingly, the authorities had to revise their budget plans for 20097 . While revenues

  The original budget. prepared before evidence of the impact o ft he global crisis and a resulling domestic growt h
slowdown began to emerge, assumed an unreali~tic GOP grow1h rate of 5Y:t percent. Jt envisaged an overall deficit
(including grants) of 3 percent of GOP. wi th moderate growth in revenues and the suppression of fud and food
substdics creating fiscal space in part for a resumplion nf capital spending, while lcaviJ1g room to finance the
repayment of residual arrears carried over from 2008.

were expected to fall short of the budget's original targets by about lO percent, leaving overall
spending targets unchanged and allowing a widening of the deficit appeared as a more desirable
option by avoiding a contractionary s tance at a time when the economy could least afford it and
when developmental goals were most vulnerable. A Supplemental Budget was prepared leaving
original spending broadly intact, and targeting the fiscal deficit at 4Yz percent of GDP. The
budget was to be ft.llly financed by additional recourse to domestic financing, and additional
expected donor suppo11.

In this challenging context, in became clear that further actions were urgently needed to restore
budget disci pline and avoid a recurrence of slippages by accelerating public financial
management reforms, mi tigate fiscal risks emanating ti·om weak corporate governance of public
sector entities and protect key developmental objectives as the authorities adopt corrective tiscaJ
measures. The authorities thus undertook to engage in a core set of critical actions,
complementary to the actions already being taken under the IMF-supported PSI program. A new
Bank DPO - the stand-alone Public Finance Support Credit (PFSC) - was tbus prepared to
respond to Senegal's urgent need for finan cial assistance and to support those new actions with a
primary focu s on fi scal issues. T he urgency and the relatively narrow focus on fiscal issues made
an interim stand-alone operation a more appropriate instrument for Bank supp011 to the
authorities at this juncture than a new series of PRSCs as originally envisaged in the FY07-010
CAS.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overall program objectives were: (i) to bring Senegal' s fiscal stance to a sound and
sustainable track; (ii) mitigate fisca l risks emanati ng from public sector entities; and (iii) protect
critical developmental objectives at a time when the authorities had to maintain a tight fiscal
policy and cope with the impact of the global crisis. These objectives were closely aligned with
the Government reform priorities laid out in the PRSPs. There were 10 speci fie obj ectives, each.
with an indicator. T hese I 0 indicators focused on outcomes, wet:"e specific and measurable, with
baselines as of end 2008 and targets for the first quarter of 20 I 0.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, a nd
Reasons/Justification

The above PDOs and indicators remained unchanged.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved )

The PFSC provided support in the fo llowing three priority areas:

(i) Public fin a nce management (PFM): restoring budgetary discipline and avoiding a recurrence
of fiscal slippages by accelerating PFM reforms, and increasing transparency, with actions
covering budget preparation, execution, systems, transparency, controls, and procurement.

(ii) Fiscal t isks from public sector entities: mitigating the fi scal risks emanating fro m Senegal's
significant number of autonomous public sector agencies and s pecialized fund s, including
hospitals.

(iii) Protecting Key Developmenta l Objectives: p rotecting selected developmental objectives in
forest resource management, road maintenance and decentralization.



                                                   4
As explained above. the focus of this stand-alone operation was on fiscal issues and particularly
geared to respond to Senegal's plight during this 2008-2009 stressful period. With this focus, the
selected priority areas \vere areas in which a number of reforms were envisaged or being
launched or under way and for wh ich specific corrective actions cou ld be taken with a reasonable
prospects of success.

In those individual areas, the Bank and the authorities had al ready an ongoing dialogue, s upported
inter alia by other Bank operations and/or sector work underpinning the reforms. There was
particularly continuity in a number of specific areas8 in which the PRSC l , Jl and III were already
being providing s upport: (i) strengthening budgetary and finan cial procedures; (ii) procurement
processes and systems; and (i ii) decentralization. particulm·ly tinancial transfers to local
Governments. Significant prior analytical work had been carried out on the fiduciary front. Of
particular help was also tbe work undertaken fo r the LMF PS I. In road maintenance, the second
transport sector program PST2 (closed in 2007) and the preparatory work for the new Transport
and Urban Mobility Project (approved May 3. 2010), provided solid analytical underpinnings and
a strong basis for dialogue. Likewise, in forest resources management, the PROG EDE I project
and its follow-up administered under the 2005 Rural electrification project, pJus the preparatory
activities for a future Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project PROG EDE 11
provided signiJicant input for the design of th is PFSC. All in all , the selected priority areas were
also key areas within three pill ars of tl1e Government's PRSPs: better governance (pat1icularly the
fiduciary reforms and decentralization), wealth creation and access to social services.

of corresponding actions (primarily prior actions) is detailed below and also shown in Annex 7
(Government's Policy Matrix and outcome indicators).

          Public finance management

Regarding PFM, the PFSC aimed at restoring budget discipline and increasing transparency
through a set of measures covering on the one had mainly budget preparation, execution, controls
and on the other hand procurement. While significant progress had been achieved under the PFM
refonn program purs ued by Government since the early 2000s, the various assessments carried
out in 2007-2008 highlighted a number of \veaknesses and deficiencies.

Weaknesses in budget preparation, incl uding poor expenditure estimates, undermined the
credibility of the budget and complicated budget execution. This often created the need for many
subsequent adjustm ents through s hifts and line transfers of budget appropriations, and resulted in
budget overruns, as well as cash flow problems. To address these problems, a new budget
preparation decree was issued in February 2009, to improve the budget procedures by revising the
budget preparation calendar for early preparation and with clear early top-down constraints to
individual ministries budgets. The decree also reinforced the quality of the Parliamentary budget
debate9 . The implementation of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) had only
yielded limited gains 10 by early 2009 and no specific MTF related actions were included under
this PFSC. It was recognized that the reform of budget preparation through a program budget
approach is an. ambitious and lengthy undertaking, requiring among other things a new organic
law on budget laws.

A number of weaknesses had also been identified in budget execution procedures. First an overly
broad and frequent recourse to simplified expenditure payment procedures ("treasury advances"),
normally reserved for emergencies. As a consequence the authorities adopted revised regulations
prohibiting "treasury advances", and confining strictly derogatory expenditure procedures to the
cases envisaged by the regulations. Second, the principle of circumscribing budget execution
operations strictly within the annual budget cycle was found not lo be strictly followed , with
budget operations taking place we ll after the end of the budget year, and large carry-overs
from year to year. In response. the authorities restated by decree the budget-closing scltedule,
and issued a decree by end February 2009 - a prior action of the PFSC- that strict(l' limits
carry-overs to no more than 5 percent o f current year appropriations, with residual carry-overs
applied against (and s ubstituting fo r) current year appropriations. To make this mechanism fully
operational, tm inventory of all active public procureme111 co11tracts n eeded to be carried out
(second part of that prior action). Final ly, as a third pa11 of that prior action. tire Council of
Ministers at/Opted for fiscal year 2009 a Supplemental Budget reflecting new carry-over rules.

Measures were also undertaken to address weaknesses on the IT front. The computerized budget
management system (S!GI' IP) of .IvfEF had not yielded all its potential for generating increased

transparency and controllability of U1e budget, in part because of delays in completing the
upgrading of the accounting computer system and the development of integration tools for budget
and accounting systems. The obsolescence of the existing IT tool used for accounting hampered
the capacity to produce timely and reliable information for budget payments, cash flow
management and budget steering, as well as the production of controllable public accounts. The
IT application at the Treasury was rudimentary and outdated. To start addressing those
weaknesses, the Government undertook, as prior actions: (i) to make the new accounting system
(ASTER) futTctional in all the centralizing accounting stations, as evidenced by the production of
a monthly balance of the T reasury on ASTER; and (ii) to publish monthly hu.dget execution
reports (Situation d'execution budgetaire) from SIGF IP on the website of the MEF.

One important ol~jective of the Government PFM's reform program is to reinforce external
control of the budget. Senegal has ao Audit Office (Cow· des Compres). functional since 200 I,
with the mandate to pass judgment on the accounts of the publ ic accountants, ensure the auditing
of accounts and of the management of public establishments and enterprises, assist the Parliament
and the Government in controlling budget Jaw execution, and conduct all manner of studies on
the public finances and the Government accounts. However, its effectiveness had been hampered
by delays in examin ing public accounts. The authorities thus committed to speed up the
transmission of budget execution laws and public accounts to this Audit Office. As a prior action
to the PFSC, U  1e authoriti es prepared the public accounts for 2006 and submitted them to the
Audit Office. Beside the issue of late tiling of public accounts by the Treasury, there is also a
need to improve the technical capacity of the Audit OOice staff, for which donor assistance has
been secured.

Follo·wing the 2003 CPAR the Government s howed a clear commitment to modernize the
N ational Procurement System (NPS). The procurement regulatory and institutional framework
and management capacity have considerably improved since. In 2006 a new Procurement Law
was adopted which complies w·ith theW AEMU 's Procurement Directives and a new procurement
code was a pproved by the Government in April 2007. A Public Procurement Regulatory
Authority, Agence de Regulation des ivfarches Publics (A RMP). an autonomous and independent
structure - respons ible for policy, handling complaints from bidders, carrying out independent
audits was created and the National Procurement Department (OCMP) was set up to ensure
appropriate internal controls of procurement transactions handled by the contracting authorities.
Several key impl ementing regulations were prepared, including national standard bidding
documents (NSBDs) for works, goods and consulti11g services. Still, those were not yet officially
approved by the Govemment, and the use of ARMP user's procurement manua l for contracti ng
entities was not yet mandatory. Adoption of the NSBD.'I and making their use compulsory was
another PFSC's p rior action. Finally. the authorities also contracted a large-scale audit of
procurement contracts for 2008, covering all sole source contracts 11 and a significant sample of
other contracts, that was completed by the end of 2009.

Further reform actions on the PFM front have been prepared to be implemented later, as follow-
up of those carried out at tlle time of preparation of the PFCS and of its prior actions. To move
more forcefully on the.se issues, the MEF developed and adopted in October 2009 an overall PFM
action plan. This comprehensive plan of reforms. actions and capacity upgrading spans the full
an·ay of PMF issues under an exhaustive, time-bound and sequenced program, drawing on self-

assessment and recommendations from development partners. Moreover. since the adoption of
this plan, Senegal has undertaken to modernize further its budget framework within the context of
new WAEMU Directives adopted in June 2009.

            Fiscal risks from public sector entities

Roughly one quarter of Senegal's the investment budget (or about 2 percent of GDP) is executed
by a growing number12 of autonomous publ ic sector agencies and specialized funds. which enjoy
relative management autonomy. Their budgets and budget execution plans are only weakly
monitored . A strong monitoring, accountability and control apparatus of the management of
public resources by these agencies has been Jacking. A Jaw with its implementing decrees was
therefore prepared to improve the framework for the creation, operat ion and eventual closure of
public sector agencies. As a prior action to the PFSC this law was submitted to parliamellt,
adopted, and the implementing regulatiOil!:l' were issued.

This problem of fi scal risks extends to Senegal 's public hospitals which arc in a difficult financial
situation. The reform of the hospital system started in 1998 aimed at enhancing hospital
autonomy. But at the same time however. very limited accountability was put in place. Given the
fiscal risks emanating fi·om the deep financial problems of the public hospital sector, a set of
urgent corrective measures needed to be taken. As prior action to the PFSC, an action plan was
thus initiated to rebuild the oversight function and begin to restore the financiaL soundness of
hospitals, comprised of: (i) the adoption by the managers of the twenty hospitals. the Ministry of
Health, and the MEF of a memorandum of understanding that ensures that twenty hospitals
de velop a financial recovery plan as a condition for state financial assistance; (i i) the creation of
an inter-ministerial committee, including representatives from the Ministry of Health and the
MEF, responsible for the oversight of hospital recovery plans; ( iii) the creation of an oversight
tw it f or the S esame plrm u of the Ministry of Health: and (iv) adoption and publication of a
decree by the Council of Ministers that sets out a health map for 2008-2013.

            Protecting key developmental objectives

At a time when it was essential that the authorities maintain a tight fi scaJ policy, it was also
important that they pursue their efforts towards key developmental objectives. Following that
approach, the PFSC focused on three areas where efforts were particularl y needed and on which
the Bank had a good dialogue with the Government, including through other Bank projects and
programs: forest resources management, road maintenance and decentralization.

With respect to forest resources management. there has been increasingly heavy pressure on
those resources as wood fuels remain the poor households' main energy source in Senegal. The
Senegalese policy ti'amcwork for forest resources management provides tor a transfer of the
responsibility of natural resources and community forests where charcoal is produced to local
governments. The strategy adopted by the authorities to meet an important part of tl1e rapidly
growing urban demand fo r household fu els without the loss of forest cover and the ecosystem ' s

                                       14
Participatory Energy Management Project PROGEDE I.

However achievement of its objectives has continued to be undermined by the persistence of an
outdated charcoal quota system with a centrally-controlled administrative all ocation system for
wood cutting licenses. Licenses were fraudulently used to produce charcoal outside the zones
managed under locally approved forest management plans under this system wllich: (i) was
fundamentall y inconsistent with the objectives of transferri ng to local communities the
management of forest resources and (ii) was reportedly rife with opportunities for corruption. The
abolition of the quota system and the un iversal enforcement of decentralization principles fo r
community forest resource management was thus a policy priority. As prior action under the
PFSC, the Ministry in charge of environment adopted and published a ministerial ordinance
confirm ing the abolition of the quota system, starting from 2010, and the prohibition of wood
cutting for charcoal production in non-community managed forests.

Senegal's road network, once in relatively good shape, has been deteriorating since the early I 990
as road maintenance has been beset by under-budgeting and budget under-execution. First the
basic institutional design- a road fund held by the Treasury. funded from general resources
tllrough a line appropriation in the general investment budget- has not ensured that resources
allocated to road maintenance kept pace with the expansion of the nef\.vork. Second, when cas h
tensions emerge, difficult arbitrages between competing priorities have not fa vored road
maintenance.     Funds to be transferred to the road works agency AATR, in charge of
implementing the maintenance programs, have often been paid out with imponant delays and on
a non-predictable basis. Efforts made over the years to increase fu ndjng IS have remained
insufficient. Studies under the Bank supported Second Transpor1 Sector Program PST2 estimated
that the annual allocation to routi ne road maintenance should rapidly be scaled up to about US$80
to US$1 00 million to avoid accelerated depreciation of the country's road capital and identified a
serious backlog in road rehabilitation of about US$400 million. The studies also confirmed the
need to improve the institutional arrangements.

As a result, the Govenuncnt decided to create an autonomous second generation Road Fund -
Fonds d'Entretien Routier Autonome (FI::RA) - to be positioned in the central bank and to be
funded directly by fuel distributors from existing and additional taxes on gasoline and gasoil (user
charges). The FERA is to be administered under a chief executive selected competitively for a
three year period. As the implementation of the new financing arrangements would be phased
over three years, the FERA will in the interim be funded through a mix of budget appropriations,
declining over time, and the user charges, increasing over time. With the objective to make the
FERA fully operational by mid-2009, as prior actions under the PFSC, the fo llowing
corresponding actions were thus taken: (i) adoption by the Council of Ministers (COM) of the
decree creating FERA; ( ii) adoption by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the decree
creating the road user charge; (i ii) appoi11tment of FERA 's administrator; (iv), opening of

   rhis first operation with US$20 million funding and ended in December 2004 was follow.od by US$ 7.2 million
successor operation up to December 2008.

     The road fund allocation increased tripled from US$ 12 mill ion in 1998 to US$36 million in 2008.

FERA 's account at the central bank, and (v) transfer to litis account of proceeds f rom tlte road
user cltarges through the adoption by the COM of a supplemental budget for F Y 2009
authorizing such transfer. Making the FERA operational is a significant achievement of this
PFSC after a long history of unsuccessful efforts - under a series of Bank supported
transport/infrastructure projects- to set up an appropriate road maintenance funding mechanism.

Under Senegal's cautious and progressive decentralization policy, central Government has
devolved to local Governments the management of public programs in nine competencies
(environment and natural resources, education, health, population and social action, youth, sport
and leisure, culture, local development pl anning, urban development, and hous ing). However in
practice the transfer of resources has not yet been aligned with the transfer of responsibilities as
among other things the tax base is highly centralized. The flow of fiscal transfers to local
G overnments is managed from the central budget through two dedicated funds, a local
Government operating fu nd the Fonds de Dotation de Ia Decentralisation (FDD) and a local
Government investment fun d the, Fonds d'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (FECL). Weak
local Government capacity also remains a significant constraint in the decentralization process
and the Government has thus developed an institutional program for supporting the gradual
improvement in local Government capacity with donor support. Addressing these political,
institutional and operational constraints to an effective decentralization program will be a long
term undertaking, beyond the scope of the PFSC. For the short term, it is important that fundi ng
both for direct local Governments and for Government agencies responsible for technical
assistance to local Governments be protected and increased. The immediate challenge remains
thus that of providing; suffic ient central Government transfers. As prior action to the PFSC, the
MEF thus tran.sferred budgetary appropriations for th e FDD ami FECL to local communities
for FY 2009.

The number of prior actions, I 0, may appear large for a swiftly prepared stand alone operation,
but was manageable, given the prior work undertaken by the Government with the Bank and
other donors, includi ng through the PRSCs and a number of projects in the different selected
policy areas. All 10 prior actions were completed in a timely manner.

2.2 Major F actors Affecting Implementation.

The factors which contributed to the successful implementation of the PFSC include fi rst the
experience gajned in preparing and implementing the series of three PRSCs, plus a number of
factors w hich already contributed to the largely successful outcome of those the PRSCs: strong
Government ownership. sound underlying analytical work and good coordination among donors.
The design of operation - a quick-reaction stand-alone operation responding to Senegal urgent
need for financial assistance, and its agenda narrowly focused on a relatively few pol icy areas
with well selected core objectives, were also tactors of success. Weak administrative capacity
was identified as a potentially negative factor; but as an improvement to the PRSCs, it turned out
as generally adequate at all G ovem mcnt levels involved. Another potentially negative factor
could have been an unfavorable political context/calendar. These key factors are further
discussed below.

Government ow ners hip was strong, particularly around the theme of PFM modernization. for
which Senegal has been pursuing a program of re forms s ince the early 2000s. T he modernization
of PFM is central to the fourth pillar of the PRSP2 and more broadly constitutes a cornerstone for
the successful implementation of Senegal's overa ll poverty reduction strategy. The 2007 PRSP
Annual Progress Report (APR) had highlighted that performance on this PRSP pillar of economic



                                                 lO
governance had been mjxed. The 2008 fiscal slippages also represented a significant setback.
Hence the increased resolve of the authorities to restore the integrity and transparency of the
budget framework and to put in place appropriate measures to strengthen PFM at large. Another
factor underpinning the Government comm itment on this core PFM strengthening theme is the
fact that this theme is a central component of the dialogue with the donors on the management of
external assistance in the spirit of the Paris Declaration. Also, since the 2003 CPA R the
Government has showed a clear commjtment to modernize its public procurement system.
Likewise, the Governrnent has also demonstrated a new commitment on starting to reduce the
fiscal risks emanating from the increasing number of public entities as a first step to improve their
governance. Finally, overall, the key implementing agency, the MEr has shown strong
commitment to push the reform efforts, starting with the prior actions.

Sound background analysis and other work. The PFSC benefiued fi·orn high quality
background work by the Bank in all the policy areas selected for this DPO - work in support to
the first series of PRSCs as well as for specific projects and T A activities in those areas. The
PFSC complements particularly well other Bank development policy, capacity building and
investments operations in those areas. Substantial analytical work was carried out with respect to
PFM, including core diagnostic assessment~ by the Bank in collaboration with the Government
and other donors, such as Public Expenditure Reviews (2005 and 2006). the 2002 CFAA and the
2003 CPAR . These works documented fisca l policy issues as well as the numerous \veaknesses
in PFM, and provided a range of recommendations on the legal framework and operational
approaches (including the integrated PFM system). on which the preparation of the PFSC has
drawn extensively. T he design of PFM reforms also reJjed on the EU-funded PEF A djagnostic of
2007, and on an IMF Fiscal Affairs Department Technical Assistance report on PFM. In
procurement, this DPO has drawn not only on the 2003 CPAR but also more broadly on the
Bank's longstanding program of suppor1 to procurement reforms in Senegal, including capacity
building under the Private Investment Promotion Project (FY03). In the non-PFM areas. the
PFSC builds on sector work, T A and policy dialogue s upported by Bank financed activities
including: (i) a report on the implementation of hospital reform in Senegal over 1998-2007 and
other preparation work for a future Hospital Refom1 TA project; (ii) a Country Environmental
Assessment (FY08), a.s well as project preparation work activities for the follow-up Sustainable
and Participatory Energy Management project (PROGEDE2); (iii) a Transport and Infrastructure
Study (FY07), as well as other work for the second Sectoral Transport Project PST2 and the new
Transport and Mobi lity Project (FYOlO); and (iv) activities related to the Local Authorities
Development Program and the National Program for Local Development and Urban Mobility
Improvement.

Donor Coor dina tion : The PFSC benefitted - like the PRSC series before - from the close
coordination existing among donors in most policy areas. Most bilateral and multi lateral
development agencies have an active presence in Seoegal and support the PRSP. Considerable
progress has been made in recent years in harmonizing development assistance to Senegal,
following the principles articulated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effecti veness and in the
Africa Action Plan (AAP). A significant number of Senegal's development partners deliver
assistance through budgetary support (EU. France, Netherlands, and Canada) and are thus
particularly concerned by the modernization of Senegal's PFM.

The partners have enhanced their coll aboration in the design of budget support operations,
including with the adoption in early 2008 of a Memorandum of Understanding- the Framework
Agreement on Budget Support (Accord Cadre pour les Appuis Budgetaires, ACAB). Under the
ACAB, common evaluation processes have been set up on macroeconomic conditions, progress
in implementing the PRSP-ll, and PrM reforms. Particularly relevant to the Pres is the close


                                                 Il
working relationship between the IMF and the Bank, especially with respect to PFM reforms, an
area in w hich they maintain close coordination and collaboration to ensure that consistent advice
is provided to the authorities. This productive collaboratjon has continued under the IMF three-
year program under the P S I approved in December 2007. The implementation o f PFM and
procurement reforms is supported by several other donors ( France, EU, Canada, and the
Netherlands) with technical and fi nancial assis tance. The Bank and/or other donors are also
supporting improvement efforts in decentralization, hospital reform, road maintenance and
forestry resource management. £n particular the EU and AFDB have a strong partners hip with the
Bank in the road sector in Senegal.

Design of operation a nd participatory process. The specific design of the PSFC as a quick-
reaction stand-alone operation res ponding to Senegal urgent need for financial assistance -
generating a new momentum for reform s - and its agenda focu sed on a few policy areas with well
selected core objectives, were also factors of s uccess. The design of the PFSC has drawn on the
PRSP ll wh ich has benefited from broad stakeholders consultations, plus consultative inputs from
stakeholders participation in the Government's PRSP and ACAB policy matrix reviews and the
update of the PRSP monitoring indicators. It benefited also from s takeholder consultations
undettaken through the preparation of the ICR on the fi rst series ofPR SCs.

The political context and calenda r, fi rst with the March 2009 local elections marked by the
victory of opposition parties in several key urban centers, did not tumed out as a negative factor
during preparation and implementation of this DPO. The post election cabinet changes did not
result in significant discontinuity affecting the key poli cy actions, as key Ministers, including the
ministers of economy & finance and budget kept their post. A changing and more complex
political context may have an impact later, with the upcoming presidential elections in 201 2. It is
more in the longer term that the political context could impact negatively the outcome of thjs
operation - with some risks of slowing down of reforms or worse, reversals.

Relevance of Risks identified a nd Risks Mitigation

Three types of ris ks that could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits of this operation
had been identi fied: (i) a deeper and/or longer macroeconomic downturn in the current global
context than anticipated; (ii) opposition from vested interests; and (ii i) weak capacity to
implement re forms. It was anticipated that the desi gn of this operation, with a relatively focused
agenda and high donor involve).llent, would help mitigate these ris ks. The risks of weak
administrative capacity was expected: (i) to be relatively minor, in part given the large num ber of
highly trained technocrats in Senegal; and (ii) to be mitigated by the support from several donors
plus the Bank with techn ical and financ ial assistance for the implementat ion of PFM/
procurement reforms, and by support fi·om the Bank or other donors to capacity improvement in
the other selected policy areas. Political opposition, including from vested interests, could
represent important obs tacles to reform, especially reforms that foster transparency in the use of
public resources. Under the PFSC those risks were expected to be mitigated by tJ'le fact that all
key policy measures were to be implemented before cred it approval and were also contingent on
the dialogue between the Government and the IMF under the PS I second review.

For the longer term, there are ris ks of reversals, but continued Bank engagement with a core team
almost entirely fi eld-based also enl1ances the likeli hood that reforms are being followed through
and policies s ustained. A deeper and/or longer macroeconom ic downturn in the cun-ent global
context than anticipated still represents a significant risk, as Senegal's short-term pros pects
continue to depend to a significant extent on developments in the global economy. One clear
mitigation strategy is for the authorities to continue to steer a stable fi scal course and adopt


                                                  12
resolute refonns, espec ially in the PFM area., that may in turn mo bilize donors to prov ide
additional resources to buffer the budget from the consequences of a more abrupt slow down. So
far been the authorities have maintained this course and on the macro-front, GDP growth rate is
                    h percent a nd could return by 20 12 to the historic trends of 4~ percent.
expected to reach 3 1

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utiliza tion:

The PFSC used the monitoring and evaluation system of Senegal's PRSP which is considered to
be broadly well designed and relies primarily on the relatively good M&E system jn MEF. The
Prime Minister chairs quarterly high level PRS supervision meetings wi th the participation of top
Government officials. A joint annual revie w of the PRS P is prepared on an annual basis. The
annual review of the PRS agenda is well aligned with the budgetary calendar. facilitating the
monitoring of links between the PRS P progress review and the preparation of the budget. Since
the approval of lhe PFSC the authoritjes have continued to e xchange detailed budget e xecution
data and fully collaborated wit h Bank sta ff on the implementation ofthc PFM reforms. Under the
ACAB arrangements a common policy matrix between Government a nd donors, facilitates joint
review and supervision on macroeconomic developments, progress in implementing the PRSP
and especially in Public Secto r Management/ PFM reforms. Ove rall, the engagement with a Bank
team almost entirely based in Dakar has allowed to monitor the progress on a continuous basis.
During the short (nine months) implementation period of the PFSC, very limited wr itten reporting
                                                                    16
material has been prepared by the authorities or the Bank team specifically and only for the
PFSC. Progress has been primarily repo11ed separate ly and d iscussed in various documents
prepared for: (i) the follow-up PRSC4 approved on Apri l 30, 2010; and (ii) several investment
and TA operations s ubsequently approved or currently under pre paration in the policy areas of the
PFSC other than PFM and procurement, as detailed below.

2.4 Expected Follow-up Operations:

The FY07-FY 10 C AS had anticipated that the first series ofPRSCs was to be followed by a new
series of PRSCs initia lly expected to start in FY09. In the exceptional circumstances Senegal was
facing in late 2008-early 2009, it was clear that the PFSC as an interim stand-alone operation for
FY09 would be a more appropriate instrument for immediate Bank support at that critical
juncture instead of the first of the new series o f PRSCs. This approach al so provided breathing
room to the authorities for the design a nd implementation of medium-term agenda that could be
supported by the next series of PRSCs. Considering the progress t7 acco mpl ished during 2009 in
the implementation by the Government of the structura l and fi scal corrective actions needed to
avoid recurrence of budget s lippages, the positive outcome of the PFSC and the s ustained
commitment of the Governn1eot to pursue reforms under the PRSP2, pre paration of the new
PRSCs went ahead during F YO lO. PRSC-IY, the first of a series of three programmatic PRSCs
was approved in April 20 I0. Their overarching o~jective is to suppo11 impl ementation of PRSP2
in its last year a nd assist the authorities in the development and earl y implementation of PRSP3
which should be fi nalized by December 20 10. The focu s of the new PRSCs include among other

  Only one lSR of December 12, 2009. No separate specific reponing was prepared for the PFSC on the progress

things PfM and Public Procurement 18 , road maintenance, and the hospital policy (including
corporate and financial governance) - w ith their corresponding com ponents a nd actions in
follow-up to the PFSC.

A lthough they a re not strictly speaking tollow-up operations to this DPO, other new Bank
projects in the policy areas of the PFSC should be mentioned. In non PFM areas, the Bank: (i)
prepared the US$55 mill ion T ransport and Urban Mobility Project (approved in May 20 I 0)
featuring a Sector Policy Letter stressing road maintenance and financing around the FERA; ( ii)
prepared the Second Phase of the Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project
(PROGEDE ll) to fUJ1her improve forest resources management; a nd (iii) is preparing a TA
project in the health sector to suppot1 hospital reform.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 R elevance of O bjectives, Design and Imple mentation

The PFSC objectives and des ign were highly relevant to country development pnonttes and
specific circumstances in 2008-2009, and were consistent with Bank strategies and goal s. T he
PFSC was aligned with the FY07-0l 0 CAS which focused on three pillars ((i) accelerated
growth/wealth creation; (i i) human development /shared growth; a nd ( iii) rural and urban
synergy) and was also structured around a governance filter aim ing inter alia at: (i) improving
transparency and efficiency in the use of public resources; and (ii) increasing public sector
accountability. The PFSC's three areas o f focus - improving PFM, rnitigating th e fiscal risks
emanating from public sector entities and protecting selected developmental objectives - are well
aligned w ith Government's priorities under both PRSP- 1 and PRSP-2. The measures s upported
by the PFCS were essential for the Government efforts to restore budget discipline and increase
transparency. These measures were complementary to critical actions being taken under the IMF
PSI. The PFSC also com plements well the Bank' s portfolio of investment projects. The PFSC
entailed significant synergies with other donors, especially those involved in budgetary support..

The choice of a stand-alone operation and its narrow ly focused des ign were quite appropriate
given Senegal's urgent need for financial assistance in 2008-09 and the authorities increasing
focus on PFM issues. The stand-alone nature of the PFSC was important to respond to a crisis
situation in which Bank support needs to be customized to the pa11icular country circumstances
and priorities. T he measures under the third area of focus, particularly on forest resources and
road maintenance, deserve special mention: abolishing the quota system for charcoal production
and operationalization of the FERA were complex but critical actions in their respective sectors
that had been contemplated 19 for significant time but were not taken by the Senegal ese authorities
under the previous Bank supported opera tions. The number of prior actions was relati vely high
but manageable.




" The US$8 million Economic Governance Project (approved in May 20 I 0) wil! also strengthen effective the
Investigation Unit of the Pub Iic Procurement Agency .


19
     Tit is is thus a good example of go\ld leverage associated w ith a DPO.




                                                             14
3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The overall program development objectives of the PFSC were threefold: (i) to bring Senegal's
fiscal stance to a sound and sustainable track; (ii) mitigate fiscal risks emanating from public
sector entities; and (iii) protect critical developmental objectives at a time when the authorities
had to maintajn a tight fiscal poJjcy and cope with the impact of the global crisis.

Most of the PFSC's actions build upon actions started during the PRSC I, ll and Ill and other
Bank operations. One can thus not entirely disaggregate the impact of the PfSC from those
operations. Likewise one should not minimize the linkage with activities of other donors,
particularly the IMF. The achievements of higher level objectives should thus not be attributed
exclusively or primarily to the PFSC. Its achievements can be first assessed with some degree of
certainty in relation to the specific policy objectives for which prior actions were carried out.
Given the short period of implementation of this operation 20 , assessing now its long term
achievements may be premature or overoptimistic. The longer term achievements of the PFSC
could be discussed on the basis of the progress achieved until today in the preparation of PRSC
TV (Report No. 52748 - SNCFT) and preparation and/or implementation of the other new Bank
operations mentioned in section 2.4.

As detailed above (in Section 2. 1 Program Pe1j   ormance), the PFSC was successful in supporting
the Government's acti ons in three policy areas. The outcomes rating in this ICR are based on an
assessment of the indicators set out to track progress in the areas of focus, primarily as a result of
the prior actions. For 9 of the l 0 indicators, the outcome by early 2010 match or exceed the
targets set at appraisal. Regarding the remaining indicator - the extent o f the use of National
Standard Bidding documents - the outcome has not yet been measured 21 precisely but there are
indications that thei r use on a steady increase (??). /\ significant achievement of the PSFC has
been to give a new impetus or to reinforce the impetus for reforms particularly in PFM,
procurement, forest resources management and road maintenance. As mentioned before,
particularly worth mentioning is the operationalization of FERA.22 for road maintenance and the
abolition of the wood cutting/charcoal quotas eventually achieved under this DPO. As currently
seen in the context of the PRSC-IV, the authorities are now pursuing with vigor the
comprehensive PFM action plan adopted in October 2009 and have undertaken to modemize
further the budgetary framework following the new W AEMU Directives. Likewise, sustained
progress can be seen : (i) in bringing the new road maintenance arrangements to speed with
increased funding under the PRSCJV and the FYOIO Transl)ort and UJban Mobility Project; and
(ii) in further improvements of forest resources management under the FYO 10 PROGEDE II
project. Progress is also anticipated in the hospital sector with the implementation of the

framework of public agencies. In this vein, the Govenu11erH established a Parastatal Sector
Directorate in the Treasury to improve the supervision of the Agencies and is committed to
strengthen its ca pac ity w ith technical and fi nanc ial resources. T here is less concrete evidence yet
that progress will be sustained in the medium to long term in the area of decentralization.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outco me Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOsj

Rating: Satisfactory

Justification: T he PFSC' s design, objectives and measures taken were highly relevant to Senegal
overall development needs and PRSP goa ls; its design and fast reaction approach were
particularly adapted to the unusual crisis context of Senegal in 2008-2009, especially after the
budget slippages. Its achievements arc overall satisfactory. with immediate concrete positive
outcomes and longe r term benefits which so far see m to be sustainable considering the s ustained
momentum of reforms (as seen under the subsequent FYOI0 o perations) and the steady
commitment of the authorities. As detailed in the next section, the institutional impact of this
operation has been impoxtant.

The outcome is particularly significant in the enJ1ancement of budget preparation and of external
controls of the budget. For exam ple (as just seen in the course of preparation of the PRSC IV) the
budget execution laws up to 2008 have now been submitted to the Audit O ffice (Cour des
Comptes) and Parl iam ent has now at last approved the reviewed budget execution laws fro m 1999
to 2002.      T he outcome is also highly satisfactory for road maintenance, where the
operational ization of FERA is long-awaited c ritical step for Senegal transport sector and poverty
reduction.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

annual budgeting and budget comprehensiveness principles restored. Oversight of the public otT-
budget entities was reinforced with the adoption of the new law on the regulatoty fram ework of
public agencies and the establishment of the Parastatal Sector Directorate in the Treasury. In the
hospital sector, the PFSC was instrumental in: (i) the creation of an inter-ministerial committee,
including representatives from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
responsible for the oversight of hospital recovery plans; (ii) the creation of an oversight unit for
the Sesame plan of the Ministry of Health.

Regarding public procurement, a significant institutional step has been the fonnal adoption by
ARMP of the standard bidding documents for works. goods and consulting services and the
making the use of such documents mandatory in public procurement. Finally, as mentioned
above, the operationa.lization of FERA has been a significant institutional change for road
maintenance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: moderate

Justificatio n: The reform steps and policy actions undertaken under the PFSC provide a basis for
additional reforms under subsequent operations. The fiduci ary framework has been strengthened,
and a number of actions taken have created a momentum that should not be easily stopped. There
continues to be however a number of risks to sustainability. Further surges in international
foodstuffs and energy prices could threaten economic stabil ity.            But mostly a long
macroeconomic downturn in the global context affecting Senegal's fairly open economy
represents a significant risk. While major policy reversals are unlikely, there is still a risk of a
slowdown with a lack of resolve to move forward with diffi cult structural refonns especially in
the context of 20 l2 presidential elections. Weaknesses in ti scal governance, and some
administrative capacity constraints in pursing effectively reforms can also not be entire ly
discounted.

Mitigating factors to these risks include the policy dialogue underpinned by a continued Bank
engagement with a core team almost entirely field-based, continued budgetary support in the
context of the follow-on PRSCs; Government commitment and donor support to the goals of
Senegal's poverty reduction program; and improved coordination among donors through the
ACAB.

The Bank was able to respond to the Senegal ' s urgent financia l needs in a difficult juncture with a
stand-alone operation designed around a core set of critical actions focused on the authorities'
concern on PFM issues, starting with budgetary matters. Its objectives were well aligned with the
Government's development agenda, priorities, and policies as set out in the PRSPs. Its priority
areas were consistent w ith the PRS strate gy and complementary to other Bank operations and
actions of other donors involved in budgetary support and PFM reform. It was closely
coord inated w ith the IMF PSI. lt incorporated key lessons leam ed from the series of PRSC 1-IH
and built on e xtens ive and solid analytica l/fiduc iary wo rk unde11aken by the Bank in suppo1 1 the
PRSP and for other operations in several sectors. It was designed in a generally partici patory
manner. 1t relied on specific indicators and emphasized concrete res ults.

It was put together primarily by a well-balanced Bank team, composed to a large extent o f fi eld
based staff, involved in a continuous dialogue w ith the authorities and local representatives of the
other donors. The exemplary way thjs multi-sectoral team used synergies to develop rapidly a
DPO covering several policy areas and that was still well focused, deserves to be specially
highlighted.

(b) Qua lity of S uperv ision

Rating: Satisfactory

Supervision appears to have been appro priate in substance. The Bank team conducted the
supervision while at the same time monitoring the implementation of tbe actions/refo rms in the
policy areas in the context of preparation of PRSC IV. However, except for one single ISR, no
specific \Vritten supervision material was produced for the PFSC. Ac hievements under the PFSC
and further progress of reform can be assessed primarily by reviewi_ng the material written 111
preparation of the PRSC IV a nd through interviews.

(c) J ustification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ra ting: Satisfactory

The overall perfo rmance can be considered as satisfactory. The Ban.k was able to respond rapidly
to Senegal's urgent needs with a stand-alo ne operation, with a design appropd ately tailored to
circumstances, w ith a focus and policy content based on a solid dialogue with the Senegalese
authorities.

                                                  18
testimony to the Government's commitment. Political will of the Government to pursue reforms
was present throughoul preparation and irnplemcntation of this DPO and was sustained thereafter
in the course of preparation of the follow-up PRSC TV. The institutional stability - with the key
ministers for the DPO staying despite the reshuffle following the local e lections - was also a
factor of success. A major factor behind the positive results was the willingness and overaU
capacity of the MEF - the implementing agency to push the PFSC actions across the different
policy areas.

The PFSC benefi tted from the paJticipatory process used for PRSPs. Consultative inputs were
also drawn from stakeholders participation in the Government's PRSP and ACAB policy matrix
reviews and the update of the PRSP monitoring indicators and stakeholder consultations
undertaken through tbe preparation of the ICR on the first series of PRSCs. The PFSC relied on
the system monitoring and evaluation system of the PRSP which had proven to be broadly well
designed and was further improved for the preparation of the APR for the year 2007. The
authorities ful ly collaborated with the Bank in the implementation of the reform acti ons and in
exchanging detai led data.

6. Lessons Learned

Several lessons were learned:

1. A quick reaction stand-alone operation responding to lhe needs and predicament of Senegal in
the critical 2008-2009 period like the PFSC can be prepared s wiftly and sti ll produce significant
results if it is underpinned by solid analytical work and a strong and dialogue in well selected
areas. This was particularly the case in the PFM and Public Procurement areas of this DPO.

2. Despite a being stand-alone operation, sucb a DPO can have a significant development impact
particularly if it is following-up on a series of prior DPOs and other Bank operations, and even
more so if in turn it is followed by DPOs and other operations, wh ich deepen the actions
undertaken under the stand-alone DPO by building on the reform momentum helped create.
Working on s uch a long term basis allows to select for the stand-alone DPO appropriate
objectives wh ich can realistically achieved. Designing in fu ll isolation a stand-alone DPO is a
much more risky proposition.

3. In that vein, PFM reforms are complex and ambitious programs that can only be reasonably
envisaged over a long time span follo,ving a carefully designed long term action plan. PFM
modernization measures included in the PFSC provided a solid basis and impetus for further
reforms; but those are likely not be fully achieved unless the Government is fully committed to
implement such a long term action plan, and if possible with further donors s upport Such
support can indeed be a follow-up series of DPOs but should ideally also include a dedicated
PFM reform T A project. The cmrent plan of the Bunk team for Senegal to prepare such T A
project for Senegal is quite timely.

4 . !laving a multi-sectoral group of Bank staff wltich ·worked as real team very closely together
across sector botmdaries, allowed to produce rapidly a coherent multi-sectoral operation in which
the different measures for the different policy areas jibed well. This teamwork was faci litated by
having the core staff workin g from the same location in the field. In turn, location of the core
staff in the field allowed to have a continuously strong dialogue and close coll aboration with the
Senegalese counterparts.




                                                19
5. Without proper oversight, public agencies and other parastatals can rapidl y become poorly
performing entities, run into a difficult financial situation and cause significant fiscal burden on
the State. Many countries have a tendency - like Senegal - to let Public Agencies proliferate,
without paying enough attention to their oversight and governance at large. Likewise. while
elaborating CASes the Bank has tended to overlook those growing problems and not to react to a
serious backtracking 24 with respect to parastatals. Thi s is unfortunate especially when one
compares the current situation with the situation in many countries in the eighties and early
nineties when the Bank was supporting the parastatal reforms with dedicated T A operations and
Adjustment Operations focusing inter alia on parastatals. The stance taken by Bank country
teams in a number of countries that systemic privatization and/or liquidation of parastatals would
basically solve the problems of performance of these entities, has often proven to be unrealistic.
When elaborating new CASes the Bank could usefully systematically review the performance and
governance of the countries' parastatals and consider accordingly if dedicated actions in this area
should not be included in the country program.

6. Several of the lessons learned in the series of PRSCs f-111 listed in their ICR apply also to this
DPO: effectiveness of budget support instruments to address cross-cutting issues, importance of
an institutional anchor, contribution of multi-donor and harmonized budgetary support to reform
implementation (in the context of the ACAB) providing incentives to the Government to proceed
with complex rcfonns. The related and well known lesson is the importance of close coordination
with the lMF for the design and implementation of PFM reforms.
