                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Implementation of the remaining activities under the third project component, Strengthening of Social Welfare Management Information System, is reaching the final stage, whereas
                         all project activities under the first (Improving Social Service Delivery) and third component (Upgrading of Social Service Facilities) have been successfully completed.
                         An extension of the project by three months to March 31, 2011 has been approved to allow for the delivery and installation of the IT and Networking equipment for the National Roll
                         Out of the Social Welfare Information Management System, which procurement took longer than anticipated.
