The\n            restructuring will correct the original mismatch between the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO), the Results Framework\n            (RF), and the project activities which have been under\n            implementation during the last three years. Firstly, the PDO\n            makes reference to improved targeting and administrative\n            simplicity of social benefits, and there are two\n            corresponding outcome indicators, one aiming at 5-10 percent\n            increase in all targeted social benefits that reaches the\n            bottom quintile of the population, and the other referring\n            to improved targeting and administrative simplicity through\n            streamlined benefit entitlements in the social welfare act.\n            However, the project activities, with the exception of one\n            small consultancy, have had no direct impact on achieving\n            improved targeting and administrative efficiency of social\n            benefits. This objective was intended to be achieved through\n            the Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL II), which had\n            one specific condition on improving targeting of social\n            benefits, and was not achieved under that operation.\n            Secondly, the outcome indicator on annual reduction of\n            referrals to resident institutions by 10 percent, starting\n            from 2008, is not attributable to the project, as the\n            project activities did not foresee any transformation of and\n            reduction in the capacity of social welfare residential\n            institutions. Also, several intermediate results indicators\n            related to inappropriate outcome indicators needed to be\n            dropped, revised, and replaced by new indicators to reflect\n            the intended project results."}, "docdt": "2009-08-07T00:00:00Z"}
