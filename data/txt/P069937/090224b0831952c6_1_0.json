World Bank supported Social\n            Welfare Development Project, cared for almost 200 children\n            with severe physical disabilities. Through the project,\n            people with developmental disabilities coped with routine\n            tasks like food shopping, cooking, paying bills, opening a\n            bank account. Fourteen social welfare centers were built or\n            renovated and equipped with a new computer management\n            system. Social workers spent less time on administrative\n            work and more with their clients. Croatia is a good example\n            of a country where changes have been successfully introduced\n            nationwide to benefit the neediest and most vulnerable\n            members of society."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T07:50:04Z"}
