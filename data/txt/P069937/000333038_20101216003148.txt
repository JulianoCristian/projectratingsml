                         Extension of Closing Date

            CROATIA -- SOCIAL WELFARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                                 P069937

                                  Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Croatia Social Welfare Development Project, Loan Number
   7307, will be extended by three months from December 31, 2010 until March 31,
   2011.

2. Implementation of all project-related activities under the first and third project
   components has been successfully completed and project objectives related to those
   components have been met. Steady progress has been made in the implementation of
   two remaining activities under the second project component (development of the
   Social Welfare Management Information System), purchasing and installation of IT
   hardware required for a national roll-out of the new MIS and installation of LAN
   cabling network in social welfare institutions throughout Croatia, however additional
   three months are needed to fully implement the final contracts.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to provide sufficient time to deliver and install
   the IT equipment (US$2.1 million) and install LAN cabling network (US$0.4 million)
   in the social welfare institutions throughout Croatia. The national roll-out of the new
   social welfare management information system is a complex process that requires full
   implementation of three separate IT hardware and software contracts and installation
   of LAN cabling network, as well as their functional integration at the national level.
   Due to the delay in the procurement process, implementation of one of the IT
   hardware contracts will require additional three months to complete, and given the
   other contracts for supply and installation of hardware and software are functionally
   connected with the hardware procured under the contract in question, additional time
   is required for their full integration into one system. This all is expected to be
   achieved by March 31, 2011.

4.     This will be the third extension of the project.
