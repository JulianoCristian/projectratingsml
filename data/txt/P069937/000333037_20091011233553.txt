                             PROPOSAL TO RESTRUCTURE
                   CROATIA SOCIAL WELFARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                                  (Loan No. 7307-HR)

Introduction
1.         T h i s Project Paper seeks the approval o f the World Bank Executive Directors for the
introduction o f changes in the Croatia Social Welfare Development Project (SWDP), Loan 7307-HR
(P069937), and o f the accompanying amendments to the project legal documents. The proposed
changes have been discussed and agreed on with the Republic o f Croatia (the Borrower) and reflect
the findings o f the Joint Portfolio Review carried out in 2009 which recommended that the Project
Development Objective (PDO) and the Project Results Framework (RF) be revised to better reflect
the original project activities o f the project and to better capture the project's expected impact. A
formal letter from the Borrower's Ministry o f Finance dated June 24, 2009 formally requests the
following changes.
2.          The key proposed changes are:
     (a) The revision o f the PDO and the RF. The original PDO i s adjusted to better reflect the original
     project activities which aim to improve social services with only a very limited impact on social
     benefits. Hence, it i s proposed to remove the reference to "social benefits" in the original PDO,
     which refers to "strengthening the quality, targeting and administration o f social benefits and
     services to those most in need." While the project would continue to support enhancing the quality
     o f social services, there would be increased focus on improving administration, planning and
     policy making o f the overall social welfare system. With respect to the RF, three PDO indicators
     are proposed to be dropped and four new added to reflect the change in the PDO and project
     activities. Furthermore, it i s proposed to drop four Intermediate Outcome Indicators, revise four
     indicators and add seven new indicators, again to better reflect original project intentions.
     (b) The reallocation o f Loan proceeds between expenditure categories to increase the allocation
     for civil works from EUR 17 million to EUR 21.1 million and decrease the allocation for goods,
     consultant services and grants from EUR 8 million, EUR 1.5 million and EUR 4 million to EUR
     5.45 million, EUR 0.25 million and EUR 3.7 million respectively.

Background and Reasons for Restructuring
3.         The EUR 31 million IBRD loan for the SWDP was approved on June 14, 2005. The
Swedish International Development Agency contributed to the project with a SEK 14.7 million (EUR
1.4 million) grant. The project became effective on January 30, 2006. In February 2009, the original
closing date o f September 30, 2009 was extended to June 15, 2010, to allow the nation-wide roll-out
o f a new social welfare management and information system (MIS) and the completion o f upgrade
and construction o f several centers for social welfare and upgrade o f social welfare homes.
4.         The original PDO was "to strengthen the quality, targeting and administration o f social
benefits and services to those most in need." The project includes three components: (i)    Improving
Social Services Delivery by developing a sustainable spectrum o f social programs across prevention,
                                                                    i)
service delivery, and client re-integration into the community; ( i Strengthening Social Welfare
Management by improving the reliability and timeliness o f social benefit administrative information
used for cash benefit system oversight and individual claims processing, and implementing `one-stop
                                                i i Upgrading Social Services Facilities by upgrading
shop' administrative services for clients; and ( i )

                                                    3
or constructing new county centers for social welfare and enhancing the safety o f older residential
social service facilities by investing in hygienic upgrades.
5.          Progress to Date. The project i s performing satisfactorily although it had a slow start, due
to creation o f complex implementation structures, including three working groups at the ministry level
and three working groups at the pilot counties. Project implementation particularly improved in 2008,
with government's increased budget allocation, bringing the disbursement to the current 8 1% (92%
committed).
6.          Most activities related to improving social service delivery have been completed and the
following important tools have been developed, including: (i) new county-level social planning
                                                                     a
methodology; (ii)    methodological centers, which are best-practice social institutions equipped to
                                                                                       i iquality standards
provide practical training to practitioners from others social welfare institutions; ( i )
in social service provision; (iv) and a new business model in the centers for social welfare according
to the one-stop-office principle to allow social workers to spend more time o n direct work with the
clients. Social service provision has been strengthened through the project's Innovation and Learning
Program which successfully implements 34 innovative community-based projects, focused on
prevention o f institutionalization, deinstitutionalization or provision o f alternative social care across
country. In addition, physical upgrades o f 45 residential institutions are underway improving the
living conditions o f clients, while 15 centers for social welfare will be upgraded or built by the end o f
the project. Finally, the creation o f software for the MIS, which i s currently in the final stage o f
development, and establishment o f data exchange model with other systems will allow for improved
administration and efficiency o f the overall social welfare system.
7.           Reasons for Restructuring. The proposed restructuring would correct the original
mismatch between the PDO, the RF and the project activities which have been under implementation
during the last three years. Firstly, the PDO makes reference to improved targeting and administrative
simplicity o f social benefits, and there are two corresponding outcome indicators, one aiming at 5-
 10% increase in all targeted social benefits that reaches the bottom quintile o f the population, and the
other referring to improved targeting and administrative simplicity through streamlined benefit
entitlements in the Social Welfare Act. However, the project activities, with the exception o f one
small consultancy, have had n o direct impact o n achieving improved targeting and administrative
efficiency o f social benefits. This objective was intended to be achieved through the Second
Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL I )          ,
                                            I which had one specific condition on improving targeting o f
social benefits, and was not achieved under that operation. Secondly, the outcome indicator o n annual
reduction o f referrals to resident institutions by lo%, starting from 2008, i s not attributable to the
project, as the project activities did not foresee any transformation o f and reduction in the capacity o f
social welfare residential institutions.' Also, several Intermediate Results Indicators related to
inappropriate outcome indicators needed to be dropped, revised, and/or replaced by new indicators to
reflect the intended project results.
8.          Part o f the reason for the misalignment, as described above, lies in the fact that the project
was designed to be implemented in parallel with the P A L series, which among others focused on
rationalization and improved targeting o f social benefits. This explains why the PDO refers to
strengthening o f the quality, targeting and administration o f social benefits, in addition to social
services, while the project components in fact relate to improvements in social services and
strengthening o f administration and policy-making in the social welfare system. The Joint Portfolio



'In addition, this indicator also did not take into account long waiting lists for some types of residential institutions such
as homes for elderly.
                                                               4
Review carried out in 2009 also noted this discrepancy and recommended that the PDO and the RF be
reformulated to better capture the results o f the project.
9.         In sum, while the project has been implementing i t s original activities in all three
components, the PDO and the majority o f outcome and intermediate indicators have either been
misaligned, mis-designed or difficult to monitor. Therefore, the Borrower and the Bank agreed to
reformulate the PDO and to revise the Outcome Indicators and Intermediate Results indicators in a
way that will align them with the originally planned project activities and capture project outcomes.
Proposed Changes
 10.         Revision o f PDO and RF'. For the reasons mentioned above, it i s proposed to revise PDO
by deleting the o l d objective o f strengthening the targeting o f social benefits. The original objective o f
strengthening the quality o f social services would be maintained and the objective o f improving
administration would be reformulated so that improvements in administration are linked with the
overall performance o f the social welfare system. In addition, the proposal i s to add a new objective
o f improving planning and policy making o f the social welfare system which the project has
supported. The RF i s revised in line with the proposed revisions in the PDO. A thorough assessment
o f all outcomes and intermediate results indicators was made during the RF restructuring mission in
March 2009 and a set o f new indicators has been proposed to ensure that the RF more closely reflects
the project activities. Annex 1 shows details o f the original RF in the Project Appraisal Document
alongside the proposed changes to the RF. Annex 2 provides the revised Results Framework with the
baseline data and annual targets until project completion in June 2010.
11.       The revised PDO are as follows: "to strengthen the quality o f social services and to
improve administration, planning and policy making o f the social welfare system."


12.         The main outcome indicators to measure the success o f the project are as follows:



 Objective (PDO)
 Strengthen Quality of Social Services   Improved variety and quality o f social services as evidenced by
                                         increased number o f beneficiaries receiving alternative community-
                                         based services generated by ILP.
                                         Improved quality o f services in public residential social welfare
                                         homes (for children and adults) demonstrated by an increase in the
                                         number o f public homes that meet public health standards.
                                         Improved social care services as measured by an increase in the
                                         number o f clients receiving community-based home care services.
 Improve Administration                  Reduction by at least 15% o f social worker time spent o n
                                         administration.

 Improve Planning and Policy             Increased capacity o f the MHSW and social welfare institutions t o
 Making                                  manage the system as demonstrated by development and
                                         operationalization o f new social policy planning and system
                                         development tools such as Social Planning, Methodological Centers
                                         and Quality Standards


13.      Reallocation o f Loan Proceeds. The originally allocated loan amount for planned c i v i l
works was underestimated by EUR 4.1 million, while the expenditures for planned goods,

consultants' services and grants were overestimated by EUR 2.55 million, EUR 1.25 million and EUR
0.3 million respectively. Reallocations proposed are as follows:

Analysis
14.         W h i l e good progress has been achieved in implementing all three project components, per
the original project descriptions in the PAD, the PDO and the RF were designed in a way that would
make it difficult for the project to meet the original objectives because the project did not focus on
social benefits, as described earlier.
15.       The proposed changes in the PDO and associated RF do not affect the original economic,
social and institutional aspects o f the project. In terms o f project implementation and financial
arrangements, the existing arrangements would continue to be used under the restructured project.
The proposed changes in the project do not involve any exception to Bank policies. The proposed
changes do not raise the environmental category o f the project or trigger any new safeguard policies.
Expected Outcomes
16.        The RF i s revised and now includes a total o f five Outcome Indicators and eleven
Intermediate Outcome Indicators which fully reflect the revised PDO and project activities. The
revisions have been developed together with the counterparts in the Borrower's Ministry o f Health
and Social Welfare and have undergone a thorough internal review.
Benefits and R i s k s
17.         The benefit o f the proposed changes i s that the PDO now fully reflects the project's
original intentions and the revised RF i s closely aligned with the PDO, and with the project activities
and their objectives. This allows for effective measurement o f the project's impact. There are n o
external risks that could jeopardize the achievement o f the revised PDO.
