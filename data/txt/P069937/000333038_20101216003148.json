The extension is\n            necessary to provide sufficient time to deliver and install\n            the Information Technology (IT) equipment (US$2.1 million)\n            and install LAN cabling network (US$0.4 million) in the\n            social welfare institutions throughout Croatia. The national\n            roll-out of the new social welfare management information\n            system is a complex process that requires full\n            implementation of three separate IT hardware and software\n            contracts and installation of LAN cabling network, as well\n            as their functional integration at the national level. Due\n            to the delay in the procurement process, implementation of\n            one of the IT hardware contracts will require additional\n            three months to complete, and given the other contracts for\n            supply and installation of hardware and software are\n            functionally connected with the hardware procured under the\n            contract in question, additional time is required for their\n            full integration into one system. This all is expected to be\n            achieved by March 31, 2011."}, "docdt": "2010-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
