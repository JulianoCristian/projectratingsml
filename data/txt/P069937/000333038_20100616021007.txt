                                  Restructuring Paper



1. The closing date for Croatia Social Welfare Development Project (SWDP), Loan
   Number 7307, will be extended by six and half months from June 15, 2010 until
   December 31, 2010.

2. Implementation of all project-related activities under the first and third project
   components has been successfully completed. However, additional time is needed for
   the completion of two remaining activities under the second project component
   (development of the Social Welfare Management Information System). These include
   purchasing of IT hardware required for a national roll-out of the new MIS and
   installation of LAN cabling network in social welfare institutions throughout Croatia.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to provide sufficient time to deliver and install
   the IT equipment (US$2.1 million) and install LAN cabling network (US$0.4 million)
   in the social welfare institutions throughout Croatia. Without the extension, the
   Government would not be able to use loan funds for completing the two remaining
   activities necessary for the completion of the social welfare MIS. Without Bank
   financing, completion of the mentioned activities would depend on Ministry of Health
   and Social Welfare's ability to allocate $2.5 million of own funds for this purpose,
   which might be difficult given the reduced investment budget of the Ministry and
   could jeopardize the completion of the MIS.

4. This will be the second extension of the project.
