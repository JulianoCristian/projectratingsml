The\n            objectives were generally met. In June 1978 the Paraguayan\n            economy was expanding with growth rates of about 10 percent\n            per year. The population was about 2.9 million, 65 percent\n            rural. The high growth rates were fueled mainly by the\n            Itapua Hydroelectric Dam. The agricultural sector followed\n            the trend with growth rates of about 5.5 percent. The sector\n            accounted for about 28 percent of gross domestic product\n            (GDP), 45 percent of employment, and 99 percent of exports.\n            Sector growth resulted mainly from expansion of cropped\n            areas in the eastern part of the country, and favorable\n            international price for Paraguay's main exports,\n            soybean, and cotton."}, "docdt": "1986-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
