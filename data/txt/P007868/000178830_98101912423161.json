Agricultural\n            Development Project for Paraguay seeks to: (i) support\n            on-farm development on 940 ranches and small livestock farms\n            through the provision of credit; (ii) consolidate\n            development of 16 land settlement schemes in Eastern\n            Paraguay by providing credit to 3,000 small mixed-farms, and\n            constructing rural roads; (iii) improve the food crop\n            marketing system by completing the wholesale market in\n            Asuncion. The project also includes technical assistance for\n            the components and for undertaking an agricultural census,\n            including the establishment of a permanent system for\n            gathering agricultural statistics. The realization of the\n            project's benefits will depend on the successful\n            implementation of technical assistance at all levels. For\n            the livestock component, there is the risk that unusually\n            drastic reduction of beef prices may deter ranchers from\n            seeking investment credit at the levels assumed under the\n            project. The settlement development component also depends\n            on the timely provision of rural roads."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
