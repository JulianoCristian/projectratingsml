livestock farms through\n            the provision of credit (through FG); (ii) consolidate\n            development of 16 land settlement schemes in Eastern\n            Paraguay by providing credit (through BNF) to 3,000 small\n            mixed-farms, and constructing rural roads; (iii) improve the\n            food crop marketing system by completing the wholesale\n            market in Asuncion. The project also includes technical\n            assistance for the above components and for undertaking an\n            agricultural census, including the establishment of a\n            permanent system for gathering agricultural statistics. The\n            realization of the project's benefits will depend on\n            the successful implementation of technical assistance at all\n            levels. For the livestock component, there is the risk that\n            unusually drastic reduction of beef prices may deter\n            ranchers from seeking investment credit at the levels\n            assumed under the project. The settlement development\n            component also depends on the timely provision of rural roads."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
