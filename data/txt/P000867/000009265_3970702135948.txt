SECOND RECONSTRUCTION IMPORTS CREDIT
SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
Borrower:           Government of Ghana
Executing Agency:   Bank of Ghana
Credit Amount:      SDR 61.6 million (US$60 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard
Purpose:            The proposed IDA Credit would make available US$60
million equivalent to support the Government of Gnana' s
economic recovery program which has been reviewed and
found satisfactory to the Association. These funds
would be allocated to the procurement of priority items
under the Government's 1985 import program which
constitutes part of the economic recovery program.
Sectors to be covered under the Credit would be
agriculture, transport, mining, and manufacturing
industries which are the most important sectors for the
objectives of the economic recovery program and are in
line with the Association's strategies for the
rehabilitation and recovery of the Ghanaian economy.
Benefits and
Risks:              The main benefits of the Credit are:  (i) imports of
the essential items to support the Government's
economic recovery program would be secured, thus
providing a basis to improve the depressed level of the
living standard; (ii) the supply position of the
economy which has been at a very suppressed level for
more than a decade would improve as a result of the
improved performance of the four priority sectors
through increased imports of essential items for
rehabilitation and maintenance; and (iii) private
institutions would benefit from more liberalized import
procedures and foreign exchange allocation and thus
contribute to more efficient implementation of the
economic recovery program. The main risks associated
with the proposed project are that the Government's
commitment to the austere economic recovery program
might be changed through personnel changes in the
Government and that adequate external financing may not
be forthcoming for sustaining imports. Close
cooperation and a continuous dialogue between the
Government, the IMF and IDA will assist in the

implementation of policy reform and the Government is
striving to maximize the flow of external assistance to
sustain the import program.

Arrangements:       The Credit is allocated across four sectors-
agriculture $15 million, industry $18 million,
transport $15 million, and mining $12 million -- with
provision for reallocation amongst these sectors.
Seventy-five percent of the individual alloca.tions for
agriculture, industry and transport are expected to be
utilized by the private sector (end user), while the
allocation for mining is for several of the major
mining companies which are 'mixed' enterprises or in
the public sector. Procurement procedures would be:
(a) for the private sector everything costing over $1
million would be subject to ICB and less than $1
million through normal commercial channels; (b) for the
pulic sector everything over $0.3 million would be
subject to ICB and below that amount through
competitive shopping. Procurement on behalf of the
Government and parastatals will be through an external
procurement agency.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR THE
SECOND RECONSTRUCTION IMPORTS CREDIT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Second Reconstruction Imports Credit to the Republic of Ghana in an amount
equivalent to SDR 61.6 million (US$60 million equivalent) on standard IDA
terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        An economic report entitled "Ghana: Managing the Transition" was
distributed to the Executive Directors in November 1984 (5289-GH). A
sumuary of the economic situation is presented in this section. Basic
economic data and selected social indicators are summarized in Annex I.
3.        Ghana once enjoyed a fairly high standard of living compared
with most other West African nations. However, a declining gross national
income has combined with high population growth (estimated at about 3 per-
cent a year) to cause a substantial erosion in real per capita income.
The average real income in 1983 is estimated at US$320, which represents a
decline by about two-fifths from what it was a decade ago. The rate of
unemployment is quite high and underemployment is widespread. Almost half
the population of about 12 million is now estimated to live in absolute
poverty. The country's basic needs indicators, once the best in Africa,
are no longer much better than those of other Sub-Sahara African countries
with comparable per capita incomes. Modern health services are available
to only about a third of the people and fewer in rural areas; only 35 per-
cent have access to safe water. Although the education system is well
established and elementary education has been free since 1962, 50 percent
of adult men and 70 percent of adult women have had no formal education.
Basic Structural Characteristics
4.        Ghana is comparatively well endowed with natural and human
resources. The country has valuable mineral deposits, particularly gold,
but also diamonds, bauxite and manganese, and offshore oil. There is
further potential for hydro power generation. Ghana has a relatively good
supply of land suitable for growing cereals and starchy staples and pos-
sesses considerable fishing and forestry resources.
1/   This Part is the same as Part I of the President's Report for the
Accra District Rehabilitation Project of February 27, 1985.



- 2 -
5.        Agriculture is the largest sector of the economy, accounting for
over half of GDP. Only 11 percent of the land area is cultivated, half of
which is under cocoa. Nearly 70 percent of the population derive an
income from agriculture or related activities.  The basic staple foods are
maize, rice, millet, yam, cassava, and plantain but, except for cassava,
yields of these crops have stagnated in recent years. Food production in
1980 was only 88 percent of that in 1975. Prolonged droughts in 1975-77
and 1982-83, inadequate support services, poor transport facilities, and
lack of fertilizers and other inputs contributed to the decline. In
recent years, Ghana has had to import 10 to 15 percent of its cereal
consumption (mainly rice and maize).
6.        Ghana's economy is highly dependent on primary products for
exports. Cocoa (of which Ghana is the world's third largest producer)
still contributes about two-thirds of total export earnings, although
production has been declining. Timber is also an important export item.
Mining is still Ghana's second largest foreign exchange earner, contribut-
ing 20 percent of the total, although production has been declining over
the past two decades. Efforts to diversify the export base have not made
much headway.
7.        Industrial production and services currently account for 7
percent and 40 percent of GDP, respectively. Manufacturing--including
textiles, steel, tires, oil refining and simple consumer goods-con-
tributed 3.4 percent of GDP in 1983 declining from 11.4 pe:cent in 1970
and provided full- or part-time employment to just over one-tenth of the
labor force. However, manufacturing in Ghana remains heavily dependent on
imported inputs.
8.        Ghana used to import all of its petroleum, mostly in the form of
crude oil, which is refined domestically and used chiefly as a source of
fuel for the transport sector. Recently, some oil deposits have been
discovered and commercial exploitation has commenced. Production of crude
iis now about 1,200 barrels per day, equivalent to 7 percent of the coun-
try's requirements. Hydroelectric power meets most of Ghana's
non-transport commercial energy needs, although it ha3 been drastically
affected by the drought in recent years.
Past Economic Developments - The Inheritance
9.        Throughout the 1970s, Ghana's economy was subject to gross
mismanagement. Large budgetary deficits, necessitated partly by the need
to support a sprawling, inefficient public sector, led to a marked accel-
eration in domestic inflation. Given the reluctance to move the exchange
rate, the fixed nominal rate became grossly overvalued, shifting relative
incentives away from exports into import trade, and more specifically from
cocoa, Ghana's main export, into subsistence food production. The result-
ing deterioration in export performance, combined with a growing disen-
chantment on the part of aid donors with Ghana's policy performance,
caused a perpetual foreign exchange crisis that pushed successive Govern-
ments into increasingly restrictive import regimes. Thus, what was once
an economy with ample imports became starved of the main fuel for its



growth. The erosion of the tax base due to declining exports and imports,
and the related decline in economic activity forced severe cutbacks in
Government operations and maintenance and capital expenditures. Thus,
foreign exchange shortages and declining public expenditures contributed
to the marked deterioration in what was once a fairly well developed
economic and social infrastructure. This in turn further reduced the
country's productive capacity.
10.       A tendency to respond to shortages with controls and rationing
worsened the problem; extensive price controls and widespread resort to
administrative price setting eroded the incentives to produce and save,
diminished the capacity of public sector entities to maintain the level
and quality of services, and created a vast parallel black market with its
related evils of corruption, smuggling and tax evasion. Declining real
wages, political instability and reduced economic opportunities led
talented and skilled Ghanaians to leave the country, depriving the country
of scarce managerial, administrative and technical skills.
11.       To add to all its difficulties, Ghana was subjected in the early
years of the present decade to three additional problems. First, a pro-
longed and severe drought that created the worst food shortages since
Independence.  Second, a sharp deterioration in external terms of trade
following the increase in petroleum import prices, and a softening in
prices of Ghana's major exports (cocoa, gold and manganese). Third, the
sudden and unexpected return of over one million Ghanaians from Nigeria,
placing a severe strain on the food and unemployment situation. The
cumulative effect of this downward economic spiral and these most recent
"shocks" to the system can be seen in the trends in key economic indica-
tors between 1970 and 1982: per capita real income declined by 30 per-
cent; import volumes fell by a third; real export earnings fell 52 per-
cent; domestic savings and investment declined from 12 and 14 percent of
GDP respectively in 1970 to almost insignificant levels; inflation aver-
aged 44 percent per annum over the period.
A Program of Reforms
12.       The Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) whicb came to
power under the leadership of Flt. Lt. Rawlings on December 31, 1981,
established a National Economic Review Committee early in 1982 to reviev
the country's economic difficulties and to develop an adjustment program
that would check this downward economic spiral and pave the way for
national economic recovery. An economic recovery program was developed by
the Government in close coordination with the IMF and the World Bank. The
program was supported in the period April 1983 to August 1984 through a
(First) IMF Standby Arrangement for SDR 238.5 million and through IDA
financed operations including a Reconstruction Import Credit (US$40
million) and two Export Rehabilitation Projects (US$93 million). Support
for the period August 1984 to December 1985 is being extended through a
(Second) IMF Standby Arrangement for SDR 180 million and a Second IDA
Reconstruction Imports Credit (US$60 million). Since its inception, the
Economic Recovery Program has focussed on:



-4-
(a) establishing a more realistic exchange rate, which has
resulted in an exchange rate movement from ¢ 2.75 - US$1.00
to ¢ 50.00 - US$1.00 within a twenty month period;
(b) establishing realistic relative prices and incomes in the
context of the new exchange rate. Cocoa producer prices
were raised by 67 percent to ¢ 20,000 per ton on May 1,
1983 and further to ¢ 30,000 per ton for the current crop
year (1984/85). A further increase is expected to be
announced for the next crop year (1985/86). In the case of
all administered prices of imported goods and services, or
inputs, a full pass through of the higher cedi cost follow-
ing the exchange rate movement was effected. Public sector
salaries and wages, and statutory minimum wages were raised
to offset in part the drastic erosion in real incomes.
Public utilities announced substantial tariff adjustments
to more realistic levels;
(c) increasing domestic resource mobilization, by an improved
public savings effort, and by improving the environment for
private savings and investment. Since the last one and a
half years, all interest rates were raised by 65-70 per-
cent, or by 4.5-6.5 percentage points; and
(d) rehabilitation programs for key sectors designed to ensure
a prompt supply side response to the planned improvement in
incentives. The three IDA-financed import sector credits
(and this proposed project) are intended to help achieve
such response.
13.       Following the announcement of this program, the Bank, in
consultation with the Government, decided to reactivate the Ghana Consul-
tative Group, which had lain dormant for 13 years. There has been a good
response to this initiative. The Group met in Paris, first in Novem-
ber 1983 and for the second time in December 1984, and has been broadly
supportive of the Government's program. Aid indications provided at the
1984 meeting of about $415 million, together with the existing aid
pipeline, could generate disbursements during the year exceeding US$300
million. This, together with the IMF Standby and the proposed project,
is designed to help finance the third year of the economic recovery
program (1985) by:
(a) an increase in imports, which would in turn stimulate
domestic production and exports; and
(b) a further reduction in Ghana's past payments arrears
(US$256.8 million at end December 1984).
Response of the Economy
14.       Data are inadequate to assess in depth the response of the
economy to this major dose of policy reforms.   However, it does appear



- 5 -
that while the country experienced almost no growth in 1983, economic
recovery was evident during 1984. The overall growth of the economy is
estimated at over 6 percent in 1984. This is the first major upswing
that CGhana's economy has experienced since 1978. The weather provides a
major explanation for this improved performance although improved sup-
plies of imported inputs were also making an impact in the latter half of
1984. The near normal rainfall patterns in 1984 have resulted in a sharp
recovery in agricultural production, and the consequent decline in food
prices since May 1984 is providing much needed relief. Energy availabil-
ity has also improved, as water levels rose in the Akosombo and Kpong
reservoirs, and as petroleum imports returned to more tormal levels.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing, while still unacceptably low, has
improved compared to 1983. About one-half of the one million returnees
from Nigeria are believed to have re-migrated. The response of donors to
Ghana's recovery program in 1984 has also been encouraging. While much
remains to be done, Ghana now needs to build on the momentum it has
generated.
15.       The Budget.  In broad terms, the structure of the budget has
improved: (i) revenues financed 65 percent of current expenditures in
1982, 76 percent in 1983, and are estimated to finance 99 percent in
1984; (ii) the proportion of total expenditures financed by revenues has
risen from 57 percent to 82 percent; (iii) development expenditures and
net lending are estimated to rise from less than 5 percent of total
expenditures in recent years to about 14 percent in 1984; and (iv) the
overall budget deficit fell from 4.4 percent of GDP at market prices in
1982 to 2.3 percent in 1983, and is estimated at 1.6 percent in 1984.
16.       Prices.  At the time the reform program vas initiated, it was
anticipated that inflation in 1983 could be held to around 50 percent.
This expectation did not materialize because of the severe drought and
the resultant increase in food prices which fuelled the 123 percent
increase in consumer prices in 1983. On a December to December basis,
the index of consumer prices rose by 142 percent during 1983. After the
initial large increases associated more with the drought than with the
exchange rate adjustment, the inflation rate dropped sharply. In the
eight months following April 198B, prices rose by 50 percent. That
inflation was not higher, despite the large exchange rate adjustment, is
evidence of the fact that most prices already reflectad scarcity values,
and that fiscal and monetary policies have been largely successful in
curbing inflation. The good rains and the abundant crops have helped
reduce inflation further in 1984, with the annual rate through August
1984 down to 23 percent.
17.       Balance of Payments. The main feature of the balance of
payments results for 1983 was a decline in exports in current dollar
terms for the third successive year. At US$440 million, merchandise
exports were 28 percent below the level of 1982 and 60 percent below the
1980 level. There were several principal causes of this poor perfor-
mance. Of these, the most obvious was the serious impact on the volume
of cocoa exports of the drought and bush fires which affected many parts
of the country in 1983. It is estimated that the drought accounted for a



-6 -
loss in this sector alone of some US$80 million in exports, the volume of
which reached an all-time low of 170,000 tons - about 35 percent below
the 1982 level. For the other export sector most seriously affected by
the drought-electricity-the impact was not felt until 1984.  However,
the fact that non-cocoa exports were some US$86 million (or 35 percent)
down against recovery program expectations indicates that other negative
factors were at work--notably, severe transport bottlenecks and
managerial constraints. As a result of this shortfall in exports and
lower than expected disbursements from foreign aid commitments, overall,
the value of merchandise imports fell by 8.5 percent as compared with
1982. However, as a result of a substantial (although largely forced)
cutback in oil imports, non-oil imports, taken together, were about 33
percent higher than in 1982. This gtill left the economy with severe
shortages of raw materials, spares, and equipment, as imports were some
37 percent below their 1980 levels in real terms. The net result was
that the current account deficit for 1983 (excluding grant aid) nearly
doubled as compared with 1982 to US$356 million-equal to 3.3 percent of
GDP-while the overall balance of payments moved from a surplus of
US$27 million in 1982 to a deficit of US$243 million in 1983. This
deficit was more thani covered by net purchases from the Fund under the
First Standby and CFF (US$259 million), so that it was still possible to
reduce arrears of foreign debt by US$34 million.
18.       Preliminary data on the 1984 balance of payments out-turn
suggest a considerable improvement in the overall balance of payments
position in 1984. This is due to an improvement in Ghana's export prices,
and a substantial increase in capital receipts. The value of exports is
estimated to have risen to US$566 million, a 29 percent increase over the
very low level of 1983. The recovery of exports is led by cocoa, earn-
ings from which grew by some 45 percent. This is despite a decline in
the volume of cocoa exports, which at 165,000 tons will reach a new low.
However, unit prices for cocoa have risen temporarily by over 50 percent
above 1983 level. Cocoa exports are set to recover to some 200,000 tons
in 1985. Exports of other goods rose much more modestly in 1984 (12 per-
cent over low 1983 levels). Imports rose by some 21 percent. This
partly reflects the return to near normal levels of petroleum imports.
Non-petroleum imports are expected to rise by 17 percent. The terms of
trade improved in 1984 due mainly to the improvement in export prices.
The current account deficit of US$322 million at 3.5 percent of GDP is
substantially below original program projections. Net capital receipts
are projected to increase by some US$70 million to US$200 million in
1984. This is mainly on account of gross aid disbursements which are
expected to nearly double to US$298 million. The capital account might
have looked healthier but for the increase in the level of public sector
amortization payments between 1983 and 1984 from US$85 million to US$123
million, delays on the part of donors in committing quick disbursing aid,
and the relatively slow initial pace of disbursement of such aid.



- 7-
External Debt and Creditworthiness
19.       Ghana's medium- and long-term external public debt outstanding
and disbursed at end-1983 is estimated at about US$1.1 billion, repre-
senting less than 4 percent of GDP. The debt service of public and
publicly guaranteed medium- and long-term debt was estimated at around
10.7 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services in 1982.
However, it is estimated to have risen sharply to 34.2 percent in 1984 on
account of both a further decline in export earnings and the expiration
date of the grace period on rescheduled debt. Arrears on Ghana's short-
term debt went from US$245 million in 1977 to US$601 million by the end
of April 1983. The arrears are now being reduced in a phased manner
under the economic recovery program. By December 1984, they declined to
around US$256.8 million, a rate of reduction beyond the IMF requirement.
A further net reduction of US$60 million is planned for 1985.
20.       Ghana must rely on official sources for most of the external
capital required to support its development program; relatively little of
its medium- and long-term borrowing is on commercial terms. Consequent-
ly, Bank loans and IDA credits disbursed at end-1983 (US$192.1 million)
together represented about 17.5 percent of the country's estimated public
external debt of US$1.095 billion at end-1983. Service paymente on these
loans and credits accounted for 25 percent of the country's external debt
service, but they are projected to decline to 17 percent of external debt
service by 1987 as other sources of lending revive. Bank Group commit-
-ments on a per capita basis amounted to only US$1.76 during 1977-82.
Lending dropped to less than a project a year during this period before
increasing sharply in 1983 to support the economic reform program.
21.       Ghana's extremely difficult economic situation and its vulnera-
bility to fluctuations in cocoa export earnings make it desirable that
future debt service obligations be kept as low as possible. Consequent-
ly, Ghana will have to depend on IDA resources for Bank Group borrowing
over the next few years. This is also consistent with Ghana's relatively
low per capita income. At the same time, to help ensure an adequate flow
of foreign exchange into the country and support the country's resource
mobilization efforts, it would te appropriate to finance a significant
portion of local costs of projects.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
22.       The principal objectives which now guide the formulation of the
Bank's assistance program to Ghana are: (a) to support the adoption of
policies designed to reverse the downward trend in the economy and return
it to a path of growth; (b) to help rehabilitate and improve capacity
utilization of the country's existing priority assets; (c) to stimulate
agricultural and industrial production, particularly for export promotion
and efficient import substitution; and (d) to improve the country' s
essential infrastructure (transport, water, petroleum, power) and relieve
major bottlenecks to increased production. The Bank Group also plans a
i.



substantial increase in economic and sector work to broaden and deepen
understanding of the constraints which are likely to impede the recovery
process, to provide direction to our future lending and the design of
project components. This proposed project was prepared and appraised
with close cooperation with the Government and the IMF to assist in the
deepening and strengthening of policy reforms and pave the way for a
structural adjustment credit in the near future. In both lending and
economic sector work, attention will be given to ways of strengthening
the institutions responsible for economic management and development
spending. The Bank's dialogue has been most effective, and the Govern-
ment continues to be both receptive and responsive to the Bank's advice.
23.       In response to the Government's announcement of a major econom-
ic reform program in April 1983, the Bank Group reopened its lending to
Ghana which had !,een put in abeyance for nearly two years due to politi-
cal and economic uncertainties and lack of proper economic policies to
address the decades of economic decline. The Executive Directors ap-
proved a $40 million Reconstruction Import Credit which became effective
in August 1983 and has been substantially committed. 2/ Two Credits for
the Export Rehabilitation Project and a related technical assistance
project followed. To date, despite some expected initial problems, the
performance of the implementing agencies under these and other projects
approved after April 1983 has been satisfactory. However, the Government
in the meanwhile had to direct its scarce human and financial resources
to cope with the unexpectedly severe drought with its accompanying side
effects of wide-spread bush fires and crop failures and a sudden influx
of one million returnees from a neighboring country. The Government's
performance under the economic reform program, however, has been persis-
tent and strong. In addition, the international donors community which
was initially somewhat skeptical about the Government's ability to carry
out the program, has now recognized the importance of making necessary
foreign exchange available to support the Government's effort, and has
began to increase their assistance. Assisted also by normal rainfalls in
1984, the economy is estimated to have achieved more than 5 percent
growth in 1984 although from a very depressed level of the past perfor-
mance. The proposed project is designed to pick up this momentum and
also to be the nucleus of larger cofinancing efforts by interested donors
in support of the Government's reform program.
Past Operations
24.       Since 1962, when the Bank Group financed its first operation in
Ghana, the Bank has made 10 Loans totalling US$190.4 million and 27
2/  This Credit would have been fully disbursed by December 1984 if the

25.       Agriculture has been a major focus of bank Group lending,
receiving 21.8 percent of the Bank Group's lending to Ghana. The lending
program in agriculture has covered fisheries (1969), Eastern Region cocoa
(1970), sugar rehabilitation (1973), livestock development (1974),
Ashanti Region cocoa (1975), oil palm (1975 and 1984), Upper Region
agricultural development (1976), and Volta Region agricultural develop-
ment (1980). The main thrust of the Bank Group's operations in agricul-
ture has been to assist the country in achieving greater self-sufficiency
in agricultural production, particularly food and raw materials for agro
industries, and rehabilitating the cocoa subsector. The Bank Group also
executed a UNDP-financed technical assistance project designed to
strengthen the management and operation of the Ghana Cocoa Marketing
Board. Alongside agriculture, power generation and distribution has also
been a major focus of Bank Group lending (21.7 percent). The sector has
been assisted by three power generation projects and three power distri-
bution projects. Transportation is the third most important sector in
the Bank Group's program in Ghana (16.1 percent of commitments).
Projects financed in the sector include three road projects (in 1973,
1975 and 1980) and a railway rehabilitation project approved in 1981.
The road projects focussed initially on rehabilitation and reconstruction
of part of the country's main trunk road system. In light of rapid
deterioration in the entire road sector, later emphasis was placed on
emergency maintenance to keep roads open for agricultural export traffic.
A telecommunications project currently under implementation aims at
improving and expanding domestic telephone services in Accra and major
urbar centers.  In the field of water supply two projects (in 1969 and
1974) have helped increase and improve the water supply in the Accra/Tema
metropolitan area and adjacent rural areas. A third water supply project
was approved in March 1983 to help carry out emergency repairs and
maintenance on the pipeline from Kpong which presently provides
two-thirds of the Accra water supply. In the manufacturing sector, two
DFC operations (in 1975 and 1979) have financed investment projects in
manufacturing and agro-industry undertaken by small and medium
enterprises. The main emphasis in this sector has been to encourage
enterprises using local raw materials and which are capable of
contributing to foreign exchange earnings and savings. In the
energy sector, a project aimed at strengthening Ghana's technical
capacity to accelerate petroleum exploration was approved in May 1983.
A second project in the sector, approved in March 1984, will provide

Rehabilitation Proecrt which is being considered by the Executive
Directors on March 21, 1985.

Project Implementation Experience
26.       The serious economic difficulties which the country has experi-
enced in recent years have adversely affected implementation of a number of
Bank Group-financed projects. The dwindling revenue base of the Government
has constrained its ability to finance the local costs of projects, and the
lack of foreign exchange has resulted in a severe shortage of imported
materials and spare parts required for the operation and maintenance of
completed projects; the mass exodus of qualified Ghanaians to neighboring
countries, and demoralization, absenteeism and low productivity among the
remaining work force have also adversely affected project performance. The
unusually adverse condition surrounding Bank Group-financed projects and
their generally poor performance have been described in greater detail in
the Project Performance Audit Reports. Overall, the main conclusion of the
reports was that macroeonomic and sectoral policy constraints were the
major factors responsible for poor performance of the audited projects.
Because of delays experienced in the impl^mentation of a number of Bank
Group projects in Ghana, the disbursement performance is behind appraisal
estimates. Annual gross disbursements over the four-year period FY81-84
have averaged about 20 percent of outstanding Loan/Credit commitments and
eq of December 31, 1984, US$202.8 million remained undisbursed. The Bank
Group has held periodic implementation reviews with the Government to
identify steps which could be taken by borrowers and the Bank Group to
accelerate disbursement on ongoing Loans and Credits.
IFC Operations
27.       IFC approved an investment of US$55 million in the mining sector
(Ashanti Goldfields Corporation Ltd.) in June 1984. IFC's investment
comprises of: (i) a Loan of US$45 million of which US$22.5 million is for
IFC's own account and US$22.5 million for the account of participants; aad
(ii) a standby loan of US$19 million of which US$5 million is for IFC's
account and US$5 million is for the account of participants. This is 1FC's
first investment in Ghana.  The loan will help finance a US$158 million
reha'ulitation project designed to incrcase gold output from about 255,000
oz. expected in 1984 to 400,000 oz. in 1989-90, a level of production AGC
last achieved in the early seventies before the deterioration in Ghana's
foreign exchange situation began to affect production at the mine.
The Bank's Response to Ghana's Economic Recovery Program.
28.       In response to Ghana's economic recovery program, the Executive
Directors approved a US$40 million Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC I) in
June 1983 and US$76 million Export Rehabilitation Project (ERP) and a
US$17.1 million Export Rehabilitation Technical Assistance Project (ERTAP)
in January 1984. The proposed project is intended to provide further
support to the economic recovery program. In addition to these projects, a
more broadly-based program of rehabil:Ltation of the country's economic
assets will be required. In the near term IDA would support a program to
rebuild the network of trunk roads including a major bridge reconstruction

component, and provide assistance to rehabilitate the paver distribution
system. In agriculture, an agricultural rehabilitation project with
special emphasis on cash crops is envisaged given the overwhelming impor-
tance of these crops, at least in the short term, for foreign exchange
earnings. In energy, through a Petroleum Refinery Rehabilitation and
Technical Assistance Credit approved in March 1984, assistance is being
provided to help reduce the cost of petroleum products required by the
country. IDA is also maintaining a dialogue with the Government for a
possible structural adjustment credit in the near future. In brief,
projects with major rehabilitation components are likely to absorb the bulk
of IDA resources for the next few years as these are likely to show the
highest benefits and quickest returns. For the outer years, IDA will begin
to examine prospects for new productive investments including support for
education, health and other important activities in the social sectors.
The extent to which the Bank Group can provide financial and technical
assistance to support such a broad-based program will be conditioned upon
the performance of the Government in carrying through its economic recovery
program.
29.       The Government of Ghana has requested the Bank Group to help
muster external assistance through cofinancing and more generally in the
context of strengthened aid coordination. At the request of the Govern-
ment, the Bank Group convened a second meeting of the Ghana Consultative
Group on December 11 and 12, 1984. The participants of the meeting
re-endorsed the Government's economic recovery program, and it is expected
that the foreign exchange requirements for 1985 under the program will be
substantially met by the donors' contribution.
PART III - THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM, 1985-86 AND
OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED SECOND RECONSTRUCTION IMPORTS CREDIT (RIC II)
30.       The Government's economic recovery program for 1984-86 is cur-
rently being supported by the IMF with a (Second) Standby Program (covering
an eighteen-month period through December 1985) and the Association with
three ongoing general import Credits (RIC I, ERP and ERPTA). The proposed
RIC II addresses three major policy areas: (i) certain aspects of balance
of payments and fiscal policies not addressed by the Government's program
under the Second Fund Standby (primarily relating to the composition of the
import program and the magnitude and composition of public development
expenditures); (ii) incentive policies geared to efficient allocation of
resources and maximization of growth particularly in the productive
sectors; and (iii) resource and sector-specific policy requirements of
certain critical sectors (agriculture, mining, industry and
transportation). This section describes the Government's economic recovery
program and the role and objectives of the proposed RIC II within it.
31.       Macro-economic management being undertaken iD close consultation
with the IMF addresses stabilization and rehabilitation issues through
greater discipline over the country's balance of payments, fiscal, monetary
and credit policies. Incentive issues are being primarily addressed



- 12 -
through correction of the over-valued exchange rate, external trade and
tariff policies and removal of price and distribution controls.
32.       The initial response of the economy to the economic recovery
program vas considerably diluted by the severe drought, which hurt agricul-
ture, cocoa exports and hydro-electric power production (Table 1). The
drought exacerbated an already acute foreign financing situation, which was
only in small part alleviated by the substantial recourse to IMF facili-
ties. Although donor response to the recovery program was positive, it
took some time for donors to translate their support into specific aid
programs. Thus the Government's efforts to substantially increase the
level of imports in 1983 and early 1984 were undermined. Without the
stimulus of a strong recovery in imports, rehabilitation programs through-
out the economy suffered severely and infrastructure constraints became
more pronounced. This eroded the gains in incentives achieved through the
program and delayed the supply response in most sectors. With the return
to more normal weather and the substantial recovery in agricultural and
bydro-electric power production in late 1984, inflation has decelerated
sharply and exports have bounced back. Substantial new aid commitments in
1984 have also improved the aid pipeline. All these factors have helped
ease pressures on policy makers and greatly improved conditions on the
ground. Food is available in plenty, petroleum supplies have improved,
transport bottlenecks, while still severe, are beginning to ease, incen-
tives for exporting have improved considerably and capacity utilization in
industry may have improved slightly. Data are inadequate and while IDA is
working together with the Government in improving the information base on
which to monitor the performance of the economy, the slide downhill appears
to have been halted, and the path cleared for the long climb back up. To
facilitate this recovery, imports will need to be substantially expanded
above their present low levels, through quick disbursing assistance aimed
at stimulating output in the key sectors of the economy.

Balance of Payments
33.        The economic recovery program recognized that Ghana's major
problem in the management of the balance of payments was a grossly
overvalued exchange rate. This was corrected by a devaluation of more
than 1,000 percent in 1983. Before this action, the overvalued exchange
rate had weakened the traditional export sectors (cocoa, timber, min-
ing), and led to increased smuggling and the virtual cessation of
officially recorded workers' remittances. When compounded with strong
instability of export earnings due to considerable volatility in primary
producer markets, Ghana's external financial position had completely
eroded as it fell into a syndrome of resorting to short term borrowing
it could not repay and consequent build-up of external payment arrears.
Table 2 summarizes Ghana's balance of payments position during 1980-82
and the subsequent response under the economic recovery program.

a/ Tnrludn private sector.
34.       The RIC II supports the minimum foreign exchange needs of
major sectors of the economy (and particularly the export sectors). A
detailed review of the 1985 import program was undertaken to ensure that
the economy's priority needs would be met and that the public sector
would not pre-empt the private sector during 1985 in this regard. The
need for quantitative controls is seen as necessary in a period of
extreme foreign exchange shortages. In the medium term, as export
rehabilitation efforts begin to pay dividends, and the exchange rate
moves toward an equilibrium rate, it is expected that a more liberal
import regime will be put in place. In the meantime, the Government is
examining ways of reducing the high cost of controls by increasing the
efficiency of the licensing system and introducing an element of liber-
alization in import policies. The proposed import program for 1985 is
summarized in Table 3 below. The Government is targetting imports at
some $900 million, and proposes to issue licenses during the course of
1985 of between $900 and $950 million. Part of the licenses issued in
1985 will result in actual imports only in 1986.

35.       The "base" figures in the program are the basic minimum
required for each sector. Although in many cases they do not ensure
even reasonable levels of capacity utilization (particularly in industry
and mining), they are considered realistic given overall external
financing constraints. The "possible additional" would ensure proper
utilization of additional foreign exchange, should it become available.
The Borrower would submit to the Association for its review a quarterly
report on the status of the import program (licenses issued, letters of
credit established--by broad categories)(draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.06).
Fiscal Measures
36.       As part of the economic recovery program, all public subsidies
were discontinued and price increases were passed through to the final
consumer. Current expenditures (as a percentage of GDP) were substan-
tially reduced, despite efforts to offset part of the substantial
erosion of real public sector salaries. The latest wage adjustment in
December 1984 doubles the public sector wage and salary bill, but still
leaves public sector salaries and wages at extremely low levels. A
start was also made on rehabilitating public infrastructure. Table 4
summarizes developments in public expenditure policies to date and
projections for 1985. These projections do not take account of measures
to raise new revenues which will be announced in the 1985 budget in
April. These will substantially reduce the 3.6 percent of GDP overall

37.       Development Expenditures.  The Bank reviewed public development
expenditures for the agriculture, mining, industry, transport and communi-
cations sectors for 1985 based mainly an expected economic returns
(wherever information was available). A "minimum" public development
expenditure program of Q4.6 billion ($92 million) for these sectors was
identified within an overall development budget of 98,250 million.
Although still meager in absolute terms, development expenditures would
treble from 0.6 percent of GDP in 1983 to about 1.9 percent of GDP in 1985.
38.       The main objectives of the agreed 1985 minimum or base (08,250
million) program are: (i) to provide adequate resources for the most
critical rehabilitation needs of the country's economic and social infra-
structure, particularly the railways and roads; (ii) to restore momentum to
development programs in the agriculture sector, particularly in support of
key productive subsectors; (iii) to ensure adequate budgetary provisions
for high priority aided projects and for high priority locally financed
projects nearing completion, and (iv) to meet the urgent rehabilitation
needs of the social infrastructure. The agreed program is summarized in
Table 5. The Government of Ghana (with assistance from IDA) also will draw
up a rolling development program for 1986-88 that v-7uld establish a frame-
work for resource mobilization, recurrent expenditures, and public



- 17 -
investments in the medium term. The Government would submit to the
Association for its review such a development program by September 30, 1985
(draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.02(a)).

39.       Monetary and Credit Policies.  The economic recovery program
embraces very conservative monetary policies. Government borrowing from
the banking system was only 0.5 percent of GDP in 1984--due largely,
however, to cuts in the development budget made necessary by shortfalls
in external assistance. For 1985, the Government intends, as part of
the Fund program, to continue tightly limiting credit. It will, howev-
er, monitor the economy closely, particularly the impact of these credit
ceilings on development expenditures and disbursement of foreign assis-
tance, including Bank Group financed projects. The Borrower would
submit to the Association for its review a quarterly report on
expenditure under the development program (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.06).
40.       The Ghanaian authorities are regularly adjusting interest
rates with a view to achieving positive real interest rates by June 1986
(inflation from August 1983 to August 1984 was 23 percent) as part of
the Standby Arrangement with the Fund. In December 1984 the Government
increased rates by 1-1/2 percentage points bringing the lending rate to
16-22 percent.
Incentives
41.        Exchange Rate.  The single most important action undertaken
under the economic recovery program has been the depreciation of the
Cedi from $1-¢2.75 in early 1983 to $1-450 at the end of 1984.  This has
substantially restored Ghana's competitive position. The Government's
agreement with the IMF calls for maintenance of real effective exchange



- 18 -
rates and further progress towards a more realistic exchange rate, at a
pace to be mutually agreed upon over the program period.
42.       Trade and Tariff Policies.  As part of the economic recovery
program, Ghana has carried out a comprehensive reform of the tariff
system. However, due to the extreme shortage of "free" foreign ex-
change, all imports are subjected to a complex licensing system.
Quantitative restrictions on imports lead to widely varying degrees of
effective protection across industries, but exporters receive no bene-
fits at all. In fact, cocoa exports are presently subject to a 75
percent tax - based on the prevailing official exchange rate and
current cocoa producer prices.
43.       The Association will assist the Government in revising trade
and tariff policies in connection with possible agricultural and indus-
trial sector credits. Possibilities include import surcharges, liberal-
ization of the import regime and export subsidies.
44.       Price and Distribution Controls.  The Government has substan-
tially reduced price and distribution controls, which covered almost all
products, domestic and imported. Most of these products were moved to a
reference price system by the middle of 1984 but 17 items are still
subject to price control. Of these, 15 are also subject to distribution
controls. In addition, to meet the need for incentive goods in rural
areas, industries which use imported raw materials can be asked to
supply up to 30 percent of their production to the Ghana National
Trading Company (GNTC) for regional distribution.
45.       Under the proposed project, the Borrower would reduce the list
of price controlled items to 8 as a condition of effectiveness (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 6.01(f)). The items which would
continue to be subject to price control are imported rice, sugar, baby
food, cement, textiles, drugs, matches and soap. As supply conditions
improve, the Borrower will re-examine the rationale for these remaining
price controls with a view to phasing them out completely.
46.       Similarly, the Borrower will, as a condition of effectiveness,
lift distribution controls on the items freed from price controls (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 6.01(f)). Moreover, as supplies
improve, the Borrower will re-examine the need for these distribution
controls, as also the requirement to supply GNTC with goods for regional
distribution.
Agriculture
47.       As paragraphs 5 and 6 indicate, agriculture, the largest
sector of the economy in Ghana, has declined in the past several years,
both in terms of output and area cultivated. The decline continued
through 1983. Until the mid 1970s, Ghana was self-sufficient in all
foodcrops except rice, but by 1983, Ghana had developed large deficits
in all crops except cassava. While the return of about one million
Ghanaians from Nigeria in 1983 aggravated the food demand situation, the
drought and bush fires in 1982 and 1983 made the food situation even



- 19 -
more serious. With good rains in 1984, however, the harvest, particu-
larly of maize, has been good. The agricultural sector is expected to
register a growth of 9.4 percent in 1984.
48.       Prices of cocoa, cotton and tobacco, which are officially
controlled, have declined sharply in real terms since 1970. The real
price of cocoa in 1983 was only 39 percent of that in 1970, that of
cotton 34 percent and that of tobacco 56 percent. The drastic decline
in production of these three commodities since 1970 may have been due in
large measure to this decline and to the successive years of drought in
the 1982-1984 period. Cocoa production declined from an average of
400,000 m.t. in early 1970s to about 158,000 m.t. in 1983/84; cotton
from a 1977 high of 11,363 m.t. to 502 m.t. in 1983; and tobacco from an
average of 2,750 m.t. in the mid-1970s to about 500 m.t. in 1983.
Rubber production also declined from about 3,500 m.t. in the mid-1970s
to about 500 m.t. in 1983. Cocoa production has recovered sharply to
about 200,000 tons in the current crop year, reflecting improved sup-
plies of inputs and better weather.
49.       Recovery Program.  The Government's short-term agricultural
program for the period 1984-86 aims at: (i) rehabilitating the export
sectors, particularly cocoa and timber; (ii) satisfying 80 percent of
maize, 60 percent of rice requirements and self-sufficiency in cassava
production; (iii) satisfying 50 percent fish and 53 percent seat re-
quirements; and (iv) maintaining reasonable production levels in other
cereals, starchy staples, pulses, nuts, oil seeds, fruits, vegetables
and industrial crops. In order to support these objectives, the Govern-
ment has taken major exchange rate adjustments to increase the incen-
tives for domestic production, sought investment and advice on the
export sectors, and stepped up its extension and support program to
farmers.
50.       Existing incentives, however, are very inadequate for cocoa,
cotton and tobacco. The current cocoa producer price is just over
one-third of the f.o.b. price at the official exchange rate despite the
substantial 150 percent increase in the nominal price following the
reform program. Therefore, the Government would provide increased
incentives to produ;_.s, in the form of higher prices.  The Borrower
would (i) nearly double the cocoa producer price (to e 56,600/ton) as a
condition of effectiveness (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section
6.01(e)) which would substantially restore incentives for cocoa farmers.
This reinforces the general understanding with the Goverrment that there
would be mutual consultations on this under the Export Rehabilitation
Project; (ii) raise the cotton producer price by 100 percent by May 31,
1985 (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.01(a)) with a full
pass through of the increased costs for textile products, and consider
phasing out price and distribution controls on textile products as
supplies of textiles improve with increased availabilities of raw
materials to be partly financed under this Credit; and (iii) increase
the tobacco producer price by 50 percent by May 31, 1985 (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.01(b)). In addition to
providing greater price incentives for agricultural producers, the



- 20 -
Government has agreed with the Association on development expenditures
and imports for agriculture in 1985 (Annexes IV and V).
51.       The 1985 agricultural program, which is modest in relation to
the sector's overall needs, includes substantial financing for irriga-
tion. Although, preliminary analysis indicates that large scale irri-
gated cropping of rice (about 85 percent of the irrigated area) is
uneconomic, the allocation is included in the 1985 budget because of the
advanced stages of construction and studies of many projects. However,
a detailed review of irrigation to evaluate completed and ongoing
schemes and evolve a strategy to maximize returns from existing invest-
ments, possibly by changes in cropping from rice to higher value crops
such as cotton, tobacco, sugarcane, and groundnuts, will be undertaken
in 1985 by the Government and the Association in preparation for the
1986-88 development program.
52.       The 1985 import program was drawn up for cocoa, timber and
other agriculture for a minimum 'base case,' but allowing for additional
foreign exchange if available. The proposed Credit allocates $15
million to cover part of the priority needs of the sector.
Manufacturing
53.       At its peak, around 1970. manufacturing in Ghana contributed
about 14 percent of GDP comparing favorably with cocoa (10 percent of
GDP), timber (5 percent), and mining (2 percent). In 1983 it contribut-
ed just over 3 percent of GDP. Ghana's industrial capacity is relative-
ly large, diverse and long-established compared to most other African
countries. Nevertheless, it cannot be utilized adequately because the
economy does not generate sufficient foreign exchange to supply the
sector's substantial imported input requirements (let alone to maintain
and replace its aging capital stock), and high costs prevent the sector
from earning sufficient foreign exchange from exports. The current low
utilization of industrial capacity--averaging 25 percent or less for the
last three years-is striking.  The average rate of capacity utilization
during the period 1972-77 was probably 60 percent, with 3 out of 10
industries operating at less than 50 percent.
54.       A substantial share of Ghana's industrial capacity either
operates with reasonable economic efficiency or could do so with some
rehabilitation of existing plants. On the whole, the most viable indus-
tries tend to be those that use a large proportion of domestic
materials, such as sawmilling, furniture, and food processing, or have
high value-added relative to import requirements, such as brewing.
Heavy industries and others whose inputs are predominantly imported,
such as steel, chemicals, vehicle assembly and containers, tend to
perform badly-especially under current circumstances with severely
restricted access to foreign exchange. In some industries, such as
textiles, efficiency varies widely depending on the particular products
and firms.
55.       Recovery Program.  The Government's exchange rate adjustments,
removal of price and distribution controls from a major portion of



- 21 -
industrial output, and foreign exchange retention schemes for exporters
have given greater incentive for production. These measures, however,
have so far had little impact on low rates of capacity utilization
because almost no additional foreign exchange has been made available
for imported inputs, and because of infra-structural and input supply
bottlenecks. Although the tariff system has been reformed, quantitative
restrictions continue to determine scarcity prices. To stimulate better
performance, the Government plans to (i) increase foreign exchange
allocations to industry; (ii) Improve the import licensing system to
permit quick and efficient utilization of foreign exchange; (iii)
mobilize domestic resources and provide adequate liquidity and credit to
support industrial recovery; (iv) improve the investment climate for
private and foreign investors, both existing and new, including issuance
of a revised Investment Code;  (v)  terminate budget subsidies to public
industries, rationalize the structure and size of the public industrial
sector, and minimize new public industrial investment; (vi) support
development of non-traditional exports.
56.       A three-stage process of industrial recovery and restructuring
is being initiated. The immediate concern is to increase utilization of
existing capacity that can make a quick contribution to industrial
recovery both by increasing GDP (or by raising revenues) and by increas-
ing supplies on the market so as to reduce scarcity pressure on prices.
Some success has already been achieved in increasing supplies of some
commodities (milk, toilet paper, soft drinks) to the point that price
and distribution controls have recently been abolished. This aids in
controlling inflation and wages, while also making it easier for the
Government to de-emphasize controls and move toward eliminating them.
The proposed Credit will finance inputs for increased utilization in
industries included under the base import program and whose prices have
been or are in the process of being liberalized. The agreed import
program will also help ensure a minimum level of operation in industries
that are expected to be included in rehabilitation efforts.
57.       The second, medium-term stage is to rehabilitate key indus-
tries through increased availability of inputs, spare parts, and re-
placement equipment needed to break bottlenecks within firms, raise
productivity, and avoid further deterioration of capacity. Evidence of
this sort of a response to improved incentives can presently be found in
export industries such as timber and lime juice, which are uslng some of
their retained export earnings to replace deteriorated equipment and
rebuild capacity in anticipation of future profits (and future exchange
rate adjustments). The results of the November 1984 IDA industrial
sub-sector mission will help form the basis for designing a rehabilita-
tion program (para 61).
58.       The third, long-term stage of industrial recovery is to
complete the restructuring process through investment or expansion in
industries that are consistent with Ghana's long-run comparative advan-
tage. Analysis of comparative advantage and efficiency indicates that
industries based on domestic resources are prime (though not sole or
absolute) candidates. Their success, however, depends on expanding the
marketed supply of domestically-produced raw materials, which in turn



- 22 -
depends on increased and liberalized prices to create the necessary
production incentives. More important, the efficiency of future indus-
trial investments and operations depends on the establishment of an
appropriate policy and incentive environment (para 61).
59.       Investment Policies.  One step in this direction is the
Government's preparation of a new "Investment Code", which was exten-
sively discussed between the Government and the Bank Group. It affirms
the Government's commitmcnt to a mixed economy and private investment,
provides legal protection against expropriation and guarantees the
repatriation of profits, capital and approved fees (for foreign inves-
tors). Its benefits (including limited exemption from customs duties
and income taxes and employment-based tax credits) are designed to avoid
any bias against small, labor-intensive or resource-based investments.
60.       Import Program.  The agreed industrial import program (Annex
VI) is intended to ensure that imports of raw materials are spread
widely across potentially efficient sectors (in 1984 a few preferred
enterprises were operating at above 50 percent capacity and ot.iers at 5
percent or less) and that the sector as a whole is provided with appro-
priate levels of foreign exchange. The program for 1985 allocates $125
million in the minimum "base case" and $175 million with "possible
additional." The proposed IDA Credit will provide $18 million for
imports for the industrial sector for all categories of imports (exclud-
ing raw materials for nearly all goods under price and distribution
controls). Wholly publicly owned industrial enterprises will not be
financed by the Credit (draft Development Credit Agreement, Schedule 1,
para 2(1)). Strong interest shown by private industria'l owners and
partners in obtaining additional inputs indicates that the policy
reforms and easing of restrictions to date have been sufficient to
facilitate a strong supply response to increased foreign exchange
availability. Although the availability of liquidity and credit may
pose a problem for some firms or be constrained as recovery accelerates,
the present liquidity position should be sufficient to take up the
amount involved.
61.       Incentives and Restructuring.  The Credit also will assist the
Government in revising industrial policies and incentives based on the
findings of the July 1984 IDA industry and trade mission and
November 1984 industrial sub-sector mission (para. 57). Accordingly,
the Government would submit to the Association for its review such an
action program by September 30, 1985 (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 4.02(b)). The Government also would be required to
submit to the Association for its review a restructuring program based
on the findings of the same missions (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 4.02(c)).
Mining
62.       Mining accounts for approximately 2 percent of both GDP and
the country's labor force. After cocoa, mining is the second largest
,axport earner, generating in 1982 about US$100 million in foreign
exchange. The major mineral commodities are gold, diamonds, manganese



- 23 -
and bauxite which are produced by five mining companies. In addition,
the Volta Aluminium Company Ltd. (Valco) has the largest primary
aluminium plant in Africa. The government-owned State Gold Mining
Corporation (SGNC) and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation Ltd. (AGC),
which is 55 percent state-owned, are the country's principal gold
producers. Diamonds are officially mined by the government-owned Ghana
Consolidated Diamonds Ltd. (GCD) and by a small number of private
diamond miners. A manganese mine is operated by the government-owned
Ghana National Manganese Corporation (GNMC), and the Ghana Bauxite
Company Ltd. (GBC), 55 percent owned by the Government mines and
beneficiates bauxite.
63.       Production of all minerals mined in Ghana declined persistent-
ly over the last decade (Annex VII gives detailed produ.,tion data). The
decline in production can be attributed to overvalued exchange rates and
high inflation rates, which created an increasing shortage of foreign
exchange and eroded the financial position of the mining companies. The
lack of funds did not permit necessary replacement and rehabilitation of
overaged equipment and facilities and frequently not even adequate
provision of materials and supplies to continue production at normal
levels. For the same reasons, mine development had to be curtailed to
the absolute minimum and exploration for new deposits came to a virtual
standstill. As the situation worsened, foreign and Ghanaian specialists
began to leave the country, further weakening the management of the
companies.
64.       For SGMC (gold), GCD (diamond) and GNNC (manganese), these
conditions were further worsened by declining availability of ore
reserves. In addition, a critical shortage of transport and inadequate
port handling facilities at Takoradi had a further impact on production.
Valco, which depends on hydro-electric power from the Akosombo Dam, fed
by the Volta River, had to shut down all operation in November 1983
because of the drought-reduced water storage level of the reservoir. In
order for the mining sector to contribute significantly to increases in
GD?, the Government has formulated a strategy aimed at "the full utili-
zation of existing resources through rehabilitation of existing capital
equipment, improvements in management practices, up-grading of local
infrastructure, the establishment of training programs, up-grading local
skills, and the strengthening of support services."
65.       The Government's policy measures regarding the mining sector
have been supported substantially by exchange rate adjustments since
April 1983, together with the efforts towards realistic relative prices
and creation of export retention accounts, which have substantially
restored profitability in the sector.
66.       Nevertheless, the lack of financial resources for capital
replacement, critical spares and materials, combined with the persistent
skilled manpower shortage and severe infrastructure constraints, did not
permit the desired production and revenue growth. In 1984, gold and
diamond production rose modestly, while manganese output recovered
ebarply. Bauxite production fell mainly on account of transport con-
straints. As the economic recovery proceeds, progress in the mining



- 24 -
sector is expected to accelerate markedly. The most likely scenario in
terms of production and revenue is shown in Annex VII. Over the long
term, the Intended beneficiary companies in the mining sector have the
potential to become fully financially viable and make a marked contribu-
tion to the country's development. This presupposes that the macroeco-
nomic environment impacting on the mining industry also continues to
improve and infrastructural constraints will substantially be alleviated
over time.
67.       Import Program.  While the mining companies now have satisfac-
tory retention accounts, a review of the sector's import needs for 1985
makes clear that they still need additional foreign exchange for consum-
ables and capital rehabilitation. The IDA and the Government have
agreed to an import program totalling US$95 million (Annex VIII) with a
possible additional $50 million should resources permit.
68.       Incentive Policies.  To deal with widespread smuggling of gold
and diamonds by private producers and middlemen, a study of means to
develop greater incentives for them to market their output through
regular channels will be undertaken by September 30, 1985 (draft Devel-
opment Credit Agreement, Section 4.03).
Transport
69.       Ghana has a relatively complex transport system comprising a
network of some 28,300 km of trunk, feeder, and urban arterial roads, a
railway system in the southern part of the country of 947 km of main and
branch lines, a deep water port at Tema and a combined deep-water/
liphterage port at Takoradi, a small inland water transport system on
the Volta Lake, and one international and several domestic airports. In
addition, Ghana has a small national shipping company (Black Star Line),
and a national airline (Ghana Airways) provides international, regional,
and domestic air transport services.
70.       About 85 percent of the road t-ansport market, which is the
domina-t part of the transport system, is operated by the private
sector. Entry in the road transport market is free, and regulations are
minimal. There are three public sector transport companies competing
with the private sector; all three make profits, though their operations
need streamlining. Road transport tariffs art set and controlled by the
Government, even though its enforcement is more strict for the public
sector than for the private sector. The public sector dominates in the
ports, ocean shipping, and lake xransport. Railways and domestic civil
aviation are exclusively operated by public sector agencies.
71.       The condition of Ghana's transport sector reflects the current
state and problems of the economy as a whole in that: (i) the decline
in economic activity over the last 10-15 years has led to a correspond-
ing decline in transpcrt volumes; (ii) the country's chronic shortage of
foreign exchange has entailed a glaring shortfall of maintenance and
renewal expenses for transport infrastructure and equipment which have a
particularly high foreign exchange component; (iii) the decline in real



- 25 -
salary levels, particularly in the public sector, has caused serious
problems of staffing, work morale, and productivity.
72.       Due to reduced economic activity, railway and inland waterway
transport, and traffic through ports was 20-50 percent below the level
of the early 1970s, while goods traffic by road may have dropped by
about 25 percent from the early 1970's and by about 40 percent from the
peak levels reached around 1980.
73.       The most serious impact on the sector has been, however,
Ghana's chronic shortage of foreign exchange which has required strict
rationing throughout the economy. This has been particularly devastat-
ing for the transport sector in which investments, maintenance and
operations are all highly foreign-exchange intensive: road construction
and maintenance works, for example, are estimated to have a foreign-
exchange content of 75 percent, vehicle operating costs over 80 percent,
while most railway and all port handling equipment have to be imported.
Ghana has a refinery of its oWn, but practically all crude oil has to be
imported (about 1 million tons per year over the last five years)
claiming a major portion of the country's total imports.
74.       Recovery Program.  The Government is fully aware of the dismal
condition of the country s transport infrastructure and equipment and
the importance of appropriate rehabilitation and renewal as a precondi-
tion for the success of its economic recovery policies. Consequently,
under the 1984-86 economic recovery program, high priority has been
given to the sector.
75.       The Government also has expressed its commitment to pursue a
policy of healthy competition between the public and private sectors in
the road transport industry; to continue allocating foreign exchange to
the private sector in proportion to its share in total transport vol-
umes; and to adjust transport tariffs periodically to reflect changes in
operating costs. With respect to public sector transport agencies such
as the railways, the three road transport companies, the Volta Lake
Transport Company and the National Shipping Company, the authorities
have decided to require them to operate on a commercial basis with a
large degree of autonomy; the Government is also open to joint ventures
between public and private sector, both domestic and foreign.
76.       Public Investment.  The development budget (Annex IX) gives
high priority to investments in the transport infrastructure and would
represent an allocation of about 45 percent of the proposed 1985 base
development budget for this sector. Even this large percentage alloca-
tion, however, would meet only one-third of actual investment require-
ments of the transport sector.
77.       The proposed development budget for the Ministry of Transport
and Communications (MTC) will enable the Government to, among other
things, cover its 1985 financing requirements for the World Bank/African
Development Bank Railway Rehabilitation Project and a part of other
railway capital expenditure, as well as resurface the runways at Accra
and KumGsi airports. The 1985 allocation for the Ministry of Roads and



- 26 -
Highways (MHB) is vell below the needs of Ghana's road network, even
though it represents a substantial increase over the 1984 allocation.
High priority projects internationally funded and/or at an advanced
stage of completion will obtain first call on available funds.
78.       Import Program.  The agreed upon import program for transport
(Annex X) is consistent with the investment program outlined above. The
proposed Credit will finance $15 million for imports for the transport
sector, the bulk of which are expected to be procured by the private
sector.
79.       Petroleum Product Prices.  Petroleum products are not subsi-
dized at current exchange rates. However, prices are below comparable
levels of other developing countries and need to be increased to reflect
user charges, encourage conservation and raise revenues. In view of the
importance of appropriate energy policies for the economic reform, the
Borrower would: (a) adjust petroleum product prices to keep in step
with exchange rate movements (draft Development Credit Agreement,
Section 4.04); and (b) issue by May 31, 1985 for IDA's review a
Government "Statement of Policy on Energy Prices," which will define an
appropriate price structure which reflects the need for appropriate user
charges, energy conservation and revenue mobilization (draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement, Section 4.01 (c)). As part of the proposed
Fourth Highway Project (FY85), IDA will review with the Government
specific price levels. As a first step, the Fourth Highway Project
would recommend a tax on fuel as a charge on road users.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
80.       The proposed Credit is one of a series of four Credits (para.
28) designed to support the 1983-86 time-slice of the Goverment of
Ghana's economic recovery program. The Bank Group's operations are
being closely coordinated with the IMF which is undertaking its second
consecutive Standby Arrangement. The macroeconomic elements of the RIC
II pre am were identifiad initially as a result of a Bank Economic
Mission which visited Ghana in June 1984. 4/ These were further
developed jointly between the Government, the Fund and the Bank. The
incentive and investment policies components of the program were devel-
oped as a result of the work of an Agriculture Sector Review Mission
which visited Ghana im May 1984, a Trade and Industry Mission (July
1984) and the Industry Sub-Sector Mission (November 1984). The sectoral
components of the program also rely on the work of the above missions, a
Transportation Sector Strategy Note (July 1984) and a Mining Sub-Sector
Review (October 1984).

November 7, 1984.

81.       The Project was pre-appraised during the June 1984 economic
mission and appraised in October/November 1984. A post-appraisal
mission visited Ghana in January 1985 (overlapping with the Fund mis-
sion) to ensure emplacement of the major elements of the RIC II.
Negotiations were held in Washington between February 19 and 25, 1985.
The Ghanaian delegation was headed by Mrs. Owusu, Deputy PNDC Secretary
for Finance and Economic Planning, and included representatives from
Bank of Ghana, Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning, and Indus-
try. Significant events and special conditions are summarized in Annex
III.
Relationship Between the Proposed Credit and Policy Reforms
82.       The proposed Credit supports the final phase (1985-86) of the
Government's economic recovery program, together with the INF's Second
Standby Arrangement (August 1984 - December 1985). The two programs
complement each other with the IMF focussing on areas of exchange rate
policies, foreign borrowing, fiscal, monetary and credit policies and
the IDA focussing on the development expenditure program and investment,
incentive and restructuring policies in the major productive sectors
(agriculture, industry, mining and transportation). The two programs
are summarized in Table 6.

Effects of Economic Recovery Program
83.       As outlined in Part II, the Government's economic recovery
program (1984-86), which is being supported by three ongoing IDA Credits
(in addition to this proposed Credit) and two consecutive Fund Standby
Arrangements, has had a substantial effect in stabilizing the economy
(1984) and should now form the basis for renewed growth through its
emphasis on rehabilitation of priority sectors and by improvements in
incentive mechanisms.
Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
84.       With incentive structures largely in place by early 1985, the
performance of the economy depends largely on: (a) a stronger export
effort and net external resource inflows sufficient to finance the raw
material and capital rehabilitation needs of the economy; (b) a more
substantial domestic resource mobilization effort to finance the minimum
required level of public development expenditures while reducing trans-
fers to the public exchequer from the cocoa sector; and (c) control over
public consumption expenditures.
85.       The foreign exchange requirements of the economy cannot be met
only from improvements in efforts since performance in this regard can
only be modest in the short term. Both cocoa and the precious minerals
sectors must await the results of the ongoing rehabilitation program,
while timber, rubber. bauxite, and manganese will show substantial gains
only after their own rehabilitation piograms, as well as the rehabilita-
tion of the transport infrastructure, are substantially complete.
Whatever the gains that accrue from improvements in exports, however,
are likely to be more than offset from the increased amortization
payments due on external debt. Ghana must therefore depend in this
period on larger net external inflows to finance its import needs
required to increase capacity utilization in productive sectors (and
particularly in industry) and to meet rehabilitation requirements. The
growth rates envisaged, particularly in the industries and services
sectors, can easily be achieved if existing policies are maintained and
if the required external resources are made available since there is
substantial unutilized capacity in these sectors. Now that the downhill
slide of the economy appears to have been halted and an economic
recovery can be expected to take place, with infusion of quick disburs-
ing assistance (para. 32), the proposed Credit would provide a basis for
such a recovery effort and is expected to attract substantial
cofinancing both from multilateral and bilateral sources.
86.       However, any response of the economy to improved incentives
and increased availability of raw materials is likely to be short-lived
unless a minimum required level of investment is made in publicly
naintained infrastructure (particularly transportation) and in critical
areas under public control (agriculture extension, public sector indus-
tries, health and education, and mining, etc.). Given the fact that it
is now accepted that cocoa and other export industries if they are to
survive must retain larger shares of their own earnings (rather than
transfer part of it to the Government Budget as in the past), increased



- 35 -
resource mobilization must occur to finance public sector investments.
The public expenditure program for 1985 has been agreed to as a part of
RIC II and the preparation of the 1986-88 rolling medium-term develop-
ment program by September 30, 1985 (para. 38) is also a part of the RIC
II program. These programs should, if they are inplemented substantial-
ly, improve public infrastructure. However, throughout this periou,
strict control over public consumption expenditures will need to be
maintained.
87.       Prospects for the medium term are for substantial improvements
in economic performance and for increases in per capita private consump-
tion if the momentum being developed by the current economic recovery
program can be maintained.
Benefits and Risks
88.       The main benefits of the Credit are:  (i) imports of the
essential items to support the Government's economic recovery program
will be secured, thus providing a basis to improve the depressed level
of the living standard; (ii) the supply position of the economy which
has been at a very suppressed level for more than a decade would improve
as a result of the improved performance of the four priority sectors
through increased imports of essential items for rehabilitation and
maintenance; and (iii) private institutions would benefit from more
liberalized import procedures and foreign exchange allocation and thus
contribute to more efficient implementation of the economic recovery
program. The main risks associated with the proposed project are that
the Government's commitment to the austere economic recovery program
might be changed and that adequate external financing may not be forth-
coming for sustaining imports. Close cooperation and a continuous
dialogue between the Government, the IMF and IDA will assist in the
implementation of policy reform and the Goverament (with the assistance
of IDA through its chairmanship of the Consultative Group for Ghana) is
striving to maximize the flow of external assistance to sustain the
import program.
Poverty Impact
89.       The Credit does not directly benefit the poor.  However, the
Credit is in support of the economic recovery program, the adjustment
objectives of which have a high degree of complementarity with objec-
tives of poverty alleviation. The reforms are intended to have a
positive impact on employment and small holder incentives, through more
realistic relative prices, higher investment levels, and accelerated
growth. Moreover, with the return to fiscal stability, resources can be
shifted at the margin to the social sectors. RIC II helps finance an
impor. program intended to improve capacity utilization in the produc-
tive sectors of the economy, which will indirectly benefit employment.
It supports measures to increase real producer incomes for small holder
cocoa, tobacco, and cotton farmers. It also supports a development
budget that shifts resources to agriculture, a sector dominated by
smallholders, and to the social sectors, particularly education and
health. To the extent that the Recovery Program enhances the country's



- 36 -
resources through greater efficiency in the utilization of resources,
and an overall increased flow of resources through increased resource
mobilization, both domestic and external, it enhances the Government's
capacity to alleviate poverty in the medium term.
Credit Amount
90.       The proposed Credit of $60 million equivalent would finance
about 5 percent of Ghana's non-oil merchandise Imports in the period
July 1985 - December 1986, and meet about 10 percent of the gross
external capital requirements of the country for the same period. The
amount of the proposed Credit was determined on the basis of IDA's
allocation for Ghana taking into account other priority needs for which
IDA assistance has been requested.
Disbursement and Procurement
91.       The Government of Ghana would be the Borrower.  The proceeds
of the Credit would be made available to the Bank of Ghana, the imple-
menting agency of the proposed project. Conclusion of the Subsidiary
Agreement between the Borrower and the Bank of Ghana would be a cond4-
tion of effectiveness of the Credit (draft Development Credit Agreement,
Section 6.02(b)). The Bank of Ghana would be responsible for maintain-
ing the accounts in respect of the project (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.01 (a) and (b)) and for submitting withdrawal
applications and supporting documentation to the Association. The
Credit is expected to be fully disbursed within eighteen months of
Credit effectiveness.
92.       Disbursement and procurement procedures have been designed to
ensure the rapid draw-down of Credit proceeds. The Credit would reim-
buzse 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of eligible imports on
the basis that they are paid for and imported after signing of the
Credit. Goods not eligible for financing are alcohol and tobacco,
precious metals and stones, nuclear reactors and uranium, petroleum
products except lubricants for the mining industry and products (or raw
materials for products) which are subject to price and di_;ribution
controls, except for raw materials for drugs, textiles and matches whose
scarcity level is so high that rehabilitation of local production
capacity of these basic items is essential for the success of the
economic recovery program (draft Development Credit, Scheduile 1, para
2(a), (b) and (c)). Imports financed from other sources would also not
be eligible for IDA financing. For contracts of less than $200,000
equivalent reimbursements would be against statements of e1penditure.
Supporting documents related to these contracts would be retained in the
Bank of Ghana and made available on request to the Association for
review. Except for office equipment, expenditures for goods procured
under invoices for SDR 20,000 equivalent or less would not be eligible
for financing out of the proceeds of the Credit. To the extent possi-
ble, reimbursement applications will be aggregated and submitted when
eligible expenditures exceed $1 million equivalent by sector.

93.       A special account would be opened at an internationally
reputable bank in a major capital market in order to ensure speedy and
smooth disbursements under the project. The authorized allocation to
such an account would be SDR 10 million. As unaer RIC I, close supervi-
sion would be exercised by the Association on the use of funds from the
special account. The Borrower would be required to open a special
account on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 2.02(b)).
94.       The Credit is allocated to four sectors -- agriculture $15
million, industry $18 million, transport $15 million, and mining $12
mllion--with provision for reallocation amongst these sectors (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Schedule 1). Seventy-five percent of the
individual allocations for agriculture, industry and transport are
expected to be utilized by the private sector (end user), while the
allocations for mining would be for several of the major mining compa-
ties which are 'mixed' enterprises or in the public sector. Procurement
would be: (a) for the private sector and the mining sector, everything
costing over $1 million would be subject to ICB and less than $1 million
through normal commercial channels; and (b) for the public sector except
for the mining sector, everything over $300,000 would be subject to ICB.
Proprietary items may be purchased directly. The Bank of Ghana may also
allow direct purcziasing for contracts below $100,000 when a demonstrat-
ed urgency so requires. All imports financed under the Credit would go
through pre-nhipment inspection by an inspection agency contracted by
the Bank of Ghana. Procvrement of items of less than $300,000 equiva-
lent would be through quotations from at least 3 internationally reputa-
ble suppliers. Procurement on behalf of the Government and parastatals
will be through an external procurement agency. Employment of an
external procurement agency acceptable to the Association would be a
condition of effectiveness (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section
6.01(c)).
Monitoring
95.       The proposed project would take advantage of the experience
of, and lessons learnt from RIC I operations, and would be implemented
and monitored by t'e Bank of Ghana, the implementing agency for RIC I.
On matters of policy, the Bank of Ghana will be guided by the existing
Interministerial PIC Committee for interministerial coordination (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.04). On matters of implementa-
tion, use will be made, as in RIC I, of a Technical Committee in the
Bank of Ghana which will be expanded to include representatives of the
Ministries of Lands and Natural Resources and Industry. The existing
RIC I Project Unit under the Technical Committee will also be expanded
slightly to reflect the larger size and the increased number of sectors
under the proposed project. The establishment of an expanded Technical
Committee and an expanded Project Unit acceptable to the Association
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit (draft
Development Credit Agreement, Section 6.01(b) and (d)). The Project
Unit is to receive a small allocation under the proposed project to
introduce some computerization for a more streamlined flow of informa-
tion.



- 38 -
96.       The Bank of Ghana, the project implementing agency, would
maintain records and separate accounts in respect of the respective
sector components and have the accounts and financual statements audited
each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to the Association.
The audited accounts and the audit reports would be furnished to the
Association not later than four months after the end of the fiscal year.
The Bank of Ghana would also maintain records adequate to record and
monitor the progress of the respective sector c'mponents and prepare and
furnish quarterly progress reports to the Asso.iation. There would be a
quarterly review of progress of the project by the Interministerial RIC
Committee, which would also prepare and submic to the Association within
six months of project completion, a completion report on the costs and
benefits resulting from the project.
Cooperation with the IMn
97.       Work on the proposed RIC II is being carefully coordinated
with the IMF, particularly in the areas of domestic resource mobiliza-
tion and trade and tariff policies. The RIC II appraisal was undertaken
while an IDM consultation mission was in the field and there was close
cooperation between the two missions. Draft documents and viewa are
being exchanged at every stage in the processing of the proposed Credit.
The IMF staff agrees with the RIC II Program, which is complementary to
the IMP's (Second) Standby Arrangement.
PART V - LEGAL IIISTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
98.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Ghana and the Association and the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and the Bank of Ghana and the Recommendation of the Commit-
tee provided for in Article V, Sectior l(d) of the Articles of Agree-
ment, are being distributed to the Ei-._utive Directors separately.
99.       In addition to the special features of the Development Credit
Agreement and the Project Agreement which are referred to in the text
and summarized in Section III of Annex III of this report, the condi-
tions of effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement are:
(a) execution of the Subsidiary Agreement between the Republic of Ghana
and the Bank of Ghana; (b) agreement on the cocoa producer price for the
1985/86 season between the Association and the Republic of Ghana as
mentioned in para 50 above; (c) the establishment of a Technical Cormit-
tee and a Project Unit as mentioned in para 95 above; (d) reduction of
price controlled items from 17 to 8 as mentioned in para 45;
(e) reduction of distribution control items from 15 to 8 as mentioned
in para. 46; and (f) employment of procurement agent as mentioned in
para. 94.
100.      I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
