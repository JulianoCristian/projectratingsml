The project was the first major attempt in India to\n            minimize water losses in conveyance and operation by\n            rehabilitation and modernization of an existing irrigation\n            system. Water savings were to be use to introduce two crop\n            irrigation in areas that previously grew only one irrigated\n            crop per year, and to bring new areas, previously rainfed,\n            under irrigation. The project supported lining of the\n            irrigation conveyance system to the 10 ha outlet;\n            construction of a link canal; improvements of irrigation\n            tanks; construction of canal service roads and village\n            roads; strengthening of the extension services; and\n            extension of the existing canal system to utilize some of\n            the water saved for increasing the irrigation command area.\n            A major lesson of the project is that lining and\n            rehabilitation of the canal system are not sufficient to\n            attain full agricultural potential. In addition, canal\n            operation efficiency and improved water management are other\n            essential elements."}, "docdt": "1986-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
