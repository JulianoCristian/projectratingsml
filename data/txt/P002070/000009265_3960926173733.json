generate a sustained supply reponse\n            in private, productive SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises)\n            in the context of the new policy environment and the ongoing\n            adjustment process. In line with this objective the project\n            includes five financial and technical assistance components:\n            (a) an apex line of credit to finance fixed assets and\n            working capital needs of SMEs; (b) a pilot financial\n            restructuring scheme; (c) a pilot mutualist credit guarantee\n            scheme for microenterprises; (d) an equipment leasing\n            component to provide alternative long term financing to\n            SMEs; and (e) an integrated package of technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1988-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
