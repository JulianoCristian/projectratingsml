Nigeria. The overall objective of the\n            project were to: (a) support existing enterprises to\n            restructure and modernize their operations to maintain\n            comparative advantage and regain competitive advantage; (b)\n            help establish a new generation of viable investments in\n            private productive sectors and service activities; and (c)\n            improve the quality and range of financial and extension\n            services available to SMEs. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was deficient. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (i) in order for\n            market-based SME development to take place, Nigeria must\n            achieve economic stability; (ii) the project had too many\n            components in addition to the line-of-credit which already\n            was a challenge for the Borrower since it involved\n            channeling funds through twenty eight banks instead of one\n            as in past projects; and (iii) the set-up of an apex unit\n            with adequate operational facilities should be a condition\n            of effectiveness for any future project to avoid the\n            deficiencies experienced in this project."}, "docdt": "1997-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
