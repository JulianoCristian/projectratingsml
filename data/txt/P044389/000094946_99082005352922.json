While there were differences among\n            and within components, overall achievement of objectives was\n            substantial, and most components are likely to be sustained.\n            Overall performance by the International Development\n            Association (IDA) was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory in all aspects of physical\n            implementation. However, because of ethnic distrust and the\n            country's complex political structure, consensus was\n            difficult to achieve, which sometimes impeded progress. A\n            key reason for the project's success was the strong and\n            well-functioning project coordination unit, which exercised\n            effective control over the various subcomponents. Other\n            lessons learned are: Developing a parallel reform program\n            can lay the groundwork for long-term sustainability of\n            government investments beyond reconstruction. IDA can\n            effectively leverage its activities by pursuing pilot\n            projects and by paying early, consistent attention to\n            cofinancing possibilities. An adequate amount of\n            well-targeted, high-quality technical assistance is key to\n            realize emergency project objectives. Establishment of\n            monitoring and auditing agencies and systems increases\n            project effectiveness and accountability. At the outset of\n            the project, the project executing agency should be\n            established and its director appointed and involved in\n            project design and negotiations. IDA backstopping on the\n            ground and intensive project supervision are needed."}, "docdt": "1999-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
