The sustainability of Argentina's reform\n            program was consolidated, partly, due to the success of\n            public sector reforms among the project's participating\n            provinces. Furthermore, the project became the link between\n            municipal and national authorities, on policy issues central\n            to the process of public sector reform. The key lessons\n            suggest that structural adjustment loans, which are targeted\n            at sub-national governments, may become key elements in\n            successful reform programs, since they provide the forum for\n            agreements on overall reform strategies. Nevertheless, this\n            success was the result of various factors, of which, the\n            strong political support was paramount. A sustained\n            reduction of expenditures requires, and, depends on adequate\n            incentives, both at the national and provincial levels,\n            since financial support does not substitute adequate policy\n            incentives. Windfall transfers and soft sources of deficit\n            financing, undermine the potential for fiscal reform, thus\n            early identification of post-stabilization measures should\n            be in place during reform processes, as well as possible\n            negotiations, to neutralize negative impacts, should soft\n            financing occur. It is suggested that crises not only\n            generate risks, but opportunities for large-scale provincial\n            reforms. Reform leverage should be maximized through strict\n            creditworthiness, and, focusing on few sub-national\n            government's reforms."}, "docdt": "1999-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
