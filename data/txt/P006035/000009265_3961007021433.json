Project will\n            support the Federal Government's effort to promote the\n            reform of provincial finances. Its purpose is to deepen the\n            fiscal reforms underlying macroeconomic stability and\n            enhance the capacity of the provincial governments to\n            fulfill their increasingly important role as providers of\n            public goods and services. It will support an overall\n            environment of incentives for restructuring provincial\n            public finances by increasing provincial accountability in\n            the use of federal transfers and eliminating special\n            treatment of provincial banks. It will also accelerate\n            reforms in eight of the 23 provincial governments with\n            financial and technical assistance to improve the structure\n            and administration of taxation; establish budgetary and\n            administrative controls; reduce redundant public employment;\n            improve the efficiency of transfers to the municipalities;\n            privatize services now perfomed by public enterprises; and\n            reduce the potential for deficit spending and inflationary\n            financing by privatizing provincial banks."}, "docdt": "1994-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
