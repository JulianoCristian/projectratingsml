PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
SECOND VATER SUPPLY PROJECT
CREDIT AN PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrover         :   People's Republic of Benin
Beneficiary      :   Societé Béninoise d'Electricité et d'Eau (SBEE)
Credit Amoumt    :   SDR 8.6 million (US$10.0 million)
Terms            :   Standard
Cofinancing      :   Caisse  Centrale de Coopération Economique of France
(about US$10.0 million); Islamic Development Bank
(about US$4.5 million); and the OPEC Fund (about
US$2.7 million)
Relendins
Terma          :   US$7.1 million  equivalent  of  the IDA Credit vould be
onlent to SBEE on terms of 20 years, including 5
years of grace and 8.5Z interest rate. The
Covernment vould bear the excbange rate risk. US$2.9
million equivalent would be passed on by the
Government as contribution to SBEE's vorking capital.
Project
Description    :    IU lne vith the Government's policy to rehabilitate
the parapublic sector, the main  objective of the
proposed project vould be to iprove the financial
viability of the urban vater supply sector through
lov cost expansions in the main urban centers,
promotion of domestic connections, tariff setting to
reflect long term marginal cost, strengthening of
SBEE's management capability and implementation of
sound commercial practices to reverse accumulation of
unpaid bille. In support of these objectives the
proposed project would include (a) the expansion of
the vater supply facilities in Cotonou and Porto
Novo; (b) a management support program for SBEE; and
(c) the replenishment of SBEE's vorking capital.



- uiii -
Proiect
Benefits       :   The proposed project vould support the
Governuent's objective of enhancing the economic
performance of the sector through irproved inve«tment
planning, and institution of oound cocmercial and
coat recovery policies. By 1994, it would supply
vater to an additional 640,000 people either directly
or indirectly through comnmity connections (an
increase of more than 150Z). More than 40Z of this
population belongs to the poverty group.
Proiect
Risks          :   The  project risks are those arising from (a) cost
overruns; (b) qperation and maintenance veaknesses;
and (c) inadeqbate tariff levels. These risks have
been minlimuzed by (a) basing cost estimates on actual
co0t for slmilar vorks lu the country and by using a
diabursement profile based on a conservative
iaplementation schedule; (b) including a substantial
management support program to strengthen SBEE's
operations; and (c) implementing systematic
procedures for tariff revisions.

Cotonou's vater, sanitation and urban problem ; prepare specific projects
for possible financing by Bank Group and other lenders; suggest appropriate
institutional arrangements; and to strengthen the financial viability of
the vater/sanitation sector. The Bank has also executed vith Société
Béninoise d'Electricité et d'Eau (SBEE), the national electricity/vàater
company, a Pover Engineering Project (Cr.1189-BEN of November 1981) and is
presently involved in the Nangbeto Hydro-Electricity Project (Cr.1507-BEN
of June 1984) being implemented together vith Communauté Electrique du
Bénin (CEB), a regional pover supplier, and Compagnie d'Energie Electrique
du Togo (CEET), the Togolese electricity authority.
1.02     The Bank has a rather limited experience in the urban,
electricity and vater supply sectors in Benin. However, during preparation
and/or execution of the above mentioned projects, it could be noted that:
(a)    implementation of a combined urban/vater/sanitation
project, as initially envisaged by the Government and the
Bank which vould have to deal with institutions with
videly differing organizational and technical problems as
vell as experience in project execution, vould be
extremely difficult; and
(b)    the Government is villing to address sectorial financial
issues, once it is highly committed to a project; for
example, substantial electricity and vater tariff
increases vere granted to SBEE before approval of the
Nangbeto Hydro-Electricity Project (para 3.15), and
negotiations of the proposed Water Supply Project (para
5.03) respectively.
B. Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
1.03      Overall, the current Bank strategy in Benin focuses on supporting
Government effort towards financial stabilization and economic recovery.
Consequently, the macro-economic dialogue emphasizes improving public
expenditure programs and sector intervention focuses on improving output
performance of existing facilities. A Technical Assistance Project for



planning and Economic Management (Cr.1530-BER) vas approved in December
1984 to aid the former lad a proposed Public Enterprise Sector
Roe-abilitation (PESR) Project (5467-BEN) aims at achieviug the latter in
the parastatals.
1.04      The proposed later project vith SBEE (one of the few
vell-funetioning parastatals in Benin) vould be tiuely due to its
complementary nature to the ongoing projects (para 1.03) and others under
consideration, since SBEE in being asked by the Government to extend its
operations in eeveral secondary centers (para 2.05), and since it in
evident that establisburà'tt of a sound financial framevork in the Urban
Vater Supply (UWS) sector can only be based on activities initially
concentrating in the hain urban centers (Cotonou sad Porto Novo).
II. TEE WATER SGPPLY AUD SANITATION SECTOR
A. Sector Organization
2.01      The overall country and sector background in given in Annex 2-1.
Responsibilities for the Urban Waster Supply (UWS) sector are exclusively in
the hands of SBEE, a combined electricity/vater utility established in 1973
as a public enterprise; it i also responsible for piped severage
facilities, vhich hovever for the moment, do not exist. SBEE reports to
the Ministry of Finance and Economy (alo in charge of Mines and Energy),
which transmite Goverument objectives vithout major interference in SBEE's
day-to-day operations. Detailed information on SBEE is given in Chapter
III.
2.02      The Rural Water Supply (RiWS) sector is placed under the
responsibility of Direction de l'Hydraulique (DE) of the Ninlstry of
Equipmuet and Transportation (MET). DE i in charge of planning,
preparation and execution of the var'ous RWS programs. Detailed
information on DE's organization and other agencies involved In this sector
i given in Annex 2-2.
2.03      Responsibilities for sanitation are divided among several
agencies: in Cotonou, for example, there are three: (a) Direction de la
Voirie (DV of the Coto-«!l Prefecture) collecta and disposes of so'id vaste
and sesage; (b) Direction des Voiries Urbaines (DVU, of MET) builde and
maintaina new etreets and drains; and (c) Direction du Génie Sanitaire et
de l'Assainissement (DGSA of the Ministry of Health) supervises latrine
construction. An Urban Management project, presently under preparation
(para 2.07), vould address the major issue of municipal services
reorganization. Responsibility for rural sanitation remains ill-defined
and for this reason, little attention has been and 8till i given to this
subsector.

B. Present Service Levels
2.04      As of end 1984, 22 out of the 78 administrative centers in
existence in Benin vere equipped vith piped systeus, but since several
centers vere served by combined facilities, there vere really only 19
systeas in operation (Anuex 2-3). Fourteen of these (of vhich three are
Cotonou, Porto Novo, and Abomey) use groundwater while f ive systems (of
which one is Parakou) obtain vater from a surface source. It is estimated
that about 60Z of the population of the presently equipped centers have
access to the public vater supply systems; 17Z being served by house
connections vith an average consumption of about 45 lcd; 13Z by public
standpipes vith an estimated consumption of 20 lcd; and 302 obtaining their
vater from neighbors (private reselling of vater). The remaining 40Z are
belleved to rely only on untreated vater sources, such as private vells,
for their drinking vater needs. The installations date, in general, from
the late sixties to the early seventies, vith the systems in Cotonou and
Porto Novo being the oldest. Physical characteristics of all the existing
systems and information on the service levels are given in Annexes 2-4 and
2-5 respectively.
2.05      Investments in the UWS sector have amounted to approxiutely
CFAF 3.2 billion (US$8.9 million) over the last five years. For the
future, the Covernment has set an overly ambitious goal of equipping the
78 provincial and district centers vith piped systems by 1990. Although
there is no national vater supply master plan, feasibility studies are
either completed or underway for about 50 of the secondary centers as vell
as for Cotonou and Porto Novo. Tentative investuent programs for 54 of
these secondary centers are in the order of CFAF 15.0 billion
(US$41.7 million or US$8.3 million per annum) up to 1990. This vould
appear overly ambitious especially vhen compared vith the pace of past
investmeut of US$1.8 million per annum. Since then, objectives have been
reduced by about one-half, and financing for only 29 centers (of vhich 25
are nev) in the amount of about CFAF 8.0 billion (US$22.2 million) has been
secured from the Federal Republic of Germany (KfW), the Kingdom of Denmark
and the African Development Fund (AfDF). Definition of future investment
prograus vill be linked to SBEE's financial prospects and be integrated in
the preperation of future "Enterprise Contracts" (para. 3.04). During
negotiations assurances vere obtained that until the end of 1993, SBEE
vould present a financing plan snd consult vith IDA before undertaking any
additional capital expenditure in the UWS and severage sectors of more than
CFA? 500 million (about US$1.4 million).
2.06      As of end 1984, there vere about 4,000 villages in Benin vith
2.4 million inhabitants. The rural population is forecast to grov at a
rate of about 1.6Z per anuum and to reach 2.7 and 3.1 million people in
1990 and 2000 respectively. Construction of modern vater points (boreholes
or open vells) started in 1980 exclusively under external assistance; past
investuents betveen 1980 and 1984 have amounted to about CFAF 8.0 billion



- 4 -
(US$22.2 million), or approximately US$5.2 million per annum. Dg has
estimated the need for water points to serve all settlementg over 200
people to be between 6,000 and 10,000 in year 2000 depending upon the vater
demand criteria taken into account (10 or 20 lcd), and is presently in the
process of identifying the exact needs of the sector vith French bilateral
assistance. Meanwhile, DR has defined an emergency program of 2,400 water
points to be created by 1990, of which about 60% should be located in the
central and northern provinces (Zou, Atacora, Borgou) which recently
suffered recurrent droughts (Annex 2-1). Such a program appears to be
reasonable with regard to DH's absorptive capacity, and projects already
completed or for which financing has been secured would result in about
2,500 vater points by 1990; detailed information is given in Annex 2-6.
2.07      In the urban centers, there are no vaterborne piped severage
systems except in limited housing areas. In Cotonou, only 7Z of the
population have access to flush toilets connected to septic tanks and 71Z
to pit latrines while the remaining 22% do not have access to any sanitary
facility at all. Also, only 40% of the public places are equipped vith
latrines or toilets. A UNDP financed/Bank executed project, vhich has
recently started, would promote construction of ventilated improved pit
(VIP) latrines both in Cotonou and the rural province of Zou. Sevage
collection and disposal services are provided mostly for emptying of septic
tanks. Solid vaste collection and disposal are unsatisfactory, although
improvements have recently been obtained vithin the scope of the
Engineering Project (para 1.01). However, only 30% of the population have
a reasonably regular service; in many parts of the city indiscriminate
garbage disposal is practiced in streets, drains and marshlands. This poor
sanitary situation is further exacerbated by very difficult drainage
conditions, resulting from the combination of a flat topography, barely
lying above the sea level, heavy rainfalls and a drainage network
unsufficiently developed and poorly maintained. The Urban Management
project (para 2.03) would also address urban sanitation and drainage
issues, at least in Cotonou. Recent surveys have shown that sanitary
conditions in the other urban centers are comparable to the one of Cotonou.
No data are available regarding rural sanitation.
2.08      There are feu reliable statistics on specific vaterborne and
sanitation associated diseases, although morbidity due to cozmon enteric
and parasitic diseases is shown to be high throughout the country
especially in the Zou and Borgou provinces. The more commonly observed
diseases are malaria, various diarrhoeas, dysenteries and parasitic
infections directly attributable to vater supply and environmental
deficiencies.
C. Sector Policies
2.09      The UWS sector being entirely in the hands of a commercially
oriented entity, SBEE, the principle of payment for the sale of piped vater
is widely accepted.



2.10      The number of domestic connections remains at a rather low level,
in spite of the relatively good development of the distribution networks in
the centers presently so equipped (Annexes 2-4, 2-5 and 2-7).   This could
be explained by the folloving observations:
(a)    Almost all compounds still have their private wells and
the urban centers, even Cotonou, are still little
urbanized with horizontal spatial development being the
norm;
(b)    House connections, which are to be paid in advance of
installation (about CFAF 60,000 or US$167), are too
expensive for a large segment of the population;
(c)    The tariff structure does not include a "social tranche"
(typically, say, for up to the first 10 ms/month);
(d)    Many consumers with domestic connections vould consume
very little vater from the public system (between three
and six m3/month per connection), and SBEE claims that the
corresponding revenues could hardly cover the processing
costs for managing the accounts. Thus, SBEE has, in the
past, not been aggressive in trying to promote domestic
connections; and
(e)    Daily water purch9se from neighbors (para 2.04) is
financially less of a burden to low income earners.
During negotiations, assurances vere obtained that SBEE would promete,
together with the new vater tariffs, a commercial policy whereby small
domestic consumers could be provided with lou cost connections partially
subsidized by a small surcharge included in the water tariff (para 5.01).
2.11      Public standpipes have so far been regarded by SBEE as one of the
main sources of municipal arrears. In Cotonou, only Il standpipes out of
60 are presently in operation; new standpipes are under consideration as a
temporary solution at strategic locations only for those newly settled
areas which have not yet been formally parcelled out under the form of
"concession standpipes". A private customer would then be accountable for
paying to SBEE the water consumed and for selling the vater at a guided
resale price. Actually, the widespread practice of vater resales to
neighbors (para 2.04) already plays the role of "concession standpipes"' and
provides a useful community service while assuring regular revenues to
SBEE. Even with a paying standpipe service, the cost to the consumer would
remain at least the same, as the "neighborhood" resale system is already
based on the smallest coin value (CFAF 5 or 10) and the general capacity of
portable buckets (approximately 18 to 20 liters).



- 6-
2.12      The RWS sector, vhose development in rather recent, (the firat
handpumps vere installed lu 1980) has benefitted from experience of other
African countries, especially the Sahelian ones. lu particular, DE puts
great emphasis on village sensitizatlon and is i plemeuting a policy of
technical and fiannial self-reliance of the villagers for the maintenance
of the handpumps; the maintenance costs of about CFAP 50,000 per year
(US$139) are borne by the villagers. Issues pertaining to handpumps
standardization, availability of spare parts and training of village
caretakers and rural blacksmiths are also correctly addressed.
D. Prolect Area
2.13      The proposed project would provide funds for expansion of vater
supply in Cotonou and Porto Novo, the two most Important urban centers lu
Benin.
2.14      Annex 2-7 describes the existlng vater supply situation in
Cotonou and Porto Novo and Annex 2-8 gives detailed vater demand forecasts
for these cities as vell as for the other urban centers served by SBEE.
Based on past experience in similar Vest African cities, the average per
capita demaud and connection ratio are expected to increase ouly
marginally.  However, during implementation of the proposed project, the
population served by the public systems in Cotonou and Porto Novo is
estimated to be multiplled by about 2.5, vhile the total population vould
only double. The folloving table summarizes the forecasts for the project
area.

III.  TUE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
A.  Institutional Envirozment
3.01      The Sociité Béninoise d'Electricité et d'Eau (SBEE) vas created
in 1973, replacing the former Sociéti Dahomeenne d'Electr1cité (SDE); its
equity ï8 held 100I by Governuent. SBEE's purpose in defined as
generation, transmission and distribution of electrie pover, as vell as
vater supply and piped vastevater disposal. SBEE's policies are determined
by a board, vhich meets at least once a year and comprises Il members
representing seven Ninistries, the National Assembly, the Chamber of
Commerce and SBEE's staff. SBEE is entrusted vith comprehensive
responsibilities for both the electricity and urban vater/severage sectors
including sector planning, project preparation, financing and
implementation, operation of the facilities, billing and collection, and
debt service. SBEE enjoys a certain measure of managerial autonomy except
in the areas of staff remuneration policies (para 3.11) and tariff setting
(para 3.15) which are placed under direct responsibility of the Government.
SBEE's rights and obligations, as vell as its relations vith customers, are
outlined in a "Cahier des Charges" (General Regulations) dating from the
former SDE; this document only refers to the electricity sector, though it
has alvays been understood that the same regulations vould apply to the
Urban Water Supply (UWS) sector. So far this jurisdictional vacuum has
not been a major issue, the sectorial organization being close to the
optimum. New General Regulations for UWS have been prepared under the
Engineering Project and vere reviewed by Bank staff during negotiations.
Signing of Regulations, satisfactory to IDA, is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
B. Organization and Management
3.02      SBEE, vhich employed 1,645 staff as of mid 1984 (para 3.11), has
separate planning departments for electricity and vater and separate
technical operation departments for the two subsectors at each of the six
provincial levels. Meter reading, billing and collection and accounting
are combined activities (see Annex 3-1 for SBEE's present organization
chart and staffing). SBEE's organizatIonal structure vas reviewed by
consultant Hydro-Quebec of Canada in 1983, vhile other consultants,
Compagnie Générale des Eaux (CGE), the largest private French vater
distribution company, financed under the Engineering Credit 1171-BEN have
analyzed in detail in 1984 the organization of the vater department. The
combination of electric pover and vater supply in one entity iB not
altogether desirable (the vater operations usually represent oanly I0%-20Z
of the turnover and tend to be treated as marginal activities), but
separation of the two activities at this juncture vould be premature taking
into account the small size of the operations, the scarcity of qualified
managers and the cost of such a separation. However, proposals made by CGE
for reorganization/strengthening of vater operations are all oriented



tovards enhancing autonomy of the vater department vis-à-vis the
electricity department vith a long-term objective of splitting SBEE into
two distinct companies. SBEE and CGE have recently signed an agreement
whereby CGE vould, upon SBEE's request, provide technical assistance for
improvement of operations.
3.03      The main problem of SBEE's present set-up is an excessive
centralization which leads the ten departments to report directly to the
General Manager and his deputy, vith limited communication among
theuselves. CGE has recoamended the creation of tvo departments, one
technical and the other financial/commercial/administrative, and of the
positions of technical manager and secretary general to head the respective
departments. CGE has also proposed the creation of a general
inspection/internal audit group reporting to the General Manager to ensure
that procedures are effectively applied. The proposed organization chart
is given in Amnex 3-2 and is deemed acceptable, as a first step tovards
further decentralization of the responsibilities assigned to the secretary
general. During negotiations, assurances vere obtained that SBEE would
establish by December 31, 1989 a decentralized management structure
acceptable to IDA. As a firat step, SBEE has recently requested Caisse
Centrale de Coopération Economique of France (CCCE) to finance a Management
Support Program (MSP) to strengthen the departments of finance, data
processing, vater distribution, electricity production and electricity
distribuzion. Such a program vould provide for short-term management
consultancy, training of intermediate higher level staff and long-term
technical assistance. It is expected that this program vould be initiated
by late 1986 and implemented by late 1988. The proposed project vould
continue actions undertaken under this program for about one year. Further
details, including terms of reference sumaries of the key technical
assistants, are given in the folloving paragraphs and in Annex 3-3.
3.04      Within the framework of the proposed PESR project (para. 1.03),
the Goverument has agreed to prepare "Enterprise Contracts" to be applied
on a pilot basis to selected parastatals. They vould be designed to guide
enterprise managers as vell as supervising ministries and to constitute the
basis for a monitoring system. In the case of SBEE, an "Entreprise
Contract" has been prepared under the Engineering Project and vas reviewed
by Bank staff during negotiations. Signing of the "Enterprise Contract",
satisfactory to IDA, is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
Credit. Such a document vould stipulate for a three-year period starting
in 1987: (a) mutual commitments, especially in the field of payment of
arrears (paras 3.18 to 3.21) and revision of tariffs (paras 5.01 to 5.04);
(b) an agreed investment program (para 2.05) and financial projections for
at least the next three years (para 3.09); and (c) selected monitoring
indicators (para 4.15). This document vould also translate the NSP into an
action-program. During negotiations, assurances vere obtained that
Government and SBFE vould carry out the provisions of the "Enterprise
Contract" effectively.



-9 -
C. Logistico, Data Processins
3.05      SBEE's central departments are located iu .n inadequate and
totally unsuitable leased building; the data processing departmeut
building is separated from the headquarters and has no means of
communication. Inadequacy of the present arrangements has resulted in mauy
management difficulties. The proposed project vould finance construction
of office space (about 1,500 m2 in a firet phase) to relocate SBEE's
central departments. The regional department of Atlantique has sufficient
office space, but extension of small collection offices to be located in
Cotonou's neighborboods vill be required in the near future. Presently,
SBEE has sufficiently sized and equipped varehouses, laboratories and
workshops (some of them have recently been created in secondary centers
under financing from the Federal Republic of Germany - GTZ); the vehicle
fleet is satisfactory and well maintained.
3.06      SBEE has been using a Bull 61/40 computer purchased in 1970 for
four major applications (payroll, general accounting. statistics and
billing and collection). Mini computers recently acquired for streamlining
collection have never been used due to maintenance problems and
incompatibility with the mainframe computer. Studies financed by the
Engineering Credit (1171-BEN) have highlighted major data processing
problems: applications are not integrated, control of data input is
insufficient and many calculations are still done manually or not done at
all. This is also exacerbated by the fact that the data processing
department is located in a building separate from headquarters,
(para 3.05). A data processing master plan, which vould caver the next
five years, has recently been studied by consultant Coopers and Lybrand
(Abidjan) under financing of Credit 1189-BEN. The Nangbeto
Hydro-Electricity Project (Credit 1507-BEN) provides for supply of nev
equipment, while the MSP includes financing of a three-year technical
assistance program (Annex 3-3).
D. Operations
3.07      The vater supply facilities are operated i- a satisfactory
manner, although more attention should be paid to reduction of energy
consumption and surface vater treatment. Also the very aggressive vater
produced in Cotonou and Porto Novo has led to deterioration of old asbestos
cement pipes and concrete reservoirs which vould need, depending on the
case, to be either replaced or rehabilitated under the proposed project
(Annex 4-1). Apart from that, the existing facilities, including the
meters are in reasonably good condition and there is no need for any major
rehabilitation program. SBEE has retained the principle of general
metering of pover and vater consumption; there vere about 43,000
electricity subscribers and 18,000 iater subscribers at the end of 1984.
Billing ls done on a bi-monthly basis and computerized. Currently, SBEE
does not have a vater meter repairs workshop, which is understandable given



- 10 -
the small number of subscribers. SBEE has insurance against all normal
commercial riska such as third party liability, fire, other riaks to SBEE's
property and inventories and vehicle insurance. Full information is
available in the project files. As i often the case in combined
electricity/water authorities, the vater department is relatively under
skilled and needs reinforcement in the field of investment planning,
supervision and implementation of new projects (including the proposed
one), and rationalization of vater operations. Actions initiated under the
MSP vill be continued under the proposed project which provides for
extension of the technical assistance/training package (Annex 3-3).
E. Accounting, Budgeting and Planning, Audits
3.08      SBEE has a commercial double entry accountïng system based on
accrual accounting principles. It uses the OCAN chart of accounts which il
the official chart of accounts nation-vide in most French speaking West
African countries. Financial studies and audits carried out under the
Engineering Project (Cr.1171-BEN) have hiL,hlighted major shortcomings
regarding co&t accounting, fixed assets, stock, customers and suppliers
accounts. The proposed project would continue activities undertaken under
the MSP to strengthen the financial department (Annex 3-3).
3.09      Annual operating and capital eMpenditures budgets are prepared
for SBEE's overall operations and each of the regions. However,
medium-term financial planning does not yet exist on a regular basis.
Therefore, assurances vere obtained during negotiations that SBEE would
prepare each year, together vith its annual budget, financial projections
at least for the folloving three years (including income statements, funds
flow statements and balance sheets) and transm4t them, together vith the
annual operating and capital expenditure budgets, for review and comment to
IDA, not later than one month before the beginning of the fiscal year
concerned.
3.10      SBEE's financial statements for FY81 to FY83, as vell as
accounting, budgeting and internal control procedures have been audited by
Coopers and Lybrand (Abidjan); these audits have been financed by the
Engineering Credit 1171-BEN. Credit 1189-BEN (para 1.01) provides
financing of audits for 1984, 1985 and 1986; and in view of shortcomings
identified (para 3.08) financing of further audits for 1987, 1988 and 1989
are also included in the proposed project. Auditors' TORs vould request
that each annual audit report include a detailed analysis of systems and
procedures, progress achieved and recommendations for further actions.
Short-tern  technical assistance to implement auditor's recommendations is
also provided for in the proposed project (Anmex 3-3). During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that SBEE would submit audited
financial statements to IDA together vith the audit report, vlthin eight
months of the annual closing date. Other audits required would also cover
the Special Account set up by SBEE as vell as the Statements of
Expenditures (para. 4.14).

F. Staffing and Training
3.11      As of mid 1984, SBEE employed 1,645 staff including 48
professionals and 69 intermediate staff; about 33% of the staff vere
employed on a temporary basis. Total staff can be divided into one-third
each for pover operations, vater operations and combined activities;
overall there is one staff member for 3; customers (one for 26 in the vater
operations) which is rather lov vhen compared with other African public
utilities. Objectives for vater operations productivity would be set forth
in the "Enterprise Contract" mentioned in para 3.04. Additional data on
SBEE staff are given in Annex 3-1. The general manager and department head
positions are staffed with competent Beninese professionals; apart from the
training center (para 3.12) there are no expatriates. Hovever, the absence
of managerial training of intermediate and higher level staff has led
professionals to spend too much time on routine administration rather than
on management of the entity. Another problem SBEE has to face is a staff
renumeration policy which, based on that of the civil service, is not
attractive enough to keep veli-qualified employees in the organization.
Although a detailed reviev of the present salary structure vas carried out
by CGE during project preparation, this is a national issue that cannot be
addressed vithin the scope of the proposed project, but rather in th'.
context of the deepening overall dialogue between Government and IDA on
rehabilitation of the public enterprise sector.
3.12      About 250 vater technicians (i.e. almost half of SBEE's present
vater distribution staff) have already been trained during a 12-month
course in SBEE's training center located in Cotonou, founded in 1978 with
financing from the Federal Republic of Germany (GTZ); this financing, which
provides for equipment and three expatriate instructors, vill be finished
in 1987. Another training center operated by CEB, located near Cotonou,
gives an 18-montn course in electromechanics at the intermediate level.
Nine employees are also being trained at an intermediate level either in
the Federal Republic of Germany or in Mali. To address the training needs
at all levels, CGE has proposed, as part of the MSP, a training program
which would (a) continue activities of the SBEE training center and upgrade
part of these tovards intermediate level technical staff; (b) expand
knowledge of vater operation engineers (studies and new works, operation,
administration, water quality); and (c) improve skills of the finance
department's higher level staff. Further details on the training program
are given in Annex 3-3.
G. SBEE's Past Performance and Present Financial Situation
3.13      Financial statements for FY81 through 1984 appear in Annex 5-1.
The income statements during this period are summarized in the following
table.
3.14      These figures show that, in recent years, SBEE has been generally
in deficit. They also show the predominance of electricity in SBEE's



- 12 -
revenues; but since SBEE does not distinguish between the two activities in
its expenditures, it is not possible to identify vith certainty whether
both activities have been unprofitable, or hov far one subsidizes the
other. This deficiency would however be addressed by the MSP (Annex 3-3)
vhich would introduce a comprehensive costing system to permit separate
accounts for each service, as vell as a more precise and meaningful
allocation of budgetary responsibilities among departmental heads.

- 13 -
3.15       SBEE's bad financial performance is largely attributable to the
failure of tariffs to keep up vith escalating operating costs, particularly
in the following respects:
(a) About 90% of SBEE's electricity output in 1980-84 vas
purchased from CEB; the average price per kWh charged by CEB
trebled during that period (as compared to an increame in
SBEE's electricity tariffs of only somevhat more than tvice),
and has since increased still further; conversely, a sharp
fall in CEB supplies after December 1983, due to the effect
of the drought on hydro-electric resources (Annex 2-1),
forced SBEE to switch to even more expensive thermal
generation to meet the supply shortage 1/; and
(b) Covernuent policy requires SBEE actively to extend its
supplies to the smaller townships, where provision of
service is unremunerative (para 2.05); this development
increasingly burdens the degree of cross-subsidization the
more profitable Cotonou and Porto Novo systams have to
carry.
These tendencies have been alleviated ta some extent by the 1984 tariff
increases of 18% for vater from CFAF 85/ms (US$0.24/m3) to CFAF 100/m3
(US$0.28/ms), and of 83Z for electricity. from CFAF 30/kWh (US$0.08/kWh) to
CEAF 55/kWh (US$0.15/kWh). Hovever, projections suggest that the vater
tariff, at least, is still far below the level needed 2/. A vater tariff
study has been completed under the Engineering Credit 1171-BEN (para 5.01);
an electricity tariff study is also scheduled under financing of the
Engineering Credit 1189-BEN.
3.16       SBEE's underlying lack of profitability is also compounded by the
Beninese fiscal code; net income before taxes is subject to a 48Z corporate
income tax, but in case of net losses a 10% tax is levied on an assumed
profit equal to 10Z of turnover. In addition to that, SBEE has to pay
dividends in the amount of 70Z of its net income after taxes to the
National Budget and the National Investment Fund (FNI); this practice is
not compatible vith sound self-financing objectives and the issue would be
addressed vithin the broader scope of the PESR project.
I/   Generation by SBEE's own thermal stations rose from 11Z of total
production in 1983 to 38% in 1984.
2/   As an indication, average water tariffs in comparable neighboring
countries of the franc zone vere approximately as follows in 1984
(in CFAF/m9): Niger:135; Togo:150; Senegal:180; Cameroun:205;
Ivory Coast:315.

The table shows how SBEE's equity has gradually been eroded, and also how
its balance sheet is increasingly swollen by the large accumulations of
unpaid bills owed both to SBEE and, as a consequence, by SBEE. The
lncrease in fixed assets in 1984 reflects the revaluation which have been
brought into account that year (para 3.24).
1. Accounts Receivable and Payable
3.18      As of end 1985, the customers receivable and major accoumts
payable have been estiuated by Government and SBEE and confirmed by

Pcxoer Supplier (CEB)               2,195               6.10
Total customers receivable at Deceuber 31, 1985 amounted to about
CFAP 7,700 million (US$21.4 million) representing eight to nine months of
billing (electricity and vater consumption as vell as vorks invoiced).
Those most difficult to collect are oved by the Central Covernment, the
mmicipalities, and the public enterprises and total CFAF 6,425 million
(US$17.85 million). In order to alleviate cash shortage, SBEE bas been
retaining the funds it oves Govermaent, mainly taxes and loan repayments,
amounting to CFAF 4,110 million (US$11.4 million) and its pover supplier
CEB amoutting to CFAE 2,195 million (US$6.1 million).  As of end 1985, the
net balance due to SBEE by the public and parapublic sector vas CFAF 2,315
million (US$6.45 million). and arrears from private customers vere
considered to be still at an acceptable level of about two to three months
of billing.
3.19      The issue of settlement of mutual debt is national and does not
apply to public utilities only. At this point, it appears almost
impossible to dissociate the issue of arrears owed by the Central
Govermuent agencies, municipalities and parastatals from the issue of
SBEE's own current liabilities. Therefore, before negotiations, the
Goveriment was asked to offset the amount owed by SBEE (various taxes and
loan repayment) against public sector arrears (including parastatals) In
the same amount. Uith regard to the net arrears of CFAF 2,317 million
(US$6.45 million) oved to SBEE, Goverument and SBEE vould enter into an
agreement reflected in the "Enterprise Contract" (para 3.04) which would
provide for:



- 16 -
(a)    a reimbursement schedule of at least CFAF 1,250 million
(US$3.5 million) over a period ending on December 31,
1992. Payments vould mainly be effected by allowing SBEE
to retain interest due to Government on the portion of
project funds being onlent to offset part of the
outstanding arrears (para 4.07); and
<b)    a contribution to SBEE's working capital in an amount of
CFAF 1,067 million (US$2.95 million) to replenish the
stock of spare parts. Correspouding funds from the IDA
Credit would be passed on to SBEE as a subsidy
(para 4.07).
On the other hand, SBEE's arrears to CEB have fallen below four months of
billing since December 1985 3/.
3.20      Furthermore, and since the approved 1986 National Budget only
provides a bulk amount of CFAF 225 million (US$0.6 million) for
electricity, vater and telecommunication, while electricity and vater
consumption alone vould amount to about CFAF 900 million (US$2.5 million),
Goverament and SBEE have agreed, before negotiations, on an additional
offsetting arrangement for 1986 only. SBEE vould effectively pay from tine
to time the taxes it oves the Government after deduction of the amount owed
by the Central Government agencies, municipalities and public services for
electricity and vater consumption. Forecasts show that for the first time
in 1986, SBEE would ove more to the Government t"ian the public sector vculd
ove SBEE (about CFAF 250 million i.e. US$0.7 milli-.n).
3.21      Regarding future Central Government, municipalities and public
services consumption, assurances during negortations vere obtained that:
(a) before the proposed Credit becomos effective, the electricity and
vater subscriptions presently classified as "Central Governuent",
but which in fact correspond to domestic consumption (mainly
Government housing), vould be transferred to the name of their
effective beneficiaries and the corresponding invoices paid for
by the latter; and
3/   Current bills are being met, except in respect of the biggest
consumer, a cement factory; by agreement vith CEB, SBEE needs only
remit that portion of its dues, as and uhen the factory pays SBEE. As
of end 1985, SBEE owed CEB about CFAF 2,200 million (US$6.1 million)
of which abolt CFAF 1,240 (US$3.4 million) vere related to the cement
factory.



- ;7 -
(b)  beginning in 1987, the National Budget and the budgets for
municipalities and public services (to be approved by their
respective supervising ministries) vould provide for each
ministry, municipality or public service, specific amounts for
electricity and vater consumption determined in consultation vith
SBEE and acceptable to IDA.
3.22      Concerning parastatals. the "Enterprise Contract" (para 3.04)
further specifies tbat current electricity and vater consumptions vill be
paid vithin four months of billing and reiterate SBEE's legal right to cut
off bad debtors. During negotia_.ions, assurances vere obtained that SBEE
vould reduce private and parastatal receivables to below four months of
billing, by December 31, 1987, by strengthening its billing and collection
procedures, including disconnection campaigns.
J. Loan Debt
3.23      Debt service for vater supply alone (as distinct from vater and
electricity combined) vas not recorded in SBEE's account until 1984. At
the end of 1985, outstanding water supply loans accounted for
CFAF 1,415 million (US$3.9 million) out of a total of CFAP 5,935 million
(US$16.5 million) including debt which vas not earlier incorporated in
SBEE's accounts.
K. Fixed Assets
3.24      SBEE's fixed assets vere inventoried by consultants Cabinet Roux
(Abidjan), and revalued on the basis of *.beir existing condition, as of
December 31, 1983. Total net value on this basis has been estimated at
some CFAF 22,150 million (US$61.5 million), compared vith book values of
CFAF 17,100 million (US$47.5 million) gross, or CFAF 10,000 million
(US$27.8 million) net of accumulated depreciation. During negotiations,
assurances vere obtained that the assets vill again be revalued in 1986 and
thereafter at least every three years, on a basis to be agreed with IDA.
SBEE has hitherto applied unusually high depreciation rates for both
electricity and vater assets (probably 1nherited from the original
electricity and vater authority, SDE a "concession" enterprise) averaging
6% - 7% annually. SBEE is presently discussing vlth Cabinet Roux and its
auditors vays of introducing depreciation rates more in line with the
Beninese fiscal code and the general practi-e i-a the public utilities which
vould lead to an average of about 4.2% (Annex ,-4).
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project ObJectives
4.01      The main objective of the proposed project would be to improve
the financial viability of the Urban Water Supply (UWS) sector so as to
allov also for further expansion in small secondary centers by:



- 18 -
(a)    implementing low cost reinforcements of the vater supply
systeus in Cotonou and Porto Novo;
(b)    pro oting domestic connections to increase accesa of the
urban population to the piped network and expand SBEE's
revenue basis;
(c)    setting vater tariffs to reflect long-term marginal costs;
(d)    strengthening SBEE's management capability; and
(e)   implementing sound budgetary and commercial practices
vhich vould inter alia avoid accumulation of unpaid bills.
B. Project Components
4.02      The project vould include the folloving components (see Annez 4-1
for detailed description):
(a)    expansion of vater supply facilities in Cotonou and Porto
Novo including: (i) drilling of 10 nev boreholes;
(ii) extension of tvo existing neutralization plants and
construction of a nev one; (iii) construction of three
storage service reservoirs and rehabilitation of three
existing reservoirs; (iv) supply and laying of 23 km of
feeders and 275 km of distribution pipes; and
(y) installation of about 11,500 small domestic
connections;
(b)    enhancement of SBEE's management capability through
(i) training of intermediate and higher level staff;
(iI) consultancy in the fields of organization,
accounting, and data processing; (iii) technical
assistance to the vater, finance, data processing and
training departments; and (iv) expansion of office space;
and
(c)    replenishment of SBEE's vorking capital including supply
of spare parts.
Technically, the proposed project is of standard nature. Underground vater
resources have been fully investigated and are sufficient to meet the
demand both in Cotonou and Porto Novo beyond the year 2000. Hovever, the
vater produced is aggressive (para. 3.07) and would require simple
treatment (neutralization) consisting in aeration and injection of lime
vater.

C. Prolect Cost
4.03      The estimated cost of the project, excluding taxes and duties,
and the financing requirements, are suaumarized belov.  More detailed
information is shown in Annex 4-2. Total project cost is estiasted to be
CFAF 10,990 (US$30.5 million) vith a foreign exchange component of
CFAF 7,905 (US$22.0 million) representing 72% of the total cost. Total
financing requirements including interest during construction are
CFAF 11,880 million (US$33.0 million) with a foreign exchange component of
CFAF 8,515 million (US$23.65 million), also representing 72% of total.

deemed feasible taking into account recent experience vith SBEE and the
expected degree of readiness of the proposed project at the time of Credit
Effectiveness (all the major contracts should be avarded at that time).
D. Project Financing and Lending Arrangements
4.06      An IDA Credit of US$10.0 million is proposed. Caisse Centrale de
Coopération Economique (CCCE) of France has indicated its villingness to
cofinance (parallel financing) the proposed project vith a total &Mount of
FF 60.0 to FF 80.0 million (US$8.3 to US$11.1 million), and vould indicate
the exact amount of its filnancing during summer 1986. The OPEC Fund (OPEC)
and the Islamic Development Bank have also indicated that they could
participate in amounts of about US$2.8 million and US$4.0 to 8.0 million
respectively. They should indicate the exact amounts of their financlng
during sumner 1986. Finally, SBEE vould participate in the amount of CFAF
2,080 million (US$5.8 million).  The tentative financing plan is Suarized
below and detailed further in Annex 4-3.

4.07      The Government of Benin would be the borrover of the IDA
Credit. US$2.9 million of the IDA Credit would be passed on as a
contribution by the Government to SBEE's working capital. US$7.1 million
of the IDA Credit would be onlent to SBEE for 20 years. including 5 years
of grace, and an interest rate of 8.5% per annum. The signing of the
subsidiary loan agreement between Government and SBEE would be a
condition of effectivenesa of the proposed Credit. The Government vould
assume the risks related to exchange rates variations, in particular
since the repayment periods of the Credit, on the one hand, and the
onlent resources, on the other, are very different. The CCCE loan, for
which SBEE would be the borrover, and which would be guaranteed by the
Government, vould be repayable over 16 years, including 4 years of grace,
and with an interest rate of 5.0% per annum and a commitment fee of 0.5Z
per annum. The Government of Benin would be the borrover of the IDB and
OPEC Fund financings for which the conditions, still to be firmed up,
would be approximately repayment periods of 25 years, including 5 years
of grace and with interest rates of 1% and 3% per annum respectively and
commitment fees of  .5% per annum.  Both the IDB and OPEC Fund have been
encouraged by IDA to ask Governuent to onlend the entirety of their
credits to SBEE on terns similar to those of IDA; interest 80 produced
would help pay off arrears owed to SBEE by the public and parapublic
sector (para 3.19). Effectiveness of the CCCE, IDB and OPEC Fund
financings vould be a condition for effectiveness of the proposed IDA
Credit. SBEE's contribution to the proposed project financing
(CFAF 2,080 million - US$5.8 million) would be compatible with the
healthy liquidity status forecast for the next years (para. 5.12).
E. Project Preparation and Implementation
4.08      SBEE, assisted by engineering consultants, will be responsible
for implementation of the UWS component and the Management Support
Program (MSP). SBEE's execution capacity will be strengthened through
the KSP (Annex 3-3).
4.09      Detailed designs and tender documents for the UWS component are
under preparation by consultants GIGG 4/ who prepared the feasibility
studies; the studies are financed by the Engineering Credit 1171-BEN, and
are expected to be ready during summer 1986. The implementation schedule
given in Annex 4-4 indicates that construction would start by late 1987
and extend through end 1992 with possible extension until mid 1993 (para
4.05). The starting date has been voluntarily set on the conservative
side.
4/   The urban/water supply/drainage/sanitation master plans and
feasibility studies for Cotonou and the water supply feasibility
studies for Porto Novo, financed under the Engineering Credit 1171-BEN
have been executed by a joint venture of German consultants IGIP
(water supply), GKW (drainage, sanitation) and GRAS (urban planning)
known as Groupement IC-IP/GKW/GRAS (GIGG). They all are experienced
consulting engineers and have so far performed satisfactorily.

4.11      A breakdown of the proposed project into major contracts and by
financing sources is given in Annex 4-3. All contracts financed by IDA
over US$0.25 million for civil vorks and US$0.10 million for equipment
vould be awarded through ICB in accordance vith Bank group guidelines;
for these contracte, prior review of bidding documents by Bank staff
would be required. Local civil vorks contractors vould be given F. 7.5%
preference margin and goode manufactured locally would also be given a
preference of 15% of the CIF bid price or the applicable customs duty and
import taxes. whichever in less. Contracta under the above-mentioned
thresholde would be awarded through either LIB or LCB. Local procurement
procedures have recently been reviewed by Bank staff and have altogether
been found satisfactory. Spare parts could also be provided either by
international shopping, with quotations from at least three suppliera, or
in the case of proprietary parts, by direct purchase from one
manufacturer or supplier in accordance vith Bank group guidelines; during
negotiations assurances vere obtained that SBEE would prepare an annual
budget of spare parts to be purchased, with indication of procurement
methods and submit it to IDA for review not later than one month before
the beginning of each fiscal year. Contracta financed by CCCE, IDB and
the OPEC Fund would be awarded in accordance vith their ovn procedures.
The laying of tertiary distribution network and the construction of

service connections, financed by SBEE, vould be carried out by SBEE' s own
work force. All engineering and technical assistance contracts vould be
avarded in accordance vith Bank group guidelines for the use of
consultants.

4.13       The estimated schedule of disbursement given in Annex 4-5 is
based on the implementation schedule given in Annex 4-4 and deemed to be
reasonable (para 4.05). The closing date of the Credit would be
December 31, 1993.
4.14       Disbursements would be fully documented except for contracts
below US$20,000 equivalent which would be disbursed against Statements of
Expenditures. The supporting documentation would be held by SBEE and
made available to IDA supervision missions; it vould also be reviewed in
the course of the audit of accounts (para. 3.10). In order to facilitate
disbursements, a revolving fund of US$500,000 5/ would be established in
a Special Account to be opened at a commercial bank and vould be used for
all categories of expenditures. The Special Account vould be replenished
by IDA on a monthly basis or when it would be reduced by one-third,
whichever comes first.
5/   This amount represents about four months of expenditure.

H. Monitoring Indicators
4.15      During negotiations, SBEE has agreed to periodically report to
IDA on its operating and financial performance, using the monitoring
indicators shown in Annex 4-6.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Tariffs
5.01      The vater tariff study, commissioned under the Engineering
Credit 1171-BEN (para 3.15), considered not only the level of rates, but
also the tariff structure; the present structure is defective in that the
sane rate is charged for all levels of consumption, however large, thus
doing little to discourage waste of vater by the more affluent consumers.
Accordingly, the consultants GIGG executing the study vere asked to
propose a progressive three-tier tariff, vith (a) the lowest or "social"
rate covering consumption equivalent to basic sanitary needs (10 m'/month
per connection); (b) an intermediate rate calculated to bring the average
tariff to the level required to meet SBEE's overall revenue requirements
for vater supply; and (c) a high rate for consumption over 25 ms/month,
based on the long-run marginal cost of vater. The study recommends an
i- ediate increase in the average tariff, from CFAF 100/m9 to CFAF 168/ms
(US$ 0.28/ms to US$0.47/ms); the "social" rate vould be kept at
CFAF 100/m' (US$0.28/ms), to remain affordable by the poorest consumers;
the intermediate rate vould be fixed at CFAF 170/m' (US$o.47/m3), and the
highest rate at CFAF 215/m' (US$0.60/ms). A general surcharge of
CFAF 5/m3 (US$0.01/ms) is included in the above tariffs to partially
subsidize the suall domestic connections (para 2.10). Further increases
vould be needed in subsequent years.
5.02      Independent projections made by Bank staff for the purpose of
the proposed project suggest however that the long-term marginal cost of
vater is about CFAF 234/ms (US$0.65/m') (para 6.09) and that while an
average rate of CFAF 168/m' (US$0.47/m') would produce a positive return
on net fixed assets ueed for vater supply, that return vould be limited
to about 2Z - 32 (after alloving for income tax), despite the substantial
increase (para 5.07).
5.03      Hovever, there are limits to the degree of increase which can
be applied to tariffs all at once.  Accordingly, it vas a condition of
negotiations that the first two rates of CFAF 100/mn  and CFAF 170/m9 have
been introduced on the lines recommended by the tariff study. During
negotiations, assurances vere further obtained that the third rate of
CFAF 215/m9 6/ vould be effective by June 30, 1987.
6/   This figure is expressed as of end 1985 economic conditions.  It
should be revised in accordance with the revision formula on the date
this third tranche becomes effective (para 5.04).



- 25 -
5.04      In order to meet the rate of return targets (para 5.05), it is
important not to let the vater tariff again fall out of step vith sector
needs, with the risk that vater supply is subsidized from electricity
revenues which would be contrary to the Nangbeto Project Credit
Agreement; therefore, assurances vere also obtained during negotiations
that the water tariff vould be revised annually on the basis of a cost
index formula acceptable to IDA, and every three years in the light of
SBEE's medium-term cash floy needs.  These tariff revision procedures are
specified in SBEE's new General Regulations for Urban Water Supply
(para 3.01). For projection purposes, the annual increase has bean
assumed at the local annual inflacion rates for both electricity and
water tariffs.  Tariffs taken into consideration are shown in the table
of para 5.07 (average revenues/m5 and /kWh).
B. Financial Rate of Return
5.05      Under the Nangbeto Hydro-Electric Project, the Government
undertook to set tariffs ta produce a rate of return, to be agreed in
consultation with IDA, as from 1988; during 1985-1987, tariffs are to be
set to generate a cash contribution to investment (on a three-year moving
average) of at least 45% annually. In the latter type of covenant, the
amount of net cash generation is directly affected by changes in working
capital and investment requirements, including accounts receivable; where
these are substantial, or where they fluctuate considerably, the entity
concerned cannot help distortions arising in its cash generation from
year to year. In SBEE's case, the speed vith which the large unpaid
arrears, in both direction may be reduced over the next couple of years
is difficult to forecast exactly, so that cash generation for 1985-1987
is somewhat conjectural (paras 3.18 to 3.22). Attainment of any given
percentage may depend on extraneous factors, including any infusion of
working capital under the proposed project (para 3.19). Therefore, for
the proposed project it is intended to pursue rates of return covenants,
on currently valued net fixed assets in operation, as follows:
(a)    for 1988, 1989 and 1990: a positive rate of return for
SBEE's overall operations; and
(b)    from 1991 onvards: a rate of return of at least 2.5% for
the water operations alone, and a rate of return of at
least 4.5% for the overall operations.



- 26 -
This type of covenant should nov be feasible, since (i) fixed assets have
been revalued and would be regularly updated on a basis to be agreed vith
IDA (para 3.24); and (ii) separate accounts for electricity and vater
operations vould be established (para 3.08). During negotiations,
assurances vere also obtained that SBEE vould review vithin the scope of
the preparation of the annual budgets and financial projections
(para 3.09) whether the rate of return objectives vould be met for the
ongoing year, and the folloving three years and propose all necessary
measures (including adjustment of tariffs) in order to meet these
objectives.
C. Future Financial Performance
5.06      On the tariff assumptions outlined in para 5.04. SBEE should be
able to emerge progressively from its financial difficulties, assisted by
the steps proposed above to help clear some of the unpaid bills from both
sides of its balance sheet, and gradually achieve a satisfactory return
on the capital invested in the company's systems (para 5.05). Such a
return vill become increasingly necessary to meet the groving burden of
debt service (para 5.09).
5.07      Annexes 5-1 to 5-3 set out SBEE's projected financial
statements 1985-1994. As already indicated, estinates vere also built
up, relating to SBEE's vater supply activities alone, and charges common
to both services being apportioned on an approximate basis. Assumptions
used for projections are described in Annex 5-4. The following table
suninarizes SBEE's forecast income statements for alternate years, vith
comparative actual figures for 1984 (para 3.14).
5.08      The first increase in the vater tariff (from a single rate of
CFAF 100/ms to two rates of CFAF 100/ms and CFAF 170/m8) has been
in effect since March 1, 1986, and the second one (addition of the third
rate of CFAF 215/m9) is assumed to take effect July 1, 1987; thereafter
both electricity and vater tariffs are assumed to develop as foreseen
in para 5.04.  On this basis, projections indicate that these tariffs vould
suffice to cover operating expenses and other recurrent charges, including
debt service and produce acceptable overall rates of return (2.4% in 1989
and 6.9% in 1991); on the approximate apportionment of accounts between
electricity and vater, the rate of return for vater operations only
vould evolve between 0.7% in 1989 and 2.6% in 1991.

5.10      Revaluation of f ixed assets have been brought into account in
1984 (para 3'.17). Thereafter, capital expenditure is assumed to be
incorporated in the balance sheet at its actual cost, no further
revaluation being incorporated until 1987 (in respect of 1986) on a basis
still to be discussed. The inflated balances of accounts payable and
receivable are assumed to reduce sharply, under the proposed set-off
arrangement, and then to taper off slowly, to a more reasonable level.
5.11      SBEE's debt/equity ratio would be satisfactory as vould also the
debt service coverage. The Credit Agreement for the Nangbeto Project
contains a debt limitation covenant, whereby no new debt vould be incurred
without consulting IDA unless future internal cash generation is at least
1.5 times future debt service, including that on the proposed borroeing;
During negotiations, it was agreed to repeat this condition for the
proposed Credit.

Annex 5-2. Summarized in the form of a Financing Plan, the folloving table
shows the project expenditures, together vith other outgolngs, and the
sources from which these are expected to be financed. It shows that SBEE
would be in a healthy liquidity statue especially in the latter years of
the project even though only marginally meeting the rate of rcturn targets.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND BENEFITS
A. ProJect Benefits
6.01       The primary benefits of the proposed project would be improved
vater supply for Cotonou and Porto Novo. Construction of additional
facilities vould allow SBEE to meet demands through 1994, and rehabilitation
and expansion of the neutralization plants vould improve vater quality and
reduce pipe corrosion. Siuultaneously, SBEE vould benefit from concerted
Institution building efforts by variols donors, to ensure financial
viability and develop management capabilities. The proposed Management
Support Program (lSP) vould enhance SBEE's operational resources and allow
for a manpower redeployment.  While these benefits vould not be easily
quantified, a measure of their catalytic effects would be the increased
efficiency of SBEE's operations documented through the decrease in accounts
receivable (paras 3.18 to 3.22) and the increase in staff productivity
(para 3.11).
6.02       The nature of urban development in the two cities is such that no
clearly demarcated poverty areas can be identified. Thus, all construction
related to the proposed project vould benefit directly or indirectly the
poverty population.
B. Least-Cost Solutions
6.03       The proposed project would expand the existing systems by taking
into account the optimnm phasing of invez;tment and the availability of
financial resources. Nobilization of groundwater resources through
drilling of additional boreholes vould be staged. Annual expansion of
secondary and tertiary networks would correspond more closely to the pace
of increased demand, improving the utilization rate of the existing
facilities. Costly investuents in elevated storage tanks would be
minimized.
C. Domestic Connections aud Public Standpipes Policy
6.04       One of the main goals of the proposed project would be to promote
domestic connections and make them more affordable in order to improve the
sanitary conditions through water distribution and enlarge SBEE's revenue base
by increasing vater sales. The introduction througb the project of
the policy of providing smll domestic consumera vith low cost connections
subsidized through the water tariff would help in achieving this goal
(para 2.11). The new customer would only have to pay an advance of about
CFAE 12,000 7/ 'US$33) representing about twelve months of vater
consumpticn, (in order to protect SBEE against possible unpaid bills) which
7/   In 1985 terms, this amount would be annually revised in parallel
vith the vater tariff.



- 31 -
can be compared with the present cost of a domestic connection of at least
CFAF 60,000 (US$167). Bovever, even vith this new policy, which vould
provide an additional 227,000 people with domestic connections by 1994,
the connection ratio is expected to increase from the present 21% and 25%
in Cotonou and Porto Novo to not more than 28% and 29Z by 1994
respectively.
6.05      Very fev people (2Z of Cotonou population, 7Z in Porto Novo) are
presently served by standpipes. which are regarded by SBEE as the nWin
source of arrears owed by municipalities. No additional standpipes vould
be provided by the proposed project and privatization of the existing
standpipes is currently being considered by SBEE (para 2.11).
6.06      Out of the population in Cotonou and in Porto Novo 48% aLd 31%
respectively rely on the informal system of private "neighborhood" vendors
for their drinking water needs. Provided that the present level of
competition, resulting in reasonable prices 8/, vould remain in the
future, this kind of supply would continue ta be of essential importance to
assure vide coverage of the urban population. It is expected that the
percentage of population served by neighbors would rise to respectively 57%
and 33% in Cotonou and Porto Novo by 1994, thus an additional 413,000
people, because of secondary distribution network extensions provided by
the proposed project (para 6.12).
D. Affordability
6.07      The new tariff structure (para 5.01) would provide a social
tranche of CFAF 100/.s (US$.28/1s) for the first lOm9 per month to apply to
all consumers, this social tariff is expected to remain constant in real
terms in the future.  Assuming a family size of five (average size of the
poor households, slightly below the size of the average urban family) vith
a monthly income of CFAF 25,625 (US$7'.2) 9/ connected to the piped network
8/   In the range of CFAF 250 - 500/m3 i.e. US$0.69 - 1.39/ms,
corresponding to coins of CFAF 5 or CFAF 10 per bucket of 18 to
20 liters, with an average value estimated at CFAF 350/ms i.e.
US$0.97/ms.
9/   The urban poverty level has been estimated as follows:
-  per capita &NP in 1984          - CFAF 123,000
-  urban poverty level             - 50% of the per capita GNP
-  monthly revenue of a family
at the urban poverty level
123,000 x 5 x 0.50/12           - CFAF 25,625



- 32 -
and consuuing 50 lcd, this social block would resault in a monthly
expenditure of CFAF 750 (US$2.08) or 2.9z of household revenues. In the
case of a compound connection (2 households, 12 persons, 40 lcd.), monthly
charges per household would amount to CFAF 875 (US$2.43) or 3.4% of the
income at poverty level.
6.08      In the most widespread case of a family of five supplied by
neighborhood vendors to satisfy their drinking vater needs of 15 lcd.,
monthly expenditures are not expected to exceed CFAF 788 (US$2.19) or 3.1%
of monthly income at the poverty level. Thus affordability is not expected
to become an issue at the proposed tariff levels (Annex 6-1).
E. Marginal Cost and Rate of Return
6.09      The estimated long-term marginal costs (LTMC), as expressed by
the average incremental cost (AIC) for the proposed project components,
have been calculated at CFAF 130/ms (US$0.36/m9) for Cotonou, CFAF 290/ms
(US$0.81/u') for Porto Novo, and CFAF 140/m' (US$0.39/m') for the two
cities combined. Calculations for the 17 existing secondary systems and
for the 25 new secondary centers taken over by SBEE provide AIC of
CFAF 265/ms (US$0.74/mJ) and of CFAF 640/ms (US$1.78/m') respectively.
Once SBEE's entire investment prograi related to vater operations is taken
into account, AIC stands at CFAF 234/ms (US$0.65/m9), thus revealing a high
sensitivity to the expansion of SBEE's vater operations in the smaller
urban centers (Annex 6-2).
6.10      In real terms, the average tariffs are expected to rise from
CFAF 100/rn3 (US$0.28lm9) in 1985 to CFAF 168/ms (US$0.47/ms) in 1986.  In
addition, the introduction of a three-tier tariff system would assure that
the tariff charged towards the upper block (more than 25m9 per month)
compares with sector-vide AIC.
6.11      The economic rate of return (ERR) has been calculated using
agreed water tariffs as a proxy for benefits. On that basis, the project's
ERR is slightly above 15%, while the same calculations carried out for
SBEE's vater operations as a vhole yield a still acceptable 5.7%
(Annex 6-2). Hovever, these figures do not reflect full benefits as
consumers' surplus and positive externalities, (such as improved sanitary
conditions and health), are not captured. The actual villingness to pay,
expressed by those consumers served by neighborhood vendors (in the range
of CFAF 250-500/ms - US$0.69 - 1.39/m3 - varying with the capacity and the
number of buckets) gives an indication as to the real value of incremental
supplies.
F. Population Benefitted, Urban Poverty Group
6.12      By 1994 an additional 227,000 people (195,000 in Cotonou and
32,000 in Porto Novo) would be provided with domestic connections, and an



- 33 -
additional 413,000 people (of vhich 389,000 vould be in Cotonou) would then
be served through neighborhood vendors. Population supplied by standpipes
is not expected to increase significantly.  Out of the urban population in
Cotonou and Porto Novo slightly more than 40Z would fall belov the urban
poverty threshold of CFAF 25,625 (US$71.2). It is estimated that by 1994
this group vould account for about 27% of total domestic consumption,
mainly through neighborhood vendors. About US$5.9 million, or 25Z of the
UWS component (physical vorks only), are poverty lending exclusively
benefitting the poor.
G.  Government Cash Flow Situation
6.13      The Government would benefit from an improved cash flov situation
through onlending of the IDA Credit and possibly from the IDB and OPEC Fund
Credits to SBEE (para 4.07), and payment of corporate taxes and dividends
by SBEE (para. 3.16). The folloving table gives an estimate of the
Government cash flov situation resulting from SBEE's water operations; SBEE
vould repay a total of about CFAP 7,000 million (US$19.4 million) over the
period 1987-1994.
H. Project Risks
6.14      Construction financed by the project is of standard nature and
groundwater resources have been fully identified (para 4.02). Hence,
construction risks are not significant. Cost overruns are not likely as
price contingencies have been calculated along an implementation schedule
which takes into account experience recently gained by SBEE and which is
slightly shorter than the regional diabursement profile.
6.15      It is very unlikely that the sewerage conditions in Cotonou and
Porto Novo are vorsened by the additional supplies of vater: the per capita
quantities distributed are not expected to increase significantly (para
2.14), the population densities are forecast to remain at the present level
and therefore the density of sevage disposals would remain comparable to
the present one. Promotion of VIP latrines (para 2.07) and reorganization
of the municipal services through the Urban Management project (paras 2.03
and 2.07) would further increase sanitary benefits of the proposed project.

6.16      Tarif f adjustments are very important as they vould permit sound
overall sector development. Furthermore, financial viability of SBEE could
be jeopardized by uncontrolled expansion of vater operations in the
secondary urban centers. However, the measures implemented under the
proposed project such as (a) technical assistance and additional training
for strengthening SBEE's planning and managerial capabilities; (b) develop-
ment of cost accounting providing separate financial Information for
electricity and vater operations; and (c) Bank's monitoring of key
performance indicators for SBEE would help to minimize the project risks.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Country Background
1.        Benin, situated on the Atlantic coast of Western Africa in the
equatorial zone, covers an area of 112,600 km2 and stretches for about
700 km in a north/south direction. It is bordered by Burkina Faso and
Niger in the north, Togo in the west and Nigeria in the east; the seaboard
is about 150 km from east to west.  The country has a fairly flat
topography with only two high altitude zones vith heights varying from
400 m to 800 m in the northwestern province of Atacora, and about 400 km
north of the coastline. The latter constitutes the central divide of the
catchment areas of the Niger and Ouémé, two of the main rivers of Benin;
north and south of the divide, stretch the central plains. In the very
south lie the lowlands easily flooded by the numerous interconnecting
lakes, rivers sad lagoons. There are three very distinct climatic zones:
semi-equatorial in the south, tropical in the central region, and sahelian
in the north.  Annual rainfalls vary from 800 mm in the extreme north to
1,300 mm in the southeast.
2.        The country is divided into six provinces, namely: Mono,
Atlantique, Ouémé, Zou, Borgau and Atacora which are sub-divided $nto
85 districts (representing 77 administrative centers only) (see attached
map IBRD 19102). Each district is also divided into communes snd further
divided into villages or quartiers. Benin's capital city is still Porto
Novo, but most of the administrative and commercial activities are located
in Cotonou, the largest urban center.
3.        The country's economy is based mostly on traditional farming.
Agriculture contributed about 45% of the GDP in 1982 and provided about 36Z
of the foreign exchange earnings. The industrial sector consists mainly of
a few imports substitution and agricultural processing plants. Known
mineral resources are limited, although recently phased exploitation of the
small Sémé offshore oil field has begun. The recently built sugar and
cement plants face problems of production costs, pricing and market
uncertainties. Although gold and phosphate prospecting has been pursued,
to date there is no indication of commercially exploitable deposits. Thus,
ln the absence of major mineral resource endownments and vith a limited
industrial base, agriculture is expected to remain the mainstay of the
economy in the foreseeable future.

4.        The latest census held ln March 1979 estimated a total population
of 3.4 million people. Although the available statistical data do not
allow to identify accurately the chare of true urban population, it can be
surmised that in 1979 about 35% of the total population (1.2 million out of
3.4 million) vas living in settlements of 10,000 or more inhabitants; and
about half of it vas concentrated ïn the four largest cities: Cotonou
(330,000), Porto Novo (130,000), Parakou (60,000) and Ab--mey (50,000).
While the average growth rate of the total population ls forecasted to be
about 3.0% until year 2000, the current "urban" grovth rates are likely to
persist in the near future (4.8% for Benin as a whole, 8.0Z for Cotonou);
as a result, the share of population living in larger settlements of over
10,000 is likely to soar to about 45% in 1990 (2.0 million out of
4.7 million) and to exceed 50% in the year 2000 (3.2 million out of 6.3
million). Annex 2-3 gives the list and population of the administrative
centers.
B. Sector Background
5.        Surface vater sources come from three major rivers namely: the
Oumé- w$th its two important tributaries, the Zou and the Okpara in the
southeast, the Niger in the north and the Mono in the western part of the
country; all of them except the Niger, flow south into a series of
interconnecting lakes and lagoons connected with the Atlantic Ocean. Apart
from these main rivers, surface vater sources have variable flows and often
carry no vater during the dry season. Groundwater constitutes the major
source of drinking vater and is available almost throughout the country.
Loi rainfalls which occurred in 1983 in the West African coastal region
have mainly affected surface vater storage and in turn, generation of
hydro-electricity, rural vater supplies and the agriculture; no major
shortage of vater has been reported in the urban vater supply sector.
Emergency programs for both the electricity and the rural water supply
sectors have been implemented vith external assistance.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE RURAL WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
1.        Direction de l'Hydraulique (DR).  DR comprises five divisions -
hydrogeology, hydrology. construction of vater points, documentation, and
administration/finances. As of end 1984, total regular staff vas about 90
including six engineers and six technicisns only; one-third of the staff is
located in the four provincial directorates. In addition, DE employs about
75 temporary agents attacbed to ongoing RWS projects or provincial
directorates. Technical assistance, financed by UNDP, is presently limited
to one hydrogeologist and is focused on the preparation of a national
program for RWS. Although it is equipped with a small drilling rig, DR
carries out feu vorks under force account, ill ongoing RUS projects being
implemented by private contractors under DE supervision assisted by vell-
qualified consultants. Overall, DE means are rather liaited especially in
the provinces.
2.   -    Other Agencies.  In the RWS sector, two other agencies, which are
active, must also be mentioned:
(a)  the CARDER (Centres d'Action Régionale pour le Développement
Rural), part of the Ministry of Rural Development, and located in
each province, vhich are in charge of promotion of social and
sanitary actions and of technical assistance and professional
training of the villagers.  They play an active role in
sensitization of the population during implementation of RWS
projects; and
(b) the Kinistry of Public Realth and especially the Direction du
Génie Sanitaire et de l'Assainissement (DGSA) which is involved
in the protection of vater Points and construction of latrines.
DGSA vill be the executing agency for a UNDP/GTZ project,
implemented by the World Bank, aiming at promoting adapted
sanitation technologies in Cotonou and in the Zou prevince.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
SECOND VATER SUPPLY PROJECT
EXISTING WATER SUPPLY SITUATION IN COTONOU AND PORTO NOVO
A. Existing Water Supply Systems
1.        The Cotonou potable uater system, mainly developed in the early
seventies under a European Development Fund (EDF) financing, is presently
supplied by nine boreholes, with a total capacity of about 20,000 m3/d;
under the ongoing Engineering Credit 1171-BEN four additional boreholes
have recently been drilled; they should increase the production capacity to
cbout 28,000 ms/d. Simple treatuent (neutralization and chlorination) i8
undertaken before distribution. As of end 1984, the distribution network
consiats of a total 8.400 mu of service reservoir storage capacity (of
which 2,000 mu  only are elevated) and approximately 400 km of pipes serving
10,600 connections (of whi_h 8,500 are domestic connections) and
60 standpipes (of which 11 only are in operation). About 90 km of
distribution pipes have recently been added under the Engineering Credit.
The distribution network covers about 60Z of the presently urbanized area.
2.        The Porto Novo potable vater supply system, built in the early
seventies under financing from the Federal Republic of Germany (KfW7, is
presently supplied by five boreboles, with a total capacity limited to
about 5,000 ms/d. As of end 1984, this distribution network consiats of
750 m3 of elevated storage and approximately 110 km of pipes serving 3,300
connections (of which 3,100 are domestic) and about 35 standpipes, all
operational.
B. Population Served and Standards of Service
3.        In Cotonou, it is estimated that only about 20Z of the population
has direct access to the SBEE distribution netvork through domestic
connections. Bowever, since the practice of vater re3ale to neighbors is
videspread, lt least for drinking and cooking purposes, it is believed that
a further 502 of the population are able to cover their drinking water
needs in this way through the SBEE system while very few people obtain
their drinking vater from the ten or so public standpipes in operation.
The remaining 30Z rely on their private vells only. In spite of the
relatively good development of the distribution network (0.8 m/inhabitant)
the number of domestic connections remains at a very low level (8,500 or 21
connection/lkm of distribution netvork).  In 1984, total vater consumption
and production have been metered at 14,100 m3fd and 20,500 m3/d, i.e.
29 lcd and 42 lcd respectively (unaccounted-for-water at 30% not very
high). Domestic consumption represents 70Z of the total consumption, the
remaining being divided between the industrial, commercial snd
administrative activities.

4.        At the end of 1984, about 232 of the Porto Novo populatlon had
connections to the distribution network sad anotbher 30Z obtain their
drinking vater either from neighbors or from public sLe1ndpipes.  The
remaining 47Z1 uaiSly located on the edges of the urbanized areas, use open
vells. As ln Cotonou, the distribution network in relatively dense
(0.7 m/inhabitaut) but the number of domestic connection in rather lov
(3,100 or 27 connections/km of distribution network). In 1984, total vater
consumption and production vere about 3,000 ms/d and 4,000 m'Id
respectively (i.e. 18 lcd and 25 lcd), the unaccouated-for-ater being
about 25Z.

SECOND VATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SBEE - PROPO.SED 'NANAGEMENT SUPPORT PROGRAH"
1.        SBEE has recently rev.quested financing from CCCE of France for a
"M(anagement Support Program ,NSP)" focused on strengthening the following
functions: electricity production and distribution, vater operations,
finances and accounting, data processing, and personnel management and
training. The MSP should start late 1986 and would be extended under the
proposed project from late 1988 onvards. The objectives of the MSP for the
vater and combined operations, as vell as the meanus deemed necessary to
meet these objectives, are described below.
A.   Water Operations
2.        Objectives
(a) creation of a technical capability able to carry out small water
supply projects (feasibility studies, detailed designs, tender
documents, and related economic and financial analysis) vith
lluited external assistance;
(b) organization of updating water distribution network maps and
technical data on other facilities, as vell as collection of
reliable statistics;
(c) organization of bulk and consumer metering and of meter repair;
and
(d) implementation of a program for improvement of pumping stations
and treatment plants operation, and for leakage detection.
3.        Training Actions Proposed for the Higher Level Staff.  They vould
consist of:
(a) training of at least 6 engineers in charge of day-to-day
operations (vater treatment and quality, pumping, vater
transmission and distribution) during a four-month course;
(b)  training of at least 2 engineers of the water department
(preparation of feasibility studies, final designs and tender
documents, procurement, construction supervision) during a
four-onth course;
(c) technical training of the engineer responsible of the vater
studies and nev vorks division during a six-month course; and

(d)  technical training of the engineer in charge of the vater quality
control unit during a six-month course.
All these training actions would be carried out abroad vith the assistance
of an experienced foreign water distribution company assisted by a
specialized vater training center.
4.        Training Actions Proposed for the Intermediate Level Staff.
They would mainly be carried out vithin SBEE existing training center,
CFPAE 11. Existing prograus would be reoriented tovards:
(a) upgrading of already trained vater technicians; and
(b) upgrading of electromechanists' skills.
Other training activities (especially for diesel specialists. polyvalent
technicians and administrative staff) vould be carried out vithin the other
existing Beninese training centers (CEB 2/, CPPE 31 and CENAFOC 4/). In
order to implement training activities within CFPAE, the proposed project
vould include remodeling of the existing buildings, purchase of additional
training equipment and a training advisor for about tvo years.
5.        Technical Assistance. A vater supply engineer vith an experience
of about 10 years in operations would assist SBEE organizing its vater
department during about three years. The proposed project vould finance
the last year of this TA.
B.  Finances and Accounting Departments
6.        Obiectives
<a) reorganization of general accounting; organization of cost and
budgetary accountings and of cash budget;
(b) preparation of a SBEE's chart of account based on the one used in
Benin;
(c) preparation and implementation of internal accounting procedures;

(d) preparation of financial monitoring indicators.
7.        Training Actions Proposed. Almost the entire accounting staff
has a sufficient background, but rather limited experience. Therefore, on-
the-job training appears to be the best alternative, in order to improve
the quality of the vorks already carried out and prepare and implement
additional procedures. No training abroad vould be provided for under the
proposed project.
8.        Technical Assistance. An experienced accountant from a vater
distribution company vould assist SBEE reorganizing the accouating
departuent during a three-year period and provide or-the-job training. The
proposed project vould finance the last year of this TA.
C.  Data Processing Department
9.        Oblectives
(a)  improvement of subscribers management, personnel management and
accounting;
(b) improvement of collection procedures;
(c) preparation and implementation of internal procedures;
(d) improvement of existing programs; and
(e) participation to the preparation of the data processing master
plan and to implementation of the new equipment.
10.       Training Actions Proposed.  As is the case for the accounting
departuent, on-the-job training appears to be the best solution since the
existing staff has a sufficient background. No training abroad vould be
provided under the proposed project.
11.       Technical Assistance. An experienced data processing specialist
from a water distribution company would assist SBEE during a three-year
period reorganizing its data processing department and implementing
recommendations of the master plan. The proposed project vould finance the
last year of this TA. One of the actions to be carrled out by this
technical assistant vould be to organize training sessions for the users of
the data processing department who, for the time being, are rather
suspiclous.
D.  Personnel Management
12.       Objectives
(a) review staff effectives and adaptation to the requirements of the
new organization chart;



- 53-
ANNEX 3-3
Page 4 of 5
(b) implementation of an efficient system of staff management
(attendance, leave ...); and
(c) coordination of the training activities both vithin and
outaide SBEE.
13.       Consultants Services.  Meeting the objectives of Personnel
Management reorganization would be achieved through the service of the
consultant in charge of coordination of the MSP (para 14) and the training
advisor (para 4).
E.  Coordination of the MSP
14.       This coordination vould be carried out by a manager of a vater
supply company vith relevant African experience in vater supply technics,
finance/accounting, and personnel/training. The proposed project would
finance about eight months of such consultancy spread over a tvo-year
period.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
ASSUMPTION FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A.  Note on Existing Statements
1.        Although SBEE's accounts are in most respect correctly kept, they
do not always reflect exactly the true situation because of certain
omissions and distortions. For example, consumer contributions to capital
outlay are not brought promptly into account; similarly. some ongoing
projects (and the related loan debt) administeged by CAA have also not yet
been incorporated in SBEE's accounts 1/. Certain earlier schemes for which
CAA organized the financing are shown in the accounts as "financed by
subsidy", even though CAA nov claims that SBEE is responsible for the debt
service liability; neanwhile, the company's income and expenditure are both
artificially inflated, by first charging depreciation of these systeus as
an expense> and then transferring the depreciation out again periodically.
in reduction of the value of the original subsidy. In addition, there have
sometimes been adjustments made after publication of the final accounts.
producing unexplained discrepancies. Nevertheless, the overall picture is
sufficiently clear to observe trends, draw conclusions and base forecasts.
B. Income Statement
2.        Water sales are projected on the demand forecasts developed in
the main text of this report, vith revenues derived from the average
tariffs forecast to be in effect year by year (paras. 5.03 and 5.04).
Electricity sales and revenues projections have been established vith the
regional Energy Division (WAPEG). Works invoiced are based on nev
connections (other than subsidized vater connections financed under the
project) and small distribution network extensions, as estimated by the
appraisal mission, using 1985 prices, increased by the inflation rates
assumed to arise thereafter.
3.        Inflation is assumed at the following rates, and applied to the
relevant operating expenses.
1/   They are hovever taken into account in the financial projections made
in this report.

4.        Materials consumed in 1985 are derived from SBEE's budget, but
for subsequent years are estimated to evolve from l.OZ to 1.5Z of the value
of fixed assets, to cover maintenance, plus half the cost of rechargeable
works. Estimates for chemicals are likewise based on SBEE's budget for
1985, increasing thereafter ln proportion to vater production.
5.        Electricity costs represent purchases from CEB to meet projected
demand and recharges to vater supply. The proportion of total electricity
production supplied by CEB, and the price charged, la based on WAPEG
estimates. The proportion chargeable to vater supply ie again based on the
1985 budget, increasing in proportion to vater production and using average
high voltage electricity tariffs.  Oil and gas co-mmmption is projected on
a similar basis.
6.        Services include such expenses as transport, insurance, rents and
repairs; the projections are based on the 1985 budget, increasing annually
from 2Z to 4Z over the forecast period. Employees covers all personnel
expenses, for which the starting point is again the 1985 budget (using the
breakdown as between vater supply and electricity shovn thereon); for later
years, only a small increase in staff members is projected, having regard
to the present overstaffing and the possibilities of upgrading the surplus
lover level personnel. Accordingly, the annual inflation factor is assumed
to cover salary increases, as vell as the small increase in numbers.
7.        Taxes, mainly levied on rechargeable vorks, are calculated at
approximately 24% of the value of those vorks; there are also some minor
taxes not separately calculated. Corporated taxes however are calculated
separately, at the present statutory level of 48Z of net profit.
8.        Provision for receivable (i.e. bad debts) is assumed at 3% of
turnover, and depreciation of fixed assets at the average rate of 4.2Z 2/;
pre-1983 assets are assumed to be depreciated at the snme rate. Deprecia-

tion of that part of fixed assets financed by consumers is re-credited to
the Income Statement under "Other Revenue", (and applied in vriting down
the value of consumer contributions in the balance sheet).
9.        Interest during construction is capitalized in the proportion of
work-in-progress to project investuents (both cumulative) during the
diabursement period.
10.       Dividende at the rate of 70Z of the net income after taxes are
assumed to be paid by SBEE to the Goverument. once the retained earnings
have a positive value (1988).
C. Balance Sheet
11.       For fixed assets, the 1983 revaluation is deemed to be
incorporated in the accounts in FY84 at which time the revaluation reserve
of CFAF 11,556 million is brought into the balance sheet. For the purpose
of calculating the rate of return, assets have been annually revalued at
85% of the foreign inflation rate per annum pending agreement with SBEE on
the basis of asset revaluation.
12.       Inventories vould decrease from eight to six months of
consumption by 1988.
13.       For accouats receivable, the set-off between SBEE and the
Governmuent is assumed to be effected at the end of FY86. Settlement of the
remaining balance due from public agencies is assumed to be expedited by
set-off against debt service chargeable to SBEE under credit on-lending
arrangements, and by the passing on to SBEE of the "vorking capital"
assistance afforded to the Governuent under the proposed project, in
reduction of tl:e liability to SBEE. For new billing accounts receivable
are projected at about four months of average annual billings.
14.       Under the heading oE "Equity and Liabilities", the item
"Reserves" includes consumer contributions to capital outlay, less
depreciation. Subsidies include revaluation surpluses, the value of
earlier schemes treated by SBEE as grant-financed, and the amount of
project financing passed on to SBEE on terma equivalent to subsidies (KfW
credit and part of IDA's contribution, under Credits 1171-BEN, 1189-BEN and
1557-BEN).
15.       Accounts payable are projected as tvo months of credit on
aaterial purchases and the cost of capital works. Customers' deposits are
estimated on the growth in the number of consumers and on changes in
consumer tariffs.
D. Funds Flow Statement
16.       Financl-g is identifiable for all investments projected in vater
supply, and debt service is calculated according to the known or expected
conditions.  For electricity investuents, some capital expenditure fr__
