Project\n            aims at: 1) enhancing Madagascar's prospects for\n            economic recovery and growth by ensuring an adequate supply\n            of electricity in the medium-term, both for businesses and\n            households, including an increased access of peri-urban and\n            rural populations to the service; 2) increasing economic and\n            management efficiency in the power sub-sector, and\n            attracting private capital for investment, through\n            institutional reform; and 3) promoting greater efficiency in\n            the production and consumption of energy, which, in the case\n            of woodfuels, will at the same time, help mitigate adverse\n            environmental impacts. The project components fall under\n            four major groups: 1) the bulk of Madagascar's Utility\n            for Electricity and Water's (JIRAMA) investment program\n            which will finance the rehabilitation and extension of\n            generation, transmission and distribution facilities, the\n            provision of tools and equipment for maintenance, a loss\n            reduction program, improvements in human resources\n            management and personnel training, a program for information\n            technology, and feasibility studies for two small\n            hydroelectric projects; 2) a program under the Ministry of\n            Energy and Mines (MEM) responsibility to increase access of\n            peri-urban and dynamic rural areas to the electricity\n            service; 3) actions in support of the institutional reform\n            of the power sector; and 4) a program for energy efficiency\n            dealing mainly with the woodfuels sub-sector."}, "docdt": "1996-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
