                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to improve poor children's overall development and readiness for further education, within a sustainable quality ECED
                         system.

                          To achieve this objective, the project will: (i) Increase poor communities' capacity to engage in participatory planning that will result in new or improved ECED services
                         for their children and families (see Component 1); (ii) Prepare the foundation for a sustainable ECED system through budgetary commitments from participating
                         districts, establishment of a national quality assurance and professional development system, and district capacity building (see Component 2); (iii) Ensure continuous
                         improvement of service delivery and system building throughestablishing effective project management, and monitoring and evaluation (see Component 3).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As part of continuous implementation support review, this ISR is updated to reflect 2 specific areas of progress:

                         1. The upgrading of FM rating (from MU to MS) based on the FM review in January 2012. The mission noted progress in the project’s financial management performance due to

                         follow-up on previous missions’recommendations, including the appointment of an FM consultant in CPICU, a TA on internal auditing, and timely IFR submission and follow-up on the
                         expenditures backlog. Consultants at the district level are also now on board and have made significant contributions to financial management performance at the district level. Based
                         on the above progress, the mission concluded that the FM rating for the project has improved to Moderately Satisfactory.

                         2. The collaboration with PNPM Generasi (Community Empowerment Program) is progressing well. Agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Home Affairs to add an
                         indicator on ECED (Every child aged 0 - 6 has access to age-appropriate ECED services); this will be piloted in mid-2012 in 2 districts where this ECED project and the PNPM
                         Generasi project co-exist. In parallel, the development of a proposal for further funding by AusAID is underway, with a target for proposal submission at the end April 2012

                         Implementation Review mission is scheduled for June/ July and the ISR will be updated again afterwards.
