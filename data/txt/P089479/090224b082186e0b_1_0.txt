                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to improve poor children's overall development and readiness for further education, within a sustainable quality ECED
                         system. To achieve this objective, the project will: (i) Increase poor communities' capacity to engage in participatory planning that will result in new or improved ECED
                         services for their children and families (see Component 1); (ii) Prepare the foundation for a sustainable ECED system through budgetary commitments from participating
                         districts, establishment of a national quality assurance and professional development system, and district capacity building (see Component 2); (iii) Ensure continuous
                         improvement of service delivery and system building throughestablishing effective project management, and monitoring and evaluation (see Component 3).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Preliminary analysis of data from the endline survey of the Impact Evaluation (available in September 2013) suggest that, on several aspects of development the gaps between richer
                         and poorer children have narrowed in project villages while they have not done so in non-project villages. This suggests the poor children’s overall development and readiness for
                         further education is improving in project villages.

                         This further support the previous result from the midline (2010) which showed the project: • had a clear positive impact on children’s enrollment in ECED services, the impact on
                         children from poor households was larger and positive and clearly significant impacts on child development were observed to be strongest for children from disadvantaged groups.

                         In parallel, analyses on Province and District final report showed that 96% districts have established a dedicated ECED unit within the local education office, all districts continue to
                         support ECED by integrating ECED agenda in their local development strategy and by allocating fund to it. A long list of local regulations in support to ECED is being compiled, some
                         even in the forms of village regulation allocating village fund to support ECED service in the community.

                         Some of the remaining activities especially on the establishment of Quality Assurance System, are being proactively followed up by the government beyond the project closing date.

                         In the final months of the project, hand-over workshops were organized, attended by representatives of Ministry and Provincial Education office where majority of districts were
                         represented by the Mayor. In these workshops, commitments and action plan to support ECED was reconfirmed.
