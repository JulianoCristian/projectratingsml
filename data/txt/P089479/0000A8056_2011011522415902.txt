                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to improve poor children's overall development and readiness for further education, within a sustainable quality
                         ECED system.

                          To achieve this objective, the project will: (i) Increase poor communities' capacity to engage in participatory planning that will result in new or improved ECED
                         services for their children and families (see Component 1); (ii) Prepare the foundation for a sustainable ECED system through budgetary commitments from
                         participating districts, establishment of a national quality assurance and professional development system, and district capacity building (see Component 2);
                         (iii) Ensure continuous improvement of service delivery and system building throughestablishing effective project management, and monitoring and evaluation
                         (see Component 3).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project is showing good results, and it is clear that districts are interested in and committed to improving ECED services, which are expanding more quickly than anticipated. A

                         ECED National Workshop conducted on Dec 8 ­ 10, attended by representatives of 50 local governments, including 31 district heads, ended with broad commitment for further
                         support to strengthening ECED service provision. Nearly all districts now have dedicated units focusing on ECED programs.
                         The baseline analysis of the impact evaluation is now being completed, and the midline data has been collected, so by mid 2011 a full report will be ready.
                         Disbursement is now improving, though continues to slip to the end of the year.
