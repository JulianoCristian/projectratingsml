                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to improve poor children's overall development and readiness for further education, within a sustainable quality ECED
                         system. To achieve this objective, the project will: (i) Increase poor communities' capacity to engage in participatory planning that will result in new or improved ECED
                         services for their children and families (see Component 1); (ii) Prepare the foundation for a sustainable ECED system through budgetary commitments from participating
                         districts, establishment of a national quality assurance and professional development system, and district capacity building (see Component 2); (iii) Ensure continuous
                         improvement of service delivery and system building throughestablishing effective project management, and monitoring and evaluation (see Component 3).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With the project scheduled to close within 6 months, the team decided to re-rate PDO and IP as Moderately Satisfactory to more reflect the combination of achievement and
                         unfinished agenda which will need to continue beyond the project. Specifically:

                         On the PDO: the midline result of Impact Evaluation has shown the project: • had a clear positive impact on children’s enrollment in ECED services (10 percentage points, significant
                         at the 1% level). The impact on children from poor households was larger. • Positive and clearly significant impacts (at 5% level) on child development were observed to be strongest
                         for children from disadvantaged groups. For instance in the domains of social competence as well as in language and cognitive development, the impact was 10 % for girls and 14 %
                         for poor children. •       Positive child development impacts were also generally observed on average, for all children living in project villages (i.e. the 310 villages included in the
                         impact evaluations), although these average impacts on development outcomes are not yet statistically significant.

                         The endline result, which is required to confirm the PDO achievement, is not available until after the project closing.

                         More than 90% of the project supported services continue to operate despite no longer receiving project grants. Alternative funding resources include village fund, (modest) fee and
                         support from district and central government. District allocation to ECED has increased significantly during project life. In the majority of project districts, local government has issued
                         supporting regulations to support ECED. Despite this high commitment by the districts, their ability to allocate resources for ECED is constraint by the overall budget envelope for
                         education and the fact that ECED is not (yet) part of compulsory education. Discussion with Min of Home Affairs to issue a Decree on ECED Minimum Service Standard is on-going.
                         Such decree will support district government in allocating local budget for ECED. The discussion is expected to continue beyond the project life.

                         Central government has distributed various block grants, most notably ECED operation fund (BoP), USD 720/ year/ service. However, the national allocation can only cover 25% of
                         number of services in the country. The insufficiency of MoEC’s budget allocation needs to be brought up to the higher level, preceded by an analysis of funding gap.

                         Some model centers, intended as local learning resource have shown to benefit its surrounding services, while others are focusing on improving the infrastructure.

                         The introduction of the new Directorate for ECED personnel development in 2012 provides better opportunity for internalizing teacher recognition and professional development and
                         the project has facilitated this integration. Key activities, including the establishment of National Trainer Association, is being scheduled for July – November, supported by the project.
                         However, this internalization process will need to continue beyond project life.

                         96% of project districts have established dedicated ECED unit with staffing and funding. The position of Head of ECED section at the district education office, has proven to be
                         effective in advocating for the local regulation, such as the issuance of local government regulations.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The process for formally handing over the project supported services from MoEC to the local government will continue until the end of the project. At the same time, record of good
                         practices and lessons learned at various level are being systematically recorded and disseminated as part of the project completion process.

                         In parallel, the Bank in partnership with other donors, will continue providing the government Technical Assistance and Analytical Support on selected issues to continue engagement
                         in this important area.
