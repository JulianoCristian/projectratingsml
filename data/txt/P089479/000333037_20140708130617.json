moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the parallel financing provided by the Royal\n            Netherlands Government allowed the project implementation\n            team to hire needed technical assistance prior to signing\n            and effectiveness. This ensured that people were in place to\n            support critical project components when the project became\n            effective. Moreover, the block grants could also begin right\n            as the project became effective so that villages could begin\n            their ECED programs quickly. The Project's\n            interventions were provided in a package that included\n            facilitation, block grants (for operation) and teacher\n            training that proved to be very effective. Moreover, each\n            village group received facilitation under the Project during\n            three years, long enough for them to be made aware of the\n            ECED services. This period was important to generate demand\n            for ECED at the village level and also to build ownership by\n            the local population by providing incentives for them to\n            establish and operate ECED centers. Together, these design\n            features were important for obtaining positive achievements\n            and to ensure sustainability at the community and district levels."}, "docdt": "2014-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
