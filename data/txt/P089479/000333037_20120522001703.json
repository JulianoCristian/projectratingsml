The project is rated\n            'satisfactory' on both project development\n            objectives (PDO) and implementation progress. Most of the\n            performance indicators have been met, and in some instances\n            targets have even been exceeded. Nearly 6,000 target\n            community-managed ECED centers have been funded and are\n            operational, providing services to children ages 0-6 years\n            old. More than 497,000 children (mostly 3-6 years old) have\n            now enrolled in these services. A parenting program will be\n            introduced this year to increase immediate benefits to\n            younger children and to prepare those children for later\n            successful participation in ECED centers. Another notable\n            progress at the community level is the functioning of a\n            community-based monitoring team (TPP) which had been idle in\n            previous years. Their active role in conducting annual\n            assessments to ECED centers now strengthens community\n            accountability and sustainability."}, "docdt": "2012-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
