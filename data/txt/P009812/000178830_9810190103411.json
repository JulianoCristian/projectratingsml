adoption of improved\n            technology and better farming practices. It will be\n            implemented in eight watersheds totalling (about 250,000 ha)\n            of the four participating States. However, if the project is\n            successful, a series of follow-on projects will be extended\n            to other areas. Major project components include: improved\n            crop and rangeland husbandry practices, soil and water\n            conservation measures, research, training and technical\n            assistance.
