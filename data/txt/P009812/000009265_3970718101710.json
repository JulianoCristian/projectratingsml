rainfed\n            farming areas through widespread adoption of improved\n            technology and better farming practices.  It will be\n            implemented in eight watersheds totalling (about 250,000 ha)\n            of the four participating States.  However, if the project\n            is successful, a series of follow-on projects will be\n            extended to other areas. Major project components include:\n            improved crop and rangeland husbandry practices, soil and\n            water conservation measures, research, training and\n            technical assistance.  The project will also strengthen\n            GOI's and the States' capacities to plan and\n            implement such schemes and invoke people's\n            participation at various levels."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
