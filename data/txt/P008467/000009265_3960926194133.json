Finally,\n            the project will provide technical assistance to train staff\n            from enterprises, Hungarian banks and government\n            departments, and to assist in appraisal of sub-projects, and\n            also to support the preparation of the next mid-range plan."}, "docdt": "1988-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
