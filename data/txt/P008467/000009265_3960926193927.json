is\n            designed to improve the capability of Hungarian industry to\n            undertake and sustain the TD (technology development)\n            necessary to meet the national objectives of increased\n            productivity and international competitiveness in the\n            context of the Government's economic reform program. In\n            accordance with these objectives, the project is composed of\n            three components; firstly, investment in commercially\n            oriented sub-projects via participating Hungarian banks.\n            These sub-projects are grouped in three areas: R/D\n            infrastructure, new industrial technology, and computer\n            software. Second, the project will finance two pre-appraised\n            investments in non-commercial, government owned entities\n            which provide essential services to TD activities. Finally,\n            the project will provide technical assistance to train staff\n            from enterprises, Hungarian banks and government\n            departments, and to assist in appraisal of sub-projects, and\n            also to support the preparation of the next mid-range plan."}, "docdt": "1988-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
