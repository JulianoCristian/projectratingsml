Development Policy Loan Project (FSDPL\n            I) for Jamaica were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            coordination with other multilaterals and bilateral\n            institutions enhances the impact of Bank operations. FSDPL I\n            was part of a package of support for the Jamaica Debt\n            Exchange (JDX) by International Financial Institutions\n            (IFIs) and bilateral donors, and its impact was amplified by\n            complementary programs by the International Monetary Fund\n            (IMF) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Use of\n            high level outcome indicators to measure progress can be\n            problematic. Since this was an operation that was meant to\n            enhance debt and fiscal sustainability, it made sense, a\n            priori, to include quantitative measures such as the primary\n            balance to gross domestic product (GDP) and debt to GDP. In\n            hindsight, however, it was clear that these outcomes are\n            well beyond the control of the Bank or the Government. The\n            impact of the global crisis, the Supreme Court ruling on\n            wages, and an early election on these indicators was\n            something that was difficult to counter with the measures\n            envisaged in the FSDPL series. The use of technical\n            assistance and/or investment lending to bolster capacity can\n            help achieve results on reforms. Including privatization of\n            specific enterprises as an outcome indicator is problematic."}, "docdt": "2012-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
