                                                 SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION

                                               Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                                               September 8, 2011

      Executive Directors approved the Second Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability
Development Policy Loan (FSDPL2) to Jamaica in the amount of US$100 million on the
payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum (R2011-0194).

        Executive Directors expressed support for the DPL and the overall design of the program,
and that its three main policy areas are an adequate foundation for the Government’s long-term
development strategy. Executive Directors observed that the DPL builds upon progress made
under the previous operation and that the DPL’s coverage of fiscal reforms is a key determinant
of economic stability and a foundation for inclusive growth. Executive Directors also noted the
delays in the IMF program and encouraged the Jamaican authorities to take steps to conclude the
fourth and fifth reviews under the IMF Stand-By Arrangement. Executive Directors
acknowledged the external and internal challenges that remain and encouraged further efforts by
the authorities in improving fiscal and debt sustainability. They urged continued collaboration
among development partners to ensure successful implementation of this project.
