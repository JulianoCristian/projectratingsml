           fiscal and debt sustainability, by supporting reforms to\n            increase control on public spending and debt generation,\n            reduce debt service burden and improve debt management,\n            reduce financial vulnerabilities, and increase public\n            spending effectiveness; increasing the efficiency of\n            financial management and budget processes, by supporting\n            efforts to improve the efficiency of public expenditure and\n            investment, and strengthen control of public finances and\n            the effectiveness of government budgeting practices; and\n            reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax\n            system, through reducing the use of fiscal incentives and\n            increasing the uniformity of the tax code, improving client\n            services for tax payers, broadening the tax base, and\n            simplifying tax payments. This program document describes\n            the single-tranche FSDPL2 in the amount of US$100 million\n            for Jamaica. The operation builds on the progress made under\n            the Bank's previous FSDPL and the FSDPL1, February\n            2010. The reform program supported by the DPL is the\n            manifestation of the Jamaican Government's strategy to\n            increase fiscal and debt sustainability, improve\n            macroeconomic stability, and accelerate growth. Reflecting\n            the most pressing concerns at the time of operation\n            preparation, the focus of the Government's program has\n            been primarily on the first objective of fiscal and debt\n            sustainability. However, the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) has\n            made significant progress towards achievement of its\n            objectives in each of these three areas, despite the\n            difficult external environment and the slow pace of recovery\n            from the adverse effects of the global crisis. The GoJ\n            remains committed to its medium term reform program under a\n            challenging environment. The GoJ recognizes the importance\n            of improving macroeconomic stability and paving the way for\n            accelerated growth while protecting the poor. The\n            macroeconomic environment was strengthened substantially by\n            the successful implementation of Government's reforms."}, "docdt": "2011-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
