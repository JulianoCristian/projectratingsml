population density.\n            An environmental screening process shall determine the\n            environmental category of each subproject, and whether it\n            warrants an environmental assessment, or, an environmental\n            management plan alone. Attached are samples of\n            questionnaires to be conducted prior to subproject approval.\n            It is specified cultural property, which includes monuments,\n            works of art, or sites of significance points of view,\n            defined as having archaeological, historical, architectural,\n            or religious significance - will be avoided, and, should new\n            finds occur the authorities should be notified, and steps\n            shall be taken to preserve archaeological sites. Mitigation\n            measures include good engineering design, to prevent further\n            deterioration in the quantity, and quality of groundwater,\n            and, in the absence of water supply networks, the project\n            will assess feasible alternative/temporary options on a\n            case-by-case basis, in compliance with the local ecology\n            aspects. Wastewater must not enter streams without settling\n            ponds, filters, or other processes. Co-ordination with\n            stakeholders, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) must\n            begin in the design phase itself. The natural landscape\n            shall be preserved to the extent possible, through\n            operations that prevent unnecessary destruction, or scarring\n            of natural surroundings. The report also addresses potential\n            resettlement, and compensation issues, including in\n            particular, ethnic groups to ensure these groups\n            participate, and benefit from the project implementation.\n            Grievance mechanisms will be in place to assure compliance\n            with these safeguards."}, "docdt": "2004-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
