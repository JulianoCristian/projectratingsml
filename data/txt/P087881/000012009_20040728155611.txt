ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK 
 
I. Objectives 
 
1. 
The Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) provides general 
policies, guidelines, codes of practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of the 
initial phase of World Bank-supported emergency reconstruction operations in Iraq.  This Framework has 
been developed to ensure compliance with the World Bank’s safeguard policies under the current 
conditions in Iraq. The objective of the ESSAF is to ensure that activities under the proposed 
reconstruction operations will address the following issues: 
 
™
Protect human health;  
™
Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;  
™
Minimize environmental degradation as a result of either individual subprojects or their 
cumulative effects;  
™
Minimize impacts on cultural property; and 
™
Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes. 
 
II. General 
Principles 
 
2. 
Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed relief and reconstruction operations and the 
related need for providing immediate assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in 
managing potential environmental and social risks, the ESSAF is based on the following principles: 
 
™
The proposed operations will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs of which may not 
be known at appraisal. To ensure effective application of the World Bank’s safeguard policies, 
the ESSAF provides guidance on the approach to be taken during implementation for the 
selection and design of subprojects and the planning of mitigation measures; 
 
™
Environmental category ‘A’ subprojects are not expected in the first year’s subprojects.  If any do 
occur, EAs for specific subprojects will be prepared during implementation, instead of before 
appraisal. Corrective measures in the form of an Environmental Management Plan will be built 
into either the emergency project or a future lending operation. The above is in accordance with 
paragraph 13 of OP 4.01 and paragraph 5 of BP 4.01; 
 
™
No resettlement issues are expected in any of the FY04 operations for the first year’s subprojects. 
If any do occur, Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), and/or Resettlement Policy Frameworks for 
specific subprojects will be prepared. However, these RAPs can be prepared during 
implementation, provided a waiver on the submission of RAPs prior to appraisal is given by the 
MD. The waiver would also specify a timetable for the preparation of the RAPs,  in accordance 
with the requirements of OP 4.12, during implementation; 
 
™
The proposed emergency reconstruction operations will finance feasibility and detailed design 
studies for these subsequent investments, which will include environmental assessments and 
social studies as required by World Bank safeguard policies; 
 
Page  2

2
-
™
Project design and subproject selection will aim at maintaining regional balance and equity 
among  ethnic religious groups, considering variations in population density.  Employment 
opportunities within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the basis of 
professional competence, irrespective of gender or ethnic or religious group.  In all projects which 
require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries, consultations will be conducted to 
elicit the views of the male and female population; and 
 
™
Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs of these 
operations. This ESSAF will be disclosed in the sector ministries and other public places in Iraq  
and in the World Bank InfoShop.  
 
III. 
Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) 
 
3. 
This ESSAF has been developed specifically for these proposed operations to ensure due 
diligence, to avoid causing harm or exacerbating social tensions, and to ensure consistent treatment of 
social and environmental issues by all donors and the Governing Council of Iraq.
 
The purpose of this 
Framework is also to assist the Project Implementing Agencies in screening all the subprojects for their 
likely social and environmental impacts, identifying documentation and preparation requirements and 
prioritizing the investments.   
 
4. 
P
4.01 Environmental Assessment.
 
Most of the proposed subprojects are likely to focus on the 
repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgrading
 
(where necessary) of damaged buildings, roads, 
railways, bridges and infrastructure of critical importance.  This would include power generation and 
distribution, agricultural infrastructure, irrigation and drainage networks, and rehabilitation of primary 
and secondary schools. Support will also be provided for mitigation measures related to the 
rehabilitation/restoration of the Mesopotamian Marshes and Shatt El Arab. The work in these areas will 
be done under OP 4.01 and it is not anticipated that OP 4.04 on natural habitats will be triggered.
 
5. 
Considering the nature and magnitude of potential environmental impacts from relatively limited 
scale and magnitude of reconstruction works, the proposed operations are likely to be classified as 
categ
ory ‘B’.  The requirement to carry out an Environmental Analysis as part of project preparation can 
be waived but, for subprojects with potential adverse impacts, a limited Environmental Analysis will be 
done during project implementation.  At the same time, prior to appraisal the implementing agency will 
agree to apply the following minimum standards during implementation: inclusion of standard 
environmental codes of practice (ECOP) in the repair and reconstruction bid documents of all subprojects; 
review and oversight of any major reconstruction works by specialists; implementation of 
environmentally and socially sound options for disposal of debris; and provisions for adequate budget and 
satisfactory institutional arrangements for monitoring effective implementation.
 
6. 
OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement.
 
The need for involuntary resettlement or land acquisition in 
specific subproject areas will only be known during project implementation, when site-specific plans are 
available.  Therefore subprojects will be screened for applicability of the resettlement policy and any 
subprojects involving involuntary resettlement or land acquisition will only be approved after preparation 
of a resettlement plan acceptable to the Bank. Several issues will increase the complexity of land 
acquisition - the lack of reliable land record systems, and the inability of people loosing land to either 
document ownership or be physically present to make their claims for eligibility. The safeguards 
framework will therefore include procedures for identifying eligible project-affected people, calculating 
and delivering compensation, and mechanisms for land dispute grievance redress. 
 
7. 
Although land disputes between private parties and refugees from war, or natural disasters are not 
covered by OP 4.12, the policy does cover those displaced by the project’s activities.  Even for those not 
Page  3
-
3
-
covered by the policy, and to ensure effective poverty reduction, it is good practice for the borrower to 
undertake a social assessment and implement measures to minimize and mitigate adverse social impacts, 
particularly on poor and vulnerable groups. Well documented consultation mechanisms will be required 
to establish eligibility for compensation.  Absent refugees who later claim compensation will require clear 
legal remedies to resolve or adjudicate disputes. 
 
8.
 
OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples.
 Ethnicity is only one of many factors determining vulnerability in 
the present Iraqi context.  Local circumstances vary too greatly to make generalizations. However, initial 
discussions with anthropologists and sociologists familiar with the country found that the presence of the 
five defining characteristics normally used (OD 4.20 paragraph 5) are inconclusive in Iraqi’s context, 
where the ethnic group concept is analytically problematic.  According to social scientists familiar with 
ground realities in Iraq, selecting a sub-section of the society for special attention in accordance with the 
requirements of OD 4.20 (e.g., separate plans for different groups) would be counterproductive and could 
even end up escalating the conflict within and between communities.   
 
9. 
In light of the above situation, a potential vulnerability assessment of all affected groups is 
planned to ensure effective consultations and culturally appropriate benefits for each group, instead of 
focusing only on groups defined as “indigenous peoples”.  As part of this analysis, subproject preparation 
will assess the vulnerability of different ethnic groups in particular project contexts (in terms of potential 
exclusion from project benefits, negative project impacts, and the need for specific culturally compatible 
mechanisms for participation), and will incorporate adequate measures to address such vulnerability in 
project design. While some specific cases may justify stand-alone Indigenous Peoples Development Plans 
(IPDP) such as in the case of the people in the Mesopotamian Marshlands, these cases can only be 
determined after social analysis of potential vulnerability and careful judgment as required by the OD 
4.20.  
 
10.
 
OPN 11.03 Cultural Property.
 
The FY04 operations may pose limited risks of damaging 
cultural property, assuming that they will not include large-scale excavations, movement of earth or 
demolition. Nevertheless, projects and subprojects will be reviewed for their potential impact on cultural 
property and clear procedures will be required for identification, protection of cultural property from 
theft, and treatment of discovered artifacts, and will be included in standard bidding documents.  While 
not damaging cultural property, subproject preparation may later identify and include assistance for 
preservation of historic or archeological sites.  If these opportunities occur, cultural property management 
plans would be prepared for those subprojects. 
 
11.
 
OP 4.37 Safety of Dams.
 
There are about 50 dams over 15 meters high, which will trigger the 
policy if included in the operations.  However, because of local site conditions, even restoring smaller, 
earthen dams and linked irrigation infrastructure (partly abandoned, damaged or destroyed by civil unrest 
and war) will require application of standard engineering safety codes, inspection and evaluation of their 
safety status, and preparation and implementation of operation and maintenance procedures.  Decisions 
on dam safety requirements will be made with the concurrence of the Bank.  
 
12. 
OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways.
 
The two major rivers in Iraq, the Tigris and 
Euphrates, are shared with neighboring countries.  However, no water sharing agreements exist between 
Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq.  Components affecting waters in riparian neighbors will trigger the policy 
and project components will be screened to identify riparian issues and to ensure adequate notification, as 
required under the policy.  Decisions on actions and requirements will be made with the concurrence of 
the Bank.
 
IV. 
Safeguard Screening and Mitigation 
 
Page  4

13. 
The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects will be consistent 
with the following guidelines, codes of practice and requirements.  The Coalition Provisional Authority 
(CPA) will confirm that areas to be accessed during reconstruction and rehabilitation activities have been 
de-mined
.
The safeguard screening and mitigation process will include: 
 
™
A
list of negative characteristics rendering a proposed subproject ineligible for support, 
Attachment 1; 
™
A
proposed checklist of likely environment and social impacts to be filled out for each 
subproject or group of subprojects, Attachment 2; 
™
Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation, Attachment 3; 
™
Procedures for the protection of cultural property, including the chance discovery of 
archaeological artifacts, unrecorded graveyards and burial sites, Attachment 4;  
™
Relevant elements of the codes of practice for the prevention and mitigation of potential 
environmental impacts, Attachment 5; and
 
™
A
sample Environmental Safeguards procedures for Inclusion in the Technical Specifications 
of Contracts, Attachment 6. 
 
V. 
Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation 
 
14. 
A number of Ministries will act as the implementing agencies for the proposed operations, 
including the Ministries of Environment, Transport, Housing and Construction, Electricity, Water 
Resources, Municipalities and Public Works, and the mayoralty of Baghdad.  Each Ministry will be 
responsible for applying the safeguard screening and mitigation requirements to its own subprojects.  
Within each Ministry, a Safeguards Focal Point (SFP) will be identified with responsibility for overseeing 
the implementation of the Framework.   
 
VI. 
Capacity-Building and Monitoring of Safeguard Framework Implementation 
 
15. 
As part of the capacity-building to be provided for implementation of the proposed operations, 
the Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministries will also receive training in  
ESSAF’s application.   
 
16. 
To assist in this capacity-building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the 
ESSAF’s application, the World Bank and subsequently the Governing Council of Iraq (GCI) will 
contract specialist services for environmental and social safeguards. During supervision of these 
operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the ESSAF, and recommend additional 
strengthening, if required.  
 
VII. 
Consultation and Disclosure 
 
17. 
This ESSAF will be shared with the CPA, with the concerned nongovernmental organizations and 
development partners of Iraq’s reconstruction.  It will be disclosed in Arabic and English by the Ministry 
of Planning and Development Cooperation on behalf of the GCI in Baghdad, Basrah, and Mosul, and it 
will also be made available at the World Bank’s InfoShop. Relevant subproject specific safeguard 
documents/mitigation plans prepared subsequently will also be disclosed.  
 
Page  5

-
18. 
The proposed operations will support a number of feasibility and detailed design studies for 
future infrastructure investments for which World Bank safeguard policies relating to consultation and 
disclosure will apply.  In particular, for environmental Category A and B investments
1
proposed for future 
operations, the implementing agency will consult project-affected groups and local nongovernmental 
organizations on the project's environmental and social aspects, and will take their views into account.
 
The implementing agency will initiate these consultations as early as possible, and for meaningful 
consultations, will provide relevant material in a timely manner prior to consultation, in a form and 
language(s) that are understandable and accessible to the groups being consulted.   
 
19. 
For Category A projects, the implementing agency will consult these groups at least twice: (a) 
shortly after the environmental screening and prior to finalization of the terms of reference for the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA); and (b) once a draft EIA report is prepared.  For the initial 
consultation, the implementing agency will provide a summary of the proposed project's objectives, 
description, and potential impacts.  For both Category A and B projects, the implementing agency will 
provide these groups with a summary of the EIA report’s conclusions.  In addition, the implementing 
agency will make the draft reports publicly available to project-affected groups and local 
nongovernmental organizations.

Attachment 3 
 
Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements and Compensation 
 
I. Objectives 
 
1. 
Resettlement and land acquisition will be kept to a minimum, and will be carried out in 
accordance with these guidelines.  Subproject proposals that would require demolishing houses or 
acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid their impacts through 
alternative alignments.  Proposals that require more than minor expansion along rights of way should be 
carefully reviewed.  No land or asset acquisition may take place outside of these guidelines.  A format for  
a
Land Acquisition Assessment Data Sheet is attached as Attachment 3(i). 
 
2. 
These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate negatively affected persons to 
ensure that they will be assisted to improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or 
production capacity to pre-project levels regardless of their land tenure status.  
 
II. Categorization 
 
3. 
Based on the number of persons that may be affected by the project, Project Affected People 
(PAPs) and the magnitude of impacts, projects will be categorized as follows: 
 
(a) Projects that will affect more than 200 PAPs due to land acquisition and/or physical 
relocation and where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced.  If the RAP 
cannot be prepared prior to project appraisal, a waiver can be provided by the World Bank 
Managing Director (MD) in consultation with the Resettlement Committee.  In such cases, 
the TT should agree with the Borrower on a timetable for preparation of the RAP. 
 
(b) Projects that will affect less than 200 persons require
 the following documentation: (i) a 
land acquisition assessment, (ii) the minutes or record of consultations which assess 
the compensation claimed and agreement reached, and (iii) a record of the receipt of 
the compensation, or voluntary donation, by those affected (see below). 
 
(c) Projects that are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant adverse 
social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and improved livelihoods 
are expected from such interventions. 
 
III. Eligibility 
 
4. 
PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood is directly affected by the project due to 
acquisition of the land owned or used by them.  PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are: 
 
(a)  those who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structures/buildings, including 
recognized customary and traditional rights; 
 
(b) those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufruct rights rooted in 
customary law; and 
 
Page  13
-
13
-
(c)  those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall within (a) and 
(b) above, are eligible to resettlement assistance to restore their livelihood. 
 
IV. 
Acquisition of Productive Assets and Compensation 
 
5. 
PAPs are eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as described below:
 
(a)
 Voluntary contributions
.
Individuals may elect to voluntarily contribute land or assets 
provided the persons making such contributions do so willingly and are informed that they 
have the right to refuse such contributions; and 
 
(b) 
Contributions against compensation
.
A
contributor/asset loser considered "affected" will be 
eligible for compensation and other necessary assistance. 
 
6. 
Voluntary contribution should be clearly documented to confirm the voluntary nature of the 
transition.  The documentation should specify that the land is free of any squatters, encroachers or other 
claims.  A format is shown in Attachment 3(i), which includes a Schedule for assessing any compensation 
claimed and the agreement reached. 
 
V. Compensation 
Principles 
 
7. 
The project implementation agencies will ensure timely provision of the following means of 
compensation to affected peoples: 
 
(a)  Project affected peoples losing access to a portion of their land or other productive assets with 
the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at a replacement 
cost for that portion of land or assets lost to them.  Compensation for the lost assets will be 
made according to the following principles: 
 
(i) 
replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent productive 
assets; 
(ii) 
materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished; 
(iii) 
replacement of damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value; 
(iv) 
other acceptable in-kind compensation;  
(v) 
in case of cash compensation, the delivery of compensation should be made in public, 
i.e., at the Community Meeting; and 
(vi) 
in case of physical relocation, provision of civic infrastructure at the resettlement sites. 
 
(b) Project affected peoples losing access to a portion of their land or other economic assets 
rendering the remainder economically non-viable will have the options of compensation for 
the entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset, 
according to the principles in (a) i-iv above. 
 
VI. Consultation 
Process 
 
8. 
The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets located in 
a
proposed subproject area are consulted.  Community meetings will be held in each affected district and 
Page  14
-
14
-
village to inform the local population of their rights to compensation and options available in accordance 
with these Guidelines.  The Minutes of the community meetings shall reflect the discussions held,

Attachment 4  
 
Protection of Cultural Property 
 
1.        Cultural property include monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of significance points of 
view, and are defined as sites and structures having archaeological, historical, architectural, or religious 
significance, and natural sites with cultural values.  This includes cemeteries, graveyards and graves. 
 
2. 
The initial phase of the proposed emergency reconstruction operations pose limited risks of 
damaging  cultural property since subprojects will largely consist of small investments in community 
infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction of existing structures, and minor public 
works.  Further, the list of negative subproject attributes, which would make a subproject ineligible for 
support (Attachment 1), includes any activity that would adversely impact cultural property. 
 
Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection from theft, and treatment of 
discovered artifacts  should be followed and included in standard bidding documents as provided in 
Attachment 6. 
 
Chance Find Procedures 
 
3. 
Chance find procedures will be used as follows: 
 
(a)  Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find; 
(b)  Delineate the discovered site or area; 
(c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects.  In cases of removable 
antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the responsible local 
authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over; 
(d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local authorities and 
the Ministry of Culture immediately (within 24 hours or less); 
(e) Responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture would be in charge of protecting 
and preserving the site before deciding on subsequent appropriate procedures. This would 
require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be performed by the archeologists of the 
Ministry of Culture (within 72 hours). The significance and importance of the findings should 
be assessed according to the various criteria relevant to cultural heritage; those include the 
aesthetic, historic, scientific or research, social and economic values; 
(f)  Decisions on how to handle the finding shall be taken by the responsible authorities and the 
Ministry of Culture.  This could include changes in the layout (such as when finding an 
irremovable remain of cultural or archeological importance) conservation, preservation, 
restoration and salvage; 
(g) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding shall be 
communicated in writing by the Ministry of Culture; and 
(h) Construction work could resume only after permission is given from the responsible local 
authorities and the Ministry of Culture concerning safeguard of the heritage. 
 
4. 
These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when 
applicable, and as proposed in section 1.5 of Attachment 6.  During project supervision, the Site Engineer 
shall monitor the above regulations relating to the treatment of any chance find encountered are observed.   
 
5. 
Relevant findings will be recorded in World Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and 
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will
 assess the overall effectiveness of the project’s  cultural 
property mitigation, management, and activities, as appropriate.

Potential Impacts 
Prevention and Mitigation Measures 
Social Impacts: 
 
·
The vulnerable groups (women, 
poor children, migrants, 
pastoralists and the poor) may 
not benefit from infrastructure 
construction and rehabilitation. 
·
Schools/health posts may 
become abandoned due to the 
lack of commitment. 
·
Building infrastructure system 
alone without needs assessment 
may not benefit the community. 
·
Infrastructure investments may 
be misappropriated by 
governments. 
 
·
Before the start of each infrastructure project, develop 
comprehensive organizational and maintenance plan, 
commitment from local government and public to maintain 
school supplies, medical supplies, etc.

The Contractor and his employees shall adhere to the mitigation measures set down and take all 
other measures required by the Engineer to prevent harm, and to minimize the impact of his operations 
on the environment.  
 
2.        The Contractor shall not be permitted to unnecessarily strip clear the right of way. The Contractor 
shall only clear the minimum width for construction and diversion roads should not be constructed 
alongside the existing road. 
 
3. 
Remedial actions which cannot be effectively carried out during construction should be carried 
out on completion of each Section of the road (earthworks, pavement and drainage) and before issuance 
of the Taking Over Certificate:  
 
(a)  these sections should be landscaped and any necessary remedial works should be undertaken 
without delay, including grassing and reforestation;  
 
(b) water courses should be cleared of debris and drains and culverts checked for clear flow 
paths; and 
 
(c) borrow pits should be dressed as fish ponds, or drained and made safe, as agreed with the 
land owner.  
 
4. 
The Contractor shall limit construction works to between 6 am and 7 pm if it is to be carried out 
in or near residential areas.  
 
5. 
The Contractor shall avoid the use of heavy or noisy equipment in specified areas at night, or in 
sensitive areas such as near a hospital.  
 
6. 
To prevent dust pollution during dry periods, the Contractor shall carry out regular watering of 
earth and gravel haul roads and shall cover material haulage trucks with tarpaulins to prevent spillage.  
 
II. Transport 
 
 
7. 
The Contractor shall use selected routes to the project site, as agreed with the Engineer, and 
appropriately sized vehicles suitable to the class of road, and shall restrict loads to prevent damage to 
roads and bridges used for transportation purposes. The Contractor shall be held responsible for any 
damage caused to the roads and bridges due to the transportation of excessive loads, and shall be required 
to repair such damage to the approval of the Engineer.   
 
8.

15. 
The Contractor shall ensure that site offices, depots and particularly storage areas for diesel fuel 
and bitumen and asphalt plants are not located within 500 meters of watercourses, and are operated so that 
no pollutants enter watercourses, either overland or through groundwater seepage, especially during 
periods of  rain.  This will require lubricants to be recycled and a ditch to be constructed around the area 
with an approved settling pond/oil trap at the outlet. 
 
16. 
The contractor shall not use fuelwood as a means of heating during the processing or preparation 
of any materials forming part of the Works.  
 
IV. 
Quarries and Borrow Pits  
 
17. 
Operation of a new borrow area, on land, in a river, or in an existing area, shall be subject to prior 
approval of the Engineer, and the operation shall cease if so instructed by the Engineer.  Borrow pits shall 
be prohibited where they might interfere with the natural or designed drainage patterns.  River locations 
shall be prohibited if they might undermine or damage the river banks, or carry too much fine material 
downstream.  
 
18. 
The Contractor shall ensure that all borrow pits used are left in a trim and tidy condition with 
stable side slopes, and are drained ensuring that no stagnant water bodies are created which could breed 
mosquitoes.  
 
19. 
Rock or gravel taken from a river shall be far enough removed to limit the depth of material 
removed to one-tenth of the width of the river at any one location, and not to disrupt the river flow, or 
damage or undermine the river banks.  
 
20. 
The location of crushing plants shall be subject to the approval of the Engineer, and not be close 
to environmentally sensitive areas or to existing residential settlements, and shall be operated with 
approved fitted dust control devices.

V. Earthworks 
 
 
21. 
Earthworks shall be properly controlled, especially during the rainy season.  
 
22. 
The Contractor shall maintain stable cut and fill slopes at all times and cause the least  possible 
disturbance to areas outside the prescribed limits of the work.  
 
23. 
The Contractor shall complete cut and fill operations to final cross-sections at any one location as 
soon as possible and preferably in one continuous operation to avoid partially completed earthworks, 
especially during the rainy season.  
 
24. 
In order to protect any cut or fill slopes from erosion, in accordance with the drawings, cut off 
drains and toe-drains shall be provided at the top and bottom of slopes and be planted with grass or other 
plant cover. Cut off drains should be provided above high cuts to minimize water runoff and slope 
erosion. 
 
25.

be dug within and around  the tips, as directed by the Engineer.  
 
VI. 
Historical and Archeological Sites
 
27. 
If the Contractor discovers archeological sites, historical sites, remains and objects, including 
graveyards and/or individual graves during excavation or construction, the Contractor shall: 
 
(a)  Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find. 
(b)  Delineate the discovered site or area. 
(c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects.  In cases of removable 
antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the responsible local 
authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over. 
(d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local authorities and 
the Ministry of Culture immediately (less than 24 hours). 
(e)  Contact the responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture who would be in charge 
of protecting and preserving the site before deciding on the proper procedures to be carried 
out.  This would require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be performed by the 
archeologists of the Ministry of Culture (within 72 hours).  The significance and importance 
of the findings should be assessed according to the various criteria relevant to cultural 
heritage, including the aesthetic, historic, scientific or research, social and economic values. 
(f)  Ensure that decisions on how to handle the finding be taken by the responsible authorities and 
the Ministry of Culture. This could include changes in the layout (such as when the finding is 
an irremovable remain of cultural or archeological importance) conservation, preservation, 
restoration and salvage. 
(g) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding shall be 
communicated in writing by the Ministry of Culture; and

Debris generated due to the dismantling of the existing structures shall be suitably reused, to the 
extent feasible, in the proposed construction (e.g. as fill materials for embankments). The disposal of 
remaining debris shall be carried out only at sites identified and approved by the project engineer. The 
contractor should ensure that these sites (a) are not located within designated forest areas; (b) do not 
impact natural drainage courses; and (c) do not impact endangered/rare flora.  Under no circumstances 
shall the contractor dispose of any material in environmentally sensitive areas. 
 
29. 
In the event any debris or silt from the sites is deposited on adjacent land, the Contractor shall 
immediately remove such, debris or silt and restore the affected area to its original state to the satisfaction 
of the Supervisor/Engineer. 
 
30. 
Bentonite slurry or similar debris generated from pile driving or other construction activities shall 
be disposed of to avoid overflow into the surface water bodies or form mud puddles in the area. 
 
31. 
All arrangements for transportation during construction including provision, maintenance, 
dismantling and clearing debris, where necessary, will be considered incidental to the work and should be 
planned and implemented by the contractor as approved and directed by the Engineer. 
 
32. 
Vehicle/machinery and equipment operations, maintenance and refueling shall be carried out to 
avoid spillage of fuels and lubricants and ground contamination. An 'oil interceptor" will be provided for 
wash down and refueling areas.  Fuel storage shall be located in proper bunded areas.
