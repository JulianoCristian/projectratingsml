APPRAISAL OF
SEVENTH INDUSTRIAL IMPORTS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Since 1964, the International Development Association (IDA)
has extended six industrial import credits to India totalling US$605
million. The funds have been used for the import of materials, com-
ponents, spare parts and some balancing equipment thereby contributing
to better utilization of existing production capacity, cost minimization
and export growth. The Indian Government has asked for another - the
seventh - credit to meet similar objectives and this report appraises this
request.
ii.       India's industrial strategy of protected import substitution had
succeeded by the mid-sixties in creating a broad industrial base capable of
producing a wide variety of goods. However, this had been achieved to
some extent at the expense of efficiency, productivity, and international
competitiveness. Triggered primarily by two successive years of drought,
the general economic depression of 1965 to 1967 forced a reappraisal of
develop.ment strategy.  Industry found itself with substantial unused
capacity and, because of its high cost structure, little possibility of
exporting. The thrust of industrial policy was reoriented towards foreign
irkets and a system of incentives was instituted to stimulate export sales.
Measured in terms of export earnings, results have been encouraging. But
sound growth, it is recognized, must be increasingly based on India's com-
parative advantages under international market conditions.
iii.      Industrial sectors that have been eligible under the previous credits
have varied in number between 5 and 12, but almost 75% of the IDA funds so
provided were channeled to the following industries: conuercial vehicles;
automotive ancillaries; fertilizers and pesticides; agricultural tractors;
electrical equipment and machine, cutting and small tools.  All credits have
been fully disbursed.
iv.       The IDA sectors have generally performed better than Indian industry
as a whole.  Many factors, of course, have combined to sustain their high
output growth record, but IDA's assistance in importing industrial materials
has undoubtedly played an important role.  Between FY's 1968/69 and 1970/71,
average annual growth in gross product value of these sectors has ranged
from a low of 10% to a high of 47%, with the weighted average about 15% as
against the 6 to 7% for all of India's manufacturing industry. The sub-
stantial increase in exports of the IDA-assisted industries in recent years
(from negligible amounts only a few years back) is particularly encouraging.
Exports by manufacturers of commercial vehicles and machine, cutting and small
tools have reached close to 10% of turnover, with electrical equipment makers
somewhat less. This welcome trend is expected to continue. Despite such
progress, however, it should be recognized that some of the sectors - though



- ii -
clearly not all - are still rather high-cost producers. Reasons for
this are varied and are attributable in part to high raw material costs,
high import duties, fragmentation of capacity in sub-economic plants,
excessive protection, outmoded product designs and deficiency in manage-
ment.
v.        The proposed seventh credit of US$75 million equivalent is expected
to be disbursed by March 31, 1972; it would be used by the same sectors as
in the previous credit, but would add power tillers and aluminum smelting
and broaden several sectoral definitions to include related products of
equally high priority. It would help meet part of the total import require-
ments of these sectors, estimated to be US$258 mllnion, for raw materials,
components and spare parts and in the proportions indicated below:

Total       258             75            2 9.*
Vi.       The sectors have been chosen because of their key importance to
the economy and their generally very good growth and export prospects. The
proposed IDA share of these sectors'total inport needs would be 29%.
Individual allocations are based on a sector by sector assessment of the
availability of other foreign exchange funds (including bilateral) and the
degree to which untied funds are required to cover imports for which free
exchange and international competitive purchasing are particularly advantageous.
This will continue to (1) increase the proportion of raw materials (versus
finished conponents) for which the IDA credit is utilized, aud (2) as a
corollary, increase the share of IDA financed iiports from developing  r tlher
than industrialized, countries.
vii.      Effective use of the IDA credit depends to a large extent on the
operational efficiency of the government institations responsible for
managing foreign exchange funds. The processing of license applications,
information retrieval, and monitoring of license usage, all need improvement
to make the distribution of foreign exchange to industry more effective.



- iii -
viii.     The procurement of imported raw materials is increasingly
being channeled through government trading corporations with the objective
of achieving the benefits of mass purchasing. However, their procurement
procedures could become more efficient and thus lower the cost of raw
materials to the uktimate user. About one-third of the credit is expected
to be used by the trading corporationufor bulk purchase of raw materials;
also their performance, costs and mark-up will be monitored and international
competitive bidding will be applied wl-ere orders exceed US$100,000. As
in past credits, no special procurement procedures would apply for the direct
import of components and spare parts, since individual firms can be relied
on to purchase these items from optimum sources in terms of price, quality
and delivery.
ix.       Tariff preferences do not apply to bulk purchases since it is the
normal procedure of the trading corporations to compare bids on a c.i.f.
price basis. In the case of imports by individual user firms, a 10% tariff
preference on a limited number of articles could influence the buyers' choice,
but many of these articles, such as certain components and parts, have by
their nature somewhat limited sources of supply. Therefore the value of
goods that may be purchased primarily on account of any preference would be
very snall.
The past six industrial import credits have contributed to sub-
ntantial growth in the manufacture of capital goods both for domestic use
and export and have also helped to decrease import dependence at acceptable
economic cost. Ih general, foreign exchange requirements per unit of pro-
duction by IDA-assisted industries have been decreasing while employment
creation has been helped substantially.  Wth the appraisal for the proposed
credit as a base, the Association, in close cooperation with the Indian
Government., intends to study further prospects for the continued improvement
in the export performance of the IDA sectors by introducing new incentives
to increase coat competitiveness and product quality.
xi.       The proposed Seventh Credit of US$75 million will further the
objectives of past industrial import financing and is sound and suitable for
financing by IDA.

1.0.     Since 196L4, the International Development Association (IDA) has
extended six credits to India totaling US$605 rdllion equivalent to import
raw materials, components and spare parts for a number of branches of
manufacturing industry, as shown in the following table:

1.02     Close to 90% of the six credits was allocated to cover part of
the inport requirements for the manufacture of commercial vehicles; automo-
tive ancillaries; cables and wires; fertilizers and pesticides; electrical
equipment; and machine tools, cutting and small tools. The remainder was
used for a nuriber of miscellaneous industries as well as for the import of
some balancing and construction equipment and their spare parts. The
eligible industry categories have varied from 5 in the first credit to 12 in
the fourth and fifth credits dropping to 6 in the most recent credit. All
credits have been fully disbursed.
1.03     In response to a request from the Indian Government, a seventh
credit is now proposed to help cover similar import requirements during the
licensing period April 1, 1972 to March 31, 1973. An IDA mission spent
Nove;ber 1971 in India appraising the performance, outlook and inport needs
;Z the industries assisted in the latest credit plus primary aluminum



and minor additional industries producing power tillers, ball and roller
bearings and an expanded range of electrical equipment (most of them al-
ready included In previous credits). These were among the additions sug-
gested by the Government for inclusion in the credit and were found to be
of high economic priority. Import procedures and relevant institutions
were also reviewed for the purpose of identifying possible measures to
increase institutional efficiency.

II. THE INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
1/
2.01     A number of Bank reports- have analyzed India's industrial sector
in some depth. Based on these reports, a brief history and salient feat..ures
of the country's industrial development are sumiarized in the following para-
graphs in order to place the appraisal in perspective.
A. Historical Summary - 1950 to 1970
2.02     During the years immediately folloving independence, the basic
strategy governing industrial development in India evolved from a seri.e5
of official pronouncements starting with the Industrial Policy Resollition
of 1948. Although there have been shifts in emphasis, the basic thr,' T
of increasing government regulation of, and participation in, industry has
remained unchanged. The strategy which has guided the Second (1955 to 1960),
Third (1961 to 1965) and Fourth (1969 to 1973) Five Year Plans was published
in the Industrial Policy FBsolution of 1956. In order to overcome the dis-
appointing growth record of the post-independence period - when industry
was predominantLy private - and to ensure desired socio-economic development
goals, Government proposed to take a more active role as innovator, regulator
and investor.
2.03     Despite the official biaas, the private sector interpretied +he
Resolution as a positive instrument which, by clearly defining the respectLve
roles of the private and public sectors, provided a new point of departure
and a basis for confidence. A wave of investment followed as both public
and private resources were funneled into the ambitious Second Plan. ITport
licenses were issued liberally, doubling between 1954 and 1957 and tripling
1/ "Economic Situation and Prospects of India" May 10,1972 and May 11, 1971;
"India's Export Prospects", May 27, 1971; "India - A Review of Trends
in Manufacturing Industry"', April 1, 1970.



again between 1957 and 1960. A crisis developed in foreign exchange
followed by the inposition of tightened import controls which have con-
tinued to the present day. To avoid foreign exchange shortages such as the
crisis of 1957-1959, or at least hold them within permissible limits, the
Government decided that even more "self-reliance", i.e., import substitution,
was needed.
2.04      Twenty years of centrally-planned development have created an
industrial base capable of producing relatively sophisticated capital goods
and a broad variety of consumer durables. Average annual industrial growth
in the organized sector (6.6% in the Fifties and 5.8% in the Sixties) has
been higher than the growth of the economry as a whole, which averaged 3 to 4%
during the last two decades. Some industrial sectors, particularly IDA-
financed sectors, have grown at a much higher rate. EBgineering industries,
reflecting major government investment in steel, machine tools, heavy
equipment and electricals grew at a spectacular rate of 20% annually in the
1957 to 1965 period. While two-thirds of the output of manufactured goods
was in consumer products in the early 1950's, with about one-sixth each in
intermediate and capital goods, currently the latter twD have doubled their
shares to one-third each. Manufacturing now accounts for about 18% of GNP,
up £ram 15% in the early 1960's and 13% in 1951.
2 05      Warming signals, however, appeared early in the Sixties. By 1966,
stocks were rising and capacity utilization dropped to 60%. The imbalance
between installed capacity and effective demand was in part attributable to
the severe recesgion of 1965 to 1967 but, even if the economy had continued to
grow at forecast levels, substantial overcapacity would have been likely.
In the public sector, large projects had absorbed major resources but were
painfully slow in construction and start-up. Once operational, moreover,
management of these enterprises experienced prolonged difficulties in aciliev-
ing efficient production. In the private sector also, encouraged by the pro-
tected market, development rebates and tax incentives, investment had been
perhaps excessive (compared to domestic demand) with little concern for effi-
ciency and competitiveness. This led the Government to add export promotion,
complete with substantial incentives, to the import substitution strategy.
2.06      Export promotion efforts have been rewarded with a high rate
of growth in engineering exports which increased between 1966 and 1968 by
about 40% to US$55 million. By FY1970/71 they had jumped another 180% to
US$155 million and in FY1971/72 to US$180 million.  While performance has
been impressive, exports stfll account for only about 5% of India's gross
production of engineering goods. The broad system of underlying incentives
including cash bonuses ranging up to 25% of f.o.b. value, tax benefits, import
duty drawbacks and special replanishment licenses (Annex 13 ), helped Indian
products to compete at world prices. Aa a means of offsetting comparatively
high domestic taxes - a major component of the domestic price structure - the
export incentive program is justifiable and, indeed, necessary.  If, in additi:-.,



- 4 -
other appropriate adjustments are made to convert financial costs to true
economic costs, many engineering industries are competitive internationally.
Given India's inherent comparative advantages - entrepreneurial talent,
abundant technical expertize, skilled workers and low labor wage rates - the
current level of exports is still only a fraction of the full potential which
could be attained by more emph'asis on productivity, efficiency and cost
reduction. IDA finance of imports at world prices can contribute to achieving
these broad objectives, but if the effects of IDA assistance are to be a.Xl-
mized, some reassessment of established policy and procedures affecting industrial
performance would appear to be advisable, particularly in increasing insti-
tutional efficiency and reducing protection for indigenous industry so that
a trend towards a system more responsive to "market" forces can develop.
B. Recent Developments
2.07      The Fourth Plan, initiated in FY1969/70, projects a modest OLNP
growth target of 5.5% per annum, but actual performance suggests 5% in
1970 and even less (between 4 to 5%) in 1971. Therefore, althougn GNP
improved after the depression years, investment in real terms contract0d
during the period 1965 through 1968 as net external aid and domestic saviy'gs
both declined. Considering the gestation period between investment and pro-
duction., the failure to reach the growth targets in FY1969/70 and sUDsequent
years is understandable in retrospect.  With the uncertainty in the ei%er3  of
future external aid, growth may continue to be somewhat depressed in the
immediate years ahead.
2.08      Industrial growth during the Fourth Plan was projected at 6 to L1%,,
almost double the target set for the entire economy.  Performance, however,
has not been up to expectations. Industrial growth appears to have droppedJ
to about 3.5% in calendar 1971 after only a fair performance in F        '7P
when growth was 6 to 7%. This disguises the great unevenness among ;7,     cv; i,
In F1970/71, output of basic  etallurgical industries declined, , te
-5%, copper -5% and lead -33%. Aludtmnrs., the one exception, grew by 21%.  Cotten
textiles dropped by about 8% over the bane period, but other con&rumer products
such as radios and household appliarces snowed sizeable increases. '3ugar
production dropped by 13.6% in the first half of 1971;  other agro-based
industries such as edible oils also declined. CerTain categories of engineerirng
products - machine tools, tracvors arad commercial vehicl.es -  continue& to
shaw good growth. Steel, terciles and .nugar together represent more iiah
one-third of the industri.i poductin index an' their declines neutral ized
the better perfcrnance of . efar larger nroriber of more dynanic thon,> w.:L _er
sectors.  In fact, if       -cs> e -SacLols are 1Kt cut of the calcvlationl, the
remaining two-thirds of v};e        C2rial n1rodiuction index had a growth rate of
5.5% in 1971, though still well below the target of 8 to !0%.
2.09      With some industries LpressecL and otxers, including tthe IDA sec--
tors, maintaining good growth, generalizations as to the reasons for low
average performance woulo cbe rCsk.  Certai½ factors undoubtedly act as
general depressants - cumerrscme co  ro s and institutional inertia., for
example - but these are no t rnew arc, mn f.act are probably less constrain-
ing today than in the past. The drop in steel production of Ff1970/71 is



- 5 -
considered by most observers as a major cause of the decline. Other deter-
rents commonly blamed are credit restrictions, labor unrest and private sec-
tor uncertainty.  In the priority sectors, however, the general constraints
apparently fade in importance as evidenced by the generally buoyant growti
rates of the IDA sectors. Certain sections of the capital goods industry,
heavily dependent on public sector investment, have been adversely affected
by cutbacks in expected budgetary allocations. Heavy industrials have been
particularly hard hit.
2.10      Capital goods have traditionally led the industrial sector in
response to the demand created by.public investment which averaged 25 to 3C0
of total manufacturing investment between 1958 and 1970. The current low
level of public investment in this sector is unlikely to rebound in the
near future because (1) external aid commitments are uncertain (2) domestic
savings accruing as taxes will at best not be sufficient to close the aid gap
and (3) priorities have shifted to the rural and small industry sectors.
Export may eventually offset low dometic demand to some extent but building
a significant eWport market for heavy industrials, unlike light manufactured
goods, will be a long and slow process. The iwmediate outlook therefore is
not encouraging. The decline in demand attributable to the decline in avail-
able. funds for public sector investment appears to be a problem with no ob-
mious short term solutions in sight.
2.11      The preceding analysis suggests that promotion of industrial ex-
ports should be one of the highest priority objectives in India's strategy.
Export increases of non-traditional (industrial) products during the first
two years of the current plan have been encouraging, but it must be remembered
that the starting base was very low. In the future, intensified promotional
effortB could yield only limited increments in export sales if production costs
runain at the present generally high level. As discussed in para.4.11 and Annex 13
export replenishment entitlements (REP s) are a valuable incentive but because
even these licenses arewvith few exceptions, controlled to prevent irmports
which compete with indigenous components, regardless of price, they can
make only a very linited contribution to cost reduction of finished products.
In para.4.12another form of incentive licensing is discussed which could
stimulate cost reduction.

III.   THE IDA FINANCED INDUSTRIES AND THE SEVENTE CREDIT
A. Review of the First through the Sixth Credit
3.01      Since 1964, IDA has approved six industrial import credits to
India (Annex 1).  An shown in the table in para. 1.01, the proceeds of these
credits assisted a gradually increasing number of branches of industry, until
the most recent Sixth Credit (which was 40% smaller than the Fifth), when
IDA-assisted sectors were cut back to the following: commercial vehicles;
agricultural tractors; automotive ancillaries; :;achine tools, cutting and
small tools, abrasives; electric motors; fertilizers and pesticides.
3.02      All six credits had as their objectives increased availability of
imported raw materials, spares and camponents at internationally competitive
prices to assist selected industries in utilizing idle capacity and increasing
cost competitiveness.   IDA funds plus other substantial additions to India's
foreign exchange resources also made it possible for the Government to con-
sider relaxing the established system of rigid import controls.   This
occurred in 1966 when a far-reaching import liberalization program was
implemented covering 59 priority industries, including all of the IDA sectors.
While exact quantification of the benefits derived from both tne IDA credits
and import liberalization cannot be made, there is no doubt that they have
contributed to increased production, improved competitiveness and, indirectly,
to export growth.
3.03      Procurement under the credits has been spread over 54 countries
(Annex 2).   The sources have become more diversified as components tied to
specific suppliers located primarily in the more advanced countries have
given way increasingly to basic raw materials.   To illustrate, in the First
Credit 84% of the funds were spent in the U.K., West Germany and the U.S.
while only 57% of the Sixth Credit was spent in these three countries.
The shift has been towards a wider group of developed but also develo;ing
countries.
3.04      In the Sixth Credit, the  iImited eligibility of sectors facilillated
more intensive appraisal than in earlier credits*  TDA sectoral allocations
were reinstated as an indicative guide reflecting IDA's assessment o.7 sectoral
priorities and foreign exchange needs.   The allocation for imports for
fertilizers and pesticides, however, were limited to US $15 million to
prevent a disproportionate share of the total credit from accruing to these
two sub-sectors.
3.05      The Sixth Credit, approved on April 24, 1970, was expected to be
fully disbursed by the erid of March ;971, out this occurred only in Jaeuary
1972, as shown below:

3.06      Actual import licenses for foreign exchange allocations from
all sources including IDA during the period April 1970 to March 1971 are
compared with estimates made during the appraisal in the following table:

Total           173.0       136.4       75.0       65.9
3.07      This table indicates that total actual licenses have been more
than previous estimates except for fertilizers and pesticides.   Therefore,
the slower than estimated disbursement of the Sixth Credit and the changes
in allocations among the sectors are not very significant and can be
ascribed to a somewhat higher availability of alternative foreign exchange
sources, bi-lateral and others.   Increased availability of non-IDA
exchange probably resulted from lower than expected production and, there-
fore, import needs of other industrial sectors.   More importantly, the
changes appear to be a response to the need to allocate and utilize IDA
funds preferentially in those import requirements wherein free converti-
bility brings about lowest cost imports.
B. Choice of Sectors under the Seventh Credit
3.08      The purpose of this appraisal is to select high priority branches
of industry in which the proceeds of the proposed credit could be used
efficiently and yield the maxinmm benefit.
3.09      The Indian Government had requested broadening of the eligible
list of sectors from 6 to 14. Difficulties were encountered in attemptiL,L
to rank them within a general rationale of priority and to determine the



-8-
appropriate cut-off point.   While some degree of arbitrariness cannot
altogether be avoided, the following criteria were adopted in testing, as
objectively as possible, the suitability of a sector for inclusion under
the credit:
- Linkage to high priority sectors, defined as - products
for agriculture, electrical, transport and metal working
industries
- Potential for rapid increase in production through utili-
zation of idle capacity, improved efficiency and lower
production cost
- Potential for export growth, and
- Need for untied foreign exchange.
3.10      Of the additional sectors suggested by the Government, power
tillers, transformers and switchgear, magnetic steel stampings, ball and
roller bearings and aluminum were deemed appropriate under these criteria.
Power tillers, also called "walking tractors", are part of the tractor
sector; transformers, switchgear and magnetic steel stampings are closely
associated with motors and often produced in the same plants; ball bearings
are closely linked to most of the priority sectors.   Only aluminum smelting
is a new sector and its past performance and prospects, as for the other
sectors, is analyzed in paras. 3.38 to 3.13.
3.11      Sectors recommended under the Seventh Credit are:
- Products for Agriculture: Tractors and Power Tillers;
Fertilizers; and Pesticides
- Electrical Equipment: Motors, Transformers, Switchgea.
and Magnetic Steel Stampings; and Aluminum Smeltikig
-Transport Equipment: Commercial Vehicles; and Automotive
Anclllaries
- Metal Working Zquipamnt: Machine, Cutting, Small Tools,
Abrasives, Ball and Roller Bearings,
3.12      The other industries suggested by the Government but not inciuided
in the recommended list of eligibility were steel pipe and tubing, as -well
as antimony and zinc smelting, since 'they appeared to be of lower priority.
Very substantial investment in steel production nas been made and steel pipe
and tuoing are among the products that will be in good supply when the
management and maintenance problems of that ind<ustry are solved.   Transient
shortages can be met, it was felt, through bilaxeral credits.   There is
only one relatively small antimony smelter in India producing and selling
well above world prices.  IDA finance of its imports would not have more



- 9 -
than a marginal effect on cost reduction.   There are two zinc smelters
in India, one private and one public.   The former imports concentrate
partly from its foreign partner and the balance from Australia.   IDA
finance, it was concluded, could not contribute significantly to cost
competitiveness in the private smelter and might have only a marginal
effect in the public sector plant.
C.  Appraisal of IDA Assisted Sectors
1.   General
3.13          The sector reviews which follow are summarized fron the
detailed analyses made during appraisaL For each sector, a brief descrip-
tion is given of its structure, past growth and outlook with emphasis on
export possibilities and any major problems that might exist, followed by
an estimate of import needs and suggested IDA allocations.   Additional
statistical data on the IDA sectors is given in annexes detailing production
(Annex 3); installed capacity (4); capacity utilization (5); exports
by product (6);  and exports by regions (7);  employment (87;  raw
naterial prices (9); number of oonpanies  (10);  foreign exchange re-
Qairements (11); foreign exchange content rT2); and Government export
;assistance (Tx).
3.14      The table on the following page summarizes some past and future
performance indices of the IDA assisted sectors under three headings --
production, exports and capacity utilization.   Although Indials industry
in 1969 was just emerging from a general recession, most IDA sectors have
indeed had growth rates during the period 1969 to 1971 much in excess of
the average growth of industry as a whole.   While exports are still rela-
tively small, in a few sectors such as electrical equipment, commercial
vehicles and machine tools as well as cutting and small tools the proportion
of exports has come close to 10% of total production, about double the rate
for engineering goods generally.
3.15      Production, estimated for FY 1971/72 and projected for FY 1972/73,
is in most cases expected to reflect a somewhat slower growth rate than in
the 1969 to 1971 period, but there are notable exceptions such as in tractors,
power tillers and fertilizers.   Capacity utilization will lag for some of
the products.   However, these figures should be interpreted with caution
because in India industrial capacity is generally expressed on a two-shift
basis and new capacity is included statistically as a full year regardless
of the month in which it starts producing.   There are of course a few
products such as fertilizers and aluminum which, for technical reasons,
have to be produced continuously on a 3-shift basis.

3.16      On the whole, the products of the IDA-financed sectors are still
fairly high priced compared with the C.I.F. import prices of similar products.
In some cases, the local prices are 50 to 100% higher, but a more representa-
tive figure, by eliminating a few extreme cases, may be 25 to 35%.  However,
if adjusted input prices, reflecting real economic cost are used, the pic-
ture is somewhat more encouraging.  On this basis, in the machine tool
sector, for example, the economic cost is about 9% lower than the actual
financial costs.  Similar results are obtained after adjusting costs of
production for electric motors, commercial vehicles, and automobile ancilla-
ries.   Some of the important reasons for high financial costs are -- high
cost of material inputs either because of high local costs or substantial
duties on imports (Annex 9); high taxes; in some sectors, undue prolifera-
tion of plants with sub-economic capacities; deficiencies in product design
and management.
2.  Products for Agriculture
a.  Tractors and Power Tillers
3.17      The tractor fleet in India increased from 54,000 in FY 1966/67,
the first year of IDA allocations to this sector, to an estimated 160,000
in FY 1971/72.  Domestic assembly and manufacture of tractors, initiated
irn the early 1960's reached an annual production rate of 9,000 in FY 1966/67,
:zsing to about 20,000 in FY 1970/71, or an annual growth of over 20% during
the four year period.  Production in Fr 1971/72, however, decreased to
about 16.,000 primarily because of labor troubles and a four month shut-
down in the plant of a leading producer (TAFE).  Despite the excellent
growth rate of indigenous production, imports have been substantial --
10,500 units in FY 1969/70, 16,000 in Fl 1970/71 and 15,400 in Fl 1971/72.
3.18      Three firms -- TAFR, International Tractor, and Escorts -- account
for over 85% of indigenous production; the residual 15% is produced by two
firms -- Eicher and Hindustan Tractors.  Total installed capacity as of
March 1971 was 26,800 units.  With expansion projects approved in existing
plants plus completion of two or three approved new plants, installed
capacity in FY 1972/73 may reach 54,000 to 58,000.  Another 4 or 5 new
plants have been licensed and some of them may be in production by FY1973/74
or FY 1974/75.  The models manufactured range from 26.5 to 50 H.P. and a
typical tractor contains 15 to 20% by value of imported components, 50 to 70%
of locally purchased components and parts anld 10 to 35% value added in the
tractor plant.  Approximately 6,000 are employed in this industry.
3.19      There is great unevenness in effective demand for the different
tractor brands.  TAFE (Massey Fergus'on) has a substantial backlog of
orders and waiting periods for delivery of upto 2 years.  i subsidiary
of Escorts has been assembling CKDts (complete knockdown units) of Polish
origin and more recently has begun the production of Ford models, although
sales of the latter have been sluggish and production has been cut back.



- 12 -
International Tractor and Eicher also appear to be encountering consumer
resistance and their stocks of finished tractors are high.   There is no
clear explanation for the selective preference displayed by farmers other
than perhaps brand consciousness.   Price is not a factor, since comparable
models are sold at about the same price (as fixed by the Government).
The 5 competing 35 H.P. models ranged in price in FY 1970/71 from Rs 24,100
to Rs 26,300, with the highest priced unit (TAFE) enjoying the strongest
market.
3.20      Prices of local tractors have generally varied between 15 and 20%
higher than equivalent imports, C.I.F.   In June, 1971, however, a new
situation was created by the imposition of a 30% import duty and a 10g
excise tax applied to both imports and domestic production.   Imported
tractors, as a result, rose in price by 43% and today, adjusting for cost
escalation in exporting countries, are about 50 to 60% higher in price than
a year or two ago.   Local tractors have been granted price increases of
23 to L2% but today, despite these increases and the excise tax, can be
delivered to the farmer at 10 to 20% less than imported tractors.   It
remains to be seen whether the current price advantage for indigenous tractors
will affect farmer preferences (which traditionally have favored imports)
and therefore improve sales of the less popular domestic brands.
3.21      Since the recent sharp increases in both imported and indigenous
tractor prices, sales trends have shown that demand is highly price elastic.
Therefore, it is more prudent to revise the FY 1973/74 demand estimate down-
ward to 40,000, from industry forecasts of 50,000 and Government projections
of 100,000 units.   Comparing this forecast with the projected installed
capacity of perhaps 58,000 (para. 3.18) in FY 1972/73, plus up to four or
five more new plants possibly cming into production by FY 197L/75, a
serious imbalance appears to be rapidly approaching.
3.22      Manufacture of power tillers i. a new industry with recent pro-
duction levels of up to 800 units annually expected to increase to 2,000
in FY 1972/73.   Upto 1971, only one plant was in production when a second
entered the market and one or two more are expected to start up shortly.
These small "walking tractors" should fill the gap between bullocks and
smaller standard tractors for plots of 10 to 25 acres.   However, farmer
acceptance has been slow probably due to its relaaively high price.   The
basic unit,plus essential attacnments, sold in 1971 for Rs 11,300 or almost
half the price of the smallest available standard tractor (20 H.P.), It
is likely that the recent sharp increases in tractor prices will induce
a more lively demand for power tillers.
3.23      Imports of components, though no- the smalLer requirements of
raw materials for the tractor and power tiller industry, are generally tied
to foreign co_llaborators in Western nations Where bilateral credits are
often available.   The flexibility offered by DA funds is limited in
application to purchase of the raw materials needed.   It is therefcre
proposed that under the Seventh Credit, of a total projected import need of
US $12.2 million and US $0.8 million respectively for the production of
tractors and power tillers, I9A contribute only TJS $3 million, or 23% of
the foreign exchange requirements.

3.24      Some discrepancies are apparent in the structure of the industry,
consumer preferenoes and the contradiction between realistAc projections
of demand and licensed capacity.   Much more analysis appears to be needed
to isolate and define the production, price and marketing problems and to
assess the extent to which future IDA credits may usefully be employed in
assisting the sector to improve overall performance.   During negotiations,
therefore, it was agreed that tractor production in India would be the
object of an intensive study during the early months of the disbursement
period. This should help the Govemment and IDA in planning and implementing
future assistance-tb this industry.
b.   Fertilizers
3.25      The past growth, present situation and prospects of India's
fertilizer industry have been described in detail for both nitrogenous and
phosphatic fertilizers in two recent IDA appraisal reportsi/ and this sector
is therefore treated only briefly in this report.   Despite its high
priority and the substantial resources allocated to developing indigenous
production, the industry has consistently lagged behind planned targets
and demand.   Consumption from a low base increased at rates of 30% per
annum up to FY 1967/68, but since then the growth rate has decreased to
'7l for nitrogen (N) and perhaps 18 to 20% for phosphate (P205).  During
the early high growth period, only some 30% of nitrogenous fertilizers
consumed was produced domestically, but has been rising to slightly over
50% since FY 1967/68.   Annual shortfalls in production have been made up
through imports of finished fertilizers.   The solution to the imbalance
lies in (1) improving capacity utilization of existing facilities, (2) com-
pleting plants under construction more quickly, and (3) constructing
additional facilities.
3.26      Production, consumption and imports of N and P20q fertilizers over
the past two years (FY's 1969/70 and 1970/71), estimates for FY 1971/72 and
projectiona for ni972773 and Ffl9Yh475- are shownnih the following table:

The estimated increase in nitrogen production in FY 1971/72 of 27% is
primarily due to better utilization of existing capacity and the contribution
of one new plant (IEL, Kanpur).   In January, 1972, the industry was reported
to be operating at an annual rate of 1.2 million tons of N, even though two
plants which had been expected to be operational in 197i had experienced
further delays.   The increase of 43% in P205 production for FY 1971/72
reflects the expected contribution of the Madras Fertilizer Ltd. plant at
Madras which came on stream in July/August 1971.
3.27      Capacity utilization of all plants has averaged only about 60%
of installed capacity in recent years, but is projected to increase to 70%
in FY 1972/73.   Some improvement can be expected as the two new plants
approach design output and six more under construction are completed and
attain full production in the period 1972 to 1974.   The older plants,
however, are constrained by persistent maintenance problems, outmoded
production processes and production breakdowns.   There are 40,000 people
employed directly in fertilizer manufacture.
3.28      Import requirements of raw materials -- rock phosphate, sulfur
and potash primarily -- plus maintenance parts and materials have been in-
creasing at a rate of about 15% per annum and are projected by Government
at Rs 475 million (US $63 million) for FY 1972/73.  Therefore an increase
from approximately US $12 million to US $14 million appears to be Justified
in view of the very high priority of this industry.   The proposed IDA
credit is important here since some of the more favorable raw material
sources are LDC's which cannot finance their exports with bilateral credits.
3.29      There does not appear, at present, to be any real shortage of
imported spares and components; apparently the pipeline has aeen filled.
The maintenance problems, particularly in the Government plants, are a
result of inadequate planning and supervision of routine maintenance and
repair.
c.   Pesticides
3.30      Domestic formulation of pesticides from imported technical grade
materials started in the late forties &id by 1957P domestic manufacture of
technical pesticides (DDT and BHC) had begun.   Since then, production
growth has paralleled increasing consumption fa±r_y closely.   Import.3 of
technical pesticides have been minor and generally limited to specialties
not available domestically.   Following the withdrawal of Government price
subsidies in 1968, consumption stagnated temporar4l y but intensive marketing
efforts since have achieved growing awareness of the need for, and benefits
of, planned application of pesticides, and consuption has risen ra iidly in
the last two years.   Overa-l. thibi has resulted in one of the fastest
growing industries in 1-naia with production increasing at an annual rate oG
20% from 12,000 tons in F'Y i965/66 to 30,000 tons in rY 1970/71. Expectations
are that in FY 1972/73 production and consumption will have reached 40,000
tons.   There are 43 firms in the organized sector of which 36 produce --
and some of them also formulate -- technical pesticides and 7 are formulators
only.



- i5 -
3.31      Capacity utilization has improved steadily -- from 50% in
FY 1967/68 to close to 80% in FY 1970/71 -- reflecting the recent and
continued resurgence of consumption.   As of March 1971, installed capacity
for technical pesticides was 38,000 tons and an additional 40,000 tons
have been approved either by licenses or letters of intent to meet fore-
cast growth.
3.32      Output in FY 1970/71 was valued at over Rs 250 million (US $33.3
million), of which 25to3C0 corresponds to the cost of imported raw materials.
Product prices are generally competitive with world prices.   Occasional
exports have been effected to Eastern European countries, but in view of
the recent recovery in domestic demand, exportable surpluses may not arise
for some time.   Over the long term, however, as the industry matures,
significant exports may well become feasible.
3.33      IDA assistance is predicated on (1) the importance of this sector
in agricultural growth, (2) the need to minimize cost of production through
optimal purchases of raw materials and (3) the long range export potential.
Total import needs in FY 1972/73, including spare parts, are estimated at
US $10 million.   An IDA allocation of US $4 million, or 40% of total
requirements, is proposed.
3.   Electrical Equipment
a.  Motors, Transformers, Switchgear and Magnetic Steel Stampings
3.34      The Seventh IDA credit will include besides electric motors
(included in the Sixth Credit) transformers, switchgear and magnetic steel
stampings.   These four categories cover the majority of the range of
products used in the power sector consuming similar raw materials and often
produced in the same factories.   Only the import requirements of units
below 33 KV, which fall outside the procurement scope of Bank Group power
transmission projects, are here considered.
3.35      Though published production figures for the industry do not as
yet reflect any definite production downtrend, recent monthly statistics
compiled by the Indian Electric Manufacturers Association (IEMA) show a
weakening of demand both in industry and agriculture.   The following table
summarizes the recent performance of the electrical industry and its short
term prospects:

The expected dip in production in FY 1971/72 may have fallen even lower if the
trend already noted by IEKA had persisted. In FY 1972/73, however, production
is expected to recover, although only moderately above the FY 1970/71 levels.
Capacity is measured on a 2-shift schedule and, on this basis, utilization
in the industry has been about 50% throughout the past six years.   Only a
few plants are operating more than one shift and in those cases it was only
a partial second shift.   Even at this low production level, however, it is
a major industrial employer with an estimated total in 1970 of 108,000
people.
3.36      Generally, India's electrical products are not competitive in the
world market because of high cost of materials, and outmoded and unnecessarily
heavy designs.  However, exports began in FY 1968/69 and have since
increased markedly with government assistance that enables manufacturers
to sell FOB at prices 30 to 60% below domestic prices.   The export target
for FY 1973/74 set by the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) is
Rs 100 million (US $13 million).   This is not an overly ambitious target
and should be attainable.   Although there seems to be little profit in
export, despite the various forms of cash assistance, it serves to fill
idle capacity and earn special import licenses (REPis - see Annex 13).
With the large domestic market as a base, potential economies of scale and
design modernization could eventually stimulate the emergence of electrical
products as one of India's leading export-oriented engineering industries.
IDA finance of imports in this sector contributes to cost-minimizing. This
in turn benefits (1) the top-priority agriculture sector Where irrigation
and general rural electrification needs represent the largest part of the
total market and (2) the build-up of export markets.
3.37      Major requirements for foreign exchange are for copper, CRGO
(magnetic) steel sheets and insulating materials.   Magnetic steel sheets
for motors are produced domestically but are not expected to be in adequate
supply until the Rourkela plant attains its targeted production.   Tn the
case of transformers, imported copper and CRGO sheets account for 50% of tVlhe
total cost.   For motors, distribution transformers, switchgear aLd m;agnetic
steel stampings, the import needs in FY 1972/73 are estimated to  xe U.S $30
million.   An appropriate IDA allocation would be US $7 million or 23% of
total imports.
b.  Aluminum Smelting
3.38      The industry ha8 made spectacular progress in recent years wirh
production of primary aluminum up from 69,000 tons in FY 1965/66 to 170,000
tons in FY 1970/71.   Existing capacity is divided among four smelters, all
privately owned, employing 17,000 persons directly.   The industry is now
operating at virtually 100% of capacity.   Existing producers are planning
to increase their capacity gradually to about 278,000 tons by FY 1971175 at
which time one additional smelter (Bharat Aluminum, a public sector plant)
is expected to go on stream with an installed capacity of 150,000 per year.



-  17  -
Although consumption has also been growing rapidly in India, it can be
expected to reach only some 330,000 tons in FY 1974/75, a year in which the
installed capacity may total 428,000 tons.   Primary production may not
be more than 280,000 tons in that year, however, since normal start-up
complications can be expected to reduce the output of new facilities.
3.39      Production, cocnsumption and exports of aluminum during the recent
past and through FY 1974/75 are summarized below:

J'/  Excluding secondary recovery which normally adds about 10% to
total production.
L/ Including extrusions, semi-fabricated and fabricated products.
in YL 1971/72, domestic demand of 205,000 tons was expected te be met by the
30,000 tons of primary aluminum, 15,000 tons of secondary metal (recovered
scrap), and 10,000 tons of' imports.   Since primary production is forecast
to increase to about 200,000 tons in FY 1972/73 and secondary metal production
to 20,000 tons, import requirements should remain about the same as in the
previous year.  However, by F2  1974/75, the need to import will have passed
and a small excess developed for export.  Thia will grow as production in-
creases after start up difficulties are overcome.
3.40      The economic recession of the mid-1960's induced manufacturers
in this sector to actively seek foreign markets and export growth was rapid,
reaching US $21 million of' mainly semi-fabricated and finished products in
Fr 1968/69.   However, rising domestic conuamption and limited growth in
production capacity reduced aluminum exports in FY 1970/71 to about US $10
million, while primary aluminum was being imported as stated above.
Significant increases in exports canot be expected again until after the
substantial rise in capacity in the mid-1970'so   If planned capacity and
production growth are realized, starting about Fr 197576, exportable suar-
pluses may appear and rise in the late seventies to a peakt of some 30,000
to 40,000 tons which, in a mix of primary, semi-fabricated and fabricated
forms, represents a potential foreign exchange inflow of Us $40to a0 million
per year e
3.4i,     The ex-works price of aluminum in India was (late 1971) Rs 3,970
per ton (US 24 cents per lb.), excluding excise duty, while world market
prices were about US 22-23 cents per lb., a level somewhat below normal
due to temporary over-capacity.   Indian aluminum is clearly competitive
internationally, despite relatively high power cost and not very dependable
power supply.   If cost-competitiveness is maintained, there should be no
problem in realizing the future potential export earnings indicated in para.3.40.



- 18 -
3.h2      Raw materials represent about 50% of the cost of production and it
is in this area that the IDA Credit can play an important role.   Bauxite,
the basic and major raw material, is available in India with adequate proven
and probable reserves.   Indigenous production, however, can meet only part
of the need of other essential raw materials -- calcined petroleum coke,
cryolite, aluminum fluoride, fluorspar, pitch and caustic soda.   IDA
foreign exchange will help producers to import at the most favorable prices
and terms, and assure regular supplies.
3.43      In view of aluminum's importance to power distribution growth (half
of India's aluminum goes into power cables), its high value added based on
an indigenous natural resource (bauxite) and its potential as a basic earner
of foreign exchange, the industry meets the adopted IDA priority criteria.
The total import need for FY 1972/73 is likely to reach US $10 million and
an IDA contribution of US $3 million is proposed.
4.   Transport Equipment and Ancillaries
a.   Commercial Vehicles
3.44      Although small by western standards, the Indian market for commer-
cial vehicles is the largest in Asia next to Japan.   The fleet has grown
more than fourfold between 1951 and 1971 -- from 128,000 to 530,000.   Since
the mid-fifties only domestically produced vehicles can be marketed in Inria.
Policies encouraging import substitution and the huge (but still largelV
unsatisfied) market potential have led to the installation of 4 heavy trnick
and bus manufacturers and 5 light commercial vehicle manufacturers sharing
an installed capacity of 84,000 units and employing about 60,000 oersone.
In FY 1971/72, they were operating at 74% of capacity, up from 67% in
F! 1968/69.   The relatively low average capacity utilization disguises,
however, the uneven performance of individual companies.   Two maJor truck
and bus manufacturers -- Telco and Ashok Leyland -- who together account 'or
72% of the industry's production have been operating at close to or above
installed capacity with order backlogs of 4-u months.   Their plants are
well managed and their products are of high quality.
3.45      Hindustan Motors, Premier Automobile and other smaller plants for
light trucks, jeeps and three-wheelers, on the other hand, nave suffered poor
market acceptance because of quality problems, inappropriaJ.e models (wrong
size and underpowered), inadequate service, misjudgement of markets and
management deficiencies.   They are taking steps to improve products and
services, however, and with the rapid growth of road transport have an oppor-
tunity to increase sales and capacity utilization.   At the present time.
low capacity utilization is clearly selective and caused more by poor
management and operations in specific plants than by the commonly bliamed
external factors such as shortages of steel, raw materials or a general
lack of demand.

j/  Assuming same proportion of exports/production is in Fr 1972/73.
Trucks and buses account for about 85% of the sector's gross product value.
Current installed capacity for trucks and buses of 58,000 units/year is
expected to increase to 74,000 in FY 1975/76 by which time it is anticipated
that production will rise to about 62,000 units, not including vehicles for
defence purposes which are primarily produced by other special factories.
Exports have grown from a negligible amount four years ago to about US $21
million in FY 1970/71, and are expected to increase further as shown above.
Twenty countries including Egypt, Ceylon, Yugoslavia, Nigeria and Iraq, form
the export market.   Export value of commercial vehicles was 13.3% of total
exported engineering goods in FY 1970/71, up from 8.9% a year earlier.
3.47      Exports of commercial vehicles are almost entirely generated by
three leading firms: Telco, Ashok Leyland, and Mahindra & Mahindra. In
view of the growing domestic market as well as increasing competition from
well-established international firms, export growth may not be as buoyant
in the future as in the past.   Moreover, compared to the profitability from
domestic sales, exports yield lower returns to the manufacturers.   They are
in the export business primarily in response to Government pressure to earn
foreign exchange since even with various forms of assistance, profit margins
are lower.   To illustrate, domestic and export prices of a Telco 7 1/2 ton
truck are compared below:

3.48      Among the problems and constraints most often cited by the
industry as adversely affecting cost of production and performance are
excessive taxation; high cost, deficient quality and outmoded design of
some indigenous components; steel shortages; difficulties and delays
in obtaining licenses for key imported parts; and plant capacities which,
even in the context of Indian wage rates, appear in many cases to be
below the levels necessary to achieve economies of scale.   IDA credits
have contributed to solving to some extent the steel shortage and imported
parts problems, but the overall beneficial effects are muted because of
the other constraints.
3.49      Imported raw materials, primarily special steels but also inclu-
ding some components and parts, account for about 20% of gross product
value and the balance in indigenous consisting of components supplied by
the ancillary industry (50 to 60%) and value added by the vehicle manufac-
turer (20 to 30%).   Import requirements in FY 1972/73 are projected at
US $42 million -- US $30 million for materials and US $12 million for parts.
The industry's importance in transport and export earnings and the need to
keep costs at a minimum justify IDA assistance.   The suggested allocations
are 33% of total raw material requirements,or US$9.9 million, and a mich
lower proportion (10%) of total components and spare parts requirements,
or US$1.2 million; since these can be partially purchased with bilateral
funds without serious cost penalty.   This totals US $11 million (rounded)
equivalent to an average IDA component of 26% of total raw material, com-
ponents and parts.
3.50      For a number of reasons, the commercial vehicle sector appears to
be particularly appropriate for the same type of intensive review proposed
for tractors (para. 3.2h).   Its current size and importance and even
greater potential for growth as a supplier to the domestic and export
markets are evident.   The fact that three of the manufacturers are operating
near full capacity and are already building export markets despite the
constraints mentioned in para. 3.48 indicates that, with 'udicious measures
aimed at cost-reduction -- especially in purchase of ancillaries which
constitute 50 to 60% of total cost -- and improved efficiency in the
industry as a whole, more buoyant growth could be generated tnan is now
anticipated.   During negotiations, it was agreed that commercial vehicles
and tractors should be considered simultaneously in an intensive sectcor
review which will help define more clearly the problems and their solution.
b.   Automotive Ancillaries
3.51      One of the more impressive accomplishments of the import substi-
tution drive of the fifties is the automotive ancillary (parts, components,
and sub-assemblies) indusTry, whtch now supplies 50 to 60% of t'the gross
product value of motor vehicles and tractors manufactured in the country.
Two hundred firms in the organized sector and 300 in the small industry
sector produce over 4,000 different products and employ about 100,000
persons.   The majority of the licensed firms benefit from collaboration



- 21 -
agreements with well known foreign firms and their products generally
meet international quality standards, though they are often of older design
than in advanced countries.   The products of the small industry sector
on the other hand clearly require quality upgrading.
3.52      Output has doubled in the last five years and another doubling
i3 likely in the next 6 to 7 years.   Capacity utilization averages 80%
but is uneven, with many of the larger, better-managed firms operating at
100% of capacity or close to it.   The industry accounts for 15.4% of
gross product value of all engineering industries in the organized sector
and 6.3% of all industry.  Production and exports since 1968, including
projections for the coming years, are swnarized below:

Production      310.0        460.0       514.0       580.0        730.0
Exports           10.0        18.0        20.5        23.0         29.0
3.53      Under Government pressure to export 5% of output, the industry
;, with the marketing assistance of foreign collaborators, achieved quite
sizeable exports particularly when related to the low level only a few
years back -- US $0.7 million in FY 1964/65.  Over 70 countries are
importing Indian automotive ancillaries including Egypt, West Germany
(fuel injection units), Ceylon, Singapore, Yugoslavia, Nigeria and Iran.
Export sales are made at prices ranging from 25 to 50% under domestic
prices.
3~.54     On the whole, domestic prices are high although there is con-
siderable variation among individual companies.  Material costs are high,
low productivity neutralizes much of the advantage afforded by Indiass low
wage rates and relatively high profits accrue to manufacturers of these
intermediary products, a sector which is somewhat less conspicuous than
large capital goods.  Generally, volume is still too small to generate
the economies of large scale production.   The diverse and dispersed
nature of these products, make them difficult to study and to identify
problems and possible improvements.  Yet their large input to the vehicle,
tractor and, similarly, to other compound products -- electrical equipment
and machine tools -- emphasizes the need to induce efficiency, productivity
and competition.   To this end the Government has recently increased licensi,._
of several local firms making the same product.  A further possibility is
contemplated in para. 4.12 which introduces selective pressure on the less
cost-competitive intermediate goods producers from other more efficient local
producers serving the same end product.
3.55      However, growth is encouraging and IDA assistance to meet import
requirements contributes to reducing costs.   Imports for FY 1972/73 are
expected to total US $54 million and an IDA component of US $20 million, or
37% of the total, is proposed.

5.  Metal Working Equipment:  Machine, Cutting and Small Tools,
Abrasives, Ball and Roller Bearings
3.56      These related articles are used mainly to manufacture various
metal products, or incorporated in capital goods and consumer durables.
Average production, imports, exports and appar-ent consumption as a whole,
though variations exist, are given in the following table:

Machine, Cutting and Small ToDls, Abrasives and Ball Bearings

Plus Imports        50.8        29.5           33.6        34.1

Consumption       124_0        145.6          t63.0       175.9
3.57      During the period 1969 to 1971, annual growth of output was 3 3
in machine tools, 45% in ball and roller bearings, and 16% in cutting and
small tools and abrasives.   Imports of machine tools were reduced by about
40% during the same period but still represent about 20% of domestic con-
sumption.   Although declining as a share of consumption, imports of bearings
are still sizeable and exports are small.   In tools, exports (principally
hand tools) have expanded at 23% per year, and imports are small and limited
to specialized items.   (This reduces overall imports from 41% three years
ago to 20% of current consumption).   This is a major achievement and
import substitution has now reached a point when the rate of reduction
of imports can be expected to slow.   However, output will continue its rap4id
growth, increasing by about 12% per year in FY 1971/72 and FY 197?/73 and
exports at an even higher rate (about 25% per year).   Of the tota1 54,CKOO
employed in these industries, a much higher proportion than is usual in
most sectors are skilled, including machinists, tool-makers, dra'iesmen,
designers, quality control personnel and foremen.
3.58      Recent expansion of exports was stimulated by marked improvements
in quality of simpler general purpose machine, cutting and hand tools and
India now appears to be capable of meeting international standards.   This
is a substantial achievement which was accomplished in part by improved
management, but also by close collaboration with firms in the U.S., U.K.
and other European countries.   Foreign collaborators have helped to
develop exports partly because of the natrket value of well-kno-,n brand
names especially in machine tools and, more directly, by shifting small
orders received at headquarters to Indian factories (in which they often
hold equity).   In these relatively labor-intensive induwtries, loiw Indian
wages (7 to 10% of those in developed countries), even at substantially
lower productivity, permit Inaian products to compete successfully in
international markets.  While export prices of machine and cutting tools



- 23 -
are generally lower than domestic prices, -aith the aid of drawback and cash
assistance (Annex 13) local producers have comparable revenue on exports.
3.59      IDA industrial import credits have helped lower costs and stimu-
late exports by untied purchase of special steels and other materials. It is
recommended that IDA's share of total foreign purchases be 27% in the machine
tool subsector and 40h in the cutting, hand tools and abrasives subsector.
For ball and roller bearings, an IDA allocation of 25% of total import re-
quirements of chrome steel tubing and other critical raw materials is con-
sidered appropriate.   Therefore, IDA's foreign exchange allocation to this
sector would be US $13 million -- US $11 million for machine, cutting and
small tools and abrasives and US $2 million for bearings.
De  The Seventh Credit - Allocation
3.60      Sectoral allocations of the proposed IDA credit and total import needs
for the licensing year April, 1972 to March 31, 1973 are compared below:
Indicative IDA Allocations by Sector

TOTAL                258                75            29% (average)
3.61      The listed IDA allocations are indicative rather than absolute, with
the exception of fertilizers and pesticides which would jointly be limited to
US $18 million, to avoid an unduly high proportion of the credit being used fon
materials which do not go into capital goods.
3.62      In the Sixth Credit, IDA's contribution (also US $75 million) was
about 43% of all import requirements of the manufacturing sectors covered. In
the proposed Seventh Credit, it is anticipated that the IDA share will average
about 29% of the total need as shown above. The smaller relative share reflects
in part the increased number of eligible industries, and in part the natural
quantitative growth in total output and import needs year to year. Also evident
is the continuing shift from imported parts and components to raw materials as
industries expand local processing, a trend which enhances the value of freely
.convertible IDA exchange and also reduces the import requirement per unit of pro-
duction.  To illustrates it is estimated that the import requirements currently
would have been 45% higher if import substitution were still at the 1964 level.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CREDIT ADMINISTRATION
4.01      Effective use of the IlDA credit depends in a large measure on the
operational efficiency of the government institutions directly involved in
managing the foreign exchange funds. Major problem areas are information
flow and delays in processing license applications.
A. Information Flow and Delays in Processing License Applications
4.02      Inports, with only very few exceptions, are under absolute Govern-
ment control and each March, the imiport policy and implementation plan for
the coming financial year is published. The system is designed to (1) protect
indigenous production; (2) hold the overall level of imports within the avail-
able foreign exchange; and (3) allocate external funds from all sources
according to use and priority. In practice, however, inadequate and delayed
flow of data on license use and physical clearances reduces the efficacy of
the system. When the information does become available, months after tne fact,
it is dispersed among a nutber of departments, limiting its usefulness for
central monitoring purposes. Under these conditions, unexpected trends and
anomalies become evident too late to trigger effective corrective measures in
time. Under the first IDA credit funds were allocated to implement an efficiency
study which was subsequently carried out by the U.S, firm, Booz Allen and
Hamilton. More recently, the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) has reconm-
mended an improved system of data retrieval but to date very limited progress
has been made in implementing these recommendations.
4.03      The time span between application for a license and its issuance
varies, but given the system of multiple levels of review and clearance % the
average time of 4 to 5 months cannot be reduced significantly, though efforts
at streamlining procedurea should continue.
4.04      During negotiations the Government confirmed that they will be askl;> g
IDA license holders to obtain revalidation of.licenses against -which letters
of credit are not opened within a period of four monthe after licerse issue1
This requirement will produce data on the IDA licenses outstanding and form
part of the Government's regular reporting to the Association.   The Govermment
also undertook to keep the Association informed on future progress in over-
coming initial difficulties in applying the IIM ccmputer program. This will be
reviewed by IDA.
B. Canalizing Agencies
4.05      There are three state corporations which have been acting as "canal-
izing" agencies (intermediaries) for import of bulk raw materials:
(1) State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. (STC) - for
agricultural products such as copra and vegetable
oils, natural and synthetic fibers, process chLemicals,
and steel



- 25 -
(2) Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) - for
ferrous and non-ferrous metals, minerals, and
chemicals
(3) Hindustvan Steel Ltd. (HSL) - for iron arAd stueel.
T7n some cases, and depending on the product in question, users may opt
either to irport direc'l-F or utilize the ser-rices of the canalizing agencies.
STC, for exarmne, organized an Industrial Raw Materials Assistance Center in
FY1970/71 which purchLases industrial raw materials for stock and resale to
small and mredu-7r, con,nanies. However, for STC's range of goods, users are
free either to avai themselveS of STC's services at an average charge of
4 to 6% or to import directly.
4.06      M}IT, on the other hand! handles material purchases for the fertilizer
industry on an exclusive basis. Orders are placed by MMTC with foreign sup-
pliers for individual users or, where small requirements can be consolidated
into large bulk orders, for grouDs of users. Based on the docunentation of a
"umaber of rock phosphate and sualfur purchases in 1970, mark-ups applied by
`A'MC to C.I.F. prices appear higher in certain cases than the 4 to 6% applied
< STf. In addition, there have been problems occasionally due to off-quality
shipwents and undependabLe delivery schedules which have adversely affected
T.-odfuction.
l.-07     O'Of the three canalizing agencies, only MMTC acted as a channel for
1DA funds under the Sixth Credit. Under the proposed Seventh Credit, it is
most likely that STC and HSL also will canalize IDA finance to some extent.
Criteria that should govern the operations of the canalizing agencies are
(1) reasonable charges for ser7ices;  (2) quality and specifications of goods
=mst be acceptable to users;  and (3) net price benefits resulting from mass
nurchasing should be passed on to users.  in view of the operational questions
noted in para. h.06 in connection witn MITC and the substantial portion of the
Seventh Credit expected to be used for bulk purchases through all three canal-
izing agencies (para. 4.03), during negotiations it was agreed that the Govern-
ment will submit details of the conposition of charges with respect to bulk
canalized purchases under the IDA credit. Furthermore, bulk purchases of over
US$100,000 per lot will be procured under international competitive bidding
procedures.
r. Preferential Tariffs
4.08      All purchases by cnnalizing agencies, expected to cover US$40
to 50 million of the proposed credit, have been and will continue to be,
as a matter of established Govre^.mernt vclcyc  evaluated on a C.I.F. basis.
This eliminates about two thirds Ofr the credit from any bias which might
otherwise arise fro. exstn  British Commoinwealth tariff preferences.  Of
the US$25 to 35 millionr remaining, expected tc be 4imorted directly by users,
only the following categories are sub,bect to tariff preferences:



- 26 -
Category                   Standard Duty  U.K. Dut¢
(% ad valorm  (% ad valorem)
(1) Iron & Steel Hoops & Strips              40            30
(2) Hi-Carbon Steel Strip up to
0.5 m                                  60            50
(3) Copper, wrought and manufac-
tured                                  60            50
(4) Copper Wire Bar (electro-
lytic)                                 40            30
(5) Copper Pipes and Tubes                   60            50
(6) Parts of Mechanically Propelled
vehicles and accessories not
otherwise specified                    60            52½
(7) Caustic Soda                             60            50
(Note: Accessories and parts for mechanical equipment (with
the exception of item (6) are dutiable at standard rates witli
no preference for U.K. origin goods.)
Direct ourchases by users in the categories listed above may aggregate
Us$15 to 25 million of the IDA credit, the balance of about US$10 million
covering items for which there are no preferential tariffs. Of the US$15
to 25 million, the larger part consists of components and spares already
"locked in" to foreign collaborating companies and there is Iit.tle freedom
of choice as to country of origin. Therefore, it is estimated that only
some US$5 to 10 million of the total US$75 million, covering direct user
purchases of steel, copper, caustic soda and other minor raw materials,
could theoretically be affected by preference tariffs.
D. Export Growth and Cost Competitiveness
4.09      A variety of incentive schemes exist to promote exports as
presented in detail in Annex 13. Among the more important are: import
replenishment entitlements (REP's), cash assistance, customs duty and
excise tax drawback, sales tax exemptions, and government market develop-
ment services. Although the package of incentives has undoubtedly con-
tributed to the encouraging export growth in so3ie IDA secl-os, there is a
need to examine feasible alternatives or modifications which might achieve
even faster rates of growth.  The possibility had been considered of "tying"
part of the proposed IDA credit to export performance of the recipient
industries, since this is one of the priority criteria.  1'o the extent that
untied IDA funds lead to reduced material costs, better delivery and pro-
duction scheduling, and general improvements in efficiency, export gros.th
possibilities will already be enAianced. Some IDA funds could have been
reserved for financing a portion of the REP's granted to 24 industries to
"replenish" with free exchange a percentage of export value.  As listed in
Annex 13, the replenishment percentage for IDA sectors ranges from 20% for



- 27 
vehicles and machine tools to 50% for storage batteries. REP's can be
used to import unrestricted raw materials, spares, components and even capital
equipment not manufactured locally and they may be transferred (usually at
a premium) to other companies in the same sector. The liberal rules
governing use or sale of REP's makes them unsuitable for controlled IDA
financing.
4.10      During negotiations, there were preliminary discussions con-
cerning the desirability of a special new type of import license which
might be used as well as REP's, but which would be particularly effective
as a cost reduction instrument and export stimulant. One possibility was
that the incremental exports of an Indian company in any year would be "re-
warded" with import licenses for a percentage of the domestic value added.
There would be no "clearance from the indigenous angle" and such licenses
would be issued automatically and be freely usable for imports of needed raw
materials, components and intermediate products within the same branch of
industry. Though it would expose certain local manufacturers to limited
competition from imports, the suggested plan would not only cause no can-
traction in aggregate sales of locally manufactured materials, components
and intermediate products but would stimulate a more rapid expansion of
indigenous manufacture. Accelerated growth of the market for indigenous
products would be inevitable as long as export growth is maintained and this
is illustrated in the hypothetical example following:
In year 1, a manufacturer exports US$1 million in value added
more than the previous year. In year 2, that manufacturer would
receive1 say, 50% of the incremental value added or US$500,000
in free import licenses. Assuming the incremental export in
Year 2 rises to US$1.5 million (US$0.5 million more than
year 1) the manufacturer would then receive US$250,000 in
free licenses (50% of US$0.5 million) issued in year 3. In
the two years, to obtain US$750,000 of free imports, exports
in local value added must increase by US$2.5 million. Since
the free licenses in any year are limited to only 50% of
the previous year's increment, the other 50% and the earlier
accumulated increments represent a growing market established
for indigenous suppliers.
The plan addresses itself to the problem of high-cost and disparity among
indigenous components and intermediates which are not price controlled and
are a major factor in the cost of tractors, machine tools, electrical,
transport, and other capital equipment. Licensing of additional manufactuvz.
of components and intermediates does not generate through competition a trei.
to lower prices, except with possible waste of capital resources. Besides,
the producers of components and intermediate products can in turn, by increasing
exports, import a percentage of their raw material requirements in the same
way- Free imports to the extent of the proposed special import licenses, on
the other hand, is expected to contribute to exports and to cost reduction
while helping, in aggregate, to increase production scope of indigenous sup-
pliers. IDA proposes to maintain the dialogue with the Government on such plan
which might be applied generally to stimulate exports, efficiency and cost-
-olpetitivenesa in the IDA and other priority sectors.

E. Intensive Sector Studies
4.11      In order to establish a better understanding of sectoral problems,
constraints and potentials for growth, it was agreed during negotiations
to carry out more intensive reviews of the problems and possible remedies in
IDA sectors. As a start, the tractor and commercial vehicle sectors will
be studied. The Government will collaborate with IDA in such studies.
F. Firms Eligible for IDA Credit
4.12      It was also agreed that disbursements of IDA funds will be limited
to firms on the official DGTD list as submitted with the application for the
Seventh Credit (Annex 10). IDA will be apprised of additions as they might
occur during the disbursement period with, in each case, basic descriptive
and financial data on the firm.
G. Assurance of Import Reauirements for the IDA Sectors
4.13      As under the previous credits, the Government agreed to make
available to IDA sector firms, as and when needed, all foreign exchange
required for the import of sufficient materials, components and spare parts,
to assure that these firms will not be constrained by lack of foreign excharge
in their production for the domestic civilian market and for export.

V.  AGREMMNTS REA1CHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)    Sectors of industry to be included in the credit (para 3.11).
(b)    Indicative allocation of IDA funds for each sector including
limitation of IDA's contribution to the fertilizer and pesti-
cides industries (paras 3.60 and 3.61).
(c)    Measures to improve licensing procedures and information
retrieval methods (para 4.04).
(d)    Criteria that should govern pricing policy of the canalizing
agencies (para 4.07).
(e)    International bidding procedures to be applied to bulk raw
material purchases through the canalizing agencies (para 4.07).
(f)    Investigation and dialogue over possible ways of increasing
exports through improved industrial performance by inducing
competition through a limited amount of corresponding free
imports (para 4.10).
(g)    During the early months of the disbursement period, intensive
sector reviews of the tractor and commercial vehicle sectors
will be carried out (paras 3.24, 3.50 and 4.ll).
(h)    Agreement on initial DGTD list of recipient firms of IDA
funds (para 4.12).
(i)    Government's obligation to make complementary foreign exchange
available to IDA sector firms (para 14.13).
5.02      With the indicated agreements, the proposed Industrial Imports
Project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US $75 million.

NOTE ON INDIAN EXPORT PRCOXTION SCHEMES
1.     India has a wide range of export promotion incentives discussed in
the following paragraphs:
Cash Assistance
2.     Cash assistance is granted to exporters with the intention of com-
pensating for disadvantages inherent in the present stage of development
of the Indian economy such as high cost of materials, small scale of pro-
duction and the various central government and local taxes and levies not
otherwise refunded (para. 7). The scheme now covers about 12% of all exports
and includes inter alia engineering goods, chemicals, plastics and paper
products. Expressed as a percentage of f.o.b. value, cash assistance for
engineering goods now varies fran 10% for batteries and industrial machinery
to 3C% for bicycles and components. The average for al1 industries is about
10 to 15%.
Import Replenishment Entitlerments (REP's)
3.    EXporters of most of the manufactured goods, including engineering
goods, receive REP's for maintenance imports.  The value of the entit1e"
ments is shown as a percentage of f.o.b. value of the export in a list which
is published annually. The rates for IDA sector goods vary from 20% for
motor vehicles and machine tools to 50% for storage batteries and other
automobile parts.  For maintenance imports, manufacturers normally are issued
"Actual User Licenses" which are based upon the consumption of imported goods
in the preceding period and bilateral as well as IDA credits are allocated to
these licenses. The main advantages of REP's over Actual User Licenses
issued against bilateral credits are (1) free foreign exchange, an advantage
to exporters in terms of flexibility, price and fast delivery;  (2) a wider
range of materials, spare parts and components, and even capital goods to
some extent, can be imported; (3) tran6ferability to other manufacturers in
the same industrial sector. (In engineering industries,for exawple, REP's
command a premium when transferred of about 50% of nominal value). Due to
these advantages, REP's appear to be an effective export incentive.
Preferences and Penalties in Import Licensing
4.     In the Actual User Import Licensing Scheme, all firms which exported
10% or more of their production in the previous year obtain import licenses
for maintenance imports with foreign exchange from the sourcea of their choice.
They also receive preferential treatment when applying for import licenses
necessary to expand capacity. The extent of preferential treatment varies
with the export performance of the firms. Companies which supply materials
and components to production for export are, however, not considered under the
scheme.



13 - 3
5.     Automotive ancillariess small and cutting tools, bicycles, diesel
engines and several other industries which are considered to be in a
favorable position to incresae exports have been singled out and specific
export 6bligatione are stipulated. In these industries, only those firms
which exported more than 5% of their production in the previous year are
assured of their maintenance import requirements in full and to the extent
possible from preferred soUrces.
Industrial Licensing
6.     The "larger" houses and foreign firms are confined to a 11corell/and
heavy investment sector, and restricted from investing in other sectors
normally reserved for medium and small industry. However, these firms may
be permitted to expand into the restricted areas if they are prepared to
commit themselves to export 60% or _ore of the additional production within
three years. Also, or other          are allowed into the areas reserved for
small scale firms ony if they coamit themselves to expert 75% or mere of
the additional production.
Tax Incentives
7~  Drawback of customs and excise duty is available on export of various
iroducts. Although only customs duties and excise taxes on the inputs to
the final stage of production for export is returned, the amounts can be
significant. &iormous difficulties arise from the process of identifying
exactly that part of the sales price which is due to import duties and excise
taxes paid by the exporter. For that reason fixed drawback rates have been
set for about 150 export items but for many more items it is still necessary
for the rates to be fixed based on precise and time-consuming scrutiny of
applications. Eport market development expenditures can be deducted from
corporate income to the extent of 1.33 times the costs. Furthermore, exports
are exempt from state sales tax in all states.  In Bombay, Madras and Calcutta,
the "octroi" (a tax on cmmodities brought into a tomn) is refunded.
Export Credit
8.     Short term pre-shipment credit and medium term post-shipment credit
schemes are available. The short term pre-shipment credit granted by
commercial banks to exporters of engineering products is extended at 6%
per annum and the commercial bank can discount such credit at the Reserve
Bank of India at 00 per armum. Medium term export credit is available throt-
the Industrial Development Bank of India (IBI) under two sehemes; -(a) re-finuic_ng
by IDBI at W-A interest of the credit directly provided by comercial banks at
not more than 6% interest; and (b) credit directly provided by IDBI at the
same 4*s interest rate up to a limit of two thirds of the total value of the
shipment. This means that with commercial banks providing the remaining 1/3
at 6%, export credit in the most favorable case can be obtained at an
effective 5 per cent. The second schem was initiated in 1968 because commercial
"Core" industries are planned in detail by the Government and
controlled through liconaing.

banks were reluctant to extend export credit under the first scheme. Export
credit for 7 years, and in exceptionally deserving cases up to 10 years, is
available.  The Export Credit Guarantee Corporation extends insurance coverage
on all exports but where financed by IDBI, the insurance policy is a pre-
condition.  The insurance coverage of engineering goods under post-shipment
export credit procedures is available up to 90% for both commercial and
political risks.
Trade Development Authority
9.        The Trade Development Authority, an ancillary organization to the
Ministry of Foreign Trade, was established in 1970 to promote selective
and intensive export development of products with potential growth in
demand in developed countries. To this end, 11 industries (including auto-
mobile ancillaries) and about 200 firms in these sectors have been selected
on the basis of their technical and commercial competency for special assistance.
The Authority provides these firms with a package of services in the fields
of production and marketing. For example, a "trade data bank" was organized
and is conducting research and analysis of potential markets. The Authority
also promotes technical development for export merchandise. Most importantlr,
simplified procedures have been evolved for processing applications by these
firms for import of materials and export of products and, in order to meet the
urgent needs of the firms, a special allocation of foreign exchange has been
placed at the disposal of the Authority.
Supply of Steel
10.       Since April 1967, India has operated a scheme under which manu-
facturers of engineering goods can obtain the difference between the world
price and the domestic price of the steel contained in exports if and w1hen
foreign steel is less expensive than domestic steel. For Kst Indian steel
products this is not the case at present. Domestically produced steel is
allocated by the Steel Priority Committee, and export industries axe given
the highest priority after defense needs are met. During the period of
steel shortages in 1970 and 1971, special efforts were made to ens'.-'e needed
imports of steel for export production.
Other Assistance
11.       In addition to the major export promotion schemes explained above,
there are: (a) railway freight concessions, varying from 0 to 40%, increasing
with the distance; (b) kxport Promotion Councils have been set up for each
of the main export lines including engineering goods which conduct export
publicity and research largely financed out of the government's MakeA
Development Fund; (c) Government quality control and pre-shipment inspection
services (since 1963); (d) for business trips abroad, firms which have a
record of Rs. 500,000 or more annual export sales receive blanket foreign
exchange approvals to cover travel expenses; and (e) exporters with anl out-
standing export record are eligible for awards by the Government.
