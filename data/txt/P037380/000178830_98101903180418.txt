RITERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TEE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND
FOR A THIRD HIGHiAY PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $13.0 million to the
Republic of Finland.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.     The Bank has made fifteen loans to, or guaranteed by, the Republic
of Finland. The projects for which these loans were made have been, or are
being, carried out satisfactorily.
3.     There have been two previous loans for highway projects totalling
$48.5 million. Both are fully disbursed. Through these loans the Bank has
assisted the Government in its efforts to improve the planning and con-
struction of highways and modernize the responsible organization, the National
Board of Public Roads and Waterw-ays (NBR). A mission to appraise the third
highway project visited Finland in May 1969. Construction was originally
planned to start in 1970 at the beginning of Finland's short summer con-
struction season, but unexpected delays in completing detailed engineering
and bidding documents caused the Government to postpone construction until
1971 in order to take advantage of a full construction season. As a result,
the Bank was asked to defer consideration of the project, and a reappraisal
mission visited Finland in September/October 1970.
4.     Negotiations were held in Washington in December 1970. The dele-
gation from Finland consisted of I1r. Vaino Suonio, Director in Chief of NBR;
Mr. Jorma Aranko, a Director of the Bank of Finland; and Mr. Niilo Pusa,
Counselor of the Embassy of Finland.
5.     The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Finland as at
December 31, 1970:

6.     No other loan proposal for Finland is expected to be submitted to
the Executive Directors for approval within this fiscal year.
7.     The present amount of IFC investment in Finland is $230,122. This in-
cludes a shareholding of $159,279 in Teollistamisrahasto Oy (IFF), which is
the only privately owned and managed financial institution in Finland to
provide long-term financing to private industrial enterprises. (IFF has re-
ceived four Bank loans totalling $63.0 million.) IFC has also invested $70,843
in shares of Huhtamaki-Yhtyma Oy, a company manufacturing pharmaceuticals.
IFC's total investment in this company included a loan of approximately $700,000
(now fully repaid) and equity participation of about $100,000 original cost.
This investment was a joint operation with IFF. IFC currently has no projects
under consideration in Finland.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.     An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Highway Project in
Finland"t (PTR-37b), dated January 28, 1971, is attached (No. 1).
10.    Finland's public highway network in 1969 totalled about 72,000 km of
which about 22,000 km were paved. The main roads generally radiate from
Helsinki and those closest to the capital have the highest traffic densities.
11.    Although the length and general location of the present road network
are satisfactory, the design and construction standards of a large part are
not appropriate to traffic needs. The relatively high growth rate of passen-
ger and freight traffic in the 1960's (about 11 and 8 percent per annum re-
spectively) has produced increasing congestion, and road maintenance and
vehicle operating costs have been high. The Government recognized these
problems in the early 1960's. Over the last seven years, it has concentrated
on the upgrading and improvement of road surfaces and alignments to meet
traffic needs. This is consistent with the long-term recommendations of the
transportation study, financed by the Bank under the first road loan made in
1964, and is to be continued in the Government's future highway investment
programs.
12.    The project consists of:
(a) The construction of a 22 km section of four-lane divided express-
way between Tattariharju and Jarvenpaa, including the construction
of five interchanges and the construction or improvement of about
36 km of approach roads. This is part of a planned 138 km ex-
pressway between Helsinki and Lusi, a town 40 km north of Lahti.
The rapid development of the area between Helsinki and Lahti and
the expected increase in traffic indicate a need to extend the
expressway to Lusi, where traffic then fans out to the north and
northeast; and
(b) The paving of about 910 km of roads included in the Government's
1971 paving program which comprises about 2,530 km of roads.
13.    The project is estimated to cost a total of US $33.8 million equivalent,
of which the expressway works account for $20.1 million, paving works for
$10.4 million and contingencies for $3.3 million. The foreign currency com-
ponent is estimated at $13.0 million equivalent and would be financed by the
proposed loan. The project cost estimate excludes the cost of land acquisition
($2.8 million equivalent), construction supervision ($1.2 million equivalent)
and project preparation ($1.2 million equivalent), which have been or will be
borne by the Government.
14.    Loan funds would be disbursed on the basis of the estimated foreign ex-
change component as follows:
(a) 35 percent of actual payments to contractors for highway construction
works; and
(b) 45 percent of actual payments to contractors for paving works.



Any surplus funds remaining in the loan account wTould be cancelled. Procure-
ment will be carried out under full international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. With the Bankts concurrence, pre-
qualification was completed in December 1970. The experience of the first
and second road projects together with the interest shown by foreign con-
tractors in the proposed project suggest that about one-half of the contract
sections will be awarded to foreign firms. This forms the basis for the
estimates of the foreign exchange component.
16.    The proposed project is economically Justified and aill expand the
existing expressway system in an area of serious traffic congestion and
continue the planned upgrading of the highway network, all of which is part
of the Government's long-range roads investment program aimed at reducing
road transport costs. The economic rate of return for the expresswray in-
vestment would be about 17 percent based upon estimated savings in vehicle
operating costs and time; for the paving program the rate of return would be
about 30 percent, based upon estimated savings in road maintenance and
vehicle operating costs.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.    The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Finland and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
Loan Agreement conforms substantially to previous loan agreements for proj-
ects of this type.
PART V - ECONOMY
18.    A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Finland"
(EA-31a) is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. A
basic data sheet is annexed.
19.    Government policy has been to meet as much of the external capital
needs as possible through long-term bond issues in international capital
markets. About 25 percent of the gross capital inflow during 1967-69 has been
provided by public and private bond issues. Finland's special geographical and
political situation and the stringency in capital markets still severely limit
the prospects for raising long-term capital abroad. The relatively small size
of Finnish companies and a shortage of internationally known names are further
obstacles. Total external medium- and long-term public debt outstanding was
$787.6 million on December 31, 1969, of which $52 million was undisbursed.
Debt service payments are moderate. They will amount to only about 3.7 percent
of foreign exchange earnings in 1970, and the debt service ratio is not ex-
pected to increase appreciably in the next few years. Finland's debt servicing
record is very good, its borrowing capacity is substantial, and it is credit-
worthy for the proposed lending.



PART VI - COIPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICIES OF AGREEICTT
20.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMENDATION
21.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
