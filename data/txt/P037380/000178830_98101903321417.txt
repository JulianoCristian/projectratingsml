APPRAISAL OF TEIE THIRD HICHWAY PROJECT'
Summary and Conclusions
i.        The relatively high growth rate of GNP and road traffic in
Finland during the late 1950's and in the 1960's has resulted in increasing-
ly congested roads, the standards of whichi have not kept pace with traffic
demands. This has resulted in high road maintenance and vehicle operating
costs. Moreover, the lack of adequate highway capacilty for current and
future traffic has impeded the growth of the economy.
ii.       Since 1964 the Bank has assisted the Government's efforts to im-
prove transport by making twqo road loans totaling US$48.5 million equiva-
lent. The loans included the acquisition of road maintenance equipment, the
paving of high priority sections of the road network, the construction of
some four-lane expressways, the engineering of future sections of express-
way, and a comprehensive transportation study. Both projects have been
successfully completed and were largely responsible for modernizing the
Government's highway organization, including its planning and executing
functions.
iii.      The transportation study, completed in 1965, was used to formulate
the Government's ten-year investment program  for the roads and railway, the
two major transport modes; the second lank road project and the proposed
third project are parts of this investment program.  Ihle study also recom-
mended improvements for the railway and for transport coordination, most of
which were accepted by the Government and are now being implemented.
iv.       The proposed third highway project comprises the construction of
a 22 km stretch of four-lane divided expressway and the paving of about 910
km of road, which is part of the Government's 1971 paving program aimed at
upgrading about 2,530 km of roads.  The total construction cost of the pro-
ject, including contingencies, is estimated at US$33.8t million equivalent,
of which US$23.1 million is for the construction of the expressway and
US$10.7 million for tile paving works. Tlhe lBank loan of US$13.0 million
equivalent will finance the foreign exchange cost of the project, which is
estimated at 35% of expressway works and 45% of paving works, on the basis
of expected participation by domestic and foreign cont:ractors.  In addition
to financing the local curreticy componenit of the above construction and
paving works, the Government will finance tihe entire cost of land acquisi-
tion and construction supervisioni, estimatecd at US$4 million equivalent.
v.         E+xecutioni of tCe project will be the responsibility of the
National. Board of Public Roads and Waterways (NBR) and the project will be
carried out under unit price contracts awarded after international competitive
bidding. The proposed project will expand th-ie existing expressway system in
an area of serious traffic congestion and will continue the planned up-
grading of the highway network, all of which are part of the Government's
long-range roads investment program aimed at reducing road transport: costs.
The economic rate of return for the expressway investment will be about



- ii -
17%, based upon the best estimates of savings in vehicle operating costs
and time; for the paving program the rate of return wrill be about 30%,
based upon the best estimate of savings in road maintenance and vehicle
operating costs.
vi.        The project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US$13 million
equivalent. A 15-year term, including a three--year period of grace, is ap-
propriate.

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Finland has requested a th:ird Bank loan to
help finance the construction of a 22 km section of four-lane expressway
and the paving of about 910 km of roads included in its 1971 paving pro-
gram.
1.02      The first loan of US$28.5 million (384-FI) was signed in 1964.
It helped to finance the construction of a 14.3 km section of a four-lane
expressway (motorway in Finnish terminology) between Gumbole and Veikkola
west of Helsinki, the capital, (see Map); a two-year paving program (1964-
1965); the purchase of road maintenance equipment; and a transportation
study carried out by Dutch consultants. This study reviewed the trans-
port sector, recommended improvements for each transport mode and for trans-
port policy and coordination, and formulated a ten-year investment program.
The second loan of US$20.0 million (445-FI) was made in 1966. It was used
for constructing a 12.2 km stretch of four-lane expressway between Tampere
and Kulju and a 400 meter long bridge at Savonlinna, implementing a two-year
paving program (1966-1967), and engineering by Swedish and Finnish consultants
of high priority expressway sections to be constructed in the future.
1.03      Bothl of these highiway projects were completecd on time and within
original cost estimates; the quality of work was excellent.  They were
largely responsible for introducing improvements and new operating methods
within the Government's highway department, as detailed in Chapter III.
The transportation study, which was part of the first loan, was completed
in 1965 and its recommendations have been used effectively by the Government
to formulate transport investment programs and to improve transport coordi-
nation; this is discussed further in Chapter II.
1.04      This report was prepared by Messrs. R. Alexander (Engineer),
H. Hansen (Economist) and A. Bergan (Consultant) on the basis of an
appraisal mission in May 1969 and, after a delay requested by the Govern-
ment, a reappraisal mission in September/October 1970. It was edited by
Mrs. P. Valad.
II. BACKGROUJND
A. General
2.01      Finland, thie fifth largest country in Europe, is one of the world's
northernmost areas.  It lies on the Baltic Sea, bordered by the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Norw7ay, and Sweden and it covers 337,000
km2 (similar to Ivory Coast or Norway). About 70% of its land surface is



- 2 -
forests, the country's principal economic resource, and about 10% is lakes
(some 55,000). Mlost of the terrain is flat, but the east and north are
mountainous.
2.02      Finland's population, estimated at 4.7 million in 1969, has been
growing at about 0.5% p.a. Gross national product (GNP) in 1969 was Fmk 34.0
billion (US$8.1 billion), or about US$1,720 per capita. Between 1960 and
1969 real GNP increased 4.7% p.a., but in 1969 it increased 9.3%. The
major sectors of the economy are services, industry, construction, and
forestry; in 1969 they contributed, respectively, 47%, 29%, 9%, and 7% of
gross domestic product at factor cost. Agriculture anLd fishing contributed
8%, but their share has been declining steadily.
B.  Transportation
(a) General
2.03      Transport is largely influenced by the low overall population
density (15.3 persons per km2); the large concentration of population and
economic activity in the south (population density 26.0 compared with 4.3
in the north); the timber industry (accounting for about 60% of total ex-
ports); and the location of the forests (in the central and northern re-
gions). The main transport arteries connect the timber supply areas with
the wood-working industries and the ports in the south, and connect major
population and economic centers of the south with eacih other and with their
ports.
2.04      The low overall population density, the lack of large urban cen-
ters, and the other economic and demnographic influences mentioned above have
resulted in a widespread network of long transport lines carrying relatively
low traffic volumes. In addition, internal transportation is aggravated by
severe winter conditions.  As a result, operating costs and investment re-
quirements for transport are high.
2.05      The principal transport modes are highways, railways, and water-
ways. Table 1 shows the domestic transport volumes, by mode, of goods and
passengers in 1969. Goods traffic, 21,800 million ton-km, was carried
mainly by road transport. The share of goods and passenger traffic carried
by road has been increasing steadily from 41% and 83%, respectively, in
1962 to 58% and 88% in 1969. Finland's transport system is geaerally ade-
quate, but congestion is developing on several main roads connecting Hel-
sinki with the other major cities in southern and central Finland. A com-
prehensive review of the transport sector and the results of tile 1965 trans-
portation study were given in the appraisal report for the second road pro-
ject (TO-517d, April 1966); their main features are summarized and updated
in the following paragraphs.



-3
(b) Highways
2.06      At the end of 1969 Finland's highway network comprised about 72,000
km of roads. The main roads radiate from Helsinki and are the most highly
trafficked. Details of the highway sector are given in Chapter III.
(c) Railways
2.07      In 1969 the Finnish State Railways (VR) operated lines totaling
about 5,720 km, of which about 460 km were double traclc.  Between 1955 and
1964, railway freight traffic was stable while passenger traffic declined.
Despite continued strong competition from roads, railway traffic has since
increased slightly to 6,000 million ton-km and 2,200 million pass-km.
Except for 1969, costs, especially labor, have increased faster than revenue.
9         VR had an operating deficit in 1969 of Fmk 116 million and revenue of Fmk
485 million, compared to a deficit of Fmk 57 million and revenue of Fink 372
million in 1964.
2.08      Following the recommendations of the transportation study (para.
1.02), the VR is consolidating its organization, reducing its staff,
strengthening its sales approach, repairing tracks and bridges, increasing
dieselization and electrification, and gradually abandoning short-haul
passenger traffic. These actions, combined with modest rate increases
(about 3% p.a.), should reduce VR's operating deficit almost 60% by 1975,
when it would be 11.5% of revenue compared with 24% in 1969.
(d) Seaports and Inland Water Transport
2.09      A large number of small ports are strung out along Finland's
coastline. In 1969, imports by sea reached 18.4 million tons and exports
amounted to 12.0 million tons. Over half the tonnage is handled at the
four main ports: Skoldvik, Kotka, Helsinki, and Naantali. The merchant
fleet consists of 504 vessels totaling about 1.3 milliont Gross Register
Tons.
2.10      The lakes provide a cheap means of transport in summertime,
especially for floating timber. Channels flowing north to south between
lakes total about 40,000 km, but they do not link the major urban centers
to their ports. Traffic carried by this mode has declined slightly in
recent years to about 1,900 million ton-km in 1969.
2.11      The Saimaa Canal, closed for 25 years, was reopened in 1968
under a concession agreement between Finland and the USSR. Some sections
are located in Eastern Karelia which is now Soviet territory. Ships up to
1,500 tons deadweight can sail 500 km inland; in 1969 they carried mainly
fuel, pulp, and timber, amounting to about 51,000 tons, and by 1975 they
should carry 1,000,000 tons annually.



-4-
(e) Aviation
2.12      Domestic air transport, especially freigiht, is still modest.  In
1969, freight and mail amounted to about 1.7 million ton-km while passenger
traffic was 163 million pass-km.  Helsinki is the main center for botl
domestic and international air transport.
C.   Transport Planning and Coordination
2.13      Tie recommendations of the 1965 transportation study mainly
concerned highways and railways, the two major modes of transport.  11owever,
they also covered improvements in transport planning and coordination.  Thle                  _
Government agreed withi most of the recommendations, and as indicated below,                 i_
has taken satisfactory steps to follow through on many of theme  hle Govern-
ment also used the investment program recommended in the study to formulate
its annual investment programs for the transport sector; the original in-
formation and plans are periodically updated and revised.
2.14      Regarding highways, the main reconmendations concerned the
strengthening of planning, execution, and administration; these are dealt
with in Chapter III. On railways, the recommendations covered improve-
ment of operations and reduction of the deficit; the steps being taken
to implement these recommendations were discussed :in para. 2.08.
2.15      Regarding transport planning and coordination, the study con-
cluded that transport planning and economic researchli (e.g., inventory of
facilities and studies of operating costs, traffic movements, and project
feasibility) should be strengthened. The necessary strengthening was first
carried out within each Government entity concerned with transport.  Later,
in 1969, three joint working groups were established by the National Board
of Public Roads and Waterways (NBR) and the VR to review existing transport
taxes and tariffs, investment criteria, and urban and suburban transport.
Finally, in March 1970, tile Government established a Ministry of Communi-
cations to handle overall transport policy, planning, and coordination.
The Ministry includes a Department of Transportation Planning which, among
other things, will continue the work begun by the joint NBR/VR torking groups
relating to user charges and will draw on thleir expertise.
III.  TIIE HIGIHWAY SECTOR
A.   The Highway Network (}ap)
3.01      The public highway network in 1969 totaled about 72,000 km
compared with 40,00( km in 1960 and was classified into main, secondary,
tertiary, and local roads (Table 2). The local roads mainly accommodate
the internal traffic of communes. As shown in Table 3, slightly less than
3,000 km of the total network were paved in 1960 compared with about 22,000



- 5 -
km in 1969.  In addition to the public roads, there are about 44,000 km
of low standard farm-to-market type private roads (generally earth) and
6,000 km of urban streets. The main roads generally radiate from Helsinki
and those closest to the capital have the highest traffic densities.
3.02      The length added to the public road network over the last ten years
was mainly transfers of the more heavily trafficked private roads rather
than the construction of new roads.  Although tile lengt;h and general location
of the present network is satisfactory, the design and construction standards
of a large part are not now adequate to cope with traffic demand.  The
relatively high growth rate of road traffic in the 1950's and 1960's has
produced increasing congestion, and road maintenance and vehicle operating
costs have been high. Moreover, the lack of adequate highway capacity to
serve traffic demand has tended to slow economic growth. The Government
recognized these problems in the early 1960's. Over the last seven years,
it has centered its highway development efforts on the continuous upgrading
and improvement of road surfaces and alignments to meet traffic needs, as
well as on the initial construction of an expressway system (which now
totals about 110 km in length).  This pattern of highway development is
appropriate to Finland, is consistent with the long-term recommendations
of the transportation study, and is to be continued in the Government's
future highway investment programs.
B.   Highway Transport
3.03      Between 1960 and 1969, the motor vehicle fleet grew by abouat 13%
p.a., from 257,000 to 753,000, with passenger cars comprising 85% of the
total (Table 4). Partly as a result of the Governiment: 's recent economic
stabilization policy, the fleet increased only 10% in .1969 over the :1968
figure.  Although the number of trucks has not changed, their total carrying
capacity has increased because larger trucks are being used. Finland had
seven inhabitants per vehicle in 1969, compared with four in Denmark and
Sweden, five in Norway, seven in Italy, nine in Greece, and 42 in Viigoslavia.
B          In 1969, approximately 104,000 motor vehicles were imported while a-out 1,000
units, mainly trucks, were produced in Finland. Production of Saab (Swedish)
passenger cars started in late 1969, and the annual output is expected to
reach 30,000 by 1975.
3.04      The growth of highway transport between 1960 and 1969 is showni
in Table 5.  Road freight traffic amounted to about 11 billion ton-kmri in
1969, an increase of about 8% p.a. Passenger travel reached 20 billion
pass-km, rising by about 11  p.a.  Most of the passenger traffic increase
was due to private car use; bus traffic increased by only 2% p.a.
3.05      The legal vehicular load is 8 m tons on a single axle and 13 m tons
on tandem axles.  These loadings are satisfactorJly eniorceI by the traffic
police and, during loan negotiations, th-e Government agreed that it will
continue to enforce vehicle load regulations consistent with tlle structural
and geometric design standards of the public highway network.



-6-
C.   Financing and Road User Taxation
3.06      Total road expenditures of all government bodies, municipalities,
and local authorities amounted to about Fmk 1,120 million in 1968 compared
with Fmk 618 million in 1962 (Table 6). NBR's current five-year investment
program (1970-74) allocates about Fmk 435 million annually for road con-
struction and improvement. This is based on the results of broad economic
studies and is adjusted according to fiscal considerations; the fiscal
constraints have been exercised reasonably and the resulting investment
level is appropriate.
3.07      The revenue obtained by the Government from road users between                    4
1960 and 1969 is shown in Table 7. It amounted to Fmk 1,020 million in
1969 compared with Fmik 272 million in 1960; none of the total was specifi-
cally earmarked for roads.  About 55% of these revenues came from fuel
taxes and most of the remainder from motor vehicle taxes. In the period
1964-68, annual tax revenues from road users covered all road maintenance
and overhead expenditures and about half of all road construction costs.
D.   Highway Administration
3.08      NBR (see Chart), an organization within the Ministry of Communi-
cations, is mainly responsible for constructing and maintaining all public
roads, but it also oversees inland waterways and airports. Cities and
local communes generally are responsible for urban streets and private
roads, respectively. NBR's main office is in Helsinki. Its 13 district
offices are well organized and staffed with competent engineers and tech-
nicians. The number of employees increased between 1960 and 1969, and is
commensurate with the increased length of the road network and work needs.
3.09      Before the first Bank project, road design and construction work                J
was executed by NBR's own forces; a limited amount of specialized con-
struction was carried out by contract. Combined with a shortage of staff,
this form of operation limited NBR's capacity to prepare and execute the
volume of work required to bring the road network to modern si ndards.
Moreover, the works were carried out at high cost and over long periods of
time.
3.10      The first Bank road project introduced international competitive
bidding on large construction contracts, and the use of consultants for
road design and construction supervision. The change. from the old system
of using its own forces had a tremendous impact on NER's organization and
operation.  In the beginning, the new procedures created certain problems
among the staff, many of whom opposed such radical clanges. However, the
excellent results achieved under the first project and again under the
second project, such as lower construction costs, shorter construction
periods, and acceleration of much-needed road improvement, convinced NBR
of the advantages of the new procedures. These procedures, particularly
competitive bidding, have been adopted by NBR for all. of its works, and
its internal operations have been reorganized accordiLngly. The adoption
of modern methods, not only in operation but also in planning and design,



-7-
has attracted a large number of highly qualified engineers and economists
to work for NBR and has made NBR an effective and well organized entity,
fully able to cope with the needed improvement and development of the road
network.
E.   Planning and Design
3.11      During the last six years NBR has expanded its planning and design
facilities considerably; it uses modern methods and equipment, such as
aerial photography, computers, and sophisticated techniques for collecting
and analyzing traffic data. Traffic counts are taken annually and systema-
tically on all important roads; they are taken in more detail every five
years on all public highways.  Origin and destination studies are made
occasionally.  The traffic counting system is satisfactory and, during loan
negotiations, the Government agreed that it will continue to collect and
analyze traffic data for highway planning purposes. Due to the urgency of
improving the existing road network to keep pace with the rapid increase in
traffic, foreign and local consulting firms are performing a substantial
portion of NBR's detailed design and engineering work for new roads (espe-
cially the expressway system). NBR is carrying out general planning and
programming, and is preparing the paving programs.
3.12      NBR's design standards are based on several years of experimenta-
tion and research on surface types versus traffic levels and stage construc-
tion; they are satisfactory. Regarding surface types, it: is NBR's policy
to place a hot-mix surface (oil-gravel) on gravel roads when average daily
traffic (ADT) exceeds about 150-200 velhicles, and to renew this surface by
an asphalt concrete carpet when ADT exceeds about 1,000 vehicles. Regard-
ing stage construction, a good example is a new asphaltic: concrete road:
a bituminous stabilized base course is initially provided; and followed
about two years later with an asphaltic concrete wearing surface. This
practice helps optimize NBR's investments because major defects show up
early and can be cheaply repaired before the final wearing surface is
placed.
F.   Construction
3.13      All major construction and asphalt paving programs are now carried
out under unit price contracts awarded after competitive bidding. In
addition to construction included in Bank-financed projects, some major
works outside these projects have also been bid internationally. The express-
way construction under the first and second road projects was carried out by
joint ventures of Swedislh and Finnislh contractors, whiile the asphalt paving
programs were mainly carried out jointly by Finnish and Swedish contractors
and one Yugoslav contractor. The quality of work performed was excellent;
it was supervised by NBR, assistetl by the Swedish consuliting firm Kjessler
& Mannerstraale.  Suclh assistance will not be required in the future, except
for very special tech-inical problems.



-8-
3.14      The construction industry has grown quickly and construction costs
have been reduced significantly, mainly due to thie introduction of larger
works and of competitive bidding under the first two road projects. Six
years ago there were only about three Finnislh contractors capable of carry-
ing out large road works similar to the bank projects; now about ten firms are
able to carry out works valued between US$10 and US$40 million equivalent
p.a. The construction cost unider cornpetitive bidding was substantially
lower than the cost of force account work under thc old system and, in the
case of the first paving program, it was about 30% less. Since the first
Bank loan for roads in 1964, the NBP has paved between 1,500 and 2,000 km
of roads annually.
C.   Maintenance
3.15      The Finnish roads are well maintained and NBR's maintenance
organization is efficient. The first road loan enabled NBR to acquire
additional maintenance equipment, which has been augmented by the purchase
with local budgetary funds of additional trucks and graders. The present
equiDment stock is adequate for the proper maintenance of all roads under
the NBR's jurisdiction. Special emphasis has been placed on snow-clearing
equipment to keep all the main roads open during the winter. During loan
negotiations, the Government agreed that it wi:Ll continue to maintain the
public road network in an adequate manner.
3.16      The average annual cost per km to ma:intain the public road network,
including allowances for equipment depreciationi, was about US$680 equivalent
in 1969.  Althougha this is comparable to the 1964 cost, it is in keeping with
current needs. Despite a substantial increase in traffic and paved roadway
surfaces since 1964, the cost per km to maintain the network has remained
relatively constant due to the reorganization of the maintenance department
and the availability of an adequate stock of efficiently-used maintenance
equipment. A new cost accounting system for more effective control of
equipment usage has been introduced recently in some maintenance districts; j
the initial results have been successful and the systems will be extended
to all districts. In addition, a study group has been created within the
NBR to analyze maintenance operations in greater detail and to propose
further organizational and operational improvements.
IV. THE PPxOJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The project consists of the:
(a) construction of about 22 km of four-lane divided ex-
pressway betveen Tattariharju and Jarvenpaa, including
the construction of five interchanges and the construc-
tion and/or improvement of about 36 km of approach roads,
and



(b) paving of about 910 km of roads included in the
Government's 1971 paving program.
B.   Expressway Construction
4.02      The Tattarijarju-Jarvenpaa expressway section is part of a
planned 138 km divided expressway between Helsinki (Viikki) and Lusi, a
town 40 km north of Lahti, the fourth largest town in Finland (see Map).
The first 5 km section of the planned expressway, Viikki-Tattariharju
(six lanes), was opened to traffic in October 1970. The present two-
lane road is flanked by heavy roadside development, is heavily congested,
and is poorly aligned; thus, it cannot be upgraded to four-lane standards
except at high cost. It will, however, be kept in operation as a service
road for local traffic. The rapid development of the area between Helsinki
and Lahti and the expected increase in traffic indicate a need to extend
the expressway over the next ten years to Lahti and beyond to Lusi, where
traffic then fans out to the north and northeast.
4.03      The design standards for the expressway, shown in Table 8, are
similar to those used in the earlier Bank-financed projects.  A relatively
high design speed of 140 km/h has been adopted for the Viikki-Tattariharju
section, now under construction, and for the project expressway section;
given the flat terrain of the immediate area, the application of this design
would not produce higher construction costs than a more conventional design
speed of 110-120 km/h. Detailed engineering of both road and bridge works
is complete and satisfactory, and tender documents are being printed. The
road designs were executed by the Swedish consulting firm, Kjessler &
Mannerstraale, with experienced Finnish staff. The bridge designs, involv-
ing 42 structures totaling about 950 m, were carried out by two Finnish
consulting firms, Heimo Kakko and Paavo Tupamaki-Ilmari Kortesluoma.
C.   Paving Works
4.04      NBR's 1971 paving program follows the patternt of earlier Bank-
financed programs and involves about 2,530 km of road sections div. .ed into:
(a) hot-mix bituminous surfacing on 1,650 km, and (b) cold-mix bituminous
surfacing on 880 km.  The project wll  include about 910 km of road sections
from (a) because of their attractiveness for international bidding. The
remainder of (a) and all of (b) will be excluded from the project, with the
Government's concurrence, because they cannot be grouped into signif:Lcant
contracts for bidding since they are small and scattered throughout ithe
country. Also excluded from the project will be some crushed stone fcrom
NBR's existing stockpile, whiclh it will furnish without charge to paving
contractors. Details concerning the total length and cost of the roads in
the 1971 paving program and in the project are given in Tables 9 and 10.
4.05      The hot-mix paving will be placed on existing paved roads (to
upgrade cold--mix surfaces and to strengthen hot-mix surfaces) and on re-
cently reconstructed roads for whiclh only thi  earthwork and sub-base have



- 10 -
been completed. The paving for the latter roads is part of NBIt's program
of staged construction (para. 3.12). The detailed engineering for the paving
program has been satisfactorily completed by NBR's own staff, as was the
case for the two previous loans.
D.   Cost Estimates and Foreign Exchange Component

a/   Based on best estimate of participation in the project works by domestic
and foreign contractors (see para. 4.08).
b/   The expressway estimate excludes the cost of land acquisition (US$2.8
million equivalent), construction supervision (US$1.2 million equivalent),
and project preparation (US$1.2 million equivalent) which will be borne
by the Government.
4.07      The construction cost estimates for the expressway and the paving
works are based both on quantities obtained from completed detailed engineer-
ing (paras. 4.03 and 4.05) and on unit prices from contracts recently awarded;
they are realistic. The 15% contingency allowance for the expressway works
includes 10% for possible quantity overruns and 5% for possible price in-
creases in both local and foreign currency elements from the time the esti-
mates were made in October 1970 to the completion of the! project. Only
a 3% contingency allowance for quantities has been provided for the paving



- 11 -
works (no allowance for price) because quantities and costs can be very
accurately estimated, because the works will be carri,ed out in less than
five months during 1971, and because actual paving costs under the earlier
Bank projects were below the project estimates.
4.08      NBR's detailed estimates of the project's foreign exchange costs
have been reviewed and are satisfactory. These estimates are summarized
below, and cover three cases: (1) work performed exclusively by domestic
contractors, (2) work performed exclusively by foreign contractors, and (3)
half the work performed by foreign contractors (their probable participation).

a/   The spread in percentages between domestic and foreign contractors is
somewhat higher than the usual 15-20% range because domestic contractors
use some equipment manufactured in Finland.
b/   Based on percentages given in para. 4.07.
4.09      Under the first two projects, about half of the expressway works
and about one-quarter of the paving works were executed by foreign firms.
For the proposed third project, foreign contractors will probably par-
ticipate for the expressway works in the same proportion; however, foreign
participation for the paving works is expected to increase to about one-
half because of the growing interest of foreign firms in the earlier
projects and becatuse many domestic contractors specializing in paving
works are now rather actively engaged. On the above lbasis, the foreign
exchange cost of the project is estimated to be US$13 million equivalent,
or 39%.

E.   ProJct Financing and Execution
4.10      The proposed loan to the Governient will finance the foreign ex-
change component of thc project.  As with thie previous loans, local financ-
ing will be met annually in tile budget of the Ministry of Communications.
During loan negoti.tions, the Government confirmed that Local financing for
project expenditures in 1971 has been inclu(led In the Government's budget
for that year.
4.11      NBR will be responsible for executing and supervising the project
and will be assisted from time to time by consultants, ar, necessary, for
any special technical problems.  Construction will be by prequalified con-
tractors on the basis of unit price contracts awarded after international
competitive bidding and will be in accordance with procedures and documents
acceptable to the Bank-.
4.12      For bidding purposes, the expressway work will be divided into
tlhree sections, each valued at about US$7 million equivaLent, and contrac-
tors will be permitted to bid on one or more sections simultaneously (see
Table 10 for details of the sections). The construction period will be 28
months or about the same time needed to construct similar expressways under
the two previous loans.
4.13      The paving works comprise 96 road sections located throughout the
country; following the procedures of the previous Bank road projects, these
sections have been grouped into 26 bidding units, as described in Table 10.
The average value of each unit is about US$400,000. Contractors may bid
simultaneously on any combination of contracts. NBR expects that about
eight to ten firms will be successful in winning the paving works and that
thie average value of an individual contract award will be about US$1 million,
although it could be much higher. The paving works will be carried out be-
tween May and October 1971.                                                                   J
4.14      NBR has established a realistic timetable for prequalification and
bidding which will permit all the project works to begin in May 1971, the
start of the Finnish construction season. To meet this date, biL, will be
invited in January/February 1971. Since the project work sites are snow-
bound from early November through March, the Bank had agreed that NBR
should invite prequalification in September 1970 so that contractors could
inspect the sites. The prequalification was completed in December 1970 and
showed that all 11 interested foreign contractors were eligible to bid on
the project works (Expressway - 3 Swedish/Finnish joint ventures, 1 English,
1 German, 1 Italian, and 1 Yugoslav; Paving - 1 Swedish, 1 Italian,
and 1 Yugoslav). Eight Finnish firms were prequalified for the expressway
works and 23 for the paving works. The period for prequalification was 45
days and for bidding it will be 60 days.

F.   Disbursements
4.15      On the basis of the above timing, the forecast: of quarterly dis-
bursements for individual project elements is indicated in Table 11 and is
summarized as follows (US$ million equivalent):
Project year a/         1     2      3      rotal
Bank participation    6.8   3.5   2.7   .13.0
a/   Project year is calculated from the quarter in which the loan is
*             signed.
Loan proceeds will finance a percentage of payments to construction con-
tractors for the works included in the project; 35% of expressway payments
and 45% of paving payments. Surplus funds in the loan account when the
project has been completed will be cancelled.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Tattariharju-Jarvenpaa Expressway
5.01      The purpose of the proposed expressway is to alleviate congestion
on the present road and to meet the increasing demand for road transport
facilities. Without the new facility, the expected futuxe traffic demand
could not be met.
5.02      The existing highway forms part of the Main Road 4-5 connecting
Helsinki, the capital, with central and northern Finland.  About 35% of the
total vehicle fleet is registered within the influence area of the highway.
Industrial production, population, and vehicle registration in the areas
immediately adjacent to the highway have been growing faster than the
national average.
5.03      ADT on the existing highway section is about 10,100 units and,
reflecting Finland's developed economy, it is made up primarily of light
vehicles (about 85%). Between 1960 and 1969, traffic increased at an
annual rate of about 15%; between 1965 and 1969, it increased at about
10% p.a. Based on expected population and motorization growth in the
expressway's zone of influence, and on a review of detailed traffic fore-
casts made by the NBR and other entities, it is assumed that light traffic
will grow at an annual rate of 10% until 1975 and then gradually decline
to 5% p.a. by 1991, and that for the same period heavy vehicle traffic will
decline from 6% to 3.5% p.a. (Table 12). The growth rates are considered
reasonable.



- 14 -
5.04      With increasing traffic volumes, vehicle operating costs and time
losses will increase as the existing road becomes more and more congested.
In addition, since the forecast traffic exceeds the capacity of the exist-
ing road, some potential traffic will not be accommodated. The proposed
expressway will therefore produce the following benefits:
(a) savings in vehicle operating and time costs for traffic
diverted to the expressway when it is constructed (i.e.,
about 90% of the total traffic);
(b) benefits accruing to the "induced" traffic that are made
possible as a result of the additional capacity and improved
service to be provided by the expressway (i.e., traffic
exceeding the capacity of the present facility); and
(c) savings in vehicle operating and time costs for traffic
remaining on the existing road as a result of decreased
congestion (i.e., about 10% of the total traffic).
5.05      Without the project expressway, it has been assumed by the NBR
that an ADT of about 25,000 vehicles is the ultimaLte physical capacity of
the existing highway at the minimum service level (with unstable traffic
flow and occasional stoppages). This is expectedi to be reached about 1979,
at which time unit vehicle operating and time cost:s will reach a maximum;
they will remain constant thereafter. Based on studies in Finland and in
other Scandinavian countries, appropriate vehicle operating and time costs
on the expressway have been determined. I/ A comparison of the future costs
of transport on the two roads for the projected traffic volume has been
made to determine the principal benefits, (a), (b), and (c) above.
5.06      Benefits which have not been quantified are savings due to decon-
gestion in vehicle operating and time costs on the approach and parallel
roads, and the increase in safety and comfort of the travellers.  An example   eW
of this type of benefit is NBR's estimate of accidents with and without the
expressway, which shows about 250 fewer accidents with the expressway in
1975 alone.
1/   Vehicle operating and time costs on the existing road are about Fmk 0.179
per km (US04.3) for light vehicles and Fmk 0.514 (UStl2.2) for heavy
vehicles.  In the estimation, the cost of timne of drivers of buses and
trucks was measured by their average saLaries. For passengers of private
cars and buses, the value of time has been assumed to equal the net na-
tional product per capita per hour. It is considered appropriate to
include time cost in a relatively developed country like Finland with
little unemployment (see Annex). Reduction in vehicle operating and
time costs in the opening year of the expressway compared to costs on
the existing road will be about 23Z for light vehicles and about 12%
for heavy vehicles (Table 13).



- 15 -
5.07      Considering the principal quantified benefits, and allowing for
additional maintenance costs because both the existing road and the express-
way must be maintained, the investment will yield an economic rate of re-
turn of 17% based on an assumed 30-year life for the expressway. The sen-
sitivity of this result was tested on the basis of a plus or minus 5%
change in construction costs, 20% change in traffic growth rates, and 20%
change in vehicle operating and time cost savings. This; resulted in a
range of 13% to 22% as the minimum and maximum possible returns. Returns
on the various combinations are given in Table 14. The expressway is,
therefore, justified.
B.   Paving Works
5.08      The project includes paving works for about 910 km of roads during
1971. With increasing traffic levels, it has become necessary to upgrade
the wearing surfaces of the existing network to avoid umduly high main-
tenance and vehicle operating costs. In 1964, NBR established appropriate
traffic levels at which it would be more economical to upgrade a given
roadway surface than to maintain it at increasingly higher costs. These
criteria were used to develop the paving programs included in the first,
second, and the proposed third highway projects. In fact, all the roads
included in the project's paving works have traffic volumes in excess of
the minimum levels.
5.09      Based on the NBR studies, annual maintenance costs for different
road surfaces at different traffic levels have been determined and used to
evaluate the project program. The costs include labor, materials, equip-
ment depreciation, administration, and supervision. These appear reasonable
and are summarized below:
Traffic Levels
*        Type of Road Surface          500 ADT              750 ADT           1500 ADT
Fmk      US$       Fmk      US$    Fmk         US$
Gravel                       3,330     790      4,100    7980   7,000    1,670
Oil-Gravel (cold mix)        1,200     290      1,750      420   3,100       740
Asphaltic Concrete           1,100     260      1,350      320   1,800       430
5.10      Improving the road pavements will also reduce vehicle operating
costs due to smoother surfaces and/or improved operational characteristics;
e.g., all-weather, less slippery, etc. Based on the experience in Finland
and on studies made in other Scandinavian countries, NBR estimates that
improving the various roadway surfaces included in the project will reduce
vehicle operating costs by about 10%, or Fmk 0.01 per kmi for cars and Fmk 0.05
for trucks.  These estimated savings are rather conservative, particularly in
respect to upgrading of gravel surfaces.
5.11      The average economic life has been taken at eight years for the
hot-mix type of surfaces included in the project. The annual rate of traf-
fic growth for the roads to be paved lhas been conservati,vely taken at 6%



- 16 -
compared with about 9% average traffic growth on all highways between 1965
and 1969. Based on savings in maintenance and vehicle operating costs,
the paving works will yield a rate of return of 30% on the investment.
Of the 96 road sections to be paved in the project, the three having the
lowest traffic levels and the highest improvement costs were examined in
some detail and produced acceptable rates of return in the 10-15% range.
Even if the annual traffic growth rate and estimated benefits were reduced
by 20%, and the investment increased by 5%, the pairing works will still
give an average rate of return of about 20%. These results indicate that
the works are well justified.
VI. RECOMMENDATI0NS
6.01      During loan negotiations, the Government agreed that it will con-
tinue to take adequate measures for controlling mo3tor vehicle weight limit-
ations, for collecting and analyzing traffic and economic data for highway
planning purposes, and for maintaining its public road network.  The tech-
nical and financial arrangements for project execuition were also agreed and
confirmation was obtained that adequate local financing for the project has
been included in the Government's budget for 1971. The project provides a
suitable basis for a loan of US$13 million equivalent. A 15-year term, in-
cluding a three-year period of grace, is appropriate.

THIRD HimGHAY PRUJECT
The Value of Time in Transportation Projects
A. General-
1.        Reductions in traveling time are often an important benefit result-
ing from transport investment. Their economic value is evidenced by the wil-
lingness of users to pay to save time in particular circumstances (e.g., high-
way tolls, express train, and air freight and passenger fares).  In a number
of countries road users, personal as well as commercial, pay substantial high-
way tolls to avoid driving on slower toll-free roads. The Bank Group has helped
finance such facilities in Japan and Mexico. Another example of the fact that
time is money is the increasing use of air travel in all countries for both busi-
ness and personal reasons, including the early "extra"! charge for travel by jet
as compared with the slower propeller planes. Similarly, in some countries,
passengers pay more to travel by express buses (e.g., Korea) or express trains
(e.g., the Bank-financed Tokaido Line in Japan) than on siower services. In com-
mercial activity, slow transport may mean working capital is "locked-up" in
higher inventories and involves greater interest payments.  Similarly, quicker
transport may mean goods can be marketed which would otherwise deteriorate and
be unsalabil (or be sold at a lower price). It can be concluded, therefore,
that time is a "commodity" for which people may be prepared to pay, since it
may make possible an increase in output or in consuniers' satisfaction. Time sav-
ings, therefore, may be logically considered in the assessment of transport
projects. In practice, however, it is difficult to evaluate time savings in
money terms because they are not usually sold at clearly-defined market prices.
2.        The question of time savings for business/freight use is largely
approached from either a cost-savings or additional revenue-earnings approach
(see B xt section).
3.        Conceptually, the net benefits to personal transport users of the re-
duced travel time from an investment may be thought of as the total value which
they would place on the time saved.  This implies that the money values "gained"
by each beneficiary can be added together without differentiation. That is, the
distribution of income is taken as given and no we:Lghting is made of the value
of time savings to one group as compared with those to another group. This ap-
proach is necessary in an economy in which people are free to use their disposabl
incomes (after any correction of income distribution distortions by taxes or
other ways).

Economics and Policy, September 1969, pp. 279-286.

4.        There is substanitial transport economiQ literature on the question
of determ:ining the vaiue of time savings. From this, it appears there are
good reasons to believe that the value of travel tile for personal use is
strongly correlated with income and, as a result, it would be meaningful to
express a person's valuatiorn of that. time in terms of his wage rate or salary.
Actual tests on this basis suggest thaw traveling times (especially in the case
of journeys to work) are evaluated by users at about, one--third of their partic-
ular hourly rate of pay. The results, however, cannot be regarded as conclu-
sive nor can they be indiscrimainately applied to other si.tuations than those
tested.
B. Methods of Valuing Time Savings
5.        The various methods which have been used to estimate the value of
time savings fall within four broad categories:l/
(a)  Commercial
(i) Revenue (net operating profit) Method.: This assumes that
taie savings are translated into additional revenue-earning
miles at a reduced average cost per mile. The method as-
sumes that this increase in transportation output takes place
over a range where marginal revenue and marginal variable
costs of the transport firm are constant. Certain vehicle
and labor costs, which vary with hours operated but not with
miles operated, are assumed to remain fixed as more miles
are run in the time saved. While this method has certain
empirical advantages and uses the well-known "economic theory
of the firm", its wealmesses are the 'Lack of knowledge of
fixed and variable costs of revenue-ea.rning transport firms
in relation to time savings the questionability of the im-
plied assumption that time saved generates additional gross
revenues,and the difficulties of localizing data for the users
of one particular highway.
(ii)  Cost Savings Method:  This assume-s thbtt all time savings
will be used and lead to savings in the resources needed to
perform a given volu,me of transport output. As used by
Beeseley and Reynolds on the M-4 (Lonclon-Birmingham Motorway)
in the United Kingdom, this method meant, in effect, that
one hour of time saved for trucks and buses was worth one
hour of drisers' and helpers' wages plus one hour of time
for vehicle maintenance costs and overhead (establishment)
costs plus interest for one hour on such vehicle investment
costs as are saved. This method has certain empirical ad-
vantages compared to the revenue approach, (i) above. A
greater localization of data is possible, but too little is
known about the time-associated cost fuactions of the trans-
port firms.

(b) Personal and Commercial
(i) Cost of Time Method: This is different from the other
methods in that values of time are derived by finding
the costs of producing time savings through alternative
highway designs and alternative construction routes.
In other words, it does not calculate the value of time,
but tells the planner the marginal cost of time which he
is implying when he decides that a given policy/solution
(and its costs) is the optimum. While this obviates the
need to determine the absolute value of time, a judgment
ultimately has to be made whether the user would be wil-
ling to pay this sum.
(ii)  Willingness to Pay Method:  This attempts to measure the
value of time in an assumed market framework.  It basic-
ally assumes that to calculate the maximum value which
users would be willing -to pay includes their "consumer
surplus" over what they might pay, for example, by way
of tolls. It is based on a satisfaction-optimizing be-
havior in the case of passenger cars and a cost-minimizing
behavior in the case of truck operators, under the con-
straint that alternative courses of action are available.
Application of this method is cceiplex and the generation
of data appears to be difficult and expensive, particular-
ly because the value of time depends on the consumption
mixibr which time is needed.
C. The Case of Finland
6.        In Finland, as in a number of other countrLes, efforts have been made
to establish the value of time in connection with transportation investments.
In 1967, for example, a study based on interviews asked transport users in the
greater Helsinki area how much they would pay in order to save transport/travel-
ing time (Method (b),(ii), para. 5 above).  The average value arrived at was
Fmk 2.07 (US $0.49) per person per hour.
7.        For the project dealt with in this report, the authorities arrived at
the value of time for passengers (including private car drivers) by dividing
the net national product per head by 2,400 working hours (representing the as-
sumed average working hours). This value is then used for all passenger travel
purposes and amounts to Fmk 1.65 (US $0.39) per person per hour in 1967, or
about 20% lower than the above interview evaluations. Given an average car oc-
cupancy of 1.9 persons, this is equivalent to Fmk 3.14 (US $0.751 per car hour.
8.        As mentioned above (para. 3), actual tests have concluded that the
average value of time per passenger hour is about one-third of the hourly wage
of users.  Information on the wages of users of the Tattariharju-Jarvenpaa High-
way is not available.  The net national product per llead, however, is about 40%
of the average hourly manufacturing wage in Finland. In practice, the average
wage of car owners in Finland exceeds the average of all employees in manufactur-
ing, and the average income in the service area of the proposed expressway is
above that of the national average, so that the time, value used will be about
one-third of the hourly wage of the users.

9.        For the drivers of buses and trucks the value of time savings was taken
as being equal to their salaries (Method (a),(ii), para. 5 above).
D. Other Examles
10.       As compared with the following examples, the Finland figures appears
reasonable (for better comparison the figures in parentheses indicate adjusted
1969 time values on the assumption of a 4% p.a. increase):
United States     US $2.00 per passenger hourl/    (US $2.16).
Japan             US $1.00 per passenger hour2/    (us $1.27>.
France            US $0.76 per passenger hour3!    (US $0.82)
Sweden            US $0.58 per passenger horlr/    (US $0.74)
Lebanon           US $0.52 per passenger hour/    (US $0.53)
United Kingdom    US $0.46 per passenger houri/      US $0.50
Norway            US $0.37 per passenger hour7!      US $0.51)
E.  Conclusion
11.       It would appear, therefore, that a figure of Fmk 1.65 (US $0.39) per
person per hour in 1967 (US $0.43 in 1969) can be accepted as a reasonable esti-
mate; it was used to calculate the economic rate of return on the proposed ex-
pressway. In order to test the sensitivity of the rate of return to dcanges in
time value, the above figure was reduced by 30%, and even on this basis the ex-
pressway yielded a satisfactory return.

Highway Research Record, No. 245, 1968, concluded that the value of time
connected with travel to and from work was US $2.82.

figure concerns vacation and leisure travel. The value of time for personal
purposes is given as US $0.94 per hour and for business as US $1.83.
