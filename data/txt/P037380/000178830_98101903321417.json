This is part\n            of a planned 138 km expressway between Helsinki and Lusi, a\n            town 40 km north of Lahti. The rapid development of the area\n            between Helsinki and Lahti and the expected increase in\n            traffic indicate a need to extend the expressway to Lusi,\n            where traffic then fans out to the north and northeast; and\n            (b) the paving of about 910 km of roads included in the\n            Government's 1971 paving program which comprises about\n            2,530 km of roads."}, "docdt": "1971-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
