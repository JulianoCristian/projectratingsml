The project consists\n            of: 1) rehabilitating and upgrading 100 km of dikes along\n            the eastern shore of Hirmand Lake; 2) rehabilitating and\n            upgrading 130 km of dikes along both sides of the Sistan\n            River, and providing a bridge across the river; 3) upgrading\n            30 km of dikes along the Niatak floodway, including six\n            bridges and an intake structure; 4) remodelling the feeder\n            canal to three existing storage reservoirs; 5) developing a\n            rock quarry; 6) strengthening project management; 7)\n            undertaking physical and mathematical modelling works for\n            river training; 8) providing maintenance equipment and\n            vehicles; 9) providing a flood warning program; and 10)\n            acquiring land for rehabilitating flood control works."}, "docdt": "1992-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
