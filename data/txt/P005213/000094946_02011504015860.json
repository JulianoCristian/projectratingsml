Lessons first point at the need for\n            detailed designs, and tender documents to be ready at loan\n            effectiveness, so as not to delay construction works,\n            regardless of a perceived urgency to present the project to\n            the Board prior to the completeness of its preparation. This\n            in fact caused not only construction delays, but distracted\n            attention to implementation as a result of insufficient\n            preparation. Likewise, technical feasibility of local\n            contractors should be assessed, exemplified in this case by\n            the absence of local technology for protecting dikes during\n            construction. Fortunately, reliable consultants were able to\n            implement contractual incentives, an effective option to\n            prod implementation, and management. The long lending\n            suspension to Iran, calls for a financial management plan,\n            to be partly expressed in a detailed implementation manual,\n            and thus, circumvent the lack of experience with Bank\n            procedures, procurement, and disbursement. Finally, linking\n            Bank disbursements in the local currency - an exchange rate\n            with little relevance to that of the Tehran stock exchange -\n            produced negative results; rather, disbursements should have\n            been linked to the Tehran stock exchange."}, "docdt": "2001-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
