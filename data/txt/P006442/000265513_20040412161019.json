The Management announces it\n            is well aware of the problems described in the Request and\n            provides data concerning the completion of the irrigation\n            projects.  The Response addresses the complaints that the\n            Bank's guidelines were not followed and that the\n            resettled communities are unable to resume production\n            because of the irrigation problems. The Management Response\n            elaborates on the fact that other agencies were primarily\n            responsible for several aspects of the project and that the\n            Management's involvement was therefore limited.  The\n            Management concludes that it complied with all their\n            guidelines, but there were still delays and insufficiencies\n            throughout the implementation of  the project.  Through\n            cooperation with the Government of Brazil and other agencies\n            involved with the project, the Management feels that they\n            will complete the project."}, "docdt": "1997-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
