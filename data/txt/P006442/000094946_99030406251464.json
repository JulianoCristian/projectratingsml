unsatisfactory.\n            The following are some of the key lessons learned: 1) Time\n            demands mandated a simpler project design. 2) The\n            Bank's resettlement policy can sometimes create\n            entitlements which imply difficult trade-offs. 3) Realistic\n            assessment of the true costs of the irrigation/production\n            package is essential. 4) Issues of subsidies for energy\n            supply should be discussed and agreed during preparation and\n            included in resettlement agreements signed by the affected\n            parties. 5) In an inflationary environment and where large\n            investments are involved, special attention to financial\n            estimation is required to reduce risks. 6) Resettlement\n            projects may be inappropriate candidates for economic\n            justification in their own right. 7) There were clear\n            differences between the challenges posed by urban\n            resettlement and rural resettlement. 8) The Bank should\n            pursue the full support of state and local authorities for\n            the public utilities, social services, and other elements of\n            resettlement propjets. 9) Disbursement percentages on major\n            project components should be considered strategically,\n            factoring in project objectives and timing. 10)\n            Participation of resettlers in decision-making if conducted\n            in a pressured, politically charged environment can force\n            poor decisions."}, "docdt":
