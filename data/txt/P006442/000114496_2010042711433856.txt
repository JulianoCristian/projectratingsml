Dear Sirs:
            Re:   Loan 2883-BR (Itaparica Resettlement and
                  Irrigation Project)
                  Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated December 7, 1987, between International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras 
S.A. (ELETROBRAS), as
amended, for the above Loan.
The Bank has received a request from ELETROBRAS and SEAIN to modify Schedule 1 
of the Loan Agreement in order to allow for the financing of 50% of expenditures for 
construction of civil works between February and July 1993, and 15% thereafter.
A Bank mission reviewing the implementation of the Project at the beginning of 
March 1993, has informed me that counterpart requirements for Project implementation 
in 1993, amounting to about US$83.1 million, have already been committed by the 
Federal Government (US$50.0 million), and ELETROBRAS (US$33.1 million). Also, 
construction of irriigation works is progressing satisfactorily, and that in order to 
avoid a disruption in the construction program, ELETROBRAS is committed to advance the 
counterpart funds required until July 1993, when it is expected that the funds 
allocated in the Federal Budget will start to be released by the National Treasury.
In consideration to the satisfactory performance of the Borrower and the 
Executing Agency, and our commitment to the completion of the rural infrastructure, 
including the irrigation works, the Bank, hereby, concurs in changing the percentage 
of expenditures for civil works between February 1993 and June 30, 1993, and to be 
financed under Category 1 (Civil Works) of the Table set forth in Paragraph 1 of 
Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement. 
The table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 (Withdrawals of the Proceeds of 
the Loan) to the Loan Agreement has, therefore, been amended to read as follows:
                        Amount of the
                        Loan Allocated
                        (Expressed in     % of Fxpenditures
    "Category           US Equivalent)    to be Financed
(1) Civil Works,        114,000,000.00    24% for expenditures made
                                          until January 31,

                                          1993 and June 30, 1993;
                                          15% thereafter.

(3) Consultants          11,000,000.00    100% of foreign
                                          expenditures, and 64% of
                                          local expenditures.
(4) Unallocated
      TOTAL             232,000,000.00"

of confirmation on the attached copy of this letter and returning it to us.  This 
amending letter shall become effective after the Bank receives the form of 
confirmation duly countersigned by the authorized representatives of the Guarantor and
