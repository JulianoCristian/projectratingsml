Dear Sirs:
Re:
Loans 2883 BR and 2893-1 BR
Itaparica Resettlement and Irrigation Project
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated December 7, 1987, between the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Centrais 
Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. ELETROBRAS, as amended, for the above Loans.
The Bank has received a request from CHESF and ELETROBRAS to extend the, period 
of financing of 100% of expenditures for civil works from June 30, 1992 to November 
30, 1992.
A Bank mission in June 1992 reviewed the implementation of the project and has 
informed me that: (i) ELETROBRAS is fully complying with its financial obligations for 
project implementation during 1992; (ii) CHESF has re-initiated the construction of 
irrigation works in most of the project areas; and, (iii) ELETROBRAS, CHESF and the 
Guarantor have agreed on a new revised financing plan, approved by the Bank, for the 
carrying out of the project activities for 1992.  We are also pleased to learn that 
the resettled population is satisfied with recent developments.
In consideration of the satisfactory performance by the Borrower and the 
executing Agency and of our commitment to the rapid conclusion of the irrigation 
works, the Bank hereby extends the
period of financing of 100% of expenditures for civil works to November 30, 1992.
The table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 (Withdrawals of the Proceeds of 
the Loan) to the Loan Agreement has therefore been amended as attached.
We are making the above exceptional arrangements with the explicit understanding 
that any funding delays after November 30, 1992, by ELETROBRAS or the Guarantor will

cause the Bank to consider applying the remedies available to it under the Loan and 
the Guarantee Agreements.
If you agree with the foregoing proposal, please so indicate by signing the form 
of confirmation on the attached copy of this letter and returning it to us.  This 
amending letter shall become effective after the Bank receives the form of 
confirmation duly countersigned by the authorized representatives of the Guarantor, 
the Borrower, and CHESF.
Because of their interest in this matter, we are sending copies of this letter 
to Ambassador Jose Artur Denot de Medeiros, Diretor, Departamento de Assuntos 
Internacionais (DEAIN); Prof.
Tercio Sampaio Ferraz Junior, Procurador Geral da Fazenda Nacional (PGFN); Dr. Armando 
de Araujo, Secretario Nacional de Energia; Dr. Francisco Roberto Andre Gros, 
Presidente, Banco Central do  Brasil (BACEN); Dr. Roberto Eigueiredo Guimaraes, 
Director, Departamento do Tesouro Nacional (DTN); Mr. George Papadopoulos, 
Representate Residente do Banco Mundial (IBRD-Brasilia); and Mr. Christoph
Diewald, Chefe do Banco Mundial, (IBRD-Recife).
