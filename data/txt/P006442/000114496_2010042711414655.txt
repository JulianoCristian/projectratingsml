Dear Sirs:
      Re:
Loan 2883-BR (Itaparica Resettlement and Irrigation
Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated December 7, 1987, between International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras 
S.A. (ELETROBRAS), as
amended, for the above Loan.
The Bank has received a request from CHESF and ELETROBRAS to modify Schedule I 
of the Loan Agreement in order to allow financing of 100% of services provided by 
foreign consultants and 64% of services provided by local consultants.
A Bank mission in November and December 1992 reviewed the implementation of the 
project ,and has informed me that project implementation is moving forward, in 
accordance with the timetable
approved by the bank in June 1992, and that for this reason the social tension in the 
project area has been reduced significantly. Furthermore, two international 
joint-ventures of consulting firms,
contracted by CODEVASF to provide production support services to the farmers, have 
started working in the area, and CHESF and CODEVASF agreed to put into practice the 
approved production action plan at the beginning of the year, including the 
organization of irrigation districts in each irrigated scheme.
In consideration of the satisfactory performance by the Borrower and the 
Executing Agency, and of our commitment to the satisfactory development of the 
production support activities, the
Bank hereby concurs in changing the percentages of expenditures to be financed under 
Category 3 (Consultants Service) of Schedule I of the Loan Agreement.
The table set forth in paragraph I of Schedule- I (Withdrawals of the Proceeds 
of the Loan) to the Loan Agreement has therefore been amended as following:
                        "Amount of the
                        Loan Allocated
                        Expressed in      % of Expenditures
    Category            US Equivalent)    to be Financed
(1) Civil Works         114,000,000.00    100% until January 31,

                                          1993 or until withdrawals
                                          under this Category have
                                          reached an aggregate
                                          amount equivalent to
                                          US$93.0 million, whichever
                                          comes first, and 24%
                                          thereafter.
(2) Goods               107,000,000.00    100%
(3) Consultants          11,000,000.00    100% of foreign
                                          expenditures, and 64% of
                                          local expenditures.
(4) Unallocated
            TOTAL       232,000,000.00"
If you agree with the foregoing proposal, please so indicate by signing the form 
of confirmation on the attached copy of this letter and returning it to us.  This 
amending letter shall become effective after the Bank receives the form of 
confirmation duly countersigned by the authorized representatives of the Guarantor and 
the Borrower.
Because of their interest in this matter, we are sending copies of this letter 
to Dr. Marcos Josd Lopes, Presidente of CHESF; Ambassador Jose Artur Denot de 
Medeiros, Secretario de Assuntos
Internacionais (SEAIN); Dr. Paulo Lustosa, Secretario Executivo de Integraggo Regional
