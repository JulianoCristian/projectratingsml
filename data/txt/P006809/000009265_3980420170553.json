Bank performance and Borrower performance were\n            also highly satisfactory. The sustainability of main project\n            achievements is likely. The project achieved its stated\n            objectives of policy change, commercial financial\n            institution participation, and simplification of loan\n            processing. The Corporacion Financiera Popular (CFP), the\n            state development bank established to support small and\n            medium scale enterprises, was unable to meet the performance\n            indicators that were required for the project. The\n            Government decided to privatize it in April 1992 and change\n            its name to the Corporacion Financiera de Desarrollo (CFD).\n            As a result of these reforms, CFD viability has increased,\n            its institutional culture is changing, and its management\n            and practices have improved. The four general lessons\n            learned are: all key elements needed for project success\n            should be accomplished prior to project effectiveness; those\n            responsible for implementing a project component must feel\n            ownership; coordination with multilateral and other funding\n            agencies and the Government on sector policy is important to\n            ensure consistent approaches and avoid duplication of\n            effort; and maintaining the focus of supervision on\n            achieving broad development goals combined with a degree of\n            pragmatism regarding conditionality can improve project\n            outcome. Lessons regarding small and medium enterprise\n            development are also described in the report."}, "docdt": "1994-10-11T00:00:00Z"}
