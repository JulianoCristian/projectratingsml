"The project outcome is satisfactory, and\n            project sustainability is highly likely. Overall, World Bank\n            performance is satisfactory: Well-defined and well-targeted\n            activities focus on project objectives, and appropriate\n            support toward their completion fostered a positive\n            relationship between Bank and Borrower and ultimately led to\n            successful project completion. Overall Borrower performance\n            is rated as highly likely for its quality inputs during\n            project preparation and highly competent project\n            implementation. Lessons learned include the following:\n            Establishing parallel institutions may undermine\n            stakeholders' support for the project. Stakeholder\n            consultation and participation at the early stages of\n            project preparation promotes ownership and, consequently,\n            sustainability. Education Improvement Projects (PMEs) have a\n            substantial impact that go betond the classroom. PME\n            financial transfers should be considered grants, rather than\n            sub-projects, in the legal and disbursement arrangements\n            made during project preparation. A monitoring and evaluation\n            system is needed to retro-feed decisionmakers with timely\n            and accurate information. Management information systems\n            must carefully balance appropriate technology with adequate\n            training and inclusion of end-users in the design stage.\n            Finally, generating demand through public campaigns is key\n            to making quantum progress in enrollment."}, "docdt": "2002-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
