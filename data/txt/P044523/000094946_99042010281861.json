The Basic Health Project is not\n            only supported, but fully consistent with the CAS regarding\n            the health, nutrition, and population sectors. The objective\n            of the project is to support a viable basic health system\n            for primary health care, public health, and disease control.\n            The four main components are: 1) The primary health care\n            component, will establish a system for delivery and\n            management of cost-effective health services, to include\n            four sub-components: development of family medicine,\n            upgrading university programs in the subject; infrastructure\n            and equipment, to support civil works and essential medical\n            equipment; management training and capacity building, to\n            provide technical assistance in legislation formulation;\n            and, the management and performance incentives, to suport\n            the development and pilot implementation of primary care\n            remuneration. 2) The public health and disease control\n            component will support capacity building, and assist towards\n            disease control and prevention. 3) The accreditation and\n            quality assurance component, though limited in scope, will\n            provide technical assistance for an early stage quality\n            improvement strategy. 4) The project management component\n            will provide institutional building support."}, "docdt": "1999-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
