sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial, Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from this project included the\n            following: 1) The quality of supervision of this project was\n            one that the standard supervision budget does not ordinarily\n            support-the real level of effort was much higher and\n            achieved through cross-subsidies from other tasks. 2) More\n            support should have been provided during preparation,\n            especially since the project was substantially more complex\n            than previous Bank-financed health projects in the country\n            and experience with a technical assistance- and\n            reform-intensive project was lacking. 3) The Project\n            succeeded in both meeting its objectives and receiving the\n            full support of government while doing so; and these in turn\n            laid a strong foundation for future scale-up efforts, both\n            in terms of a powerful demonstration effect and of\n            government buy-in to the reform process. 4) Change\n            management, public relations, and communications are\n            critical. 5) Pilot activities should be designed and\n            implemented with a view to scaling-up from the outset. 6)\n            There were lost opportunities for monitoring and evaluation.\n            7) The use of relatively large, multi-year\n            single-institution contracts was a sensible strategy for a\n            new borrower with complex TA requirements and limited\n            capacity to manage multiple consultants or contracts. The\n            effectiveness of these efforts is only called into question\n            the linkages between the agencies that received support and\n            the broader health system context was fragile. 8) Provider\n            training and quality assurance activities provided a strong\n            foundation for developing continuing medical education."}, "docdt": "2004-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
