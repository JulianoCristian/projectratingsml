access to financial services to low-income populations inMadagascar. The outcome indicators
have beenrevisedto reflect higher impact achievedby (i)   extending financial services to a greater
number (300,000) of low income populations, (ii)   reachingoperational sustainability for all five
microfinance Savings and LoanAssociations (SLA) networks, and (iii)    delivering a supportive
legal framework for the microfinance industryinMadagascar.

Does the scaled-up or restructured project trigger any new safeguard policies? No.

I. Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to provide an
additional credit in an amount o f US$5 million to the Republic o f Madagascar for the
Microfinance Project (P052186), Cr. 3217-MAG. It also proposes to extend the closing
date o f the original Development Credit Agreement by 18 months, from December 31,
2007 to June 30, 2009. The proposed additional credit will be on standard IDA terms
with a maturity o f40 years andcommitment fees not to exceed 0.5 percent.

2.      The proposed additional credit would help finance the costs associated with the
financing gap under the current IDA-financed project until a multi-donor sector wide
(SWAP) financial sector program is in place. The SWAP will include a microfinance
component which will incorporate activities planned inPhases 2 and 3 o f the original 15-
year microfinance APL. The additional credit would help to support full implementation
o f activities under phase 1 o f the microfinance project which were scaled back due to
lack o f resources such as providing technical assistance for the microfinance Savings and
LoanAssociations (SLA) networks as well as pursuingthe national training program.

3.      The additional credit will also allow the project to expand its activities beyond the
results originally sought under Phase Iand scale up the project's impact and development
effectiveness. Specifically, the additional financing will make it possible for the project
to: (i)provide technical assistance to microfinance SLA networks to increase their
membership to 300,000 low income individuals, o f which 50 percent are women, to
increase savings, and credit outstanding by at least 25 percent and to reach operational
self-sufficiency for all five networks currently in operation in the provinces o f
Antananarivo, Antsiranana, Fianarantsoa, and Toamasina; (ii)    support the implementation
o f the Microfinance law and the adoption o f prudential regulation that are in line with
international best practice; (iii)strengthen the capacity o f the Central Bank o f
Madagascar (CBM) to properly supervise Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) licensed
under the new law; and (iv) advance further the establishment o f the national training
program on microfinance. These activities will enhance the economic justification o f the
project by increasing the number o f beneficiary institutions and clients and providing a
framework for increasing the operational self sustainability and viability o f the
microfinance networks and sustaining the training provided.

4.      The additional credit will also make it possible to continue providing, through the
Banking Commission o f Madagascar (CSBF), support to MFIs in the other provinces o f
Mahajanga and Toliary. In addition, the project will be able to join forces with other
donors such as the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) in providing technical
assistance to recent Government initiatives such as the credit bureau andpayment system.




                                              2

Partnership arrangements:

5.     Although no formal partnership or co-financing arrangements exist, the project
will continue to collaborate closely with other donors involved in the microfinance
industry in Madagascar including UnitedNations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF),
MCA, and the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). The MFI networks
supported by the project will benefit from activities financed by these development
partnersincluding capacitybuildingfunds, payment system, credit bureau initiative and a
database for monitoring all MFIs inthe country.


11.    BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancinginthe amountofUS$5
       million.

6.     The Madagascar Microfinance Project was designed as a 15-year Adaptable
Program Loan (APL) to be implemented in three phases o f five years each. The first
phase o f the project became effective in 1999.          The IDA credit supporting the
Microfinance Project in the amount o f SDR 12.1 million (US$16.4 million equivalent)
was approved on May 20, 1999, and became effective on October 28, 1999. The initial
closing date o f the project o f December 31, 2004 has been extended three times to
December 31, 2007.      The extensions were granted to allow the project to complete
original activities whose implementation had been severely disrupted by the political and
economic crisis that affected the country in the wake o f the December 2001 Presidential
elections. Other unforeseen events, such as the sudden death of the project coordinator,
caused additional delays.    As o f March 5, 2007, 97 percent o f the credit under the
microfinance project has been disbursed and the remaining balance i s fully committed
andexpected to be fully disbursed by June 2007, the approximate date o f effectiveness o f
the proposedAdditional Financing.

7.     The Credit agreement was amended once during implementation on January 23,
2003 to revise and update the disbursement table to provide, inter alia, for a temporary
12-month increase in the disbursement percentages o f certain categories o f expenditures,
increase the amount o f the authorized allocation for the project implementation unit
(AGEPMF) Special Account andprovide for the regular preparation and transmission o f
financial monitoring reports.

8.     The project's original objective o f increasing long term access to financial
services to low-income populations in Madagascar remains unchanged. The project has
performed well in general and has exceeded its performance indicators resulting in a
rating o f Highly Satisfactory on the Project Development Objectives and Satisfactory on
Implementation Progress over the past twelve months. At end-December 2006, the five
microfinance SLA networks that have been supported by the project served more than
170,000 clients (against a target o f 72,469) across 150 retail organizations; they
represented more than 70 percent o f all microfinance savings in the country and the
networks' loans and deposits continue to grow at 25 percent annually.         Operational
sustainability reached an average o f 122 percent (against a minimumtarget o f 19 percent)


                                             3

in the five networks. However, given that the networks are still not financially self-
sustainable, their status remains fragile and they will continue to require donor support
for the delivery o f necessary technical assistance for their member organizations. The
project has also helped the Government adopt a new Microfinance Law and supported the
Central Bank's efforts to update prudential regulations for MFIs to conform to
international guidelines. The pilot training program has involved all microfinance
institutions in Madagascar and helped increase knowledge about best practices in
microfinance among practitioners.

9.      In2005, the GovernmentofMadagascarrequestedthe Bankto startpreparingthe
second microfinance APL as originally planned. At the same time, the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund were undertaking a joint Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP).       The FSAP and the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), both
undertaken in 2005, concluded that access to formal financial services in Madagascar
remained very low. Deficiencies in the legal, regulatory and informational environment
limited access to credit and other financial services, particularly for private sector
enterprises. This coupled with an inefficient state-dominated insurance sector, unreliable
payment systems, and an unfunded and unsustainable pension system, limited the
financial sector's ability to contribute to growth.

10.     Based on the conclusions and recommendations o f the FSAP and the ICA, the
Government and IDA agreed not to proceed with the second and third phases o f the
microfinance APL and instead to scale up to a broader financial sector program to
address some o f these key obstacles to financial sector development. The Government i s
currently developing a Financial Sector Development Strategy and action plan for its
implementationwith the help o f the World Bank and other donors which will serve as the
basis o f a sector wide program for financial sector development inthe coming years.

11.     The additional credit was requested by the Government to (i) the authorities
                                                                       allow
to continue to provide crucial technical assistance support to the microfinance SLA
networks, (ii)avoid a serious risk o f systemic failure o f the microfinance sector if
assistance were to stop abruptly, and (iii) a smooth transition to a broader financial
                                            ensure
sector program inpreparation. The additional financing is, therefore, being used as bridge
financing until the Government i s able to put together a sector-wide financial sector
program that would be supported by donors, including potentially by IDA. The
additional financing will not be a substitute for the original second and thirdphases o f the
microfinance APL. Activities slated to be undertaken under the remaining phases will be
folded into the microfinance component o f the financial sector program.


111.    ProposedChanges

12.     The main development objective of the project under the additional credit remains
unchanged and i s to increase long term access to financial services to low-income
populations in Madagascar. The additional financing will support achievement o f this
objective through the implementation o f the original four components and scaling up
results for higher impact:


                                               4

Component 1: Improving Legal and Regulatory Framework for Microfinance
Strengthening o f the legal and regulatory framework in which microfinance institutions
operate by supporting: (a) the formulation and implementation o f laws and regulations
aimed at providing a conducive environment for undertaking microfinance business
including the adoption o f best practice prudential and supervision norms, accounting plan
for MFIs, licensing requirements and procedures; (b) the strengthening o f the Central
Banko fMadagascar (CBM) capacityto supervise microfinance institutions through, inter
alia, training of staff and acquisition o f required technical advisory services and logistical
support; and (c) the establishment and implementation o f a monitoring database for
MFIs.

Component 2: Development o f Viable and Sustainable Microfinance Institutions
Development o f regional networks o f microfinance institutions by: (a) strengthening the
five existing SLA networks through technical assistance and capacity building in the
provinces o f Toamasina, Fianarantsoa, Antsiranana, and Antananarivo; (b) extending o f
SLA network financial services to women and disadvantaged groups', through outreach
programs, in isolated regions o f Madagascar and the development and introduction o f
new microfinance products to respond to client needs; (c) further developing linkages
between microfinance SLA networks and the banking sector; (d) supporting MFIs inthe
other provinces o f Mahajanga and Toliary through the supervision activities o f the
Central Bank o f Madagascar; and (e) the monitoring and evaluation o f SLA networks.

Component 3: BuildingCapacity inMicrofinance through Training
Incollaboration with the professional association of microfinance institutions, and other
private firms, continue delivery o f well tested training courses developed by C G M on
delinquency management, interest rate setting, accounting for MFIs, financial analysis,
business planning, information system, operational risk management and product
development; and new courses on regulations, accounting standards, and other topics
tailored to the specific needs o f the microfinance industryinMadagascar.

Component 4: Audits and Studies to Expand Microfinance Knowledge
The project will continue to carry out audits and studies including: (i)            operational and
financial audits o f the SLA networks; (ii) to evaluate the impact o f the Project on
                                                 studies
beneficiaries in each o f the provinces where SLA networks operate; and (iii)              studies on
other pertinent subjects relevant to the microfinance sector.

13.       Complementary proposed changes for the additional financing include project
costs, financing plan and schedule, closing date and implementation schedule. The total
additional project cost is estimated to be US$5 million. The breakdown o f estimated cost
is shown in Annex A. Annex B lays out the revised project performance monitoring
indicators. The financial plan, disbursement schedule, and a summary o f procurement
arrangements are provided inAnnex C.

1Disadvantaged groups are the very poor (most often women) inisolated areas who are not likely to benefit
fromthe microfinance SLA networks without a special outreach programbecause they lack very basic
skills, access to resources, and markets.


                                                   5

14.    To simplify reallocations among categories during the last two years o f project
implementation, allocations and disbursements under the new credit will be done under a
single category, grouping all the former categories. However, the project implementation
unitwillmaintainits internalaccountingsystem unchanged.

15.    As requested by the Government, an extension o f the project closing date from
December 31,2007 to June 30,2009 will be reflected inthe new Financing Agreement to
allow the project to complete the planned activities untilthe new financial sector program
is inplace.

16.    Implementation arrangements will be the same as for the ongoing project. The
CentralBank ofMadagascar, through the General Secretariat o fthe BankingCommission
(CSBF), would retain the overall responsibility for the implementation, coordination and
oversight of activities in component 1 o f the Project on improving legal and regulatory
framework for microfinance.         The Agence d 'Exe`cution du Projet Microfinance
(AGEPMF)will remainas the Project ImplementingEntitywith the overall responsibility
for the implementation, coordination and oversight o f all other project activities and
components. Project implementation will be coordinated by the Secretariat o f AGEPMF
headed by an Executive Secretary and a team o f technical experts in accordance with the
procedures set out in the Project Implementation Manual. To reflect ongoing efforts to
help build and use country systems and reduce reliance on a parallel project
implementation unit as per the Paris Declaration on "Harmonization and Alignment for
Development Results",       the AGEPMF would continue its integration into the
Microfinance Coordination Unit at the Ministry o f Finance and Budget with the
Executive Secretary being from the Ministry o f Finance and Budget. The Secretariat o f
AGEPMF will havethe responsibilities listedbelow:

    (a)     liaise with other development partners;
    (b)     prepare the annual work programs, the annual budget, the accounts, progress
            reports, quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs),             disbursement
            applications andprocurement documentation;
    (c)     arrange for the continuous monitoring and follow-up o f microfinance SLA
            networks;
    (d)     negotiate, sign and supervise the execution o f all consultant contracts;
    (e)     ensure that annual external audits are performed on all MFI networks, and
            semi-annual technical audits are carried out; and ensure that beneficiaries
            surveys and other studies are carried out;
    (f)     have the project's (AGEPME and CBM) records, accounts and financial
            statements audited each year by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.

17.    Inaccordance with Bank policy and procedures, the financial management (FM)
arrangements o f both implementing agencies (AGEPMF and CBM) have been reviewed
to determine whether they are acceptable to the Bank. This review was an update since
the FM systems o f these two implementing entities have already been assessed in the
context o f the on-going supervision o f the project. The overall conclusion o f this review



                                              6

is that the C B M and AGEPMF continue to maintain adequate financial management
systems and that the financial management risk i s moderate. However, to further improve
the systems the following measures need to be taken: (i)update o f the AGEPMF
accounting manual o f procedures to reflect agreed changes in the project organizational
structure/procedures and provide the models o f quarterly FMRs required under the
additional financing; (ii)finalization o f the recruitment process o f the Director o f Finance
for AGEPMF to address the vacancy o f this position since December 2006; and (iii)
organization o f a specific' training to ensure proper preparation of FMRs by CBM,
AGEPMF and regional microfinance SLA networks staff. It was noted with satisfaction
that the update o f the accounting manual o fprocedures andthe recruitment of the Finance
Director are inprogress and are expected to be finalized prior to credit effectiveness.

18.     The project's financial statements (to be submitted by the CSBF and AGEPMF)
will be audited annually by an international accounting firm acceptable to IDA, in
accordance with International Standards o f Auditing. Since the contract o f the current
auditor will expire this year, the recruitment process o f a new accounting auditor will be
launched. The auditors should be recruited within six months after the effectiveness date
o f the additional financing. The audit report will be submitted to IDA not later than 6
months after the end o f each fiscal year.

19.     Procurement arrangements under the proposed additional financing will be the
same as the arrangements under the ongoing microfinance project; however, the updated
Guidelines o f 2004 will apply. Procurement o f goods and works required for the project
and to be financed out o f the proceeds o f the credit shall be governed by the "Guidelines
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credit" published by the Bank in M a y
2004. Procurement o f consultants' services shall be governed by the "Guidelines for the
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers'' published by the
Bank in May 2004.        For each contract to be financed by the Credit, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior review
requirements, and time frame are outlined in the Project Financing Agreement, the
OperationalManual andthe Procurement Plan.

20.     A separate procurement plan for the additional financing has been prepared and
approved by the Bank procurement team. Since the previous agreed procurement plan
for the initial credit was governed by 1999's Procurement Guidelines, it will not be
integrated into the Global Procurement Plano f the initial Microfinance Project Credit and
will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.



IV.     Consistency with CAS andAfrica Action Plan

21.     The microfinance project i s consistent with the new CAS (to be presented to
Board inApril 2007) which recognizes that to achieve higher rates o f growth inclusive o f
all sectors o f the economy, Madagascar needs to consolidate recent achievements and
deepen policy reforms in critical sectors. The CAS analysis underscores the need to



                                                7

remove barriers to growth such as lack o f access to finance and factor markets (credit,
electricity, land) among others. Broad-based and inclusive financial systems significantly
raise growth, alleviate poverty and expand economic opportunity. The lack o f financial
services, inparticular deposit and loan services for the poor, has been demonstrated to be
a key obstacle for moving beyond subsistence living and microfinance i s well placed to
address the issue.

22.     The microfinance project's main goal o f providing greater access o f rural and
microfinance to low-income populations will also help support the Africa Action Plan
focus o f ensuring that the poor and women are able to participate in and benefit from
growth. The additional financing will allow the project to deliver a higher impact on
poverty alleviation by increasing the outreach o f low income populations who have
access to financial services from 150,000 to 300,000 o fwhom 50 percent are women.



V.      Appraisalof Restructuredor Scaled-upProjectActivities

23.     Although the project i s being scaled up, the project activities remain as originally
designed and appraised. The economic, financial, technical, institutional, fiduciary, and
social aspects o f the activities to be undertaken with the additional financing remain the
same as inthe original project.

24.     There are no outstanding or unresolved fiduciary, environmental, or social
problems. The microfinance project, which i s a technical assistance and institution-
building project, has no direct environmental impact and no environmental assessment
is required. The environmental category o f the project i s C and will remain the same
since the additional financing will go towards scaling up original project activities and
impact. The scaled up activities do not involve any exceptions to Bankpolicies.


VI      ExpectedOutcomes

25.     The original program goal o f improving the income and living standards o f low-
income Malagasy by increasing their long-term access to financial services remains
unchanged. Given that the project has already exceeded the quantitative targets set out in
Phase Io f the microfinance APL, the targets will be revised to reflect the current status.
Specifically, the additional financing will makeit possible to:

       Provide technical support to the SLA networks to increase their membership to
       300,000 clients, increase savings, and credit, including those for women and
       disadvantaged groups by at least 25 percent, and to attain operational self-
        sufficiency for all five networks;
        Support the implementation o f the Microfinance law and the adoption o f
       prudential regulations that are in line with industry best practice; and provide
       technical assistance advice to recent initiatives in the credit bureau and payment
       systems.



                                              8

    0   Strengthen the capacity o f the Central Bank to properly supervise MFIs licensed
       under the new law;
    0  Make further inroads inthe establishment o fthe national training program.

26.    Project indicators to be monitored and detailed performance and outreach
indicators for each microfinance SLA network are presented inAnnex B. SLA networks'
performance and outreach indicators are based on their three year business plan 2006-
2009.   The Central Bank and Banking Commission updated performance indicators
include the implementation o f the Microfinance law and the adoption o f prudential
regulations and other accounting and management norms for microfinance that are inline
with international best practice. The CSBF will also be expected to provide regular
supervision o f all licensed MFIs. The training program will continue in collaboration
with the Professional Association o f Microfinance practitioners and be expected to
deliver new courses especially on implementation o f the law and regulations as well as
accounting standards dictatedbythe supervisory authorities.


VII.   BenefitsandRisks

27.    Benefits: The key benefits o f the project made possible with the additional
financing will be to increase access to financial services to an even larger number o f low
income populations and especially women and disadvantaged groups. By scaling up on-
going activities, the project will more than double its current results and extend the
benefits o f financial services to about 300,000 people. The extension o f the closing date
will also allow the project to support the Government in its implementation o f the new
microfinance law aimed at providing a conducive environment and increase microfinance
investment inMadagascar.

28.    Risks: Of the original risks identified for the microfinance project, two remain at
medium risk. They are: (i)delayed implementation o f the legal and regulatory
framework; and (ii)SLA networks do not reach the projected targets in membership,
deposit and loan volumes. To mitigate these two risks, the project will provide the
necessary technical assistance to boththe Central Bank andthe SLA networks.


VIII. FinancialTerms and Conditionsfor the AdditionalFinancing

29.    The additional financing will be provided as an IDA credit. The Country
Financing Parameters approved on M a y 12, 2005 allow for up to 100 percent
disbursement including taxes and duties. On that basis, reimbursement for eligible
expenditures under the new credit would be honored at 100percent.

30.    In addition to the submission of the legal opinion of the Recipient on the
Financing Agreement, the additional conditions ,to the effectiveness o f the Financing
Agreement are: (i)  a subsidiary agreement has been executed on behalf o f the Recipient
and CBM; (ii)   a subsidiary agreement has been executed on behalf o f the Recipient and
AGEPMF.
