"Ratings of the Microfinance Project for\n            Madagascar were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; the risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            the Bank's performance was moderately satisfactory; and\n            the Borrower's performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the long term\n            approach which ended being one prolonged phase was an\n            excellent design feature that contributed to effective\n            achievement of project objectives. Targeted interventions\n            can contribute to inclusive financial systems by increasing\n            participation and welfare of vulnerable groups as observed\n            in this project. Good governance for member owned\n            institutions such as the financial cooperative has been a\n            key to achieving sustainability. Where issues for management\n            action are raised in supervision reports, it is important\n            for management to make quick decisions and take stern\n            position to send a strong message to the borrower and\n            rectify the situation before the damage is too big. During\n            the political crisis, the Microfinance Institution (MFI)\n            networks were resilient and continued to supervise their\n            affiliates when the regulator was not able to do so due to\n            political insecurity in the provinces."}, "docdt": "2011-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
