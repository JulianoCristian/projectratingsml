Reform\n            Support Credit in Chad was unsatisfactory with a likely\n            sustainability.  The institutional development impact was\n            moderate with unsatisfactory performance by the Bank and\n            highly unsatisfactory by the Borrower. Lessons learned from\n            the IRSC experience and similar public finance reform\n            programs indicate the importance of combining policy lending\n            with comprehensive support in the areas of capacity-building\n            and technical assistance. A second lesson concerns the\n            program-budgeting process. Ideally, the preparation of\n            program-budgets should be a two-phase process: 1)\n            preparation of draft programs to help the government make\n            appropriate decisions about overall budget priorities; and\n            2) sector ministries should review again their\n            program-budgets with a view to optimizing the use of funds\n            available to their sector. For the future, the budget\n            preparation process should start with: (i) identification by\n            the government of its overall strategic priorities and (ii)\n            early issuance of the budget circular defining\n            inter-sectoral allocations. A third lesson concerns the role\n            of the civil society and the feasibility of supporting\n            independent oversight institutions. The Bank should continue\n            to give a high priority to building the capacity and\n            protecting the independence of trade unions and other civil\n            society representatives which, if successful, can help\n            develop a culture of transparency in the management of\n            public resources. A fourth lesson concerns the need to move\n            more forcefully towards result-based indicators."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
