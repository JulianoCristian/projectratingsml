ProgramObjectives. Like its predecessors, the Fourth and Fifth Structural Adjustment
Credits (SAC IV and SAC V), the IRSC supports the completion o f a medium-term
reform program focusing on two o f the five strategic axes identified inChad's full PRSP,
namelyto: (i)  promote good governance; and (ii) strong and sustained growth.
                                                   ensure

Credit Description. The reforms supported by the IRSC aim to enhance poverty reduction
by: (i)promotion o f good governance, including: (a) enhanced transparency,
accountability and adherence to the rule o f law; and (b) transparent, accountable and
efficient use o f public resources through the reform o f budget preparation, execution,
monitoring and reporting, public procurement and human resource management in the
civil service; and (ii) sustainable growth in rural areas through a profound reform o f the
cotton sector. The IRSC focuses on key elements that underlie improved public service
delivery through improvements in budget preparation, execution, and monitoring and
better humanresource management inthe civil service. The reform process supported by
the IRSC will pay particular attention to empowering the independent institutions that
provide the checks and balances for the efficient management o f resources for poverty
reduction - in the executive, legislative, andjudicial branches of government, as well as
in the media and civil society, including farmers' associations. Finally, the IRSC will
complement and enhance the impact o f other Bank interventions, especially the
Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, and its associated capacity-building
program for petroleum revenue management the Management o f the Petroleum Economy
Project. Additional financing will be mobilized to continue to support capacity-building
activities, as well as through the capacity-building program o f the World Bank Institute,
the Agricultural Services and Producers' Organizations Project, the Local Development
Program Support Project and ongoing and future operations inthe health, education, and
transport sectors.

Benefits. Successful implementation o f the reform program will: (i) in better
                                                                          result
governance including, stricter adherence to the rule o f law and more transparent and
accountable use o f public resources; (ii)improve the Government's efficiency and
poverty reduction focus in delivering services in health, education, basic infrastructure,
justice and rural development; and (iii)improve farmers' bargaining power inthe cotton
sector and access to inputs andmanagement services, and enhance their productivity.

Risks. Key risks to the proposedoperation are the following.

0  First, consistent implementation of the proposed agenda will depend on continued
   strengthening o f the commitment to improved governance and sound oil revenue
   management. It will also require that recent Presidential initiatives for setting up
   parallel control mechanisms (contde d 'Eta0 do not undermine, but rather
   complement, existing oversight institutions and procedures. Continuing a close
   dialogue with the authorities, and promoting the role o f civil society in checks and
   balances on the use o f oil revenues will help to mitigate the risk o f weakening
   commitment.

0  Second, the resurgence o f instability at the North, East and South borders o f the
   country could hamper the implementation o f the government's programs and related
   budget. Chad i s facing a difficult humanitarian and political situation in the Eastern
   part o f the country, where about 200,000 refugees from Sudan have settled incamps,
   fleeing the combats between the Sudanese army and rebel groups inthe Darfur since
   February 2003. Additional financing needs have arisen on account o f the
   humanitarian crisis. About US$3.7 million have been incorporated in the revised
   budget law for 2004 to finance humanitarian expenditures in support to the Chadian
   populations indirectly affected by the crisis.

0  Third, successful implementation of the proposed program will require careful
   attention to consensus-building and management o f expectations o f the population,
   which are high, following the beginning o f oil production and the completion o f the
   PRSP. Recent political developments include a proposed constitutional amendment
   that removes the cap on successive presidential mandates, which will be submitted to
   a national Referendumin early 2005 to consult with the population on this issue. The
   highexpectations and the highstakes associated with political power due to the new
   oil wealth increase the risk o f social instability. Ensuring that oil revenues are
   translated into visible results on the ground will bekey inmaintaining social stability.

0  Fourth, the cotton sector reform program, which affects about 350,000 poor farm
   families, i s inherently complex and has the potential to harm some rural livelihoods.
   To mitigate the risks involved, it will be important to monitor the poverty impact o f
   the reform program, notably through the continuation o f the Poverty and Social
   Impact Analysis and to follow-up with actions to mitigate negative impacts.

0  Fifth,macroeconomic instability and/or a unexpected sharp decline inoilprices could
   significantly affect program implementation, although these risks will be mitigated by
   the sterilization and stabilization mechanisms for oil revenues established in July
   2003 and cautious macroeconomic management.

                     INSITUTIONAL REFORMSUPPORT CREDIT

                                1.     INTRODUCTION

1.1     The following Program Document proposes an Institutional Reform Support
Credit (IRSC) to the Republic o f Chad for SDR 17.1 million, the equivalent o f US$25
million. The credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and a 10-year
grace period. The proposed IRSC would provide fast-disbursing support to address
Chad's external financing needs and support the third stage o f a medium-termreform
program reflecting the country's full Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). After the
completion of this three-stage process, it i s expected that the Chad IRSC will be followed
by a successor operation inFY06, inthe amount o f US$10 million equivalent. Building
on progress achieved, this FY06 operation i s planned to focus on policy measures and
actions geared at improving public sector delivery in key priority sectors for poverty
reduction. Chad's adjustment efforts have also been supported by the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The last PRGF
expiredon January 6th, 2004 and the discussions are underway for a new program, with a
view to presentation to the Board o f the International Monetary Fund(IMF) inDecember
2004. Other donors, includingthe European Union, France and the Afkican Development
Bank are also providingfinancial support.

1.2     The program supported by the IRSC i s laid out in the Government's Letter o f
Development Policy (Annex 1). Like its predecessors, the Fourth and Fifth Structural
Adjustment Credits, (SAC IV and SAC V)', the proposed IRSC focuses on strengthening
governance and public resource management as necessary conditions for improved
service delivery to the poor. It further supports sustainable growth in the rural areas
through the reform o f the cotton sector. The proposed credit i s a key element o f the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on December 11, 2004, and
which identified the following objectives for Bank assistance: (i)strengthening
governance, including public resource management and service delivery arrangements,
the rule of law, and environmental and social safeguards for oil exploitation; and (ii)
ensuringinclusive, broad-based growth as the country embarks on oil production.

1.3     In preparation for broader programmatic support, efforts towards additional
capacity building, institutional strengthening, and reforms to strengthen Chad's fiduciary

`SAC   IV was approvedbythe BoardinNovember 2001 andclosedinAugust 2002. SAC V was approved
by the BoardinMarch2003 andclosedinAugust 2003.

arrangements will be supported through the proposed operation, as well as the ongoing
Management o f the Petroleum Economy Project and additional financing that would be
mobilized to support capacity-building activities under the program. A Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) i s plannedfor FY07, the preparation o fwhich would be subject to
attaining specific results-to  be specified and discussed with the Government in the
course o f FY05 policy dialogue, and to be assessed in the context o f the annual Public
Expenditure Reviews (PERs), a planned Development Policy Review (DPR) and the
recent Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA, FY04).

1.4     Prior actions for negotiating the IRSC are essentially process-oriented, which i s
consistent with the approach followed previously under SAC IV and SAC V, where the
focus has been put on detailing and putting in place key processes and procedures for
achieving the objectives ofthe medium-termreformprogram. Nevertheless, to underpina
progressive move towards more result-oriented program objectives and monitoring
indicators, the Government has also agreed to define results-based indicators and
benchmarks that would form the basis for assessingprogress inthe implementation o f the
reformprogram under the IRSC. The definition o fmeaningful benchmarks and indicators
will take time and would represent triggers for future budget support/programmatic
lending to Chad. Inparticular, the successor operation inFY06, in the amount o f US$10
million equivalent, i s expected to be framed around sector components that would
capture results such as improvement o f service delivery in key educators (in particular
health and education). These triggers have been highlighted in italics in the matrix
presented inAnnex 2.

1.5     The remainder o f this document is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the
country background, including recent political, economic and social developments.
Section 3 presents Chad's PRSP, progress under the Government's reform program and
areas o f World Bank support. Section 4 describes the proposed credit, detailing actions
taken prior to Negotiations, triggers for future program lending, implementation and
monitoring and credit administration, as well as benefits and risks. Section 5 discusses
coordination with other donors and Section 6 assesses compliance with Bank policies.


  2.      RECENT POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

                            A.     POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

2.1     Following nearly three decades o f civil war, Chad has experienced peace and
stability since 1993. A new constitution was adopted in 1996, and the Constitutional
Council was established in 1996 and made fully operational in 1999. On May 20, 2001,
Chad held its second multi-party presidential elections with the incumbent, President
Deby, winning inthe first round a second five-year mandate. Legislative elections were
subsequently held on April 21,2002. The rulingMouvement Putviotique du Salut (MPS)
won 112 out o f 155 seats, more thantwo-thirds majority. A new Government was formed
in June 2003 and reshuffled in August and November 2003, and in February and July
2004. The authorities o f Chad have begun the implementation o f a decentralization
process. The first local elections, initially planned to take place in early 2004 with the



                                           - 5 -

objective o f electing city councils in 47 towns and the capital city, N'Djamena, are now
likely to bepostponed to 2005.

2.2      In December 2003, the Government signed a new peace agreement with the
MDJT (Mouvement pour la Dkmocratie et la Justice au Tchad), a rebel group that had
been active inthe extreme Northern part o f the country, causing casualties over the past
few years and resulting momentarily inthe economic isolation o f the Saharan Region o f
Tibesti. This peace agreement has however been rejected by a faction o f the MDJT, and                  I

in subsequent clashes between the rebels and the Chadian army, several people were
killed. The situation has since stabilized, but remains fragile. Overall, the threat to
political stability has not beenentirely eliminated-Chad          has a long history o f rebellions,
and some neighboring countries, such as the Central African Republic and Sudan, face
recurrent instability. Chad i s facing a difficult humanitarian and political situation inthe
Eastern part o f the country, where about 200,000 refugees from Sudan have settled in
camps, fleeing the combats between the Sudanese army and rebel groups in the Darfur
since February 2003. Further, by raising the potential stakes associated with political
power, oil revenues risk making the maintenance o f socio-political stability even more o f
a challenge.

2.3      Chad's Parliament approved a Constitutional amendment removing the cap on
successive presidential mandates and abolishing the (never-established) Senate on May
26, by 123 votes infavor, none against, and one abstention. The amendment i s now to be
submitted to a national referendumearly 2005. A commission, inwhich representatives
o f opposition political parties have refused to participate, has been established to prepare
for the referendum.

                                   B.       ECONOMIC      PROGRESS^

2.4      Since 1994, Chad has generally maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic track
record with the support o f an IMF enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility and a Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility, and five World Bank Structural Adjustment Credits - the
last o f which was fully disbursed in April 2003. Real GDP growth averaged 5.5 percent
per year in 1994-2003. Since 2001, GDP growth has exceeded 9.5 percent per year.
According to the latest estimates and projections, real GDP continued to grow at a strong
pace (10.5 and 9.7 percent) in2002 and 2003, driven by oil-related investmentsandtheir
spillover effects. The construction o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline advanced faster than
planned. Oil production began in July 2003 and Chad started to collect oil revenues in
lateNovember 2003.

2.5      As the construction phase of the pipeline project got underway, some
macroeconomic risks emerged. Inflation, measured by the change in the consumer price
index, accelerated in 2002, reaching 5.2 percent. Together with the appreciation o f the
euro, to which the FCFA i s linked, against the dollar, this evolution resulted in a
significant appreciation o f the real exchange rate. These risks have nevertheless been

monitored carefully. A sharp decline in inflation has been observed in 2003. Current
estimates indicate that the consumer price index (based on prices in N'Djamena) has
overall declined by 1.8 percent during the year, but real exchange rate appreciation has
continued due to the appreciation o f the Euro. In the cotton sector, performance has
continued to be weaker than expected, despite the improvements in world prices.
Cotontchad's difficult financial situation resulted in significant delays inthe purchase o f
cotton seed from producers and payments for cotton duringthe 2002/2003 season.

2.6     Fiscal policy in recent years has been broadly consistent with macroeconomic
objectives. Starting in the last quarter o f 2001 some progress was made in domestic
revenue collection, as government revenue as a percentage o f GDP increased from 7.8
percent in 2002 to 8.4 percent in 2003. However, Chad's revenue to GDP ratio remains
among the lowest inthe world; ongoing efforts needto be vigorously pursued to broaden
the tax base and improve the efficiency o f tax collection and customs operations. In2003,
the primary base deficit, excluding grants and oil revenue, as a percentage o f GDP,
increasedto 2.9 percent as compared to 2.3 percent in2002.

2.7     Total expenditures averaged 18.6 percent o f GDP in 1994-2003, and current
expenditures have been kept under tight control, averaging about 10 percent o f GDP. At
the same time, the allocation o f expenditure has shifted in favor o f education, health,
social affairs, transport, public works, and justice. Budget allocations to priority sectors
for poverty reduction was increased further under the revised2003 budget law adopted in
July 2003, and rose sharply in the 2004 budget law as the bulk o f direct oil revenues are
requiredto be allocated to these sectors, but due to the delays in committing funds and
making payments, the actual expenditures in the priority sectors have continued to be
below budgetedestimates.

2.8     Since the beginning o f its adjustment efforts in 1994, Chad has made good
progress in structural reforms, with particularly significant achievements in 2000-2004,
as documented in Box 1. The implementation o f the ongoing reform program continues
to be broadly satisfactory, although the pace has been slower than expected in some
areas, notably cotton sector reform and civil service reform. Over the past three years,
dialogue with the Government of Chad on governance has evolved considerably,
resulting in a frank and shared assessment on the major issues. Chad's record on the
implementation o f governance and transparency measures remains uneven, but
significant efforts have been made since the Board presentation o f SAC V, following the
adoption o f a National Governance Strategy inAugust 2002. These achievements include
the organization o f a nationalparticipatoryRoundtable on the Justice sector inJune 2003,
the publication o f several major audit reports in 2003, notably the second report on the
use o f H P C funds and the second report on the audit of the five largest public
procurement contracts, as well as the full operationalization o f the Petroleum Revenue
Oversight Committee. Despite these efforts, governance problems persist, notably in the
area o fpublic procurement.

2.9     Considerable progress has also been made in 2003 to finalize and put in place
unique modalities for managing oil revenues ina transparent way for poverty reduction.
These included the adoption o f presidential decrees in July 2003, which set up
mechanisms for sterilizing and stabilizing oil revenues and specified the role and
attributions o f the Petroleum Revenue Oversight Committee (the College) and its right to
publishits reports independently. The College has completed the hiring o f technical and
support staff, published its operational manual, and i s now fully operational. Two
additional decrees, which specify modalities for managing the Future Generations Fund
and provide for the savings o f revenues accruing to the oil producing region, were
adopted by the Council o f Ministers inNovember 2003 and signed by the Head o f State
on March 18,2004.

  2.10     With respect to human development, Chad ranked 166th out of 173 countries
  listed in the 2002 United Nations Human Development Index. From the 1995-1996
  household survey, the incidence o f poverty in Chad (defined as the proportion o f
  households with annual spendingbelow what i s necessary to meet minimal food andnon-
  food needs3), is estimated at 43.4 percent. Using a more cross-country definition o f the
  poverty line, an estimated four-fifths o f the population o f about 8 million live on less than
  a dollar a day. Social indicators remain well below the average for sub-Saharan Africa.

    For the whole o f the area covered by the household survey, this (daily) level was estimated at CFAF 253,
  well below the international standard poverty line o f one dollar per personper day (about CFAF 700).


                                                   - 10-

 More than half o f the population - including the majority o f women - over the age o f 15
 i s illiterate. Access to improved sources o fpotable water has improvedover the past three
 years, but i s still limited to 34 percent o f the population at end 2003. Electricity i s
 accessible to only 1 percent o f the population, and only 61.4 percent o f all-year road
 network could be used throughout the year as o f end May 2004 (up from 43.5 percent at
 end-2001).

 2.11       Gender and regional disparities are among the most striking features o f poverty in
 Chad, as revealed by the 1995-96 household ~urvey:~                   Gender-related indicators are
 particularly low. Maternal mortality i s estimated at 827 per 100,000 live births, and there
 has been only very slow progress on assisted deliveries over recent years (19.7 percent in
 December 2003 compared to 15 percent in 1998). The ratio o f girls' to boys' primary
 school enrollment was only 63 percent inthe year 2000. Epidemic and endemic diseases,
 such as cholera, typhoid and malaria, are prevalent in all regions o f the country, with the
 latter disease being a leading cause o f mortality. The incidence o f HIV/AIDS increased
 alarmingly in the latter half o f the 1990s, although preliminary recent data suggest a
 slowing o f this tendency during the past two years. There are large regional differences
 for health and education indicators. The gross primary enrollment rate varies between 26
 percent inthe Salamat, and 111percent inthe Logone Occidental. The DPT3 vaccination
 rate i s 20 percent inthe Lac but reaches 106percent inthe Logone Occidental.

2.12    Nevertheless, certain social indicators have improved considerably since 1994
(Table 2), indicating substantial progress in the delivery o f social services. The gross
primary school enrollment rate for girls, although still low, has increased from 31percent
in 1994-95 to 55 percent in 1999-2000, thenan estimated 58.7 percent in2000-2001 and
an estimated 65 percent in 2001-20025. Chad has developed a coherent sector plan
(PARSET) to become eligible for the EducationFor All Initiative (EFA). This program is
undertaken with the support o f the Bank through the Education Sector Reform Project. In
the health sector the DPT vaccination rate has increased from 18 percent in 1994 to 48
percent in2003.

2.13    Chad's real per capita GDP i s estimated to have significantly increased on
average by 15.3 percent per year in2001-2003, and i s projected to increase by an average
rate of 7.8 percent per year over 2004-2009. In the absence o f data on the evolution o f
household incomes,6 it i s difficult to assess the poverty reduction and distributional
impact o fthis average growth. However, it i s reasonable to assumethat the recent spur in
national income, which has been driven by oil-investment andrelated spillover effects in
the construction and services sectors, has to date principally benefited the urban
populations o f N'DjamCna and the southern secondary cities. At the same time, the
southern rural population has been facing the consequences o f the sharp drop in world
cotton prices until2002. The world cottonprices havebeen on a downward trendover the
past decade, reaching a 30-year low in2001/02, with a 56 percent drop inprices between
1994/95 and 2001/02. At present, world cotton prices are experiencing a slight upward
trend, but the cumulative fall inprices over the last decade has the widened the urban-
rural income gap.

2.14    The poor social indicators in Chad calls for intensified efforts to use the oil
resources to address poverty, with specific efforts to reach the poor in the rural and
isolated areas o f the country. The reform program supported by the proposed IRSC, with
emphasis on public expenditures and services for human development and economic
services, and cotton sector reform, provides the appropriate policy and institutional
framework to implementmeasures to improve living conditions. The scarcity o f data and
statistics to monitor social outcomes also calls for significant efforts to put in place
comprehensive databases and capacity inthe National Statistical Institute (INSEED), and
in ministries. Work is ongoing, notably with the support of UNDP, which is providing
assistance for the creation o f a Poverty Observatory at INSEED. It i s also envisaged that
the Bank will provide capacity-building to ministries inthis area.




  The 2001 and 2002 figures are preliminary and the 2003 figures are not available. The Ministry o f
Education faces significant difficulties inthe production o f statistics.
  The first National Household Survey has been fielded in January 2003. Data collection has been
completed inMarch2004 and the first analytical results are expected to be available inearly 2005.

Medium-TermProspects

2.15      The oil production and exports i s expected to boost economic growth, with real
GDP growth rate of 30.8 percent in 2004 and 12.0 percent in 2005 but declining to 3.7
percent in 2006. In 2007-2020, GDP growth is expected to average about 2 percent per
year, due to the projecteddecline inoil production from the Doba fields. It is nevertheless
anticipated that the growth in the non-oil sector will be sustained, with non-oil GDP
growth averaging about 5 percent per year. These assumptions are relatively conservative
as they assume that no new oil fields would come on stream (oil companies are now
widely expectedto develop new oil fields inthe near future).

2.16      The 2004 Budget Law was approved with delay on January 29,2004. The overall
fiscal deficit excluding grants, which reached an estimated 14.1 percent o f GDP in2003,
i s expected to decline significantly to 7.6 percent in 2004 and 7.1 percent 2005. In the
2004 budget, in accordance with the provisions o f Law No. 001/PR/99 on the
management o f oil revenue, 10percent o f revenue are deposited in a fund for future
generations after setting aside a provision for debt service. Of the balance, 5 percent o f
forecast oil revenue benefit the producing region and 80 percent i s earmarked for: (i)                    the
financing o f additional expenditure in some priority sectors' (health, education, social
action, rural development including water and environment, and infrastructure); and (ii)
setting aside some amount in a stabilization fund for these priority sectors', which the
Chadian authorities formally established in July 2003 to stabilize budgeted expenditures
to be financed by volatile oil revenues and to sterilize any excess liquidity. Inthe 2004
budget, the share of these priority sectors in total expenditure is 72 percent, and in
expenditure fundedby own resources 54 percent, as compared to 42.6 percent inthe 2002
budget.

2.17      At the time o f budget approval, oil revenues, currently consisting o f royalties
accruing to Chad, had been estimated at CFAF 60 billion (about US$102 million) in
2004. These projections have since been revised on the basis o f the recent higher-than-
.expected oil prices for brent but also higher-than-expected transport costs and quality
discounts. The windfall i s estimated to reach CFAF 20.6 billion (about US$38 million)
which will be saved'for the most part in the Fund for Future Generations (10 percent o f
revenues net o f debt service associated to the pipeline project), the stabilization fund for
priority sectors (72 percent of net revenues) opened at the regional Central bank BEAC,
and the account of the oil-producing region at BEAC (4.5 percent of oil revenues).
Hence, out o f the windfall, only about CFAF 2.3 billion (US$4.2 million) are expected to



  Priority sectors eligible for financing fromearmarked direct oil revenues, as listed inpara. 2.15, differ
from priority sectors for poverty reduction as defined inthe PRSP, since they do not include the broad area
o f governance, especiallyjustice.
  The additional expenditure o f priority sectors has been defined as expenditure against non-earmarked
resources inexcess o f a budget usingbase 2002. This base 2002 budget is defined as a budget that would
maintainthe share o fpriority sectors inexpenditure covered by non-earmarkedresources, excluding
interest, at a level at least equal to that o f the 2002 budget forecast (42.6 percent).

be spent. Inthis context, a revisedbudget law has been approved by the Government in
July 2004.

2.18    Due to a relatively weaker-than-expected perfonnance in non-oil revenue
collection, and delays in the provision o f financial support from the country's main
partners, Chad i s currently facing a very tight financial situation and has undertaken
significant adjustment through reduction o f expenditures in 2004, especially in non-
priority sectors. This tight financial situation i s due inlarge part by the failure to conclude
the remaining PRGF review prior to its expiry in early January 2004. As a result the
expected disbursement from the IMFwas lost and, more importantly, the disbursemento f
support from other donors, notably the Bank and the EU, was delayed. The fragility o f
Chad's situation i s underscored bythe following factors:

0       Both external and domestic arrears, including arrears to IDA, have recurred
        periodically (Chad even underwent a period o f suspension o f IDA disbursements
        from July 30th to August 27th, 2004).


0       Additional financing needs have arisen on account of: (i)       the humanitarian crisis
        in the Eastern part of the country, where refugees from Sudan's Darfur Region
        have gathered (CFAF 2 billion, Le., about US$3.7 million, havebeenincorporated
        in the revised budget law for 2004 to finance humanitarian expenditures in
        support to the Chadian populations indirectly affected by the crisis); and (ii)      the
        anticipated widespreaddamage to crops from locust swarms, identified as a crisis-
        level threat in Chad among other countries in the Sahel. These constraints have
        been aggravatedby a mediocre 2004 rainy season.

0       Politically, the tight financing constraint i s particularly difficult to manage. With
        oil revenues now coming into Chad, expectations among the Chadian population
        are very high, and the extreme belt-tightening required under a no-financing
        scenario would beparticularly difficult to explain to the local population.       '



2.19    A Fund mission visited Chad August 13-24, and the Fund implemented a two-
stage approach inpreparation for a new PRGF arrangement. Key prior actions identified
duringthe August mission were monitored and, upon their completion, a second mission
will visit Chad from October 28 to November 10 to negotiate the new PRGF-supported
program which i s planned to be discussed at the FundBoard o f Executive Directors early
2005.

2.20    The tight financial situation facing Chad in a context o f high oil prices and
unexpected windfall may appear at first paradoxical, but i s explained by the fact that oil
revenues can in large measure be used only to fund selected priority sectors, and cannot
therefore be used to compensate for shortfalls innon-oil revenues and external budgetary
supportto finance the remainder o fthe budget.

2.21     Following the completion o f the pipeline inmid-2003, investmentis projected to
decline markedly, from 53.1 percent o f GDP in2003, to 27 percent in2004, 21 percent in
2005 and about 16 percent in the following years. Private sector investment, excluding
the oil sector, would increase progressively from about 4 percent of GDP in2003-2005 to
nearly 8 percent in2009. The CPI i s expected to decline further in2004 (-5 percent) then,
inflation, measured by the change inthe CPI, is projected to stabilize at around 3 percent
over the long term (2005-2020). Past stability notwithstanding, maintaining prudent
macroeconomic policies will be crucial as oil revenues flow in. In this respect, the
stabilization fundwill be instrumentalto avoid excess liquidity inthe economy.

FinancingRequirements

2.22     With oil production and exports, macroeconomic imbalances are expected to
significantly decline over the medium term. The current account deficit excludingofficial
transfers, which amounted to 40.8 percent o f GDP in 2003, i s expected to be sharply
reduced to 19.6 percent o f GDP in 2004 and 12.3 in 2005. Chad will continue to need
foreign official development financing assistance to ensure that, based on levels o f
expenditures in the 2002 budget, oil revenues allocated to eligible priority sectors are
additional and not a substitute for other sources o f budget financing. Moreover, with oil
revenues being reserved to fund selected priority sectors as per the Petroleum Revenue
Management Program and the Law 001PR/99, a relatively significant financing gap will
persist in 2004-2007 in the other sectors (including justice, which i s a priority sector in
the PRSP).

2.23    Financing requirements are estimated at US$25 million in 2004 after taking into
account the sharp reduction inoverall expenditures that the authorities have undertakenin
consultation with the Fund. This gap would be filled with the proposed IRSC. External
financing assurances, especially from the European Union, would also help fill the 2005
financing requirements. As shown in Table 4, after taking into account already identified
available financing - including future planned Bank operations, the financing gap
amounts to about US$26 million in 2006, US$12 million in 2007 and US$3.6 million in
2008. A financing shortfall in 2004-2008 would have a detrimental impact on the
implementation o f the budget in the PRSP priority sectors (including governance and
justice), given the level o f Chadian government dependency on official development
assistance.

Access to the EnhancedHIPC

2.24     Chad reached the decision point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative inMay 2001.
Inthis context, oilrevenues andthe debt reliefunderH P C would contribute significantly
to reducing the burden o f external debt for Chad, as detailed in the Country Assistance
Strategy for Chad (2003). The completion point of the H P C i s expected in the second
half o f 2005, at the time o f the completion o f the first review under the future PRGF
program, which would tentatively take place at that time.

                                    A. THEFULLPRSP

3.1      Chad adopted its full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) inJune 2003. The
PRSP focuses on five strategic axes and fifteen national objectives as presentedinBox 2.
As the direct result o fthe participatory process involving the population andcivil society,
governance and sound macro-economic management figure very prominently inthe full-
 fledged participatory PRSP. The document underlines the need for strong and sustained
growth, improved human capital, improved living conditions for vulnerable groups, and
the preservation o fthe environment.

 3.2     The Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) concurs with the strategic priorities o f the
PRSP. As underlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (2003), to achieve the main
PRSP objective o f halving poverty by 2015, it will be critical to ensure that sustained
 emphasis i s placed on reforms to promote governance and maintain support for agreed
programs, including increasing transparency in public procurement, and that capacities
 are built both at the national and local levels to implement the priority programs
identifiedinthe PRSP. Inaddition, increasing the level o fpoverty-reducing spendingand
improvingthe quality o f service delivery inthese areas will be key for poverty reduction.
As underlinedinthe JSA o f the PRSP, a very important challenge for Chad will also be
to promote growth in the non-oil sectors and increase non-oil revenues to ensure
 continued adequacy o f resources for implementing the PRSP when oil revenues start


                                           - 17-

declining. These challenges will be at the core o f the analysis undertaken in the
framework o f the Development Policy Review (DPR) which i s planned to be completed
inFY05.

3.3     Since the Board presentation o f SAC V inMarch 2003, satisfactory progress has
been made in implementing the medium-term program presented in the Program
Documents for SAC V and SAC IVYalong the two strategic axes of the reform: (i)
promote good governance, including (a) strengthen transparency, accountability, the rule
o f law and participation; and (b) ensure efficient and transparent public resource
management with a view to poverty reduction; and (ii)           promote sustained growth in the
rural sector. As indicated in Box 3, Chad has made substantial progress in meeting the
triggers for further program lendingidentified under SAC V, and a significant proportion
o f these triggers have been exceeded. Progress was strong in the area o f public
expenditure and procurement reforms; however, recent reports have underlined
continuing implementationweaknesses even in these areas, requiringthe continuation o f
a vigorous program o f reforms and especially associated capacity-building. In the areas
o f civil service and cotton sector reforms, progress was slower than expected. On
balance, progress has been satisfactory. Most o f the SAC V triggers (Box 3), as well as
complementary key measures identified in the course o f SAC V implementation,
constituted prior actions to negotiating the proposed IRSC. These prior actions, which
therefore may differ slightly from the SAC V triggers specified inthe Program Document

 for that operation, are described in Section 4 o f this document. In the remainder of the
 section, key results achieved and remaining issues are described. Delays encountered in
 the implementation o f some components of the program are discussed and analyzed.

                               c.          PROMOTINGGOOD GOVERNANCE

 3.4       In the National Governance Strategy adopted in August 2002, governance is
 defined as transparent and participatory management o f economic and social
 development, based on the primacy o f law and accountability. Consistent with this
  definition, the PRSP identifies the following key areas o f governance reform :

           (i) Consolidation o f the rule o f law, including the fight against fi-aud, corruption
           and impunity in customs and tax administration, and expenditure management;
           judicial reform; and security for property and individuals.

           (ii)Redefinition ofthe role ofthe state, theprivate sector, and civil society,
           including decentralization o f power and deconcentration; increased access o f the
           population to public information; and strengthening of the capacity o f the private
           sector and o f civil society;

           (iii) Promotion o f efficient and transparent management o f public affairs, which
           includes improved budget management;                       more transparent and efficient
           procurement; and promotion o f an efficient, motivated, and more capable public
           administration.

3.5      Inthis context, the proposed IRSC would support the implementationoftwo key
strategic objectives under the medium-termreform program: (i)                 strengthentransparency,

3.6      Reform strategy. Over the mediumterm, the authorities have decided to adopt and
implement measuresfor:

         (i)ensuringaccessofthepopulationandcivil servants to public information;
         making the justice system more efficient, equitable and transparent; and fighting
         corruption, the involvement o f thirdparties and inefficiencies incustoms services,
         andbringingcustoms services moreresponsive to the needs o fusers.

         (ii)  ensuring(a) independent oversight and control of the use of public resources,
         notably petroleum revenues, by putting inplace an adequate legal and regulatory
         framework,      strengthening the Auditor General's Office set up in September
         1999, the General Finance Inspection o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance,
         and by making the Petroleum Revenue Oversight Committee fully operational;
         and (b) transparency and dissemination o f information on the use o f public
         resources.


                    Box 4. The PetroleumRevenueOversightCommittee

In December 1998, the Government adopted the Petroleum Management Law, stipulating that all
Government revenues from the Doba oil fields will be integrated inthe annual Government budget and that
royalties and dividends will be spent on development expenditures mainly for health, education, basic
infrastructure, and rural development, as well as on the development o f the oil-producing region. In
addition to the normal oversight and control procedures for Government expenditures, the Law foresees the
creation o f an independent Petroleum Revenue Oversight and Control Board (CCSRP). The CCSRP
consists o f nine members who are the Director o f the Central Bank, the Director o f the Treasury, a member
o f the Supreme Court, two parliamentarians, and one representative o f each o f the following group o f
stakeholders: human rights associations, local NGOs, the religious communities, and trade unions. The
CCSRP was originally scheduled to become operational by 2004 only, ahead o f first oil expected in 2005.
Following the problems surrounding the use o f a first part o f the petroleum agreement signing bonus, the
Government decided that the CCSRP would provide earlier oversight and control for the expenditures to be
made with the remainder o f the bonus. Moreover, the faster-than expected completion o f the pipeline
construction added to the urgency o f making the CCSRP fully operational earlier than initially expected,
which involved puttinginplace the necessary regulatory framework, rules o f procedures, staffing, training,
office space and equipment. These actions were fully completed in2004.

3.7    Key actions and achievements over the past year, with the support o f SAC V,
have included:

       (i) completionofasurveyontheusers'perceptionofcustomsservices;
           The

       (ii)The adoption of an action planfor the further improvement of customs
       services and the launching o fthe implementation o fthis actionplan;

       (iii)Publicationandwide dissemination oftheGovernment's BudgetLaw for
       fiscal year 2003;

       (iv) Publication on its website o f critical reports by the Auditor General's Office
       such as its report on the execution o f the Budget Law for fiscal year 2002, the
       audit o f the use o f HIPC resources in2002, andthe audit o f the five largest public
       procurement contracts in2002.

       (v) Preparation o f a first draft of the policy for public disclosure of information
       and review ofthis draft by the Government; and

       (vi) The organization o f the "Etats Ge`ne`raux de la Justice" after the completion
       o f a survey o fthe perceptions o fusers o fthejustice system.

       (vii) Steps to makethe CCRSP fully operational:
               - Adoption o f a decree statingthe role and attributions o f CCSRP;
                - Finalization and publication o f a detailed manual o f procedures on the
               basis o f the decree;
                - Hiringo f five analysts to help it carry out its mission;
                - Training o f members, including study tour inNorway and establishment
                o f a twinningarrangement; and
                - Publicationo f CCRSP's quarterly and annual reports.

3.8    Keyresults include:

(i)strengthenedconsultationprocess inseveralareas,andincreasedopenandfrank
   A
assessment of governance shortcomings in the country. This has built on the successful
consultation process undertaken under the PRSP process. Progress i s illustrated by the
organization o f a participatory Round Table on the Justice Sector, in June 2003,
following the completion o f a survey on the functioning o f the justice system among
users and professionals of the sector. In addition, the survey o f users' perceptions o f
customs services has been completed, which has, for the first time, offered the
opportunity to identifythe main strengths and weaknesses o f customs services inrelation
to clients and employees. The Government intends to use the result o f this survey to
amend the action plan for reforming customs services, currently under implementation
with use of government own resources in 2004 as donor financing has not been yet
mobilized. Increasing access to public information, for the population as well as civil


                                           - 24 -

servants themselves, will also be key to enhancing consultation, participation and
transparency inpublic sector management.

(ii) Improved transparency on issues relating to public finance management: Several
major audit reports in 2003, notably two reports on the use o f HIPC funds and a second
report on the audit o f the five largest public procurement contracts, as well as the 2002
report o f the General Finance Inspectorate were completed and published.Progress has
also been made on improvingtransparency by the wide dissemination o fthe 2003 Budget
Law, and the submission o f the 2002 Budget Settlement Law to Parliament before the
presentation and adoption o fthe 2004 Budget Law.

(iii)Improved eficiency and transparency in customs operations, and reduced
involvement of thirdparties. Progress has been made on the implementation o f the action
plan, but has been to a certain extent slowed down by the delays in securing financial
support from extemal partners.

(iii) Strengthened mechanisms for check and balances in the area of public finance,
notably through the full operationalization o f the Petroleum Revenue Oversight
Committee (Coll2ge). A decree was adopted on July lst,        2003, specifying the role and
attributions o f the College andthe modalities o f its control functions. The decree affirms
its right to all relevant information pertaining to the mobilization and use o f oil revenues
and to publishits reports independently.The CCSRP has hired technical staff and is now
fully operational. The authorities of Chad have also made significant progress in
establishing sound modalities for managing oil revenues. These included the adoption o f
presidential decrees inJuly 2003, which set up mechanisms for sterilizing and stabilizing
oil revenues. Presidential decrees were also signed on March 18, 2004, setting up the
FutureGenerations Fundand establishing a savings account for oil revenues allocated to
the oil-producing region until decentralized collectivities are in place. In addition, the
auditor general's office, Chambre des Comptes, and the General Finance Inspection
Directorate have produced several reports o f satisfactory quality on public expenditure
and procurement. Capacity building has been undertaken in the Finance Commission of
the Parliament, but there is a needto intensifythe efforts inthis area.

3.9     This progress notwithstanding, effective enforcement of accountability and
sanction mechanisms i s still in need o f significant strengthening and streamlining. As
stated inthe PRSP, there i s a need to reinforce the fight against corruption, especially in
public finance management. Govemance problems remain important and deep-rooted as
witnessed by the persistence o f major issues in public procurement, discussed below.
Emphasis also needs to be put on better coordination and monitoring efforts in the
implementation o f the govemance agenda. Clear responsibilities in this area have been
formally attributed to SENAREC (Secrhtariat National pour le Renforcement des
Capacitks), the capacity buildingbody, and a budget has been allocated to this task inthe
2004 budget.

       results achieved on implementation o f the National Governance Strategy and
       revisits priorities as needed;

       (ii) Finalization and submission to Parliament o f the law on access to public
       information, and publication o f implementation decrees; definition and launching
       o f implementation o f a strategy to ensure that the law is enforced effectively and
       access to public information will be improved for civil servants and populationo f
       main cities;

       (iii)Definition and adoption of an action planto reform thejustice system;

       (iv) The recommendations of the survey of customs users' perceptions will be
       incorporated in the customs action plan, and implementation o f these additional
       actions will have begun;

       (v) The Auditor General's Office and the General Finance Inspectorate will
       continue to publish quality reports on the use o f public resources; and there will
       be effective enforcement o f audit recommendations. The Government will prepare
       a monitoring report on this subject, in consultation with the Auditor General's
       Office;

       (vi) A court for treating cases o fmismanagement ofpublic resources will be fully

       applied;

       (vii) The capacity o f the Finance Commission o f Parliament to assess budget
       orientations andexecution would have been strengthened;

       (viii) The CCSRP would have fully established itself as the independent oversight
       and control board for petroleum revenues as witnessed by its regularly published
       reports on the use o f first oil revenues;

       (ix) The use o f petroleum revenues will be fully in accord with the Petroleum
       Revenue Management Law 001/PW99.

EnsureEfficientandTransparentPublicResourceManagementwith a View to
PovertyReduction.

3.11   The reform program in the area o f public resource management includes three
components : (i)   improving budget management; (ii) public procurement more
                                                       making
efficient and transparent; and (iii) promoting a more transparent and efficient human
resource management inthe civil service. Improve budgetmanagement.

        o fhealth, education, public works andhousing;

        (xvi) Finalization and launching of implementation o f an action plan to improve
        the arrival o f expenditures at the level o f basic facilities in the health and
        education sectors: most prominently; computerization of asset management,
        supplies and deliveries has started inthe health sector, along with training o f staff
        in N'Djamena and in the regions; a manual of procedures for managing the
        delivery circuit from the center to the beneficiaries has been prepared and
        enforced inthe education sector.

        (xviii) Effective implementation o f the mechanism to subsidize community
        teachers has started;

3.14    Achievements. Significant results have been obtained, including:

(i)Improved budget preparation. In 2003, ministries in priority sectors (health,
education, higher education, agriculture, livestock, social affairs, public works, housing)
prepared medium-tenn expenditure frameworks (program budgets) for 2004-2006.
Although o f uneven quality, these program budgets represent a first step towards linking
strategic objectives, as identifiedinthe PRSP, to activities and budgetary resources. Key
achievements also include a significant improvement in the content o f the budget
circular, which included a detailed medium-term macroeconomic and budgetary


                                          - 28 -

framework, as well as sector ceilings for public expenditures, based on the PRSP. Due to
weak capacity in the Budget Directorate o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance, the
circular was released very late in the course o f budget preparation in 2003 and 2004,
which made it more difficult for the ministries to prepare their programs within the sector
ceilings.

(ii)Strengthened institutional and human resources for budget preparation and
monitoring. Although vigorous efforts will need to be pursued in terms o f capacity-
buildingfor public finance management, several important steps have beentaken over the
past year. Most prominently, the authorities have put in place a clear institutional
framework for public finance management, by creating Administrative and Financial
Directorates (AFD) ineachministry, which have been assigned the missionto prepare the
budget and program budgets, monitor budget execution, prepare procurement bids, and
review expenditures. Insome cases, these AFD will also be incharge o f humanresource
management. AFDs' Directors have been nominated, and are inthe process o f identifying
staffing and training needs to make the AFDs fully operational. The progress incapacity
building has beendemonstrated, most prominently, by the preparation, without technical
assistance, o f program budgets in ministries, and the completion, by the Ministry o f
Agriculture, o f its first Public Expenditure Review, ahead o f schedule. The Ministry o f
Economy and Finance has also identified staffing needs in the Budget Directorate for
budget preparation and monitoring, and hired fifteen young economists who are being
trained. This progress notwithstanding, capacity-building efforts will need to be
broadened and intensified in the course o f the next phase of the reform program. Chad's
development partners, including the Bank Group, the IMF and UNDP, will continue to
put a strong emphasis on this objective. The Bank is notably planning to mobilize
additional financing to continue to support capacity-building activities under the
program; inaddition, the World Bank Institutehas identified Chad as a focus country for
its assistance;

(iii)Progress on the monitoring of budget execution. Achievements include the
publication, albeit still with delays, o f a monthly table on budget execution by ministry,
distinguishing the various stages o f the expenditure circuit. For technical reasons, this
table presents some drawbacks, but has become instrumental in the dialogue on and
assessment of budget execution inpriority and non-priority sectors. It has highlightedin
particular, very clearly, the significant delays that exist in the payments for priority
expenditures. Significant progress has also been made on the implementation o f the
Integrated Financial Management Information System, which has been used for preparing
the 2004 budget, and is expected to become fully operational for monitoring budget
execution inthe near future -thus replacing the current system to produce the table.

 Box 5 - Overview of budget allocations and implementation of priorities 1998-2003

Chad's fiscal policy i s by and large prudently managed to maintainmacroeconomic stability. Nevertheless,
the analysis o f past public expenditures concludes that, despite increases in budget allocations to priority
sectors for poverty reduction over the period 1998-2003-20           percent a year through 2003-actual
expenditures inthese sectors have decreased inpercentage o f total expenditures (from 64 percent in 1998 to
49 percent in2002, including foreign-financed expenditures). This overall trend can be analyzed by sector
as follows (interms o fbudget outturns):

    Expenditure on education representing approximately 12 percent o f total government expenditure are
    below the average figures observed by UNESCO in some twenty African countries (around
     19 percent). Despite steady growth in the operating budget, the share of education expenditure
    decreased from 1999 to 2002, as a result o f a sharp decline inthe investment budget in2001 and a low
    execution rate for the operating budget, particularly in2002.
    The share of public expenditure devoted to health (per capita) i s among the lowest in Sub-Saharan
    Africa. From 1998 to 2002, this share was about 9 percent, which is higher than the ratios observed for
    M a l i or CBte d'Ivoire (5-6 percent) but lower than those inNiger and Namibia (roughly 10 percent).
    Over the 1998-2002 period, the growth of defense spending (29percent per year o n average) was
    considerably higher than the average growth in public expenditure (13 percent per year on average).
    The resources allocatedto defense correspondto 8 percent of expenditures over the 1998-2002 period.
    Infrastructure, and road infrastructure in particular, benefited from sizable budget appropriations.
    However, owing to a slowdown in the execution of capital expenditure, the share o f total expenditure
    devoted to infrastructure dropped sharply, from 26 percent in 1998 to 12percent in2002.
    The share o f public expenditure devoted to agriculture, livestock and the environment increased from
     16 percent in 1998 to 20 percent in2001, but was only 15 percent in2002. As noted, the breakdown o f
    expenditure in this sector reveals a low level o f expenditure on goods and services in relation to
    personnel expenditure, which inevitably results ininefficiencies.

Even after excluding foreign-financed Title V expenditures, which are usually over-programmed, the
analysis indicates that there has been no actual increase intotal spending o npriority sectors over the period
1998-2003. Domestically fmanced expenditure on the priority sectors (as defined in Law No. 001/PW99)
represented 35 percent o f total domestically financed expenditure, they accounted for only 33 percent in
2002. This trend continued in 2003, as indicated in preliminary budget execution reports. This result
indicates a shift inpriority implementation duringbudget execution.

3.15      Despite results achieved, recent audit reports have nevertheless highlighted the
poor quality o f expenditure, with more emphasis on the needs o f the central
administration and less on improving basic service delivery. As indicated in Box 5,
despite progress achieved on monitoring aspects, budget execution in priority sectors
remains excessively slow, especially at the payment stage, due to weak planning o f
commitments and poor cash flow management. This has been aggravated in 2004 in a
context of a very tight financial situation. Significant deficiencies exist inthe expenditure
channel in most sectors, both quantitatively (a significant proportion o f public funds or
purchased items do not reach their beneficiaries) and qualitatively (deliveries are made
with long delays or differ from the orders). The Public Expenditure Tracking Survey
(PETS) report for the Ministry of National Education, for example, shows that the
deliveryrate at schools for expenditure on supplies is estimated to be only 38 percent o f
expenditures that were programmed to be delivered, which i s due to appropriation o f
resources at intermediary deconcentrated levels to fulfill their own basic needs, and to


                                                   - 30 -

leakages and inadequate record keeping and reporting. Another leading cause o f this
outcome i s the weaknesses in the monitoring o f deliveries. These deficiencies call for
deeper reforms in the area o f budget preparation, execution, monitoring and evaluation.
The results and recommendations o f the second Public Expenditure Review, o f the
ongoing Country Financial Accountability Assessment and o f the HIPC AAP exercise
which i s in its final stage will be instrumental in refining and deepening the
Government's reformprogram inthis area.

3.16   Next steps and expected results. By the end o f the IRSC period, the following
actions andresults are expected to be achieved:

       (i)Completion of the recruitment and training of staff in the AFDs and
       Procurement Directorate and o f members o f procurement commissions; adequate
       number o f staff with required skills will be in charge o f budget preparation and
       execution inministries and Procurement Directorate and commissions;

       (ii) Preparation o f 2005-2007 and 2006-2008 program budgets in all priority
       sectors, which will informthe 2005 budget, and will be submittedto Parliament at
       the time o fthe discussion o fthe draft Budget Law; the budget circular andbudget
       documents will include a medium-term macro-framework, a medium term
       expenditureframework and sector expenditure ceilings;

       (iii)Preparation o f an action plan to move progressively towards deconcentration
       o f some responsibilities to ministries, and increase accountability o f ministries in
       public expenditure management. This will include inthe short term to: (a) identify
       measures to give sector ministries the responsibility for orders to pay; (b) define
       supporting measures including implementation o f accounting procedures, (c)
       revision o fregulatory statutes and (d) training actions;

       (iv) Completion o f the installation o f the Computerized Expenditure Circuit
       (networking of Directorates at the Ministry o f Economy and Finance, training o f
       users inthe area o f budget execution); a fully operational IFMISwill be inplace;

       (v) Appropriate planning o f budget execution, on the basis o f regularly updated
       procurement plans that will be shared with the Procurement Directorate on a
       monthly basis;

       (vi) Further streamlining o fbudgetmanagement procedures, especially inthe area
       o f budget execution (streamline the commitment procedure, incorporate multi-
       year commitment appropriation inthe budget, enforce the organic law for deferral
       o f capital expenditure, streamline the expenditure circuit for labor costs);

       (vi) Monitoring o f budget execution on a monthly basis, using the budget
       execution tables, and appropriate cash-flow management, through the use o f the
        12-month cash-flow plans; these actions will contribute to a faster execution o f
       the budget in priority sectors; a fully effective in-year budget execution
       monitoring system with effective monitoring o f performance indicators and


                                         - 31 -

         execution o f the investmentbudget will be inplace; annual execution o f the non-
         wage operational budgets in the priority sectors will exceed 60 percent on a
         commitment basis as o f endJune 2005;

         (vii) The Budget Settlement Law for the preceding year is submitted to
         Parliament, then adopted before the adoption o f the Budget Law for the
         subsequentyear;

         (viii) Annual review of expenditures in all priority sectors with a view to
         evaluating the impact o f expenditures on poverty reduction and the
         implementation o f the PRS for further improvement o f the medium term
         expenditure plans; and a hll-fledgedPERineach sector every three years;

         (ix) Annual publication by the General Finance Inspection o f a report on
         irregularities in budget execution and the continuous implementation o f
         administrative sanctions for irregularities;

         (x) Involvement o fusers inthe tracking mechanismfor basic health andeducation
         facilities;

         (xi) Assessment o f public expenditure tracking systems in all other priority
         sectors, in view o f improving the tracing and arrival o f expenditures from the
         center to beneficiaries, and involving users inthe monitoring system. The process
         will include an update of the surveys carried out in the health and education
         sector, and will be progressively extended to other sectors, starting with the
         Ministries o f Agriculture, Livestock and Water and Environment; in all sectors,
         the objective will be to lay out a baseline indicator to measure the magnitude of
         existing losses, and establish intermediate targets to be reached over the years.

         (xii) Finalization and submission to Parliament o f the revised texts goveming
         public finance management inChad (regime financier de l'Etatg).

3.17     In parallel with the IRSC, support is expected to continue to be provided for
capacity-building under planned operations and in collaboration with the World Bank
Institute. The methodology for improved capacity-building will be : (i)                     establishing
clearer benchmarks for capacity development at all levels o f Bank intervention; (ii)


  Generally, the current legal framework for fiscal management meets the needs for day-to-day
adrmnistration o f the budget and compliance controls. It i s being modernized both to make controls more
effective, notably through developing a proper system o f sanctions, and to take into account arrangements
to deconcentrate andor decentralize public expenditure management. The legal framework should be also
completed intwo major directions : (i)for strengthening policy andbudget formulation, it should lay down
principles and methods to ensure aggregate fiscal discipline and efficient resource allocation, such as
requirements to prepare o f a macro-economic framework and an MTEF and to include in the budgetary
documents statements on the objectives and indicators on expected outputs and results; and (ii)for
improving transparency and accountability it should lay down principles and procedures for increasing line
agencies' responsibilities and accountability in budget management, audit and disseminating budget
information.



                                               - 32 -

working with Chadian partners to monitor the capacity development process; (iii)
strengthening local training organizations; (iv) working with the leadership to build
stronger ownership o f the capacity goals; and (v) including a broader range o f civil
society and the private sector in training programs as a way o f providing external
monitoring.

Increase transparency and efficiency inpublic procurement.

3.18   Reform strategy. In the context o f the Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR, 2000), the Government and World Bank staff jointly concluded that Chad's
public procurement procedures were ill-definedand poorly implemented. The definition
o f the respective roles o f various institutions involved in the system was unclear;
consequently, conflict o f interest problems arose. Both civil servants and private sector
representatives lacked training in procurement methods.        The approval circuit was
unwieldy and involved the highest authorities for fairly small procurement contracts.
Hence, unnecessarily long procurement procedures hindered the execution o f the budget,
notably in priority sectors. The public was not systematically informed regarding
standard biddingdocuments, invitations to tender for bids, reference prices, outcomes o f
bidding procedures, appeals to awards or blacklisted firms.     There was no transparent
appeals and dispute resolution system; no systematic auditing o f procurement contracts
andthe fhctioning ofthe procurement system.

3.19   Consequently, as indeed has been substantiated in subsequent audit reports,
procurement was characterized by abuse o f direct or limited bidding procedures and
administrative orders (Bons de commande administratifs), overpricing,             lack o f
transparency in the award o f important contracts, long delays and poor quality o f
procurement procedures (planning and preparation o f tenders for bids, technical
evaluation, monitoring o f contract execution, etc.).

3.20    Several factors have contributed to these weaknesses, inparticular: (i)insufficient
capacities in ministries and the procurement commissions and Directorate; (ii)
weaknesses o f control functions, including at the Commitment and Financial Control
Directorate o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance, and at the Procurement Directorate;
(iii)lack ofanadequateregulatory fkamework andclear differentiations ofrolesand
responsibilitiesinprocurement.

3.21    To remedy these problems, the Government has launched a public procurement
reformprogram. This program provides for:

        (i)
          Simplification o fthe procurement approval circuit;

        (ii)Clarificationoftherolesofthe various institutionsinvolvedinthepublic
       procurement system inthe context o f a new Public Procurement Code;

        (iii) andimplementationofanindependentprocurementappealssystemin

                                          - 33 -

       (iv) Information and training of civil servants and the private sector with respect
       to procurement procedures;

       (v) Preparation anddissemination of standardbiddingdocuments;

       (vi) Widepublication o finformationregardingpublic procurement;

       (vii) Accreditation ofprocurement specialists; and

       (viii) Annual auditing ofpublic procurement contracts and the public procurement
       system.

3.22   Key actions implemented over the past year, with the support o f SAC V, have
included:

       (i)Finalization and publication of a new Public Procurement Code and
       preparation o f implementation decrees;

       (ii)Preparation o fthe draft accompanying standardbiddingdocuments;

       (iii)Regular publication o fthe quarterly procurement bulletin;

       (iv) Completion and publication of the audit of the public procurement contracts
       and systemfor 2002.

       (v) Creation of Administrative and Financial Directorates in ministries, that,
       among other tasks, handle procurement activities; identification o f the needs in
       terms o fprocurement specialists to staff the AFDs;

       (vi) Hiring and training o f procurement specialists to staff the Procurement
       Directorate;

       (vii) Recruitment o f a consulting firm that provides technical assistance and
       training inthe area o fprocurement to all stakeholders; and

       (viii) Completion o f a comprehensive review of the needs interms o fprocurement
       specialists for implementing effectively the newly adopted Code, notably for
       establishing the Sector Procurement Commissions inministries.

3.23   Achievements. In the area o f public procurement, the authorities have made
considerable progress towards puttinginplace a revisedregulatory framework for public
procurement andimproving transparency:

       (i) new Public Procurement Codewas issued in December 2003, andthe
           A
       preparation o f implementation decrees and standard bidding documents i s
       underway. Under the new Code, the Public Procurement Directorate i s expected
       to focus on its oversight and control attributions, and will no longer be directly
       involved in the procurement process. In addition, procurement responsibilities


                                        - 34 -

        (technical and financial evaluations o f bids) will be decentralized to ministries,
        which i s expected to bring about more efficiency inthe process.

        (ii) Transparency in public procurement has continued to improve, with the
        publication, as mentionedabove, o f several important audit reports by the Auditor
        General's office, including a second audit o f large public procurement contracts
        and a second audit of the use of H P C resources. The publication o f the public
        procurement bulletin has also contributed to improving transparency, by
        publicizing more widely public tender for bids and disseminating the results o fthe
        procurement process.

3.24    These achievements are noteworthy, and in line with expectations at the time o f
SAC V Board presentation. However challenges ahead are significant and include in
particular the need to enhance capacity at the Procurement Directorate and in the
ministries (including the AFDs and the Sector Procurement Commissions) to implement
the revised Code. Itwill also be critical that the authorities adopt implementationdecrees
that ensure the establishment o f an efficient, transparent, and fair procurement system. In
this respect, three key aspects will need to be taken into account: (i)     selected foreign
firms should not be requested to sub-contract to or work in association with local firms,
even if it is necessary to promote local participation in the implementation o f public
activities; (ii)the implementation decrees should ensure that the new Procurement body
(OCMP) will focus increasingly on ex-post control and will not be directly involved in
procurement activities so as to be able to fill its oversight role; and (iii)the
implementation decrees should ensure some sort o fprivate participationinOCMP.

3.25    Next steps and expected results. By the end o f the IRSC period, the following
actions and results are expected to be achieved:

         (i)Finalization o f implementation decrees that ensure a transparent, efficient and
         fair implementation o f the new Public Procurement Code; full application of the
         Code and its associated decrees; in particular, it i s expected to complete the

Promote a more transparent and efficient human resource management in the civil
service.

3.26   Reform strategy. With about 34,000 public employees (excluding defense),
Chad's civil service i s o f moderate size. However, the organization and staffing of
several key ministries i s not focused on well-specified missions. Skill levels are ill-
matched with job requirements and the incentive system does not promote results-
oriented service delivery. Staffs are unduly concentrated in urban areas.       Moreover,
human resource management suffers from the absence o f clear rules for recruitment and
promotion and from inconsistencies between the civil service files and the payroll, both
maintained manually. All these factors seriously affect the quality and poverty-
orientation o fbasic public services.

3.27   The Government adopted a civil service reform program in 1998, aimed at
improving the quality o f human resources in priority sectors, providing adequate
incentives and a productive working environment, increasing the accountability o f staff to
beneficiaries, and putting inplace transparent staff rules, regulations, and records. This
reform program was extensively discussed with all stakeholders and its implementation
was launched. A census o fpublic sector workers was finalized inNovember 2000 andits
results were expected to provide the basis for the creation o f harmonized and
computerized payroll and civil service records. A new civil service status law introducing
competitive recruitment and merit-based advancement was adopted by Parliament in late
2001, and the draft implementation texts (textes d'upplicution) have been prepared. A
medium-termreformprogramwas formulated and included:

            Review
        into account their respective sector development strategies;
        (ii)Update and implementation of the regulatory framework to introduce
        transparent and competitive recruitment and merit-based remuneration and
        promotion;
        (iii)Implementation o f an accurate and up-to-date payroll file.


3.28    Key actions and achievements. Since the adoption o f the new civil service status
law in December 2001, implementation o f the civil service reform program has been
slow. A key step was accomplished in 2003, with the launching and completion o f a
participatory institutional and organizational audit o f nine key ministries". Results on the
ground have nevertheless been modest. Most implementation texts o f the civil service
law remain to be reviewed and approved by the Cabinet and to be issued subsequently.
Progress was initially made towards harmonizingthe civil service andpayroll files, but in
the absence o f a clear mechanism for updating regularly the civil service file, which i s
based on the 2000 census, the data on the administrative and financial situation o f civil
servants has rapidly become outdated. As a result, the payroll files are not accurate. The
Payroll Directorate at the Ministry o f Economy and Finance also lacks the tools and
capacity to ensure appropriate monitoring o f the payroll. Moreover, pressed by Unions,
the Government has awarded across-the-board salary increases in2003 and 2004, which
i s at odds with the spirit o f the reform. The principles o f competitive recruitment and
merit-based remuneration and promotion, which constitute the overarching objectives o f
the reform, have beenintroduced in a few instances only. Ministries have limitedcontrol
on the hiring and management o f their own human resources -which are the
responsibility o f the Ministry in charge o f Civil Service- and hardly have an accurate
knowledge o fthe number and qualifications o ftheir staff, especially inregions.

3.29    This lack o f significant achievements has several causes, which have been
thoroughly analyzed duringthe course of SAC V. Key factors include:

        (i) Inadequate prioritization of activities under the reform program (census o f civil
        servants and building up o f the civil service file prior to identifying a mechanism
        to manage and update the administrative and financial information on a regular
        basis; focus on performance evaluation tools in the absence o f clear job
        descriptions; etc.). This situation i s largely due to the two-year delay for
        completing the audit o f key ministries, which was initially expected to constitute
        the starting point o f the reform by providing an assessment o f the staffing needs,
        organizational settings and management procedures required for improving
        transparency and efficiency in civil service management and delivery o f public
        services.

        (ii)Lack ofproper coordinationand analytical underpinningsofthe reform
        program. As an illustration, several draft implementation decrees (missions,
        family allowances, etc.) have not been approved by the Ministry o f Economy and
        Finance, which feared that these new provisions -which are likely to involve
        financial implications- could lead to an unacceptable increase inthe payroll. This
        requires a proper assessment o f the positive andnegative impact o f the reform on
        the payroll, which had not been done. Until now, the implementation o f the
        reform program has essentially been assigned to C E S W , without clear
        leadership at the decision-making level for bringing on board other important
        stakeholders who have an important role to play in the success o f the program
        (Ministry of Economy and Finance, including Payroll Directorate, technical
        ministries, other Directorates o f the Ministryincharge o f Civil Service, etc). As a
        result, there has been an unbalanced focus on technical measures (tools for
        performance evaluation, computerized system, etc.).

        (iii)Although progress has been made at the level o f CESRAP to build the tools
        for implementation o f the reform program (performance evaluation system, civil
        service file, computerized system for managing the administrative and financial
        situation o f civil servants, etc), further progress has been constrained by the weak
        capacities that exist at C E S W and inthe Ministryin charge o f Civil Service in
        general. A similar bottleneck exists in the Payroll Directorate, which needs
        capacity-building and support, and in the technical ministries. This will constitute
        a central point o f focus under the next program o f capacity-building activities
        currently under preparation.

3.30    Actions completed before negotiating the IRSC. As stated in the PRSP, the civil
service reform i s critical for improving public service delivery, putting in place an
effective public finance management system, and managing the wage bill ina transparent
and sustainable way. A major step has beencompleted in2003 with the audit of the key
ministries and the assessment o f past performance under the reform program, lifting a
significant bottleneck. Following this assessment, and buildingon the strong commitment
o f the authorities to move forward with the modernizationo f public administrationon the
basis o f the results o f the audits, short-term actions will focus on improving transparency
and efficiency in human resource management. On the basis o f the audits, the
government has prepared a comprehensive, well-sequenced and well-articulated two-
stage action planfor 2004-2006, which will initially focus on ministriesinpriority sectors
and will be geared towards improving human resource management and reinforcing the
AFDs. The first stage will focus on the improvement of financial and administrative
management o f the civil service through the implementation o f adequate computerized
tools and the transfer o f human resource management to ministries, starting with the
Ministry of Economy and Finance on a pilot basis. In this context, the following
measureshave been implemented inpreparation for the IRSC:

        (i)The Technical Committee (Comitk Technique de Suivi), a committee
        consisting o f the Secretaries General o f all Ministries associated with the program
        and chaired by the Deputy Secretary General o f the Presidency, jointly with all
        stakeholders in the administration (CESRAP, other services o f the Ministry in

3.32    The second stage of the action plan, beyond the IRSC implementation horizon,
will consist of the consolidation and extension to all audited ministries and ministries in
priority sectors o f actions undertaken in the area o f human resource management and
strengthening o f the AFDs, and will also include improvements in the institutional and
organizational settings and staffing o fministries. Key actions will include:

             (0      Adopting and implementing action plans to improve the institutional
                      and organizational settings and procedures in each key ministry, in
                     relation to their poverty-reduction mission, and putting in place
                     requiredprocedures, systems and staffing;

             (ii) Revisitingthe institutional arrangements, missions and identifying
                      duplication o f responsibilities between some key ministries, notably
                     between the Ministry o f Plan, Development and Cooperation and the
                      MinistryofEconomy andFinance.

             (iii) Implementing fully the measuresfor introducing competitive-based
                      recruitment; identification and implementation o f measures for
                      improvingincentives for staff.

3.33    The overarching objectives o f introducing competitive recruitment and merit-
based remuneration and promotion inthe civil service as a whole, and o f puttinginplace
a computerized and harmonized integrated civil service and payroll file, will be pursued
ina phased manner, starting with audited ministriesandministries inpriority sectors. In
parallel with the IRSC, the Bank will provide capacity-building and implementation
support through existing andplanned follow-up IDAprojects.



                   D.      ENSURE    STRONGAND SUSTAINEDECONOMIC               GROWTH

3.34    The PRSP identifies four strategic objectives which the authorities intend to
pursue in order to promote strong and sustained economic growth. They include: (i)
developing the sources o f growth; (ii)      promotion o f the private sector; (iii)development
o f basic infrastructure and support for growth; and (iv) achieve a sustainable increase in
rural output.

3.35    As regards the last objective, the rural development program o f the Government
places strong emphasis on the following goals: (i)           the reform o f the cotton sector; (ii)
strengthening of farmers' organizations; (iii)      community development; and (iv) ensuring
adequate access to agricultural services and infrastructure. The pro osed operation aims
at providing support to the first two key goals, which are interlinked      pz.

l2Otherbank operationsaim at providing support to the rural developmentprogramof Chad, notably the
Agricultural Services & Producers' OrganizationsProject, approvedby the BoardinNovember 2003; and
the LocalDevelopmentProject approvedon September 16,2004.

3.36    Outside o f the potential o f oil, cotton i s considered to have major economic and
social importance for Chad. It directly impacts most inhabitants o f the most densely
populated zone o f Chad, the Sudan zone, in terms o f incomes and services. Cotton
production i s carried out by 350,000 farmers and i s their primary source o f income, in
addition to its indirect effects through income multiplier effects and linkages to non-
agricultural goods and services. Cotton i s also a major source o f export revenue and the
cotton industry i s the largest borrower from the financial system, and a key source o f
backward and forward linkages through services and contracts (transport, etc). Unlike the
successes elsewhere inthe CFA zone, cotton yields in Chad over the past decade have at
best stagnated and have beenlargelyindecline since the beginningo fthe 1990s.

3.37    The weak performance o f cottoninChadrelative to other CFA zone countries can
be explained by physical, demographic, as well as economic factors. These various
elements combined suggest the need for a concerted strategy to support the cotton sector
in Chad, in a holistic manner. That is, in order for the cotton reform program to
successfully turn Chad's cotton industry around, it must address the multiple facets o f the
constraints noted above. Thus, the program must address not only the efficiency issues,
linked to the performance o f Cotontchad inits various functions, but also the incentives
and representation o f producers, the management o f a privatized cotton sector, the
provision o f credit, research and extension, the development o f private input and credit
deliverycapacity, andthe infrastructuraldimensions.

3.38    Reform strategy. Chad has decided to emphasize consensus-building among
stakeholders all along the reform path. In December 1999, after consultation with
stakeholders, the Government o f Chad adopted a cotton sector reform strategy, with the
primary objective of improving production and farmer incomes. The reform strategy
consists o f two keypillars:

        (i)Strengthening the role o f farmers' associations; and

        (ii) Disengagingthe state from cotton production.

3.39     Under the first pillar, the reform strategy consists of: (i)strengthening the
institutional and organizational capacities o f farmer associations; (ii) improvingfarmers'
access to information; (iii)improving farmers' access to input and management services;
and (iv) ensuring farmers' participation in the design and monitoring of the state's
withdrawal from the cotton sector.

3.40    Under the secondpillar, the reform strategy consists of: (i) separation o fthe
                                                                        legal
oil and soap division (DHS) and subsequent privatization o f an autonomous oil and soap
enterprise; (ii) identification and evaluation o f alternative scenarios for privatization
                the
o f Cotontchad; (iii)an ex-ante poverty and social impact analysis o f privatization
scenarios; (iv) broad consultation and participation through a farmers' and an investors'
forum to discuss the options for the reform; (v) adoption and implementation o f a final
privatization scenario; and (vi) ex-post monitoring o fthe impact o freforms.

3.41 Key actions have includedthe following:


                                            - 4 1 -

With regard to the first pillar, achievements to date are:

        (i) creationof9ComitCsdeConcertationLocaux(CCLs)throughelectionsin
           The
        5,000 cotton zone villages andtheir legal recognition;

        (ii)Establishment of a ComitC Paritaire in which CCLs and Cotontchad
        participate equally for the determination o f producer prices on the basis o f a
        formula that links domestic prices to the fiber-equivalent world cottonprice;

        (iii)Approval o f a diagnostic o fthe institutional capacities o f the CCLs and action
        planfor strengtheningCCLs;

         (iv) The launching of a capacity-building program to strengthen farmer
        associations.

        (v) Baseline survey ofthe status ofmarket informationamong farmers;

        (vi) Operationalization of amarket information systemfor farmers;

3.42    As a result, cotton farmers have been further empowered through the
strengthening o f participatory institutions, and improved access to market information,
enabling them to play a role in the formulation o f policies on crucial issues such as the
reform scenarios, election o f representatives, and pricing o f outputs, as well as in input
distribution, cotton collection, weighing and grading.

3.43    With regardto the second pillar, progress has been delayedby the world outlook
for cotton prices and the financial difficulties o f Cotontchad. Over the past year, the
program has not been hlly implementedas scheduled, because o f the persistent financial
difficulties o f the state-owned ginning company Cotontchad. As a result, the objective of
implementing cost-reducing measures aimed at improving the efficiency o f Cotontchad's
operations could not be hlly achieved. Expenditures on needed equipment and
maintenance were able to take place only after June 2003, when Cotontchad eventually
obtained additional financial support from its Frenchpartner, Dagris.

3.44    Progress was nevertheless made under SAC V to advance action plans on
divestiture o f public sector involvement incotton activities and privatization o f industrial
and commercial activities of Cotontchad (Table 5). The scenario study is now completed
and identifies nine privatization scenarios, summarized inTable 5, which run the gamut
from improved management o f the status quo under Cotontchad to complete divestment
by the state, to multiple cotton companies organized exclusively by zone or competing
nationally, to dismantling of the integrated company model. The identification and
analysis o f the various scenarios draws on reform experiences to date inboth CFA and
non-CFA countries. Two broad scenarios have been selected by the Government for
furtheranalysis: sale o fequity (scenario 2) and sale o fginneries (scenarios 4-7).

3.45   On balance, despite past difficulties, the reform process under the second pillar
has accelerated significantly inthe past few months. Achievements to date are:

       (i)Completion o f a technical and financial audit o f Cotontchad and adoption of an
       action plan for the financial restructuring o f Cotonchad and the recruitment o f a
       controller to assist inimplementingthe actionplan;

       (ii) OilandSoapFactory,whichwaslegallyseparatedfromCotontchadin
           The
       early 2002, was privatizedinJune 2003;

       (iii)Completion of analysis of alternative scenarios for privatization of
       Cotontchad;

       (iv) The technical teams in charge o f the reform process have prepared a report
       for the High Interministerial Committee presenting the various scenarios for
       reform, and describing the way forward for successfully completing the cotton
       sector reform, highlightingthe main issues to be tackled, as described above. This
       important step paves the way for moving forward on the program along the lines
       identified above. On this basis, two broadpossible divestiture scenarios havebeen
       selected by H C I for the ginning activities o f Cotontchad, by taking into account;
       (a) the objective o f promoting competition while disengaging the State from
       Cotontchad activities; (b) the results o f the quantitative and first stage o f
       qualitative ex-ante poverty and social impact analysis for discussions at a
       producers' and an investors' forums;

       (v) The Government and Cotontchad have agreed officially on the cross-debt
       situation andon the mechanismsto resolve it;

       (vi) Preparation o f an investors' and a producers' forum to discuss the selected
       scenarios and accompanying measures. The fora took place on September 28-29,
       2004 and October 2-3,2004 respectively;

       (vii) Completion of ex-ante quantitative and first stage of ex-ante qualitative
       poverty and social impact analysis and launching o f the second stage o f the ex-
       ante qualitative analysis, which aims at assessing the social impact and risks
       attached to each envisaged scenario for the reform.

   Box 6. Povertyand Social ImpactAnalysis of the cotton sector reformprogram.

The cotton reform program in Chad, which aims at disengaging the state from the sector,
potentially affects about 350,000 poor families. Its primary goal i s to increase farmers' incomes.
Given the complexity o f the reform program, the Chadian authorities decided to undertake an
extensive ex-ante and ex-post poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA), allowing for early
adjustments inthe programifneeded.

The ex-ante PSIA consisted o f (i)a qualitative analysis and (ii)           a quantitative survey. The ex-
ante analysis was conducted inparallel with a study which aimed at identifying various scenarios
for the reform These activities and results achieved are describedbelow:

The ex-ante qualitative analysis was articulated along two separate stages:

(i) firststageaimedatunderstandingthesocialandeconomicdynamicsofthecottonsector.
    The
It comprised different, yet complementary, analytical instruments: (i)a Social Impact
Assessment, which was completed in 2002; and (ii)           an Institutional Analysis, for which the field
world was conducted in the month o f M a y 2002 and the analysis was completed, prior to the
identificationo f several reform scenarios by the Government inlate 2002.

 (ii) secondstage,aSocialRiskAnalysis,waslaunchedafterthescenarioshadbeenidentifiedand
     The
focused on the potential social impacts o f each privatization scenario. The study was completed and a draft
report was produced, which i s to be finalized and validated by the Government before end 2004.

The ex-ante quantitative analysis consisted o f a household survey limited to the cotton producing areas and
was informed by the outcome o f the first stage o f the ex-ante qualitative analysis. The survey was
completed inJune 2003, and data cleaning was finalized inAugust 2003. Results will serve as a baseline to
identify the impact o f the reform program. The qualitative analysis has allowed to identify a range of
detailed issues, risks and potential benefits for cotton producers, as well as for other stakeholders in the
rural sector associated to cotton production and marketing (non producers, private sector, govemmenl
institutions). This analysis has been carried out for each reform scenario. Among the issues that were
identified, key points include : (i)  issues pertaining to production and cotton collection mode througk
village associations, including the level and timeliness o f distribution o f inputs by CotonTchad anc
practices o f downgrading o f cotton quality, which raise the question o f the role and organization o f village
associations before and after privatization; (ii)  the productivity issues that affect farmers; and (iii)    the
welfare o fproducers and the potential impact o f the reform on those producers that will necessarily have tc
give up cotton production. The analysis calls for and provides a basis for a deepening o f preparatoq
analysis before the forums on institutional, technical, financial, social and organizational issues associatec
to the reform process. The information collected will be invaluable for the f i a l selection o f the refom
scenario, and provides much needed information on the livelihood and welfare o f producers in the cottor
producing areas. The results o f the social risk analysis will informthe selectiono f the scenario to be chose1
for the reform. In parallel, these results will also form the basis for the identification o f accompanying
measures that would contribute to mitigate the potential negative short term impact o f the reform o n cottor,
producers. On this basis, and following the forums, the authorities will finally select one scenario for the
privatization o f the cotton company.

3.46     The wuyfonuurd. Underlyingthe selection o f scenarios, and inpreparation to the
forum o f investors and the forum o f producers andthe final choice, there are a set o f key
issues that must be highlightedand that are likely to color the debate and evaluation o f
the various scenarios.

3.47     These core issues revolve around what mightbe called the "3 C's": Coordination,
Competition, and Credit. Thus, the critical issues that concern these three dimensions
are:

         (i) desirability ofmaintaininga singleintegrated cottoncompany versus
            The
         multiple integrated cotton companies, which has implications for both
         coordination o fthe chain and for competition;

         (ii) desirabilityofsplittingfunctionswithinthecottonchainanddevolving
             The
         from an integrated to a specialized system o f companies inthe cotton chain;

         (iii) centralquestionofinputcreditrecovery,giventheneedtomaintaininput
             The
         use andpromote an input-intensivecotton cultivation;

         (iv) The aspect of risk, particularly vis-a-vis both domestic weather and
         productionrisk and internationalprice risk, and who shouldbear it; and,

         (v) The extent o f regulation and institutional coordination among various actors
         andwhat the role o fthe state i s inthis regard.

3.48     In addition to the strictly privatization-oriented scenarios presented above, the
 scenario study also highlights liberalization and coordination scenarios that have to do
with the needto build strong institutional support for the evolving market structure. The
 study also highlightsthe importance o f creating structures to address the relationship of
the producers to the emerging private sector, the relationship and coordination among the
private sector, and the relationship o fboth producers and private sector with the state.

 3.49    Hence inorder to be successful, the overall Government reform program needs to
 address the following key issuesunder the overall cotton sector reform program:

 3.50    Addressing the financial situation of Cotontchad. In financial terms,
 Cotontchadhas been in a situation o f growing fiscal deficit for the past few years, with a
 negative net balance o f 4 billion FCFA in 2002/2003, from a positive balance of 4.4
 billion in 1996/97. The situation o f unresolved debts between the State and Cotontchad
 persists and, combined with difficulties and delays experienced by Cotontchad in
 securing financial resources from other sources, has hampered the implementationof the
 2002/2003 cost-reducing measures aimed at improving Cotontchad's efficiency A first
 critical step has been for the Government and Cotontchad to agree on the cross-debt
 situation and on the mechanisms to resolve it. During the course o f the IRSC, the key
 decision will be to whether or not recapitalize Cotontchad, inthe order o f 6 - 10 billion
 CFAF. The second decision is whether to invest in productive capacity (extension,
 research, soils) in order to make the sector more attractive to investors. This would



                                            - 46 -

involve a more active role for the Ministry o f Agriculture and may require an estimated
investmentof 12billionCFAF.

3.51    More emphasis on productivity enhancement is needed, notably on soils,
agricultural research, and extension: given that Chad i s the worst performer among the
CFA zone cotton producers in terms o f yield, which in tum prevents it from realizing
economies to scale incotton processing, this i s a priority intervention.

3.52    Importance of transport infrastructure and transport sector: Despite the
distinction o f Chad among the CFA zone cotton producers as having the highest internal
transport costs and thus the lowest producer prices, which in tum result in the lack o f
incentives to producers, rural transport infrastructure and trucking capacity have
significantly deteriorated over the reform period. Thus, a concerted infrastructure
development initiative, originally conceived as the thirdpillar o f the reform inaddition to
privatization and producer organizations, i s a priority intervention.

3.53    Promoting private sector development within the cotton sector reform:
While the CTRC has focused on the development o f producers organization into
economic actors, through the envisaged creation o f producer input and output marketing
cooperatives, there has beenno similar or parallel development o f private sector trading
activities. Thus, unlike Benin, where an active private sector engaged in input delivery
was inplace to support the privatization o f the sector by function, this private sector does
not already exist in Chad and i s considered a key priority in a concerted cotton sector
reform support program.

3.54    Establishingan institutionaldevelopmentwithin the cotton sector reform: It
is critical to   establish an inter-professional association and the needed institutional
framework to create, reinforce, and maintain the "rules o f the game" in the post-
privatization era. The current and envisaged efforts to promote the privatization process
 and to create producer cooperatives needto be place ina clear institutional framework, in
which it i s clear who would assume critical functions such as market regulation, legal
 enforcement among private actors, and the provision o f public goods such as grades and
 standards and market information.

 3.55    More emphasis on finance andinputcredit recovery: A critical issue vis-a-vis
 the cotton sector, in whichever privatization scenario that prevails, i s the ability o f the
 private sector to obtain trade finance. A similar issue presents itself vis-a-vis input credit
 recovery from farmers in the context o f a possible privatization by function. In other
 countries, notably Benin, elaborate institutional arrangements to provide a clearinghouse
 for input credit have been created. The appropriate mechanism in the case o f Chad will
 be considered and developed inthe context o f a concerted cotton sector reform program.

 3.56    Clarifyingthe producer price-settingmechanism. Within the reform effort, a
 Comite` Paritaire was established for the purposes o f providing equal representation to
 producers and the Cotontchad inthe fixing o f the pan-seasonal, pan-territorial price. The
 mechanism established was to fix producer prices as a fixed ratio (roughly 20%) o f the
 average international cotton price. This has the effect o f locking inthe operating costs o f


                                          - 47 -

the Cotontchad, which undermines the actual bargaining power o f the producers.
Secondly, producers have little negotiating power regardingthe price discount for second
and third quality cotton, which i s very large and has been further widened (lst     quality:
160 CFAFkg, 2ndquality: 90 CFAFkg and 3'd quality 60 CFAFkg).                 In light of the
envisaged privatization, the price-setting mechanism will be re-considered and developed
inthecontext ofacottonreform support strategy.

3.57     Move beyond privatizationto competition. Privatization i s not sufficient for
bringingabout competition, which ultimately leads to more efficiency andgreater welfare
for producers. Thus, a strategic vision o f the liberalization o f the cotton sector needs to
be developed inwhich a gradualist approach i s taken to bring about greater competition
and in which privatization is the first step. This requires addressing not only the
marketingaspectsbut developing anintegrated vision vis-&vis the competitiveness ofthe
sector as a whole, from the research, extension, and input delivery to export.

3.58     Next steps and expected results under the I R K . In this context, and within the
overall reform scenario as described above, it i s expected that the following key actions
willbeimplementedwiththe support o fthe IRSC:

          (i)Farmers' associations will participate inthe design o f the program to divest the
          state from Cotontchad following their participation in a farmers' forum on
          alternative options for privatization.

          (ii)Statusofknowledgeofcottonfarmersoncottonmarketconditions willbe
          monitored through a follow-up survey;

          (iii) asecondstageaftercompletionoftheactionplanforrestructuringthe
               As
          CCLs, review o f performance o f CCLs with respect to their ability to fulfill their
          role in terms o f (a) communication to producers; and (b) representation o f their
          interests; and implementation o f action planto redress gaps;

          (iv) The completion o f a sensitization campaign with producers, on the selected
          scenario for reform;

          (v) Completion andvalidation ofthe ex-ante poverty and social impact analysis;

          (vi) Followingthe organization o f a producers' forum and an investors' forum, a
          final scenario will be selected by H C I and the preparation o f procurement
          documents will be launched inview o fthe tender for bids.

 3.59     Inparallel, and inpreparation to the finalization o f procurement documents, the
 following studies will be completed after adoption o f the final scenario, with the support
 o f the IRSC and other Bank instruments, as well as, possibly, the French cooperation and
 other donors, to support implementation o fthe overall Government reform program.

          (vii) Definition o f options for puttinginplace a clear institutional framework, in
          which it is clear who would assume critical functions such as market regulation,



                                             - 48 -

        legal enforcement among private actors, and the provision o fpublic goods such as
        grades and standards and market information;

        (viii) Elaboration o f options for institutional arrangements to provide mechanisms
        for finance and input credit recovery, and review by the High Interministerial
        Committee (HCI);

        (ix) Completion of a study on options to engage the private sector in cotton
        activities, with a focus on agricultural inputs and services, and definition o f an
        actionplan; review byHCI;

        (x) Evaluation o f the price-setting mechanism and identification of measures to
        improve it inthe context o fthe cottonreform support strategy.

3.60    Given its complexity, it i s not expected that the medium-term reform program
will be fully completed by the end o fthe IRSC (December 2005). The first step, which is
the privatization o f Cotontchad, i s expected to be fully finalized in the first semester o f
2006.

                     E.       THESTRATEGICCONTEXT OFTHE IRSC

3.61    The proposed Credit would assist Chad in launching the implementation o f two
strategic PRSP axes: (i)  promote good governance; and (ii) strong and sustained
                                                                 ensure
growth. The IRSC will thus address Chad's principal development challenges: (i)
translating future petroleum revenues into expenditures for poverty reduction; and (ii)
promoting growth inthe non-oil sector, especially inrural areas. The program supported
by the IRSC is laid out inthe Government's Letter o f Development Policy presented in
Annex 1. A detailed policy measure and action matrix can be found in Annex 2. The
program i s consistent with the three-year medium-termprogrampresented inSAC IV and
SAC V. The medium-term program i s a rolling three-year program initially based on the
I-PRSP and the PRSP. The IRSC supports measures that have been identified during
PRSP preparation, and are described in the Matrix of Priority Actions o f Phase Io f the
PRSP displayed in Annex 1 o f the document. Monitoring indicators are proposed in the
PRSP document, that are mostly process-oriented. `The support to the PRSP will be
broadened under subsequent Bank operations, possibly in the form o f a PRSC in FY07,
andthe contributions o fother donors.

3.62    The IRSC also draws on recent analytical work, most prominently a Public
Expenditure Review (June 2004), a Country Financial Accountability Assessment and a
H P C tracking exercise - which are in their final stage -, the audit o f the nine key
ministriescompletedby the authorities (2003), and several audit reports prepared by the
Auditor General's Office and the General Finance Inspection. It also draws heavily on a
comprehensive, stock-taking policy note prepared by Bank staff on the strategy and road
map for the reforminthe cotton sector.

3.63    The proposed credit is a key element o f the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
which was endorsed by the Board on December 11, 2004, and which identified the
following objectives for Bank assistance: (i)     strengthening governance, including public

                                            - 49 -

resource management and service delivery arrangements, the rule o f law, and
environmental and social safeguards for oil exploitation; and (ii)ensuring inclusive,
broad-based growth as the country embarks on oil production.


                            4.      THE PROPOSEDCREDIT

4.1     The proposed credit is a core operation to implement two o f the five strategic axes
o f Chad's full PRSP and to implement the World Bank CAS. As detailed below, Chad
completed, prior to Negotiations, several key prior actions in the areas o f governance,
public resource management and cotton sector reform. In Annex 2, which presents the
Government's action matrix, the actions satisfied prior to negotiations have been
highlighted in bold. Most prior actions derive from the triggers for further program
lending identified in the Program Document o f SAC V and displayed in Box 3 o f the
present document. Most triggers have been completed and many o f them have been
exceeded. As highlighted inSection 111, some triggers, however, have been refined during
the course o f the IRSC preparation. Conversely, compared to the triggers identified in
the Program Document for SAC V, several additional prior actions were agreed upon
duringprogram implementationonthebasis ofrecent analyticalwork (para. 3.61).

4.2     Prior actions for negotiating the IRSC are essentially process-oriented, which i s
consistent with the approach followed previously under SAC IV and SAC V, where the
focus has been put on detailing and putting in place key processes and procedures for
achieving the objectives o f the medium-termreform program. Nevertheless, to underpina
progressive move towards more result-oriented program objectives and monitoring
indicators, the Government has also agreed to define results-based indicators and
benchmarks that would form the basis for assessingprogress inthe implementationof the
reform program under the IRSC. The definition o fmeaninghl benchmarks and indicators
will take time and would represent triggers for future budget support/programmatic
lendingto Chad. Inparticular, the successor operation inFY06, inthe amount o f US$ 10
million equivalent, i s expected to be framed around sector components that would
capture results such as improvement o f service delivery in key educators (in particular
health and education). These triggers have been highlighted in italics in the matrix
presentedinAnnex 2.

4.3     The selected prior actions and triggers are meant to assist the authorities to better
manage the petroleum revenue for poverty reduction and to cope with the challenge o f
reforming the cotton sector in a difficult external environment. All prior actions and
triggers have been defined to satisfy one or several o fthe following criteria: (i) are a
                                                                                   they
critical step ina process o freforms launched over the past three years andto be continued
in the medium-term; (ii) engage the independent institutions that are destined to
                            they
provide the checks and balances on the use o f public resources; and (iii)   they contribute
to the curtailing o f opportunities for abuse o fpublic resources.

4.4     To enhance transparency, accountability, adherence to the rule o f law and
participation; improve the preparation, execution and ex-post monitoring, control and
audit o f the budget; make public procurement more efficient and transparent; strengthen
the transparency and accountability o f the civil service; strengthen the cotton farmers'
organizations, and disengage the state from cotton production, the Government
implementedthe following prior actions before negotiating the IRSC:

4.5     To enhance transparency, accountability, adherence to the rule o f law and
participation; improve the preparation, execution and ex-post monitoring, control and
audit o f the budget; make public procurement more efficient and transparent; strengthen
the transparency and accountability o f the civil service; strengthen the cotton farmers'
organizations, and disengage the state from cotton production, the Government has
agreed to the following ten key indicators that would form the basis for assessing
progress on reform implementation, and would constitute triggers for future
programmatic lending in FY06. These actions which represent the core o f the program
supported by the IRSC are presented in italics in Annex 2. The Annex also include
detailed indicative benchmarks for monitoring progress under the program.

2.    EnsureEfficientand Transparent Public ResourceManagementwith a View
to PovertyReduction.

Improve budget management.

          The Ministries in charge o f Health, Social Action, Education, Higher
          Education, Housing and Territorial Management, Public Works, Justice,
          Agriculture, Livestock and Water and Environment have prepared annually
          medium-term expenditure frameworks for 2005-2007 and 2006-2008 that are
          consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy and have been submitted to
          Parliament along with the draft budget law 2005 and 2006;

          The computerized expenditure circuit (IFMIS) is fblly operational; monthly
          tables on budget execution by ministries are produced regularly by the
          MinistryofEconomy andFinance;

           Staffing requirements for core functions and job profiles in AFDs, Planning
          Directorates andHRDshave been fblly identified and fblfilled;

          A diagnosis of the systemfor tracking public expenditures and ensuring their
           arrival from the center to the beneficiaries in the Ministries o f Agriculture,
           Livestock, and Water and Environment in the rural development sector has
          been completed by these Ministries; An update o f the health and education
           Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) has been carried out by the
           Ministries incharge o f Health and Education; in all sectors, the objective will
           be to lay out a baseline indicator to measure the magnitude o f existing losses,
           and establish intermediate targets to be reached over the years through
           detailed action plans.

Increase transparency and efficiency inpublic procurement.

   (vi)    All ministries involved in public procurement have prepared and updated
           monthly procurement plans up to the end of 2005, as confirmed by OCMP
           (Organe ChargC des MarchCs Publics), the public procurement body in
           accordance with Article 23 o f the Public Procurement Code; these plans have
           been circulated to OCMP and the Financial Control Directorate o f the
           Ministry o f Economy andFinance on a monthly basis;

   (vii)   The Commissions in charge o f bid evaluation (Commission d'ouverture et de

           civil service census has beencompleted.

B.EnsureStrong and Sustained Economic Growth

   (x)     Following the investors' and producers' forums, a final reform scenario has
           been selected by the Government and studies have been completed to assess
           the financial, legal, social, institutional and technical implications o f the
           reform and identify accompanying measures, in view o f the preparation o f
           procurement documents.


                       c.     IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING

4.6    As for the previous five adjustment operations, the HCI, an inter-ministerial task
force chaired by the Prime Minister and including the Ministries o f Economy and
Finance, Ministry o f Plan, Development and Cooperation, as well as the technical
Ministries representing priority sectors, will oversee the implementation o f the proposed
operation. The day-to-day monitoring o f the program will be the responsibility o f the
Cellule Economique in the Ministry o f Plan, Development and Cooperation in
coordination with the PRSP Steering Committee. The basic monitoring tool will be the
policy and action matrix presented inAnnex 2. IDAwill regularly discuss progress on the
implementation o f this matrix with the Cellule Economique and the PRSP Steering
Committee, as well as with the Comite` Technique de Suivi, a committee consisting o f the
Secretary Generals o f all Ministries associated with the program and chaired by the
Deputy Secretary General of the Presidency. Such setting has proved successful in the
implementation o f SAC IV and SAC V. Monitoring will be coordinated with other
donors, especially with the IMF, the African Development Bank, the European Union,
UNDP and the FrenchDevelopment Agency.

4.7    Monitoring o f IRSC relies mainly on process and result-based outputs as
presentedinAnnex 2, consistently with the monitoring indicators displayedinthe PRSP.

                             D.      CREDIT ADMINISTRATION

4.8      Borrower and credit amount. The Borrower i s the Republic o f Chad. The
proposed credit amount i s SDR 17.1 million (US dollars 25 million equivalent), disbursed
inonetranche. The closing date ofthecreditwould beDecember 31,2005.

4.9      Disbursement, Reporting and Auditing Arrangements. The credit will follow
the simplified procedures for structural adjustment operations as set out in OD 8.60.
Disbursementswill not be linked to specific imports and there will be no procurement
requirements. Once the credit is approved by the Board, the Borrower will open and
maintain a dedicated deposit account at the CentralBank. IDA will disburse the proceeds
o f the credit into the deposit account inone tranche o f SDR 17.1 million (US dollars 25
million equivalent) which will be made available upon effectiveness o f the Development
Credit Agreement, anticipated for November 2004. If after deposit inthe deposit account
the proceeds o f the credit or any part thereof are used for ineligible purposes, as defined
inthe DevelopmentCredit Agreement, IDAwill require the borrower to either: (i)         return
that amount to the deposit account for use o f eligible purposes, or (ii) the amount
                                                                         refund
directly to IDA. IDA reserves the right to require an audit o f the deposit account at any
time, in such a case, the audit will be carried out following a terms of reference
acceptable to IDA. Although an audit o f the use o f credit finds will not be required, IDA
reserves the right to require audits at any time. The credit's administration will be the
responsibility of the Ministry o f Plan, Development and Cooperation.

4.10     Fiduciary Safeguards. As documented in the Country Procurement Assessment
Report (2000), as well as earlier sections o f this document, numerous weaknesses exist in
accounting, auditing and financial management o f public funds. Nevertheless, some
progress in financial management were made as part of SAC V and the preparation o f the
IRSC as well as in the context o f the PRGF-supported program. A full-scale Country
Financial Accountability Assessment i s under way and its preliminary recommendations
are taken into account inthe proposed operation.

4.11 Environmental Assessment Requirements. The proposed credit i s subject to OD
8.60 and hence no environmental categorization applies. Implementation o f the cotton
sector reform program may have environmental implications due to the environmental
liabilities associated with Cotontchad's factories, as well as a potential increase in cotton
production and attendant fertilizer and pesticide use. Hence, an environmental audit o f
the DHS and Cotontchad plants has been prepared.                    After   finalization,  its
recommendations will be translated into a road map (guide environnemental) and
monitored by the Government. In addition, issues regarding the use o f fertilizers and
especially pesticides will be addressed in the context o f the implementation of the
ongoing Agricultural Services and Producers' Organizations Project .

4.12     Poverty and Social Impact Analysis. The governance component of the proposed
credit i s expected to have a significant positive impact on poverty reduction through
improved budget management and service delivery. The careful analysis o f public
expenditures and the elaboration o f sector-medium term expenditure plans will improve
the poverty focus o f public expenditures and will steer the effective use o f petroleum



                                          - 5 6 -

revenues for poverty reduction.    The improved management o f public resources will
enhance the efficiency, transparency and quality o f public spending. An engagement o f
the independent institutions providing checks andbalances on the use o f public monies,
the strengthenedcontrol and audit, the stricter adherence to the rule of law and the fight
against the abuse o f power will all contribute to ensuring a better alignment between
budget allocations and actual public spending in the field. Together these factors will
allow for expanding basic services as well as for enhancing their quality and increasing
their focus on poverty reduction. This will be especially important for women and girls
who currently suffer most from poor access to quality services ineducation and health.

4.13    The cotton sector component o f the proposed credit touches so manypoor people
in a direct way that it is deemed necessary to conduct an in depth ex-ante and ex-post
poverty and social impact analysis. A quantitative and the first stage o f a qualitative ex-
ante poverty and social impact analysis have been completed and the second stage has
been launched to analyze scenario-specific PSIA issues before the adoption of the final
scenario. This will allow the Government and other stakeholders to take the results o f the
ex-ante analysis into account when making a final decision on the privatization scenario
for Cotontchad and the reform strategy for the sector. Following the state's divestiture
from Cotontchad, the cotton reform program will be monitored by regularly surveying a
sub-sample o f cotton producing households interviewed in the context o f the National
Household Survey. The results o f the ex-post analysis will serve to realign the reform
program ifnecessary.

4.14    Borrower involvement and commitment. The proposed program i s entirely based
on the PRSP which was developed in a consultative process involving the Government,
civil society and the population at large. The specific elements o f the proposed program
have been prepared by the Government in full coordination with the PRSP Steering
Committee. Inaddition, most o f the individual components o f the proposed agenda have
been widely discussed with all stakeholders. Over the past three years, ownership o f the
governance agenda - which was tentative during SAC IV preparation - has evolved
considerably. This is mainly due to two factors. First, civil society and the population at
large have squarely identified improved governance as one o f the highest priorities for
poverty reduction in the context o f the PRSP consultations - as adequately reflected in
the full PRSP. Second, the intense dialogue around the misuse o f the petroleum
agreement signing bonus and the consequences o f irregularities in public procurement -
both with the Bretton Woods institutions and inthe local press - has created a climate o f
frank discussion of govemance issues, and of greater pressure to act on them.
Nevertheless, given vested interests, pockets o f resistance against the governance agenda
continue to exist. As regards the civil service reform agenda, a broad consensus on the
conclusions o f the audit o f the nine ministries has been observed among the main
stakeholders. Consensus-building will continue to be critical to the successful
implementation o f the reform program.

                                  E.      BENEFITS   AND RISKS

Benefits.

4.15    Successful implementation o f the reform program should result inbetter governance,
stricter adherence to the rule o f law and more transparent and accountable use o f public
resources. It should improve the Government's efficiency and poverty reduction focus in
delivering services in the priority sectors, including health, education, basic infrastructure,
justice and rural development. It will lead to an increase in farmers' bargaining power inthe
cotton sector that will enhance their productivity and welfare. Finally, it will complement
and enhance the impact o f other Bank interventions, especially the Petroleum Development
and Pipeline Project, and its associated petroleum revenue management program, the
Management o f the Petroleum Economy Project, the Local Development Program Support
Project and planned additional capacity-building activities, as well as ongoing and future
operations inthe health, education, transport and agriculture sectors.

Risks.

4.16    There are the following risks to the proposed operation. First, consistent
implementation o f the proposed agenda will depend on continued strengthening o f the
commitment to improved governance and sound oil revenue management. Itwill also require
that recent Presidential initiatives for setting up parallel control mechanisms (contrble d'Etat)
do not undermine, but rather complement, existing oversight institutions and procedures.
Continuing a close dialogue with the authorities, and promoting the role o f civil society in
checks and balances on the use o f oil revenues will help to mitigate the risk o f weakening
commitment.

4.17     Second, the resurgence o f instability at the North, East and South borders o f the
country could hamper the implementation o f the government's programs and related budget.
Chad i s facing a difficult humanitarian and political situation in the Eastern part o f the
country, where about 200,000 refugees from Sudan have settled in camps, fleeing the
combats between the Sudanese army and rebel groups in the Darfur since February 2003.
Additional financing needs have arisen on account o f the humanitarian crisis. About US$3.7
million have been incorporated in the revised budget law for 2004 to finance humanitarian
expenditures insupport to the Chadian populations indirectly affectedbythe crisis.

4.18    Third, successful implementation o f the proposed program will require careful
attention to consensus buildingand management o f expectations o f the population, which are
high, following the beginning of oil production and the completion of the PRSP. Recent
political developments include a proposed constitutional amendment that removes the cap on
successive presidential mandates, which will be submittedto a national Referendum in early
2005 to consult with the population on this issue. The high expectations and the high stakes
associated with political power due to the new oil wealth increase the risk o f social
instability. Ensuringthat oil revenues are translated into visible results on the ground will be
key inmaintaining social stability.

4.19    Fourth, the cotton sector reform program, which affects about 350,000 poor farm
families, i s inherently complex and has the potential to harm some rural livelihoods. To
mitigate the risks involved, it will be important to monitor the poverty impact o f the reform


                                              - 58 -

program, notablythrough the continuation of the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis and to
follow-up with actions to mitigate negativeimpacts.

4.20    Fifth,macroeconomic instabilityand/or aunexpectedsharp decline inoil prices could
significantly affect program implementation, although these risks will be mitigatedby the
sterilization and stabilization mechanisms for oil revenues established in July 2003 and
cautious macroeconomic management.


 5.       COORDINATIONWITHTHE IMF,THE AFDB AND OTHER DONORS

5.1     A three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) supported program
was approved in January 2000 and its fifth review was approved by the IMF Executive
Board inJuly 2003. The sixth and final review under the program could not be completed
and the arrangement expired on January 6th, 2004. A new PRGF supported-program is
tentatively planned for presentation to the Board o f the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) in December 2004. Chad's adjustment efforts are also being supported by other
donors, including the European Commission, France and the African Development Bank.

5.2     The design o f the IRSC has been very carefully coordinated with the IMF and
other donors. The Fund's dialogue focuses on government revenue-related measures as
well as complementary actions to improve public expenditure management. Both
programs also focus on improved governance. The African Development Bank i s also
providing financing for the proposed government program through budgetary support.
The European Commission and UNDP are providing technical assistance in support of
the budget cycle reform program. Work in support o f the PRSP is coordinated between
the Bank, the IMFandahost o fdonors, especially the European CommissionandUNDP.

                INSTITUTIONAL REFORMSUPPORT CREDIT (IRSC)

                          LETTER OFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY


Preamble

1.  Chad has negotiated five structural adjustments credits with the World Bank, the last o f
    which, the Fifth Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC V), took effect in April 2003. It also
    negotiated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), under the Poverty Reduction and
    Growth Facility, a three-year program that ended on January 6,2004. These programs have
    made it possible to strengthen and complete the activities undertaken and to make
    significant progress in macroeconomic and financial stabilization and structural reform.
    The reforms were also supported by the Structural Adjustment Support Program(PAAS) o f
    the EuropeanUnion, the StructuralAdjustment Grant (SAS) o fFrance and a credit from the
    African Development Bank (AfDB) duringthe 2000-2003 period.

2.  Many institutional and structural reforms have been implemented since 1995. To
    consolidate those achievements, the Government adopted the National Governance
    Strategy (NGS) in 2002 and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) in 2003.
    Those reference documents were drafted in a painstaking and participatory manner,
    inasmuch as inputs were provided, at various levels o f consultation, by a broad range o f
    civil service, civil society and private sector actors and by all development partners. The
    documents are frames o f reference for medium- and long-term assistance provided by
    Chad's development partners and serve as a basis for coordinating the Government's
    economic, financial and social policies.

3.  To consolidate macroeconomic stability and the various sectoral programs outlined in the
    above documents, the authorities wish to put an IDA Institutional Reform Support Credit
    (IRSC) in place in 2004-2005 in order to continue and strengthen the various reform
    programs. The main objective o f the IRSC i s to support PRSP-identifiedpriorities with a
    view, inter alia, to:
    (i) strengthening governance and transparency through the implementationof the
            SNBG by ensuring the population's access to public information, enhancing
            transparency, establishing a more efficient court system, combating corruption and
            ensuring independent monitoring o fthe use o f public resources;
    (ii)    ensuring efficient and transparent budget management aimed at poverty reduction
            by further reforming the budget cycle, strengthening the regulatory and institutional
            public procurement framework, and continuing civil service r e f o m by means o f a
            more efficient and transparent humanresource management; and
    (iii)   ensuring strong and sustained economic growth by boosting rural production
            through State divestiture from production and marketing o f cotton.

I. Povertyreductionstrategy

4.  The NPRS i s a coordinated combination o f all sectoral strategies to be implemented in
    coming years with a view to halving extreme poverty in Chad by 2015. It has been
    formulated in a relatively favorable international context in view o f the readiness o f
    wealthy countries and international institutions to support the poverty reduction efforts o f
    poor countries. The national context also appears propitious because o f significantprogress

                                                                                   Page 3 of 14

   made towards achieving democracy, the ongoing structural reforms, and the additional
   revenue from the exploitation o f the Miandum and KomC oilfields since July 2003.

5. Inline with the above, the Government has adopted five strategic thrusts andpriority lines
   o f action for NPRS implementation. They are:
    (i)      improving the social, legal, political and economic environment;
    (ii)     ensuring substantial and sustained growth;
    (iii) improvinghumancapital;
    (iv)     improving the livingconditions o f vulnerable groups and HIV/AIDS victims; and
    (v)      restoring and protecting the ecosystem.

11. Strategiesinthe priority sectors

6. Based on the major NPRS strategic options, several strategies specific to the priority
    sectors have been formulated, mostly reflected in the form o f program budgets. This has
    facilitated clearer identification o fthe objectives sought.

   Education. To achieve quality education for all by 2015, the Government adopted a ten-
   year program in support of the reform o f the education system inMarch2002, as part o f the
    follow up to the Geneva IV Round Table and in agreement with its partners. The program
   aims to:
    (i) improve significantly the quantity and quality indicators, particularly primary
             school enrollment, retention and completionrates;
    (ii) developnationalcurricula,providetrainingtomostofthecommunityteachers,and
             design Chadian textbooks;
    (iii) developinnovativeprogramstocombatilliteracy;
    (iv)     improve the quality o f education;
    (v)      introduce experimental innovations such as school health and nutrition, pre-school
             education and distance education; and
    (vi)     promote effectively the enrollment o f girls.
      To which end, the Government has made crucial policy commitments, including:
      -      increasing substantially the share o f education in GDP with a view to attaining at

      -      least 4 percent by 2015, and
             allocating at least 50 percent o f the education budget to the development of basic
             education.

8.  Health. The overall objective o f the national health policy i s to ensure that the population
   has access to quality basic services in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO)
    guidelines, namely, health for all within the shortest possible time-frame. To attain that
    objective, the Government plans to formulate a national healthpolicy centered around:
    (i) developingqualitybasichealthservicesforthepopulation;
    (ii) actingwithurgencytohavequalifiedhumanresourcesavailable;
    (iii) improvingthemanagementofthehealthsystem;and
    (iv)     continuing to combat endemic and epidemic diseases.

9.  Rural Development. In April 2000, a Rural Development Support Plan (PIDR) was
    identified in agreement with Chad's development partners to help to implement the
   programs o f action that emerged from the Sector-based Consultation for Rural
   Development (SCRD).           The PIDR i s        consequently a tool for      supporting the
    operationalization o f the SCRD. From its inception, the PIDR has consisted o f two major
   programs:


                                              - 3 -

                                                                                         Annex 1
                                                                                    Page 4 o f 14

   (i) the Sectoral Capacity-Building Program (PROSE),                     aimed at supporting
             professional organizations and public and private rural sector services, and
   (ii) theLocalDevelopmentProgram(PRODEL), focusedonlocaldevelopmentand
             aimed at empowering decentralized communities and malung them accountable for
             their owndevelopment;
    and two cross-cutting programs:
    (i) theSectorMonitoringMechanismSupportProgram,and
    (ii) theMicro-FinanceSupportProgram.

10. Many projects and programs are being drawn up on that basis, most notably the Natural
    Resource Management Project in the Sudan Zone (PGRN/ZS) and the Pastoral Animal
    Husbandry Support Project (PASEP) with Afi-ican Development Bank (AfDB) assistance,
    the Local Development Program Support Project (PROADEL) and the Agricultural
    Services and Producer Organizations Support Project (PSAOP) with World Bank support,
    and    the   Assongha-Biltine-Ouaddai' Decentralized          Rural   Development     Program
    (PRODABO) and the Mayo Dalla and Kabia Decentralized Rural Development Program
    (PRODAKA) with German Cooperation Agency support.

11. Moreover, as part of its international commitments, the Government of Chadhas launched
    the following activities: the National Action Plan to Combat Desertification(PAN-LCD),
    the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP),the Water and Sanitation Master Plan
    (SDEA), and the NPRS. PAN-LCD was developed and implemented before the SCRD, but
    its objectives have been taken into consideration. Other main thrusts or goals formulated
    under the activities (NEAP and SDEA) that followed the SCRD have been taken into
    consideration generally under the PIDR and particularly under the specific projects that are
    at the preparatory stage. Accordingly, the SCRD outcomes are aligned with the NPRS.
    The main objective o f the sectoral strategy i s to achieve a sustainable increase in the
    volume o f environment-fi-iendly production and capacity building in the rural sector. The
    aim i s to achieve bigger and better yields inorder to meet economic development needs and
    to improve the quality o f life o f the population; preserve the environment as a national asset
    and productive capital; and place Chadian women and men at the center o f all facets of
    sustainable development.

12. Under the program, the Govemment makes a short- and medium-term commitment to
    attain the following five specific objectives, which will contribute to the achievement o f the
    core objective o f the sectoral strategy:
    (i) sustainableincreaseofproduction;
    (ii)     development o f competitive production activities;
    (iii)    management and enhancement o f natural resources;
    (iv)     promotion o f the rural areas; and
    (v)      enhancement o f the efficiency of government measures.

13. Addressing the physical, technical and institutional issues in the cotton sector, which i s o f
    utmost importance for the Government, i s also an important component o f the reform. In
    the context o f the discussions o f the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) o f the International
    Development Association, the Govemment i s committed to implement the following in
    2004-2005: (i)   rehabilitate and maintain rural roads; (ii)  improve agricultural productivity
    through more efficient research and extension; and (iii)provide support to cotton
    producers.

                                                                                    Page 5 o f 14

14. Transport. Inthe Public Works and Transport sector, the Government adopted a national
    transport strategy in November 1999, as part o f the follow-up to the Geneva IV Round
    Table (1998). One o f its main objectives in the 2000-2009 period i s to ensure that at least
    50 percent o f the permanent national network i s usable in all seasons o f the year, thereby
    improving socio-economic services. The strategy aims to:
    (i)     open upthe country internally and to the outside world;
    (ii)    reduce transport cost for domestic and international trade;
    (iii)   ensure minimum access to all regions o f the country, especially during the rainy
            season; and
    (iv)    ensure that the main cities o f the country are linked by a set of roads that are open
            to vehicular traffic all year round.

15. Energy. Inorder to find a permanent solution to the energy crisis inChad, the Government
    and a private group signed a contract for the management o f the Chadian Water and Power
    Company (STEE) in September 2000. To that end, a U S $50.8 million IDA credit was
    urgently extended to the Government in 2002 for the construction o f a new power plant in
    N'Djamena and the rehabilitation o f power generators in the main cities o f the country.
    The aim was to balance the financial accounts o f STEE in 18 to 24 months and enable the
    private operator to play the role o f the mainpartner and majority shareholder o f a privatized
    STEE. Three years later, those obligations have not been met. Consequently, the
    Government recently terminated its contract with VIVENDI-DIETSMANN, represented by
    VEOLIA, and drew up, for 2004, a strategy to overcome the energy crisis on the basis of a
    short- and medium-term timetable, which it has undertaken to implement with the partners'
    support. Government strategy in2004-2005 consists of: (i)      renew and increase production
    capacity inN'Djamena and in secondary cities through rehabilitation o f existingproduction
    units, the purchase of four caterpillar groups, the installation o f MBH groups, and the
    construction o f a 21-MWh capacity-power plant in Farcha; (ii)explore the use cheaper
    energy sources, including the use o f Doba crude by MBH groups, the implementation o f
    the Sedigui project in order to use cheaper fuel supplies, and the possibility to use heavy
     fuel imported from Cameroon or Nigeria; and (iii)        increase production capacity at the
    national level.

111. Macroeconomic andfinancialobjectives for 2004-2005

16. Before the CFAF devaluation, the Chadian economy was inrecession (-7 percent growth in
     1993). InJanuary 1994, inthe aftermath o f the devaluation, Chad renewed its cooperation
     with the Bretton Woods institutions.       Under the three-year program o f the Enhanced
     Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), signed in 1995 (after the suspension o f the
     Structural Adjustment Facility in 1992), an average real GDP growth rate o f 4.7 percent
     (compared with a 5 percent objective) was achieved in the 1995-1998 period. Owing to
     weak rainfall and the combined effect o f the Asian crisis, falling cotton prices on the world
     market and the price o f oil, GDP declined in 1999 and 2000 by 0.8 and 0.6 percent,
     respectively.

17.  In 2001, 2002, and 2003, as a result of various exogenous factors, particularly the
     acceleration o f the construction o f the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, completed at the end o f
     July 2003, the Chadian economy experienced higher real GDP growth rates than forecast:
     9.4, 10.1, and 9.9 percent respectively. Real GDP i s expected to rise by 38.5 percent in

     Economic and Demographic Studies - INSEED). Further underlying factors are:
     2004 and 14.6 percent in 2005 (according to the National Institute o f Statistics and




                                              - 5 -

                                                                                   Page 6 of 14

    (i)     the combined effect o f higher seed cotton production from the 2001-2002 and
            2002-2003 crop, owing to good rainfall; and
    (ii)    infrastructure buildingactivity linked to oil production.

18. Gross investment has reached 34.7 percent o f GDP in2001, 56.7 percent o f GDP in 2002,
    then 42.0 percent in2003, as a result o f further private large-scale investment inthe oil and
    public works sectors. It i s expected to continue to decline following the completion o f the
    pipeline and to reach 15.7 percent in 2004 and 11.5 percent in 2005. However, a rebound
    incotton prices observed since late 2003 and early 2004 and a purchase price subsidy by
    the Government for the next crop might have a positive effect on primary-sector GDP
    growth in2004 and on cotton growers' income in2004-2005.

19. Owing to the scarcity o f cereals and the famine in Chad as a result o f drought in 2000,
    inflation reached an average o f 12.4 percent in 2001. It fell to -1.8 percent in 2003 and i s
    expected to reach -5 percent in 2004 and 3.3 percent in 2005- which confirms that the
    inflationary pressures that ledto the 1994 devaluation are under full control.

20. The Government plans to continue its efforts to putpublic finances inorder, mainly by:
    (i)      pursuing the policy of broadening the tax base by taking measures to tax the
             informal sector (4 percent advance payment, tax identifier (NIF), general flat-rate
             tax); and
    (ii)     continuation o f a flat-rate 18-percent value-added tax (VAT), which has been
             applied since 2000; and combating fraud, smuggling, and tax evasion by
             implementing an actionplan for taxes andcharges and another for customs.

21. After discussions with joint IMF-WB-AfDB missions, the Government has set several
    sectoral objectives. The 2004 budget, to be balanced with support from the World Bank
    and the Structural Adjustment Subsidy provided by France (and already disbursed), has
    been drawn up with a view to attaining those objectives. In the context o f the
    implementation o f the Petroleum Revenue Management Law N0001/PW99, 10 percent o f
    direct revenues are saved for future generations and 90 percent are transferred to Treasury
    and earmarked for the most part to priority sectors. The Government has adopted four
    other implementationdecrees, including :

           Decree No238/PR/MEF/03 on sterilization o fpetroleumrevenues stemmingfro the
           exploitation o f the three oil fields o fKomC, Miandoum et Bolobo (articles 3,4 and 5
           o f this decree describe the management o f these resources ;

           Decree No239/PR/MEF/03 on stabilization o f expenditures financed with oil
           revenues

           Decree N0240/PRMEF/03 on the organization, functioning and attributions o f the
           PetroleumRevenue Oversight Committee (Collbge de contr8le et de surveillance des
           ressources pktrolibres);

           Decree No095/PR/MEF/04 on the transitory modalities for managing royalties on oil
           productionthat are allocated to the oil producing region ;and

           Decree No096/PR/MEF/04 on the management o f the Future Generations Fund.

                                                                                      Page7 o f 14



IV. The ReformPrograms supported by various IDA credits (SAC IV, SAC V and IRSC)

22. Withincomingoilrevenue as fi-om 2004, Chad faces two mainchallenges:
    (i)      ensuring that it i s usedefficiently and transparently for poverty reduction; and
    (ii)     promoting growth innon-oil sectors, especially the rural sector, which i s the source
             o f income o f most o fthe poor population.

23. In view o f these two challenges, which have been bome out during the preparation of the
    PRSP, the Govemment launched a medium-term program in 2001, and its components are
    set out below.

    I.Strengtheninggovemance

        a. Enhancing transparency, accountability, the rule o f law and participation in the
             implementation o f the National Governance Strategy (SNBG)           -the "govemance
             component".
        b. Ensuring sound and transparent management o f public resources with a view to
             reducingpoverty, focusing on three areas:
             i. improving budgetmanagement (preparation, execution, monitoring and
                                                          -
             ii. enhancingthe transparency and efficiency ofpublic procurement - the
                     evaluation o f public expenditure) the "public finance component";


             ...     "public procurement component";
             111.    promoting more efficient and transparent management o f human resources
                     inthe civil service the "civil service component".
                                           -

    11. Promoting sustained mowth in the rural sector through cotton sector reform - the
        "cotton component".

24. This program has been supported by the World Bank through two structural adjustment
    credits (SAC IV and SAC V). The third phase of the program, described below, will be
    supported throughthe InstitutionalReformSupport Credit (IRSC).

Governance component

25. Strengthening transparency, accountability, the rule o f law and participation under the
    National Governance Strategy (SNBG) are part o f democratic principles. Many o f the
    activities carried out with SAC IVand V support will continue with IRSC support to ensure
    that they are consolidated. The Government committed to carrying out specific preliminary
    activities in the area of good governance before negotiating with the World Bank. They
    consisted of:

    (i)    formulating the first draft o f the strategy on access to public information and submittingit to
           the HighInter-ministerial Committee (HCI) for review;

    (ii)     broadly disseminatingthe 2003 budget law;

    (iii)    publishing on the Internet the main reports of the General Finance Inspection Directorate
             (IGF)ando fthe PetroleumRevenueOversight Committee (CCSRP);

Cotton component

30. Economically and socially, cotton i s particularly important to Chad and its population. In
    terms o f income and services, it has a direct impact on most o f the population o f the Sudan
    Zone. Cotton i s produced by about 350,000 growers and ensures the livelihood o f more
    than two million people. The cotton sector plays a key role in the Chadian economy as a
    major source o f export earnings, the greatest borrower from the banking and financial
     system, the largest sub-contracting and trade supplier, and so on. The role o f cotton as a
     cash crop i s complemented by livestock. On account o f its herd, Chad i s the biggest
     livestock and meat producer and exporter in the Central African Economic and Monetary
     Community (CEMAC).

3 1, Under the proposedreform, the Government's objectives are:

     (i)     the divestiture o f the State from cotton production activities and trade under a
             reform scenario formulated on a participatory basis, and the liberalization o f the
             cotton sector through the privatization o f Cotontchad; and

     (ii)    the integration o f cotton growers, as equal partners, into the cotton industry, by
             strengthening the institutional framework o f grassroots organizations, buildingtheir
             management shlls, and improving their access to farm inputmanagement services.

32.  Inthe past, several activities were carried out with SAC IVandV support, inparticular:

     (i)     the adoption o f the action plan for institutional capacity building in producer
             associations;

     (ii)    the privatization o f oil and soap production;



                                             - 12-

                                                                                      Annex 1
                                                                                 Page 13 o f 14

    (iii)   an examination o fpossible scenarios for State divestiture from Cotontchad.

    (iv)    a social and poverty-related impact study.

33. To consolidate these activities, the Government has considered some measures to be
    preliminary to IRSC negotiations, and has carried them out. They are:

    (i)     conclusion o f an official agreement between the State and Cotontchad on cross-
            loans and their treatment;

    (ii)    drafting o f a report for the HCI on the various reform scenarios and prospects,
            stating the issues to be examined; and

    (iii)   selection by HCIo f two scenarios for evaluation.

34. To ensure progress in the reform o f the cotton sector, the Government undertakes to carry
    out, in2004-2005 and with IRSC support, the following activities:

            assessing the social impact o f each scenario and identifying the reform support
            measures needed from a technical, social, financial, and infrastructure point o f
            view;

            holding a forum o f investors and a seminar with cotton producers inorder to gather
            their views on the privatization scenarios and examine the institutional, technical,
            financial, competitive, and social aspects and the social and poverty-related impact
            o f each scenario;

            launching and completing additional studies on institutional, technical, financial
            and social implications o f the reform scenarios; and completing the poverty and
            social impact analysis; and;

            ensuringthe adoptionby HCIo f a final scenario for the privatization of Cotontchad
            inview o fthe preparationo fthe procurement documents.


V.  PROGRAMMONITORING

35. Like the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), the IRSC will continue to be
    implemented under the supervision o f the HCI, assisted by the Technical Committee for
    Adjustment and the Cellule Economique. The latter, incooperation with the NPRS Steering
    Committee and the various sectors concerned, will see to the drafting o f the quarterly
    reports on the progress o f the program and will endeavor to collect all the information that
    may improve the monitoring o f the program.

36. All services concerned by the program will be activated to improve the coordination o f all
    programs in order to ensure their success. The Cellule Economique i s the main body
    providing information concerning ongoing programs to the development partners.

This letter, requested by Chad's donors, presents an assessment o f the country's
macroeconomic situation and policies for 2004, prospects for 2005, and the status o f Chad's
relations withthe Fund.

Chad's macroeconomic performance i s expected to improve further in2004, with a real GDP
growth projected at 31 percent, on account o f oil-related activities. The average annual
inflation i s expected to reach a negative 5 percent mainly because o f a bumper crop in the
preceding year. Chad's extemal position i s projected to strengthen in 2004, reflecting the
coming on stream o f oil exports and a significant decline inimports following the completion
o f the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline. Prospects for 2005 are also encouraging, with real GDP
expected to expand by 12 percent, inflation remaining subdued, and the extemal position
continuingto improve.

Inthe fiscal area, the 2004 budget anticipated a significant increase intotal spending, and an
overall deficit (on a commitment basis, excluding grants) o f 9.5 percent o f GDP. However,
through endJuly, budget execution was hampered by financial difficulties caused by:
(i) lower-than-anticipated non-oil revenue due to delays in the implementation o f revenue
measures, most o f which required donors' financial assistance; (ii)    the late receipt o f oil
revenue accruing to the budget because o f delays in the finalization o f the institutional
arrangements for the management o f oil resources; and (iii)a significant shortfall in
budgetary aid flows, following the non-completion o f the last review under the PRGF-
supportedprogram.

Inview of the cash-flow constraint, the authorities decided to slow down budget execution
sharply in the first half o f the year and to intensify efforts to enhance revenue collection,
notably by strengthening tax administration, with technical assistance from development
partners. These actions notwithstanding, payments arrears re-emerged in the second quarter.
At endJuly, arrears on extemal debt obligations amounted to CFAF 5 billion, equivalent to
0.2 percent o f GDP.

                                                                                        Annex 5
                                                                                     Page 2 of 4

The authorities adopted, at endJuly, a revised budget that scaled down expenditures. The
revised budget also included some spending for emergency relief to assist the population
living in the areas at the border with the Darfur region o f Sudan, financed with a grant from
the Economic and Monetary Community o f Central Africa; the cost o f the electoral census
ahead o f the referendum to validate the May 2004 revision o f the Constitution; and wage
increase in the education and health sectors, agreed with the trade unions early in the year,
which were inline with understandings reached with Fund staff at end-2003. The increase in
spending was, however, more than offset by cuts made in budgetary appropriations for
material and supplies, transfers, domestic investment, and the wage bill o f the military.
Hence, in the revised budget, the overall deficit (on a commitment basis, excluding grants)
was brought down to 8.4 percent o f GDP.

There was some progress inthe implementation o f structural reforms. Inthe cotton sector, the
authorities selected two reform scenarios that are being studied in more detail to determine
the reform strategy before the end o f the year. Inthe oil sector, significant progress was made
inthe preparation of the institutionalmodalities for the management of oil resources, which
allowedthe repatriationo f oil revenue to begin inearly July 2004.

Regarding relations with the Fund, there i s no Fund-supported program currently in Chad.
The last arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) expired on
January 6, 2004. The final review under the program was not concluded because o f
weaknesses inperformance in 2003, inparticular inthe area o f public resource management,
which i s now being addressed. Discussions for the 2003 Article IV consultation and the
Ex-Post Assessment o f Chad's performance under past Fund-supported programs took place
in October-November 2003, and were concluded by the Executive Board o f the IMF on
March 19, 2004. A Fund team visited N'Djamena during August 13-24, 2004, to initiate
discussions on a new arrangement under the PRGF that would cover the period 2005-07. The
team reviewed economic and financial developments; discussed the revisedbudget for 2004;
and reached understandings on a fiscal adjustment package as well as a treasury cash-flow
plan for 2004, and on prior conditions for the resumption o f discussions on a new program
(Attachment I).

Regarding the fiscal adjustment for 2004, the authorities would need to renegotiate some
obligations falling due on domestic liabilities, scale down scheduled repayment o f domestic
arrears, and make additional expenditure cuts, as well as revenue efforts, in order to limit
 spending to available resources. With the implementation o f these measures, and based on
budget execution through July, the overall deficit (on a commitment basis, excluding grants)
would reach 7.6 percent o f GDP in 2004. The financing gap i s estimated at
 CFAF 18.2 billion, and it i s covered in part by external budgetary aid granted through July,
totaling CFAF 4.8 billion. For 2005, the mission reached understandings on the broad outline
 o f the budget, which envisions an overall deficit (on a commitment basis, excluding grants)
 o f 7.2 percent o f GDP. The authorities also agreed to continue efforts to improve non-oil
revenue collection, and to strengthen budget control procedures, particularly for priority
 sectors. The financing gap i s estimated at some CFAF 64 billion (2.4 percent o f GDP). The
 authorities are seelung donors' financial assistance to cover financing gaps for 2004 and
 2005.

 Overall, effective implementation o f structural measures described in Attachment I,and
 observance o f the cash-flow plan duringAugust-December 2004, together with finalization o f
 a draft budget law for 2005 along the lines discussed with the staff, would contribute to

                                                                                            Page 3 of 4

 establishing a good basis for discussions on the prospective program. Inparticular, the prior
 conditions will address weahesses in public expenditure and cash flow management, and
 contribute to the transparent use o f oil resources, including revenue from future fields.

 A mission would return to N'Djamena in October, once the prior conditions have been met,
 to resume discussions on a new PRGF-supported program. Inthis context, it will also revisit
 the macroeconomic and budget frameworks for 2005, in line with available external
 financing.

 CREDIT D'APPUI AUX REFORMES INSTITUTIONNELLES (CARI)


            LETTRE DE POLITIQUE DE DEVELOPPEMENT



I   Preambule

  1. L e Tchad a ntgocid avec la Banque mondiale cinq credits d'ajustements structurels,
    dont le demier, CAS V, est entre en vigueur en avril2003. I1a tgalement nkgocie avec
    le Fonds Monetaire Intemational un programme triennal dans le cadre de la Facilite
    p,our la Reduction de la PauvretC et pour la Croissance qui est arrive a son terme le 6
    janvier 2004. Ces programmes ont permis de renforcer et parachever les actions
    entreprises et rkaliser des progrts importants dans la stabilisation macroeconomique et
     financitre et les reformes structurelles. Les reformes ont CtC Cgalement appuyees par
     le Programme d'Appui a I'Ajustement Structurel (P.A.A.S) de 1'Union Europeenne,
     ainsi que la Subvention a I'Ajustement Structurel (S.A.S) de la France et le Credit du
     Fonds Afiicain de Developpement (FAD) pendant la periode 2000-2003.

  2. D e nombreuses reformes institutionnelles et structurelles ont et6 mises en place depuis
     1995. Pour consolider ces acquis, le gouvemement a adopte en 2002 la StratCgie
     Nationale de Bonne Gouvemance (SNBG) et en 2003 la Strategie Nationale de
     Reduction de la Pauvrete (SNRP). L'elaboration de ces documents de reference a ete
     tres laborieuse et faite de manitre participative en ce qu'elle a beneficit, a differents
     niveaux de reflexion, d'une large contribution des agents de l'administration publique,
     des acteurs de la societe civile et du secteur prive et de tous les partenaires en
     developpement. Ces documents constituent des cadres de reference pour l'assistance a
     moyen et long termes des partenaires en developpement du Tchad. 11s servent
     egalement de base pour coordonner les politiques Cconomiques, financibres et sociales
     du Gouvemement.

  3. Pour consolider la stabilite macroeconomique et les differents programmes sectoriels
     tels que decrits dans les documents prCcitCs, les Autorites souhaitent poursuivre et
     renforcer les differents programmes de reformes par la mise en place du Credit
     d'Appui aux Reformes Institutionnelles (CAN ) de I'IDA en 2004-2005. L'objectif
     principal du CARI est d'appuyer les prioritks identifikes dans le DSRP pour permettre
     entre autres de : (i) renforcer la bonne gouvemance et la transparence par la mise en
     ceuvre de la SNBG a travers l'accts de la population a I'infonnation publique, la
     transparence, la mise en place d'un systeme judiciaire plus efficace, la lutte contre l a
     corruption et le contrble independant de l'utilisation des ressources publiques ; (ii)
     assurer une gestion budgktaire efficace et transparente dans l'optique de reduction de
     la pauvrete 9 travers la poursuite de la reforme du cycle budgitaire, le renforcement du
     cadre reglementaire et institutionnel pour la passation des marches publics, l a
     poursuite de la reforme de l a Fonction'publique par la mise enplace d'une gestion plus
     transparente et plus efficace des ressources humaines ; (iii)assurer une croissance
     economique forte et soutenue a travers la production rurale par le biais du
     desengagement de I'Etat de la production et de la commercialisation du coton.

I. Strategie de lutte contre la pauvrete

4. La StratCgie Nationale de Reduction de la Pauvrete(SNW) est la federation cohkrente
   et globale de l'ensemble des strategies sectorielles a mettre en aeuvre dans les
   prochaines annCes pour rtduire de moitie la pauvrete extreme au Tchad          a l'horizon
   2015. Elle s'inscrit dam un contexte international relativement favorable du fait de la
   disponibilitk des pays riches et des institutions intemationales a accompagner les pays
   pauvres dans la lutte contre la pauvrete. Le contexte national s'annonce tgalement
   propice du fait des avanctes significatives sur le plan dkmocratique, des reformes
   structurelles engagkes et des revenus additionnels qui sont gentrts par l'exploitation
   des champs petroliers de Miandum et KomC depuisjuillet 2003.

5. De ce qui precede, cinq axes strategiques et actions prioritaires sont retenus par le
   gouvemement pour la mise en ceuvre de cette strattgie nationale de reduction de la
   pauvrete et qui sont : (i)amkliorer l'environnement social, juridique, politique et
   economique ; (ii)assurer une croissance forte et soutenue ; (iii)ameliorer le capital
   humain ; (iv) amkliorer les conditions de vie des groupes vulnkrables et victimes du
   VIH/SIDA ;(v) restaurer et sauvegarder l'ecosysteme.

II. Les strategies dans les secteurs prioritaires

6. Plusieurs strategies ont Cte elaborees dans les secteurs dits prioritaires en se basant sur
   les grands stratigiques dkveloppes dans la SNRE'. La plupart de ces strategies sont
   traduit enbudget programme, ce qui permet de mieux cemer les objectifs recherches.

7. Ediication. Pour rialiser une education universelle de qualite a l'horizon 2015, le
   Gouvemement du Tchad, suite a la Table Ronde de Geneve IV en accord avec ses
   partenaires, a adopte en mars 2002 un programme decennal d'appui a la reforme du
    systeme educatif en vue : (i) d'une amelioration significative des indicateurs de
    quantite et de qualitt notamment le taux de retention et de scolarisation dans le
   primaire et dont quelques-uns uns sont retenus pour l'acces au point d'achevement ;
    (ii)du developpement de curricula nationaux, de la formation de la majorite des
   enseignants communautaires et de la conception de manuels scolaires tchadiens ; (iii)
    du developpement de programmes novateurs de lutte contre l'analphabetisme ;(iv) de
    l'amelioration de la qualite des apprentissages ;(v) de l'expkrimentation d'innovations
    comme la sante et la nutrition scolaires, l'education prkscolaire et l'education a
    distance ; (vi) d'une nette promotion de la scolarisation des filles. A cet effet le
    Gouvemement s'engage a entreprendre les mesures cles de politiques suivantes : un
    accroissement substantiel de la part du PIB consacree a 1'Cducation avec un objectif
    d'au moins 4% d'ici 2015, l'affectation d'au moins 50% du budget de l'education au
    developpement de l'enseignement de base, etc.

8. Sante`. L'objectif g6nCral de la politique nationale de santk est d'assurer a la
    population l'acces a des services de base de qualite s'inscrivant ainsi dans la
    philosophie de l'organisation Mondiale de la Sant6 a savoir santC pour fous sur un
    horizon aussi rapprochk que possible. Pour rCaliser a terme cet objectif, le
    gouvemement compte biitir sa politique         nationale de santC sur les axes : (i)le
    developpement des services de santC de base de qualit6 pour la population; (ii)
    l'urgence de disposer des ressources humaines de qualit6 ; (iii)l'amelioration de la


                                             3

   gestion du systeme de santt ; et (iv) la poursuite de la lutte contre les maladies
   endemiques et tpidkmiques

9. De`veloppement Rural. En Avril 2000, de concert avec les partenaires au
   developpement du Tchad, il a et6 identifie un Plan d'Intervention pour le
   Developpement Rural (PIDR), pour aider a mettre en ceuvre les programmes d'action
   issus de la CSDR. Le PIDR est donc un instrument d'appui           a l'operationnalisation de
   la consultation sectorielle sur le developpement rural. Dbs son identification le PIDR
   Ctait compose des deux (2) Programmes majeurs : i)le Programme de Renforcement
   des    Capacites    Sectorielles    (PROSE),      axe    sur l'appui     aux   organisations
   professionnelles et aux services du secteur rural, public et prive et ii)le Programme de
   Developpement Local (PRODEL), centre sur le developpement local et visant
   l'emergence et la responsabilisation des communautes decentralisees sur leur propre
   developpement et de deux (2) programmes transversaux : i)le Programme d'appui au
   Mecanisme de suivi du secteur et ii)le Programme d'Appui a la Micro-finance.

10.Sur la base de ce qui precede, plusieurs projets et programmes sont en cours
   d'instruction dont les plus importants sont l e Projet de Gestion des Ressources
   Naturelles en Zone Soudanienne (PGRN/ZS) et le Projet d'Appui au Systbme
   d'Elevage Pastoral (PASEP) avec le concours de la Banque Africaine de
   Developpement (BAD), le Projet d'Appui au Developpement Local (PROADEL) et le
   Projet d'appui aux Services Agricoles et aux Organisations des Producteurs (PSAOP)
   avec l'appui de la Banque Mondiale, le Programme de Developpement Rural
   Decentralise des Departements de Assongha, Biltine et OuaddaY (PRODABO) et l e
   Programme de Developpement Rural Decentralist des Departements du Mayo Dalla et
   de la Kabia (PRODAKA) avec l'appui de la Cooperation Allemande, etc.

11.Par ailleurs, dans le cadre de ses engagements sur le plan intemational, le
   Gouvemement du Tchad a initie les exercices suivants : le Plan d'Action National de
   Lutte contre la Desertification (PAN-LCD), le Programme National d'Action pour
   I'Environnement (PNAE), le Schema Directeur de 1'Eau et de I'Assainissement et la
   Strategie Nationale de Reduction de la Pauvrete (SNRP). S'agissant du PAN-LCD
   elabore et mis en auvre avant la Consultation Sectorielle sur le Developpement Rural
   (CSDR), ses orientations ont ete prises en compte.             Les grands axes ou objectifs
   decoulant des exercices posterieurs a la CSDR (PNAE, SDEA) ont ete pris en compte
   d'une part dans le PIDR en general et d'autre part dans les projets en instruction de
    maniere specifique. Au regard de ce qui precede la CSDR s'inscrit en droite ligne de
    la Strategie Nationale de Reduction de la Pauvrete. L'objectif central de la strategie
   sectorielle vise      l'augmentation durable du volume de production dans un
    environnement preserve et le renforcement des capacitbs dans le secteur rural. I1 s'agit
   de produire plus et mieux en vue de repondre aux nCcessitCs de developpement
   tconomique et d'amtliorer le niveau de vie des populations. Cet objectif traduit
   egalement la preoccupation de preserver l'environnement en tant que patrimoine et
    capital de production et d'accorder une place centrale a la femme et l'homme
    tchadiens dans toutes les perspectives de dkveloppement durable.

12. Dans le cadre du programme, le Gohernement s'engage a court et moyen terme a    4


    realiser les cinq (5) objectifs specifiques dtfinis et concourant tous a la realisation de
    l'objectif central de la strattgie sectorielle. I1s'agit de : i)l'augmentation durable de la
   production ;ii)l'emergence des filieres competitives ;iii)la gestion et valorisation des

    ressources naturelles; iv) la promotion du monde rural; et v) l'amelioration de
    I'efficacite des interventions publiques.

13. [En effet, la resolution des questions d'ordre physique, technique et institutionnel likes
    au secteur du coton, a laquelle le Gouvemement accorde une grande importance est un
    volet non moins important I1 s'engage dans le cadre de la StratCgie d'appui au Pays
    (SAP) de I'IDA en 2004-2005 a (i)rehabiliter et entretenir les routes rurales ; (ii)
    ameliorer la productivitk agricole par une recherche et une vulgarisation plus
    efficaces et (iii) de l'appui aux organisations de producteurs de coton.
                       foumir

14. ,  Dans le secteur des Travaux Publics et des Transports, le Gouvemement a adopt6 en
    novembre 1999, suite a la reunion de Genbve en 1998, la strattgie nationale des
    transports. Un des principaux objectifs pour la ptriode 2000 - 2009 est l'amelioration
    de l'accessibilitk en toute saison aux services socio-economiques a travers la
    praticabilitk de la circulation sur au moins 50% du rkseau national permanent. La
     strategie adoptee repose sur i)le desenclavement intkrieur et exterieur ;ii)la reduction
    des coiits de transports tant A l'inttrieur du pays que sur les tchanges intemationaux ;
     iii)la conservation d'une accessibilitk minimale         l'ensemble des regions du pays
    surtout en saison de pluie ;iv) l'obtention d'un lineaire suffisant de routes circulables
     toute 1'annCe et permettant de relier les principales villes du pays.

 15. Energie. Dans le souci de rtgler definitivement la question de la crise CnergCtique au
     Tchad, le Gouvemement a signt en septembre 2000 avec un groupe pnvC un contrat
     de gestion globale de la STEE. A cet effet un credit d'urgence d'un montant de 50,8
     millions de dollars US de I'IDA a CtC accorde en 2002 au gouvemement pour la
     construction d'une nouvelle centrale electrique A N'Djamena et la rehabilitation des
     groupes dans les principales villes du pays. Ceci a pour but d'equilibrer les comptes
     financiers de la STEE entre 18 et 24 mois et permettre a l'operateur prive de devenir
     partenaire de reference avec la majorite de capital social de la STEE privatisee. Trois
     ans apres ce cahier de charges n'est pas respectt. De ce qui precede, le gouvemement
     vient de resilier le contrat avec VIVENDI-DIETSMANN reprtsente par VEOLIA et a
     Clabore pour 2004 une strategie de sortie de la crise energttique assortie d'un
     chronogramme a court et moyen terme qu'il s'engage avec l'appui des partenaires a
     mettre en oeuvre. Cette strategie du Gouvemement consiste en 2004-2005 a : (i)
     renouveler et a augmenter les capacites de production a N'Djamena et aux centres
     secondaires par la rehabilitation des unites de production existantes, l'acquisition de
     quatre groupes caterpillar, l'installation des groupes MBH et l'installation e la centrale
     de Farcha d'une capacite de 21 MW. ; (ii)utiliser des sources d'energie moins cheres
     a travers l'etude de la possibilite de briiler le brut de Doba par le groupe MBH, la
     realisation du projet SEDIGUI permettant l'utilisation des combustibles moins chers
     et l'etude de la possibilitk d'utiliser le fuel lourd importe du cameroun ou du nigeria ;
     (iii)augmenterlescapacitesdeproductionauniveaunational

Ill. Les objectifs macroeconomiques et financiers 2004-2005

 16. Avant la devaluation du FCFA, 1'Cconomie tchadienne etait dans une situation de
     recession avec un taux de croisSancC.de -7% en 1993. En janvier 1994, grice a la
     devaluation, le pays a renouC avec les Institutions de Bretton Woods. L e programme
     triennal de la Facilite d'Ajustement Structure1 RenforcCe (FASR) sign6 en 1995
     (aprbs la suspension de la Facilite d'Ajustement Structure1 en 1992) a permis de
     realiser de 1995 a 1998 un taux moyen de croissance reel du PIB de 4,7% sur la


                                                5

   penode contre l'objectif de 5%. Les annees 1999 et 2000 ont connu des faibles taux de
   croissance de -0,8% et -0,6% dii         a la faible pluviomktrie et l'effet conjugut de la
   crise asiatique, de la baisse du cours mondial du prix de coton et l'augmentation du
   prix du petrole.

17. A la suite de plusieurs facteurs exogbnes notamment l'accklkration de la construction
   de l'oleoduc Tchad-Cameroun dont la fin des travaux a eu lieu en fin juillet 2003 ,
   I'economie tchadienne a connu un taux de croissance plus accblert que prevu et la
   croissance du PIB reel en 2001, 2002 et 2003 est respectivement de 9,4% en 2001 et
   10,1% en 2002 et 9,9% en 2003. I1 serait en hausse de 38,5% en 2004 et 14,6% en
   2005 (selon 1'INSEED). Panni les facteurs determinants, il convient de noter
   Cgalement (i)    l'effet combine de l'impact de la hausse de la productionde coton-graine
   pour la campagne 2001/2002 et 2002/2003, suite          a une bonne pluviometrie; (ii)les
   travaux d'infiastmctures lies a l'exploitation du petrole. L'investissement brut realis6
   durant la periode est de 34,7% du PIB en 2001 a 56,7 % du PIJ3 en 2002 puis A 42,0%
   en 2003 refletant l'accroissement massif de l'investissement prive dans le secteur
   pktrolier et dans les travaux publics. I1poursuivra sa tendance a la baisse du fait de la
   fin de la construction du pipeline et s'ktablirait a 15,7% en 2004 et 11,5% en 2005.
   Cependant, le reequilibrage du prix du coton observe depuis fin 2003 debut 2004,
   combine avec la subvention du prix d'achat par le gouvemement pour la prochaine
   campagne pourrait en 2004 avoir des effets positifs sur la croissance du PIB du
   secteur primaire et sur le revenu des cotonculteurs en 2004/2005.

18. Le niveau de l'inflation a atteint une moyenne de 12,4% au cours de l'annke 2001 a
   cause du deficit cerealier et de la famine qui a sevi au Tchad suite a la skcheresse de
    I'annCe 2000. Son niveau a regresse et s'est ttabli A -1,8% en 2003, et projete a -5%
   en 2004 et 3.3% en 2005, confirmant ainsi la maitrise complete des effets de hausse de
   prix qu'avait entraines la devaluation de 1994.

19. Le Gouvemement envisage d'autre part la poursuite de la mise en ceuvre des efforts
   d'assainissement des finances publiques centres sur i)la poursuite de la politique
   d'elargissement de l'assiette fiscale en direction du secteur informel par l'introduction
    des mesures visant a fiscaliser ce secteur ( acompte de 4%, le numtro d'identifiant
    fiscal (NIF),l'impBt general liberatoire) ;ii)la poursuite de la mise en ceuvre de la taxe
    sur la valeur ajoutee (TVA) au taux unique de 18% appliquee depuis 2000, la mise en
    application du plan d'action des impBts et taxes et de celui de la Douane afin de lutter
    contre la fraude, la contre bande et l'evasion fiscale.

20. A I'issue des discussions avec les missions tripartites du FMI, de la Banque Mondiale
    et de la Banque Afiicaine de Developpement, le Gouvemement s'est fix6 un certain
    nombre d'objectifs sectoriels et le budget 2004 qui bentficiera de l'appui de la Banque
    Mondiale et de la subvention       a  l'ajustement structure1 (SAS) de la France ( deja
    decaissee ) pour boucler le gap de financement a ete klaborb afin de pouvoir les
    atteindre. Dans le cadre de l'application de la loi NoO01/PU99 portant gestion des
    revenus petroliers 10% des revenus directs nets sont reserves aux generations fitures
    et 90% verses au Tr6sor et prC-affectes en grande partie aux secteurs prigritaires. L e
    gouvemement a pris quatre autres dectets d'application notamment :

        J   le dicret No238/PUMEF/03            portant mise en place du mecanisme de
            sterilisation des revenus pktroliers provenant de l'exploitation des trois champs
            de Komt, Miandoum et Bolobo ;


                                               6

          J le d6cret No239/PR/MEF/03          portant mise en place du mecanisme de
             stabilisation des depenses financkes au moyen des revenus p6troliers ;

          J le dCcretN0240/PRMEF/03 portant organisation, fonctionnement et conditions
             du contrale et de surveillance du collbge de contr6le et de surveillance des
              ressources pdtrolibres (CCSRP) ;

              le dCcret N0095/PR/MEF/04 portant modalitCs transitoires de gestion de
              redevances pktrolibres affectkes la rCgion productrice ;
                                               a
          J le dCcret No0961PR/MEF/04 portant modalitks         de gestion du Fonds pour les
              Generation Futures(FGF) .

 IV. Les Programmes de Reforme appuyes par les differents credits de I'IDA
     (CASIV, CAS V et le CARI)

  21. Avec I'amvCe des revenus pCtroliers en 2004, le Tchad a deux defis principaux : (i)
     s'assurer que les revenus soient utilisCs de fayon efficace et transparente pour la
     rtduction de la pauvrete ; (ii)promouvoir une croissance dans les secteurs non
     pbtroliers, surtout dans le secteur rural qui est la source de revenus pour la plupart des
     populations pauvres. Au vu de ces deux defis qui ont t t t confirmts par le processus
     d'elaboration du DSRP, le Gouvemement a lance [en 20011 un programme a moyen
     terme axe sur :

    I. lerenforcentent delaboririepouveniance
     a. le renforcement de la transparence, la responsabilisation, 1'Etat de droit et la

                                  ((                      ));
     b. une gestion saine et transparence des ressources publiques en vue de la reduction
          de la pauvreti, selon 3 axes :
               i.l'amelioration de la gestion budgetaire (prkparation, exicution, suivi et
                  evaluation des depenses publiques)    - contposante ((financespubliques u;

        secteur coton - contposante coton
                                      ((     )).


  22. Ce programme a CtC appuyk par la Banque mondiale a travers deux credits
      I'ajustement structure1 (CAS IV et CAS V). La troisieme phase de ce programme,
      dCcrite ci-dessous, sera appuyCe par le Credit d'Appui aux RCformes Institutionnelles
      (CARI).

  23. Le renforcement de la transparence, la responsabilisation, 1'Etat de droit et la
      participation dans le cadre de la StratCgie Nationale de Bonne Gouvemance (SNBG)
      font partie des principes dkmocratiques. Plusieurs actions ont CtC menCes avec I'appui

                                               7

  des CAS IV et V et beaucoup d'entre elles se poursuivront avec l'appui du C A M en
  vue de les consolider. Le gouvemement s'est engage a rdaliser certaines actions
  prdalables dans le domaine de la bonne gouvemance. I1s'agit de :

  i)      Elaborer unepremiire version de la stratkgie d'accb ci 1'information publique

          CCSRP et recruter des analystes.

24. Dans le cadre du programme qui sera soutenu par le CAR1 en 2004-2005, le
   gouvemement s'engage a :

   i)     faire publier par le C C S W des rapports annuels et timestriels et les difhser
          sur son site Intemet, avec un bilan annuel de l'utilisation des recettes

   Plusieurs actions et mesures ont ttt prises par le passt notamment avec les appuis des
   CAS IV et V. Certaines actions qui se poursuivent ont &e retenues par le
   gouvemement comme .des actions prealables aux nkgociations du C A N et ont tte
   realisees. I1s'agit de :

   i)      Prisenter dans les documents budgitaires 2003 soumis au Parlement un cadre
