The\n            reforms supported by the IRSC aim to enhance poverty\n            reduction by: (1) promoting good governance, including: (a)\n            enhanced transparency, accountability and adherence to the\n            rule of law; and (b) using public resources transparently,\n            accountably, and efficiently through reforming budget\n            preparation, execution, monitoring and reporting, public\n            procurement, and human resource management in the civil\n            service; and (2) causing sustainable growth in rural areas\n            through a profound reform of the cotton sector. The IRSC\n            focuses on key elements that underlie improved public\n            service delivery through improvements in budget preparation,\n            execution, and monitoring and better human resource\n            management in the civil service. The reform process\n            supported by the IRSC will pay particular attention to\n            empowering the independent institutions that provide the\n            checks and balances for the efficient management of\n            resources for poverty reduction in the executive,\n            legislative, and judicial branches of government, as well as\n            in the media and civil society, including farmers'\n            associations. Finally, the IRSC will complement and enhance\n            the impact of other Bank interventions, especially the\n            Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, and it s\n            associated capacity-building program for petroleum revenue\n            management the Management of the Petroleum Economy Project."}, "docdt": "2004-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
