Lessons learned:\n            The problem of commitment to reform was exacerbated by\n            changes in the senior management who was advocating the\n            reforms. Some resistance arose from the outset from\n            Directorate General of Land Communication (DGLC) and even\n            the Daops in Perumka/PTKA, and the commitment of Ministry of\n            Finance was not as strongly demonstrated as that of Bappenas\n            and the railways. The studies undertaken have increased the\n            awareness of Railway Persero (PTKA's) board and staff,\n            the IACC and senior government officials of the main issues\n            involved in restructuring, as well as the different\n            alternatives and approaches, and critical prerequisites for\n            any successful reform. Reform processes are inherently\n            complex to implement, require high degree of stakeholder\n            consultation, analysis of impacts on the various affected\n            groups and consensus building.
