general objective of improving\n            the economic efficiency and service quality of\n            Indonesia's railway sector, to position it to play its\n            proper role within the transport system, the Railway\n            Efficiency Project aims specifically at: a) railway\n            subsector policy reform by restructuring the railway\n            corporation, reforming its relationship with the government\n            and creating the foundations for expanded private\n            participation; b) rationalizing railway subsector capital\n            investments; c) improving railway subsector management and\n            operations; and d) increasing the physical capacity of an\n            important railway corridor.  The project consists of five\n            components: a) policy reform involving restructuring of\n            Perumka into a persero and reform of government corporate\n            interfaces; b) improvements to the railway between Jakarta\n            and Bandung to expand capacity, shorten passenger journey\n            time, and improve safety; c)implementation of a modern track\n            maintenance system on Java; d) implementation of a diesel\n            electric locomotive unit exchange maintenance system on\n            Java; and e) strengthening of Permuka's management."}, "docdt": "1996-10-17T00:00:00Z"}
