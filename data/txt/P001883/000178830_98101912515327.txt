MAURITI'z S
APPRAISAL OF A PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report proposes a project to enlarge and improve port facil-
ities at Port Louis, the capital city of Mauritius. The port plays a vital
role in Mauritius' economy, being the island's only deep water harbor with
mooring and cargo handling facilities.  Port traffic, which was fairly constant
from 1968 through 1971, increased from 1.51 million tons in 1971 to 1.77 mil-
lion tons in 1973 (i.e. 17%). Further growth up to 2.24 million tons by 1980
(27%) is anticipated, due to the impact on the economy of the Government's
1971-1975 Development Plan and strong indications that the eccnomy will con-
tinue to expand at a rapid pace as export processing industries are established.
ii.       Bagged commodities (mainly sugar) and petroleum products, the prin-
cipal cargoes, now account for about 48% and 19% respectively of total ton-
nages. Sugar and other bagged cargo is handled fairly adequately by lighters;
the introduction of alongside mechanized loading facilities for sugar is being
deferred due to the impact it would have on unemployment, which is already
high in Mauritius. Petroleum product handling facilities are satisfactory
and will be improved shortly when pipes are installed at a new bulk deep-water
berth. Port Louis' pressing problem concerns general cargo which now totals
260,000 tons and is expected to increase by 50% to 391,000 tons in 1980. At
present virtually all this cargo is handled by lighters, some 60% of which are
old and need replacing. The quays and storage facilities are becoming con-
gested and a high cargo damage and pilferage rate prevails. These risks in-
crease after dark and therefore little work is performed at night; consequently
ships' turnaround time is high. General port efficiency needs improvement:
responsibility for port operations and control is divided between several Gov-
ernment departments and private firms, and coordinated management and planning
is lacking.
iii.      The project comprises a first stage of a master plan for port devel-
opment, prepared by consultants Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (U.K.) with
financing from the British Overseas Development Administration (ODA).   It will
provide three deep-water general cargo berths, two sheds, administrative and
workshop buildings, cargo handling equipment, two replacement tugs, channel
and port basin deepening and technical assistance in port administration,
accounting and operations. A port authority will be established on commercial
lines, and financial, costing and budgetary control systems and cost-based
tariffs will be introduced with the aid of port advisors. The total estimated
cost of the project is US$16.12 million with a foreign exchange component of
US$12.12 million or 75% of total costs. The ODA is expected to finance the
cost of dredging, one of the tugs and equipment (US$2.24 million of which
US$0.59 million is for local costs) while the United Nations Development
Programme will provide US$0.12 million to cover the foreign cost of technical
assistance. A Bank loan of US$10.0 million is proposed to finance the foreign
exchange costs of construction, including supervising consultants.



- ii -
iv.       <he project will enable the port to handle efficiently the increas-
ing general cargo traffic and is expected to yield a satisfactory economic
return of about 17%. Main benefits will be lower handling costs, a faster
turnaround of ships and reduced damage and pilferage of cargo. Other bene-
fits which have not been quantified include improving the overall efficiency
of port operations as a result of consolidating responsibilities under a
quasi-autonomous body and introducing modern port management techniques.
The project will cause no reduction in employment opportunities. The civil
works contract for the project will contain an option for the construction of
the third berth, enabling the port authority to confirm, by no later than
March 1, 1976, the need to proceed with its construction, a decision to be
based on actual traffic developments up to that time. This arrangement will
enable the Government to minimize the port's capital investment in the un-
likely event that the economy suffers a setback during the next two years.
v.        The port's existing tariffs were last revised in 1967 whereas sub-
stantial salary and wage increases have since occurred. To enable the pro-
posed port authority to meet its financial obligations which include full
debt service coverage and the financing of the project's local costs, tariff
increases of 15% in 1976 and 20% in 1978 are assumed in the financial fore-
casts. They should enable the authority to achieve a minimum return of 7%
p.a. on net fixed assets in use in fiscal 1978 and thereafter. Assurances
from the Government were obtained during negotiations concerning this target
and debt and non-project capital expenditure limitation.
vi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$10.0 million equiv-
alent to the Government of Mauritius, to be onlent to the port authority.
Repayment over 25 years including five years grace is proposed.



MAURITIUS
APPRAISAL OF A PORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Mauritius has requested Bank assistance to help
finance investments to be made at Port Louis harbor, the island's only com-
mercial deep-water port. There are currently no deep-water berths for gen-
eral cargo and most goods are loaded and unloaded by lighters. Responsibil-
ity for lighterage quays and storage facilities is divided between several
government departments and private interests, cargo pilferage and damage is
high and ship turnaround time long. The Government is aware of these inade-
quacies and in December 1971 appointed British consultants, Sir Alexander
Gibb and Partners 1/, financed by the U.K. Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) to prepare a master plan for port development. On the basis of the con-
sultants' recommendations, the Government has decided (a) to construct deep-
water berths to reduce lighterage operations and thus decrease ships' turn-
around time and cargo handling costs and improve the security of cargo; and
(b) to create a port authority to operate the port efficiently and on commer-
cial lines.
1.02      The proposed project, which will be the first lending operation
of the Bank Group in the transport sector in Mauritius, comprises a first
phase of the master plan. Total project costs are estimated at US$16.12 mil-
lion with a foreign exchange component of US$12.12 million (75%). ODA is
expected to finance US$2.24 million equivalent of project costs (of which
US$0.59 million is for local costs) and the United Nations Development Pro-
gramme (UNDP), an additional US$0.12 million. The Bank will finance US$10
million of the foreign exchange expenditures; i.e., about 83% of the foreign
costs or about 62% of the total project costs (para. 4.07).
1.03      This report is based on information supplied by the Government, on
the ODA-financed port study, and on the findings of Bank appraisal missions
in June and October 1973 consisting of Messrs. F. Lawson (Economist), K.C.
Rodley (Financial Analyst) and R.Y. Scheiner (Consultant Engineer). The
report was edited by Miss J. Murphy.
2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Mauritius (Map 10782) is a small and densely populated island situated
in the Indian Ocean about 550 miles east of Madagascar and 1,500 miles from the
1/   In association with Freeman Fox and Associates (U.K.).



- 2 -
African coast. With an area of only 720 sq mi, and a population of about
850,000 persons, there are nearly 1,200 inhabitants per square mile. In
addition, 25,000 inhabitants live on the island of Rodrigues, some 400 miles
to the east.
2.02      The population increase, now 1.8% per annum (compared to a rapid 3%
in the 1950's), and the island's isolated location, small size and limited
resource base, have all contributed to hindering economic development. The
economy is based essentially on sugar production, which occupies about 95%
of all arable land and accounts for over 90% of all export earnings.
Mauritius's development is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the world
market for sugar and, since it is situated in the cyclone belt, to the vag-
aries of climate.
2.03      During the 1960's, GNP per capita stagnated because of the poor
international market for sugar. In recent years, however, there has been an
upsurge of per capita income, in part owing to excellent levels of sugar pro-
duction and record world prices. The effects of this turnaround are, however,
only slowly being felt by the bulk of the population. Unemployment is still
a serious problem. About 40,000 persons are out of jobs (16% of the labor
force) of which 30,000 are aged between 15 and 25. The Government is aware
of these problems and aims in the 1971-1975 Development Plan to create over
50,000 new job opportunities by 1975, and increase the rate of economic devel-
opment to 7% per annum. These targets may be ambitious in spite of the recent
very favorable developments in the world sugar market and the positive re-
sponse the Government is getting to its program of establishing export-oriented
industries.
2.04      The Bank Group is assisting Mauritius to achieve these targets
through two recent projects, the Rural Development Project and the Coromandel
Industrial Estate Project which together will help create some 16,000 tem-
porary and permanent jobs. As part of its employment creation program the
Government also plans to establish export processing industries at Mer Rouge
(245 acres), an area of Port Louis adjacent to the harbor; reclamation of
the area, now a tidal flat, is underway (para. 3.02). Efficient transport
facilities, in particular shipping and aviation, are also essential to
achieve the industrialization targets set by the Government.
B. The Transport Modes
2.05      Internal transport in Mauritius is entirely by road, an un-
economic railway system (62 miles) having been phased out in the mid-1960's.
The island is served by a well-developed road network. Over 870 miles of
roads, of which about 610 miles are paved, crisscross the island, giving a
total road density of 1.2 mi/sq mi, one of the highest in the world. A 10
mile expressway connecting Port Louis and Phoenix to the south has recently



- 3 -
been completed and several other projects are in different stages of prepara-
tion. These include constructing a 3.4 mile expressway between Port Louis
and Terre Rouge in the north at a cost of about US$2 million; interconnecting
the southern and northern expressways via a partially elevated highway through
the capital at an estimated cost of US$6 million; and eventually, extending
the northern expressway to a new airport to be built in the northeast.
2.06      The international airport at Plaisance on the southeastern tip of
the island is the only airport serving Mauritius. Aircraft movements at the
airport have increased dramatically, from 735 in 1961 to about 2,600 in 1972,
reflecting both increased tourism (some 49,000 tourists visited the island
in 1972 compared to only 15,000 in 1957) and the island's strategic location
as a refuelling stop on the Africa/Australia route. Twelve international
carriers hive scheduled services to Mauritius, with some 25 weekly flights in
total. Light aircraft fly twice weekly to the island of Rodrigues, which
has a small airport.
2.07      Although major improvements were made to Plaisance airport in recent
years to accommodate modern jet aircraft, the Government has now decided to
construct a new airport at the Plaines des Roches, since the existing facili-
ties restrict jet aircraft, especially in adverse weather conditions and at
night. Reportedly, financing of the order of US$30 million equivalent is
being arranged with the People's Republic of China. The complete scheme, in-
cluding construction of a 12 mile expressway to Port Louis would cost about
US$36 million equivalent. Detailed plans and designs are still lacking and
costs could in fact be higher. Construction is expected to start in 1974/75
and to last about four years.
2.08      Imports and exports are shipped through Port Louis, the country's
only commercial deep-water port. The island has another deep-water harbor
at Grand Port in the southeast but because of its exposure to the southeast
tradewinds and storms, it is not utilized for commercial shipping. Port
Louis has an excellent natural harbor and, located on the island's northwest
side, is well protected from prevailing storms by the surrounding mountains.
In 1972, Port Louis handled a total of 1.76 million tons of cargo, comprising
670,000 tons of sugar for export, 540,000 tons of general and bagged cargo,
and 550,000 tons of bulk cargo (petroleum products, cement and edible oils).
Details concerning the port's facilities and operations are given in Chapter 3.
C. Transport Coordination and Planning
2.09      The existing transport modes complement rather than compete with
one another and transport coordination is therefore not a major issue. Plan-
ning in transport, as in other sectors, is the responsibility of the Economic
Planning Unit in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. The
various ministries responsible for implementing transport projects have not



- 4 -
had adequate capacity to meet the ambitious targets established in the
1971-1975 Development Plan and the program has therefore slipped consider-
ably. Implementation is, however, expected to improve during the remaining
plan period with expert assistance provided by the Canadian International
Development Agency.
3. PORT FACTLITIES, OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
A. Port Facilities (Annex 1 and Photograph)
3.01      The seaward approach to Port Louis is a 600 ft wide, 1-1/2 mile
long channel with a water depth of 32 feet below MLW 1/ (maximum tidal range
..2 ft), suitable for general cargo vessels and bulk carriers of up to about
18,000 DWT. 2/ The harbor, which is virtually free of siltation, comprises
a main basin with a water area of 320 acres and two adjacent minor basins
of 22 and 8 acres, respectively.
3.02      The Government has been dredging the harbor for the past three
years as part of its Mer Rouge reclamation scheme, and to date some 50 acres
of land have been partially reclaimed. In mid-1973, ODA agreed to finance
the remaining reclamation dredging program. A U.K. dredging contractor is
undertaking this work. When the program is completed at the end of 1974, most
of the harbor will have been dredged to a depth of 40 feet. Little or no
maintenance dredging will be needed.
3.03      The port is predominantly for lighterage, with 15 mooring buoys for
vessels of from 20 to 30 foot draft. Ocean-going general cargo is handled
at three public lighterage quays (A,B and E) having a total length of 1,500
feet, and a fourth (Quay C) serves inter-island traffic. Sugar, the port's
largest export commodity, is taken by lighter directly from the quays adjacent
to the dock companies' warehouses to the vessels in the stream where the bags
are emptied into the hatches. Bagged cargo, such as rice, flour and pulses,
are taken by lighter to the Government-owned granary. There are two deep-
water alongside quays, used mainly for liquid and dry bulk cargo. Petroleum
products are also unloaded via a submarine pipeline, and bulk cement is pumped
into silos at an old timber jetty.
3.04      Ouays A and B are equipped with small mobile cranes of 3/4 ton
capacity; Quay B also has an 18-ton electric tower-crane and a few mobile
cranes of capacities up to 20 tons for heavy cargo. Further equipment for
general cargo handling is on order, financed by ODA, but no mechanical bulk-
handling facilities for sugar are presently foreseen because their installa-
tion would create unemployment for some 1,500 to 2,000 workers, thereby com-
pounding the island's serious unemployment problem.
1/   All water depths quoted are below Mean Low Water (MLW).
2/   Deadweight tons.



-5-
B. Operations
3.05      Lighterage and cargo handling operations, excluding liquid bulk and
cement, are labor intensive. The total labor force employed is about 3,500,
divided into two main groups: stevedores working on the vessels, and dock
labor working on the lighters, quays and in the warehouses.
3.06      Time required by labor to reach ship and shore during lunch and
breakfast stoppages reduce the actual daily working hours to about nine on
weekdays and five on Saturday, including one to two hours of overtime per
day. The average tonnage handled per general cargo vessel is at present
1,200 tons discharged and 200 tons loaded. Hatch-hour output is low at about
10 tons per hour; the average ship service time is high at about llC hours
and is increasing. Night work is infrequent for bagged cargo and rare for
general cargo since lighterage after dark increases the already considerable
pilferage and damage due to double-handling and poor and uncoordinated super-
vision at quays and in the transit shed. Alongside berths to be provided
under the project will facilitate safe and efficient cargo handling at night
and provide an opportunity to introduce multi-shift working arrangements for
labor. During negotiations the Government agreed to introduce such arrange-
ments when the proposed berths become operational.
3.07      Sugar is loaded mainly during June-November at a rate of 1,000-
1,200 tons per ship-day. Other bagged cargo is handled at rates of 600-1,000
tons per ship-day, the varying rates depending upon barge availability and
elevator capacity at the granary. Petroleum products are pumped either from
vessels in the stream via a submarine pipeline to the tank farm at Fort
William, or from alongside Quay D to and from tank farms just behind the quay.
Bulk cement is pumped at a rate of 300 tons per hour from cement carriers
into silos with 7,500 tons capacity.
C. Administration
3.08      The Marine Services Department (MSD) of the Ministry of Communica-
tions, employing some 300 staff headed by the Director of Marine, is responsi-
ble for pilotage, ship towage, dredging, navigational aids, maintenance of
buoys and enforcement of harbor and safety regulations. Other government
departments, such as Customs, Police, Treasury, Lands, and Public Works
also have jurisdiction over and responsibilities for various port functions.
MBD has no effective control over cargo handling or storage operations;
private firms are responsible for allocating berths and buoys and for cargo
handling, including control of the Government-owned transit sheds. These in-
clude three stevedoring companies which are responsible to the shipping
companies for handling cargo between ships and lighters and two dock companies
owning the lighters, small tugs and most of the private warehouses in the port
which are responsible for the movement of cargo between vessels, the quays,
transit sheds and warehouses.



-6-
3.09      Divided responsibilities and lack of overall control constitute
fundamental weaknesses which inevitably lead to serious operating difficul-
ties and materially reduced port efficiency. Cargo pilferage and damage is
high and storage space is inadequately utilized. Also, there has been no
continuous port development planning, and financial and cost controls are
lacking.
3.1O      The Government is aware of these inadequacies and at the recommenda-
tion of the consultants commissioned to undertake an overall study of port
development, has decided to create a National Port Authority (NPA), responsible
for all aspects of port administration, operations, and finance. A chief
executive will have overall control of day-to-day operations, responsible to
a board which will determine policy. Initially, at least, the stevedoring
and dock companies would continue to handle cargo into lighters and onto wharves,
both private and public, but would do so under license from and subject to over-
all supervision and security control by NPA, which would also allocate berths,
covered and open storage space and cargo handling equipment. NPA responsibil-
ities will widen as the project's deep-water berths become operational, and
less use is made of private lighters and premises. By then, an experienced
management structure will have been established within NPA with sufficient
resources to employ stevedoring and dock labor directly, should this be de-
sired. During negotiations the Government agreed to create a National Port
Authority no later than January 1, 1975, with such powers, responsibilities,
organization, resources, financial structure and policies as shall be mutually
acceptable to the Government and the Bank.
3.11      Although no difficulty is envisaged in engaging qualified staff for
management posts in NPA, they will lack port experience. Consequently tech-
nical assistance in administration, finance and cargo-handling operations is
needed to create and develop an efficient and financially viable port organi-
zation. Under the project two port advisors will be provided for two years
financed by the UNDP with the Bank as executing agency. Draft terms of
reference are given in Annex 2. During negotiations, the Government agreed
that these advisors will be appointed by mid-1974 if possible, but no later
than September 1, 1974.
D. Budgets, Accounts, Audit and Insurance
3.12      No complete port accounting or costing systems exist.  Cash receipts
collected by various Government departments for public sector services in the
port, as well as cash expenses incurred by the MSD, are shown in the national
budget; however, many port expenses such as repairs, power, clerical, account-
ing and staff welfare costs are included in various non-port budget items
and are not fully identifiable. No fixed asset accounts are kept and no de-
preciation is provided for. Commercial accounting, costing and budgetary
control systems will need to be established by NPA, assisted by the port
advisors; during negotiations the Government agreed that accounting and
costing systems satisfactory to the Bank will be introduced in NPA no later
than January 1, 1976.



- 7 -
3.13      As a Government department, MSD's revenues and expenditures are
subject to audit by the Director of Audit. However, as the accounting system
of NPA will be based on commercial practice, the accounts should be audited
by qualified independent external auditors. During negotiations, the Govern-
ment agreed that independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank will be employed
to audit NPA accounts.
3.14      Since the Government's port facilities are presently self-insured
out of general revenue and an insurance reserve may not be available for
take-over by NPA, it was agreed during negotiations that no later than
January 1, 1976, NPA will provide for insurance for such risks and in such
amounts as are consistent with good commercial practice.
E. Tariffs and Costs
3.15      The present tariffs (Annex 3) were established in 1965, with only
minor amendments subsequently, including a 5% surcharge in 1967. A review
of the tariff structure undertaken as part of the ODA-financed port study
revealed that while the revenue yields a reasonable overall surplus for MSD,
the tariffs are not cost-based. Furthermore, some distinctions between dues
on vessels, dues on cargo and special dues are not clear, and dues are not
always levied on a consistent basis, some services being rendered free of
charge. The study proposes changes to the structure and to specific rates,
the application of which, up to 1980, would not yield more revenue than
existing tariffs. The consultants' recommendations are of limited use, how-
ever, as their review was based on fiscal 1971 operating costs without ade-
quate allowance for inflation or the cost of new deep-water berths. Further-
more, MSD salary scales were increased by over 40% in fiscal 1974. As totally
realistic port costs will not be ascertainable until the end of NPA's first
year of operations, a comprehensive tariff review should be undertaken at
that time. NPA should not be required to render services gratuitiously or
at a charge insufficient to cover the costs involved unless the Government
undertakes to make good the loss incurred. During negotiations, the Govern-
ment agreed that revised tariff charges based on cost and market considerations
will be introduced by July 1, 1976. Any prior interim increase made necessary
by rising costs would probably be by way of a surcharge (para. 6.05).
F. Port Planning and Development
3.16      The ODA-financed port study, completed in February 1973, contains
a long-term master plan for developing Port Louis (Map 10827) which calls for
(i) extending Quay 1 for bulk cargo, (ii) constructing additional deep-water
berths for general cargo, and (iii) providing a quay and storage facilities
for mechanized sugar operations near Fort William. The consultants have
recommended that, as a first phase of the master plan, alongside facilities
should be provided as required to handle general cargo through 1980. On the



- 8 -
basis of their traffic forecasts, the consultants have recommended construct-
ing two deep-water berths, but application of a port simulation model (para.
5.04) suggests that three berths will be needed if recent traffic trends con-
tinue. The proposed project covers a first phase of the master plan for
Port Louis with provision of either three or two berths depending on actual
Lraffic growth (para. 4.11).
4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project, described in more detail in Annex 4, includes the
following:
(a)  construction of three deep-water berths, a small jetty,
mooring dolphins, sheds and administrative and workshop
buildings, together with consultants' services for
engineering and supervision of construction;
(b)  purchase of cargo-handling equipment and two tugs;
(c)  completion of the port dredging program; and
(d)  technical assistance to the NPA in port administration,
accounting and operations.
4.02      The deep-water berths to be constructed will be for general cargo,
each approxinately 600 feet long. Two transit sheds will be provided and a
third will be transferred from Quay E if it is found to be required (para.
4.11). The new jetty will be for ships carrying cement in bulk and will re-
place an old timber jetty nearby which requires demolishing to make way for
Berth 2. The new location is in an area designated by the master plan for
the eventual extension of Berth 1; however, the provision of a new jetty
and mooring dolphins for Berth 1 was found to be less costly than extending
the quay.
4.03      The mechanical cargo handling equipment will be for the new general
cargo berths when completed, and the tugs will replace two existing ones in
poor condition. The port dredging program, part of the Mer Rouge land
reclamation scheme (para. 3.02), will result in an overall depth of 40 feet,
more than satisfying the port's presently foreseeable needs. The technical
assistance will help the new NPA to establish sound financial, operating
and administrative procedures (para. 3.11).

B. Cost Estimates and Financing
4.04      The total estimated cost of the project (including three berths) is
US$16.12 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$12.12 mil-
lion equivalent or 75%. Local costs include import duties, averaging about
10% of the c.i.f. price of imported materials. Detailed cost estimates are
given in Table 1 and summarized below:

Contingencies:

4.05      The construction cost estimates, updated to reflect expected prices
at the time of bidding in early 1975 (taking into account known effects of
recent fuel price increases and assuming price escalation of 12% p.a. through
1974), are based on the consultants' port study, including their preliminary
design analysis for buildings, on the actual construction costs for Berth 1
completed in late 1971, and on the contract for rehabilitating Quay E signed in
early 1973. As most of the soil investigations and hydrographic studies have
been completed, an overall physical contingency of 5% is considered adequate;
the only substantial variant is likely to be the length of piles. A price con-
tingency has been provided to cover price increases during construction (1975 -
1978) of between 8% and 10% p.a. on berths and buildings and between 5% and 7%
p.a. on equipment. It has not been possible in making these estimates to take
full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. The
allocation for dredging is based on the actual contract, awarded in 1973, on a
fixed price basis. The contract for two tugs has also been awarded; it provides
only for labor cost increases as the engines and steelwork were imported in
1973. Estimates for consultant services and technical assistance are based on
expected man-month requirements.
4.06      The UNDP will finance the technical assistance to NPA; the Govern-
ment has filed an application for a grant of US$120,000 to cover project re-
quirements for which adequate provision is made in the UNDP country program
for Mauritius. ODA will finance the costs of dredging, of mechanical equip-
ment and of one of the two tugs. ODA has already approved a loan to the
Government to help finance the Mer Rouge reclamation scheme, of which US$1.01
million equivalent is estimated to be the amount attributable to port dredging



- 10 -
requirements. The cost of the tug will be met by a second ODA loan of about
US$607,000 equivalent to be finalized shortly. ODA is also expected to finance
the mechanical equipment (US$623,000) but is unable to give a firm commitment
at this time since the equipment will not be needed until 1977-78 when the new
berths are completed. During negotiations, the Government agreed to obtain
alternative financing for the cargo-handling equipment should ODA be unable
to finance it.  The Bank silL finance the foreign costs of construction, in-
cluding engineering and supervision by consultants, totalling US$10 million
equivalent. NPA will finance the remaining project costs totalling US$3.76
million (of which US$350,000 is the foreign exchange cost of the second tug).
The ODA and Bank contributions will be in the form of loans to the Government
relent to NPA on current bank terms (para. 6.10).
4.07      The financing of project costs is summarized as follows:
US$ million equivalent -
Local   Foreign   Total    %
UNDP                   -        0.12      0.12      1%
ODA                   0.59      1.65      2.24    14%
IBRD                   -      10.00      10.00    62%
NPA                   3.41     0.35       3.76    23%
4.00    12.12      16.12   100%
4.08      Disbursements from the IBRD loan account will be on the following
basis:
(a) 77% of all civil works except dredging, which represents
the estimated foreign exchange component, and
(b) the actual foreign exchange costs of engineering
consultants' services.
The schedule of estimated disbursements is shown in Table 2. Any surplus
funds remaining in the loan account upon project completion should be cancelled.
C. Execution
4.09      The Ministry of Communications, assisted by Ministry of Public Works'
technical staff, will be responsible for project execution until creation of
NPA in early 1975, at which time the port authority will take over this re-
sponsibility. Consultants acceptable to the Bank will be employed to complete
engineering, to prepare bidding documents and to supervise construction. The
Government has selected Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners for this task, which
is satisfactory. Detailed engineering is expected to start in Narch 1974;
any payments made prior to loan signature, not likely to exceed US$100,000,
will be financed retroactively.



- 11 -
4.10      Construction will be by contract awarded to prequalified contractors
after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guide-
lines. Contractors will be permitted to submit alternative design proposals
for wharves. In estimating the foreign exchange costs it has been assumed that
the major contracts (those for the wharves, jetty, and shed steelwork) will be
awarded to foreign contractors as local contractors are unable to undertake
major civil works; however, to encourage their participation in the project,
separate contracts are anticipated for shed erection and other buildings and
asphalting. Construction is expected to start in early 1975 and to be completed
in late 1978 (Annex 5).
4.11      In order to minimize the port's capital investment in the unlikely
event that the economy suffers a setback during the next two years, thetcon-
tract for the wharves will contain an option for constructing Berth 4, which
will only be undertaken if actual traffic developments through 1975 confirm
that it is required. During negotiations, the Government agreed that it will
agree with the Bank no later than March 1, 1976, whether to proceed with con-
struction of this berth. The criteria and methodology to be used in deter-
mining the need for Berth 4 were agreed informally.
D. Ecology
4.12      The project will not cause any ecological disturbances in the
harbor of Port Louis or its environment. The reclamation of the Mer Rouge
area will improve living conditions in the immediate vicinity as this area
is now used illegally to dump rubbish. To safeguard the harbor against
adverse effects from future reclamation or other works, the Government has
agreed not to make or permit any offshore physical changes such as would
impair the port's effectiveness.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Background
5.01      The port facilities at Port Louis are becoming increasingly inad-
equate to handle the expanding traffic. Insufficient lighterage quays, shed
space and barges are causing increased delays to ships, with unloading and
loading of general cargo vessels (averaging about 1,420 tons import and export
cargo) taking about five days. If port operations are not improved, it is
likely that a freight rate surcharge will be imposed on Mauritius by ship-
owners. Partly because of increasing delays at Port Louis, freight rates
increased by more than 30% during a twelve month period 1970-71.



- 12 -
5.02      In determining the optimum solution for developing Port Louis in
the near term, the consultants assessed a number of various cargo handling
systems and their relative cost, with the objective not only of increasing
port capacity but also of reducing operating costs. They considered, for
example, the possibility of shifting from the present labor intensive method
for handling sugar exports to a mechanized system. This scheme, however, has
a major disadvantage in that some 1,750 jobs would become redundant, thereby
compounding the unemployment problem in Mauritius; the Government has there-
fore decided to postpone mechanization of sugar handling until the ongoing
industrialization program is sufficiently advanced to absorb at least some of
the redundant workers. The mechanized handling of bagged cargoes, such as
rice and flour, was also considered, but this too would create considerable
unemployment as well as necessitate relocating the specialized storage facili-
ties for these commodities (the Government's granary, for example). The most
promising immediate solution to relieve congestion, improve operations, and
reduce operating costs was found to be the provision of alongside facilities
for general cargo; this would reduce port handling costs for general cargo
from the high Mau Rs 22 per ton now being experienced using lighterage oper-
ations to about Mau Rs 15 per ton.
B. Traffic Forecasts
5.03      General cargo traffic at Port Louis, which is closely tied with
industrial demand and GDP growth, has grown steadily over the past few years,
increasing at about 5% p.a. between 1969 and 1971. Between 1971 and 1972,
an unprecedented growth of 32% was recorded, attributable in part to an over-
flow from 1971 when there had been a strike in the port and the fact that
1972 was an exceptionally good year for sugar in terms of both weather and
market prices. Rather than dropping the following year, however, general
cargo traffic has continued to grow, and preliminary figures for 1973 indi-
cate an increase of 8% over the 1972 levels. For the project analysis, it
has been assumed that general cargo traffic will grow from the 1973 level
of 260,000 tons to about 390,000 tons in 1980, or at an average annual growth
of 6% (Table 3 and Annex 6).
C. Berth Requirements
5.04      In assessing the number of general cargo deep-water berths required
through 1980, the consultants assumed that as much as 150,000 tons could be
handled at each berth annually. While this is a feasible assumption for a
multi-berth port, it does not accurately measure effective throughput in
ports with only one or two berths. The Bank therefore applied a port simula-
tion model for operations up to 1980, to ascertain the throughput and conges-
tion that would arise, should the project as a whole, or parts of it, not be
undertaken. The variables and parameters used in the model are given in
Table 4. The results show that the annual throughput for each of three along-
side general cargo berths would vary from 102,000 to 116,000 tons with in-
creasing traffic and operating two work shifts. Thus by 1980, a fourth berth



- 13 -
would be required if all projected general cargo were to be handled alongside.
Handling overflow tonnages at buoys during peak periods was found to be more
economic, since it will allow the regular use of some lighters, which will
continue to be utilized for sugar during its export season. More intensive
use of the proposed three berths can be achieved when necessary by introducing
a third work shift.
5.05      As detailed in Table 4, operations at the existing two alongside
berths (Quays D and 1) were also simulated for 1980. These berths will con-
tinue to handle bulk commodities such as molasses, edible oils, petroleum
products, fertilizers and chemicals. The analysis showed that there will be
sufficient capacity for the projected volume of traffic with acceptable ship
waiting times.
5.06      The new cement pier is to be built between existing Berth 1 and
proposed Berth 2 since the simulation analysis showed that if cement were to
be handled at Berth 1, the average waiting time of ships using that berth would
increase considerably.
D. Optimum Alongside Scheme
5.07      In selecting the optimum scheme for alongside berths the consul-
tants investigated various alternatives, with the object of selecting that
alternative which would minimize total port costs, including those associated
with traffic that would continue to be lightered. Costs were expressed in
accounting price terms (Annex 7), discounted to obtain the net present cost
of each scheme. The alternatives analyzed included different sequences and
timing of quay, shed and other construction.
5.08      The analysis showed that the most economical scheme would be to
construct Berths 2 and 3 and reconstruct existing Quay A. However, the second
best alternative, that is, building Berths 2, 3 and 4 is only 9% more expen-
sive using a discount factor of 10% and assumed traffic levels. It presents
considerable but unquantifiable advantages over the consultant's initial
choice in avoiding seriously disrupting port operations during the recon-
struction of Quay A. In addition, this scheme for Berths 2, 3 and 4 offers
the advantage of concentrating all general cargo in one area close to the
Mer Rouge export processing zone.
E. Economic Return
5.09      A summary of investment costs used in the analysis is given in
Table 5 and cargo handling costs in Table 6. The project was also evaluated
on the basis of shadow pricing for costs and benefits, in particular labor
costs.



- 14 -
5.10      The economic return was estimated by comparing the proposed invest-
ments with the 'do nothing' alternative of maintaining lighterage for general
cargo. This is not, in fact, a complete 'do nothing' situation, since sub-
stantial capital investments would still be needed to: (a) construct additional
lighterage quays and transit sheds at a total cost of Mau Rs 16.1 million as
traffic increases; (b) procure additional or replacement of lighters (Mau Rs
1.9 million); and (c) procure additional lighterage quay equipment (Mau Rs 2.9
million). These costs are avoided if deep-water berths are constructed, so
they have been deducted from the deep-water quay capital costs. Other savings
accruing from the project are as follows (Tables 5 and 6):
(a) savings of Mau Rs 4.59 per ton (excluding depreciation and
interest) by eliminating lighter operations and Mau Rs 2.45
per ton by reducing unit costs of stevedores and dockers
through increased efficiency with alongside working and
lower overheads because of multi-shift working, together
accounting for 16% of the project's total benefits;
(b) reduction in the average service time of ships from an
estimated 136 hours by lighters (for cargo of 1,700 tons) to
80 hours for alongside operations. Allowing for a 15% in-
creased lighter output in future, which might be possible with
additional modern lighterage quays, lighters and mechanical
equipment, the net savings in ship time is estimated at about
36 hours per ship or, at Mau Rs 10,000 per ship day, Mau Rs
9 per ton of cargo handled at the port. This benefit, accounting
for 24% of the project's total benefits, is expected to accrue
to the economy through a minimizing of future freight rates; and
gc) reductions in loss and damage due to the elimination of double
handling (minimum of 1-1/2% of the value of the average general
cargo ton, conservatively estimated at Mau Rs 1,500). These
benefits, accounting for 60% of the project's total benefits,
accrue to Mauritius by way of reduced insurance premiums and
shipping conference surcharges.
The introduction of cost-based tariffs scheduled for 1976 will ensure that
Mauritius recoups an adequate share of projeet benefits should they not be
reflected in reduced freight rates.
5.11      On these assumptions the overall investment yields an economic
return of 17% over a period of 25 years (Table 5). Alternatively, using
accounting prices as described in Annex 7, the return is only marginally
lower since the effect on both costs and benefits is almost the same. The
first year return is 16% for the project as a whole. The first year return
for each of the berths is 16%, 19% and 19% respectively, the difference being
explained by the fact that benefits are mainly in the form of savings in cargo
handling costs, and the cost of Berth 3 and 4 is somewhat less than that of
Berth 2.



- 1 5 -
5.12      Berth 4 need only handle about 55,000 tons in 1979 to have a first
year return of about 10%. IJith Berths 2 and 3 capable of together handling
about 210,000 tons of general cargo, traffic across the wharves totalling more
than 265,000 tons per year would seemingly warrant Berth 4. However, as some
cargo will undoubtedly be handled by lighter when bunching of ship arriva.s
would otherwise produce unacceptable waiting times and as some cargo will be
handled at specialized berths, a total port throughput of general cargo of about
310,000 tons would be the likely minimum to justify Berth 4. If traffic growth
were to fall from the 6% p.a. expected to below 3%, 1979 througnput would be
less than this minimum. In view of this fact and the uncertainties due to the
worldwide oil crisis and the probable reopening of the Suez Canal, an option
for final commitment of Berth 4 will be kept open (para. 4.11).
F. Sensitivity Analysis
5.13      The sensitivity of the return estimated for the project as a whole
was tested by assuming variations from the best estimates. If construction
costs of the berths increased by 15% and the savings attributable to the
avoidable cost of lighterage operation were reduced by 15%, the economic
return would still be a satisfactory 14%.
G. Employment Effect
5.14      The project will cause no reduction in employment opportunities;
rather, with the growth in traffic and the introduction of multi-shift oper-
ations made possible with the project, more workers are expected to be employed
than presently required using lighterage.
6.  FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Backgrotind
6.01      Port operating costs incurred by the Marine Services Department,
representing nearly 90% of the Government's annual recurrent port expenditure,
have been accurately identified. The remainder, incurred by various other
Government departments, have been reasonably estimated and the Government-
owned port fixed assets have been valued at depreciated replacement cost by
the consultants to provide a basis for calc-lating annual depreciation charges,
a financial rate of return and the extent of Government equity in the proposed NPA.
6.02      Revenues in the recent past have produced an adequate return on
assets. However, the overall financial objectives behind the existing tariff
structure are obscure; some services are rendered free of charge, and certain
other rates are below cost. These anomalies should be rectified by NPA, the
financial objectives of which should ensure that tariffs are cost-based and
that the cash generation from operations is adequate to provide, among other
things, full debt service coverage and a reasonable contribution towards a
capital replacemenit and investment program properly related to anticipated
traffic and inflationary conditions.

These results are satisfactory; there were no debt service charges during the
period under review. As the operations were conducted by Government depart-
ments, no balance sheets were prepared.
C. Future Prospects
6.04      Financial forecasts are based on projected traffic growth (Table 3),
application of the present tariff structure, and the following basic assump-
tions: (a) NPA will be operative by January 1, 1975; (b) the project's first
deep-water general cargo berth will become operational by July 1, 1977, and
the second and third by July 1, 1978; (c) stevedoring and cargo handling labor
will continue to be provided by private firms but under license by and subject
to the overall supervisory control of NPA; and (d) the Government will vest
port fixed assets and adequate working capital as equity in NPA. The fore-
casts also take into account approved salary and wage incremental formulae
and cost of living increases provided in the Sedgwick Salary Report, 1973,
wltich the Government has adopted. Annual price level increases, based on the
experience of Mauritius during the past three years but accelerated for cer-
tain items have also been provided for. Details of principal assumptions are
given in Annex 8. The forecast revenue and expenditure accounts (Table 7)
are summarized as follows:

6.05      Projections first prepared, using present tariff levels, were in-
adequate to generate revenues needed to ensure full debt service coverage and
finance a reasonable part of the port's investment needs. This is because
the current tariffs were last amended in 1967 and do not allow for the follow-
ing costs: (a) Government salary and wage awards which raised MSD pay by an
average of over 40% in fiscal 1974, (b) general price inflation, and (c) an
increase of port security and cargo control staff required to facilitate im-
proved cargo-handling operations until the project berths are completed.
The expected increase in port traffic and consequent effect on revenue is
insufficient to compensate fully for these commitments. Therefore tariff
increases yielding an additional 15% revenue annually from fiscal 1976 and a
further 20% from 1978 onwards have been assumed in the forecasts given above.
The first increase will probably be a temporary surcharge on some or all
rates, prior to establishing cost-based tariffs in 1976 (para. 3.15); the
second will be selective and designed to preserve the established cost-based
structure. By the time the first increase is made, the port users should be
deriving benefit from NPA's improved cargo-handling and security procedures.
The second increase would coincide with the use of the proposed deep-water
berths and the consequent reduction of ships' turnaround time.
6.06      In 1975, NPA is expected to license stevedoring and dock companies
to handle cargo on its premises and later assume the direct employment of
part or all such labor. Some net revenue from license fees can be expected
to accrue but it is not possible to forecast the financial effect of these
operations in the absence of detailed plans.
6.07      In 1979, after project completion, it may be possible to reduce cargo
security costs, as most operations will be confined to an area which can be
more easily controlled than the present lighterage quays. However, no reduction
has been assumed in the forecasts.
D. Financing Plan

6.09      The cash situation is likely to become tight in 1978 when project
expenditure reaches its peak and a year-end balance of only Mau Rs 75,000 is
forecast. The situation is otherwise satisfactory. In view of NPA's consider-
able local currency costs and loan service commitments during this period, no
provision has been made for any dividend return to Government on its equity
holding.
6.10      The forecast balance sheet data are in Table 9.  It is assumed that
an IBRD loan to the Government of Mauritius of US$10 million equivalent will
be approved, repayable over 25 years including a 5-year grace period at 7-1/4%
interest per annum. During negotiations the Government agreed to onlend to
NPA on similar terms. ODA's loan for port dredging is repayable over 20 years
at 7% and the loan agreement requires onlending on these terms to NPA. Other
ODA loans for a tug and mechanical equipment will be similarly onlent (Annex 8).
Onlending terms would pass on any foreign exchange risks to NPA. Such risks



- 19 -
have been assumed as nil in the forecasts. Apart from 1978 (para. 6.09) the
current and liquid ratios are adequate. The debt/equity ratio reaches a peak
of 60/40 in 1979 and declines thereafter. Times interest ratios and debt
service coverage (Table 7) will be low in 1980 at 1.4 and 1.6 respectively,
but as loan repayments commence in that year, the ratios should improve in
1981 and beyond. However, in 1980 the financial prospects should be reviewed
by NPA to determine whether any further tariff changes are necessary to ensure
that NPA's financial objectives are adequately met. The need for, and extent
of any equity return to Government in the future should also be determined at
that, time.
6.11      The forecast return on net fixed assets in use during the period
1975-1980 fluctuates somewhat. Anticipated tariff increases in 1976 improve
the rate of return from 6% to about 9% for that and the following year. Despite
a further tariff increase, the rate falls to 7.6% in 1978 and slightly lower
thereafter due to project completion and the resultant 74% and 33% increase
respectively in net fixed asset values. However, these rates are satisfactory.
6.12      In order for NPA to achieve its financial objectives (para. 6.02)
and ensure the success of the financing plan, during negotiations the Govern-
ment agreed that, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank, NPA will:
(a) incur no further debt if its net cash revenue for the fiscal
year or the 12 consecutive months immediately before the date
of occurrence, whichever is greater, would be less than 1.5
times the maximum debt service requirement of any succeeding
fiscal year;
(b) limit investments to those included in the project up to the
Closing Date of the proposed loan, except for small items not
exceeding Mau Rs 1,000,000 per annum in total; and
(c) take such measures necessary to achieve net operating revenues
sufficient to yield annual rates of return on net fixed assets
in use of not less than 8% in 1976 and 1977; and not less than
7% in 1978 and thereafter.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      The following are the principal matters on which agreement was reached
with the Government during loan negotiations:
(a) introduction of multi-shift working (para. 3.06);
(b) creation of a national port authority (para. 3.10);
(c) appointment of port advisors (para. 3.11);



- 20 -
(d) establishment of commercial accounting, costing and
budgetary control systems (para. 3.12);
(e) appointment of external auditors (para. 3.13);
(f) insurance cover (para. 3.14);
(g) tariff revision and implementation of cost-based tariffs
(para. 3.15);
(h) provision of alternative source of finance for mechanical
equipment if necessary (para. 4.06);
(i) civil works contractual option for Berth No. 4 (para. 4.11);
(j)  onlending terms (para. 6.10); and
(k) financial targets (para. 6.12).
7.02      Retroactive financing of approximately US$100,000 is recommended
for expenditure on consulting services (para. 4.09).
7.03      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$10 million to the
Government of Mauritius.

MAURIT IUS
FORT PROJECT
Existing Port Facilities at Port Louis
General
1.        Port Louis is on the northwest side of the island and has an
excellent natural harbor protected from the prevailing southeast trade-
winds and storms by the mountains behind the port. Sea conditions
around Mauritius are primarily influenced by the southeast winds which
have an uninterrupted fetch of several thousand miles of water, and which
at times cause very rough sea conditions, with waves up to 40 ft
occurring near the exposed southeast coast. The coral reef surrounding the
island provides the only wave protection for the coast.
2.        Cyclones with winds up to 160 mph are occasionally experienced.
The port area is somewhat protected from these winds, though sheds and
structures must be designed for high wind gusts. Ships will normally
leave the port during a cyclone and put out to sea. The annual rainfall
reaches between 100 and 180 in per year in the mountains and 30 to 80 in
in Port Louis, The large annual variations are mainly due to the effect
of cyclones producing heavy rainfalls. Work, of course, ceases in the
port during these stormy periods.
3.        The seaward approach to the port is from the northwest through
a gap in the coral reef. The 600 ft wide, 1½ mi long channel is buoyed
and pilotage is compulsory. The limiting water depth at the entrance,
now 32 ft, is being deepened to 40 ft.  The spring tidal range is only
1.2 ft. The port is virtually free of siltation.
Description of the Port
4.        The harbor comprises a main basin with a water area of 320 acres
and two adjacent minor basins, the "Trou Fanfaron" and the "Caudan", with
water areas of 22 and 8 acres respectively.
5.        The port is predominantly a lighterage port, with most ships
tying up at buoys. A total of 15 ships - two with drafts of 30 ft,
nine with drafts of 26 ft and four with drafts of 20 ft - can be accommodated
at buoys. This mooring area is also being deepened to 40 ft. There
are continuous lighterage quays in the Trou Fanfaron and Caudan basins
which formed the original century-old dock area of Port Louis. These quays,



ANNEX 1
Page 2
with water depth of 8 - 12 ft, are badly deteriorated. Along them are
numerous private warehouses, the Government granary, customs sheds and
other port buildings.
6.        The main port facilities are as follows:
Quay A - built in 1960 on the southwest side, water depth 12 ft,
623 ft long. This quay has a 500 x 150 ft transit shed. Small
mobile cranes are used at Quays A and B for lifting cargo from
lighters.
Quay B - built in 1960 on the south corner, water depth 10 ft,
h36 ft long (not in straight line). It is fitted with an 18 ton
capacity electric crane.
QuavyC - built in 1930 on the east side, water depth 18 ft, 390 ft
l--i-g,is presently used for inter-island trade. This quay is in
poor condition.
Quay D - built in 1929, and reconstructed in 1960, on the west side,
vater depth 30 ft, 492 ft long Pnd one of the port's two deep-
water berths, used mainly for handling of liquid bulk cargoes
such as molasses and petroleum products.
Quay E - built in 1930, water depth 4 - 10 ft, 440 ft long (not in
straight line) used mainly for lighters. This quay is now being
repaired and straightened and provided with a small transit shed
(ODA financing).
Berth 1 (West Quay) - near Fort George, was completed in 1971, (except
for bulk handling installation) water depth 35 ft, 400 ft long, to be
used for-inbound chemicals and outbound fertilizer as well as white
oils.
Cement Jetty - built in 1915, a small wooden jetty adjacent to
Quay 1 for ships carrying cement in bulk.
7.        Oil is also pumped to a tank farm at Fort William through a
submarine pipeline.
8.        Most of the private warehouses around the Trou Fanfaron and
Caudan basins are used for sugar storage during the season from June to
November. The owners are the Albion Dock Company, Ltd. and the New Mauritius
Dock Company, Ltd. These companies own and operate some 175 lighters and
II tugs. About 60% of the lighters are in poor condition and are not being
replaced as owners anticipate the early construction of deep water berths.
A similar situation prevails for some of the privately owned warehouses.



AN]Zi5 1
Page 3
Ship repair facilities
9.        The privately owned shipyard contains a dry dock 440 x 70 ft
and a 250 ft long slipway and a yard for building small boats. The ship-
yard carries out repairs to all types of ships, and maintains and builds
lighters, small tugs and pleasure craft. These facilities are an
important ancillary to the port.
Shipbreaking
10.       Shipbreaking activities presently occupy one buoy berth.  The
scrap is processed locally. This labor intensive activity will in future
be removed to the Roche Bois basin north of the Mer Rouge area.
Fishing fleet activities
11.       Port Louis serves as a base for deep-sea trawlers from Japan,
Mauritius, Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia engaged in tuna fishing in the Indian
Ocean. With some 300 calls per year, these vessels occupy most of the
shallow draft buoys in the main basin. The Japanese maintain a motner-ship
in the port and have recently added a canning factory to their freezing plant.

PORT PROJECT
Project Description
1.        The project consists of the following elements:
(a)  The construction of Berths 2 and 3 and, subject to review of
actual traffic developments through 1975, Berth 4, for ocean-
going general cargo vessels. The total length of the three
berths is 1,800 feet with an alongside depth of 35 feet.
However, one or xore of the berths will be designed and con-
structed for future container traffic and an eventual water
depth of 40 feet.
(b)  Two transit sheds of 60,000 sq ft for each of Berths 2 and 3
and adequate open storage areas. Berth 4 will be equipped
with a transit shed presently located at Berth E, if required;
the cost of moving this shed is not included in the cost
estimates.
(c) Port administration buildings, workshops and the necessary
ancillary services.
(d) A new bulk cement pier between Berths 1 and 2, and mooring
dolphins for Berth 1 to allow occupancy of Berth 1 by larger
bulk carriers.
(e) Technical assistance for port administration, accounting and
cargo-handling operations.
(f)  Consultants' services for detailed engineering, preparation
of bid documents, and construction supervision.
(g) Dredging works of approach channel and port basins.
(h) Provision of two tugs, various cargo handling equipment
(mainly forklifts, tractors, trailers, and mobile cranes).
2.        The preliminary design of the proposed new deep-water berths is
based upon Berth 1 which was designed by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners,
and completed in late 1971. The structural system of Berth 1 comprises
cylindrical steel piles supporting a monolithic reinforced concrete slab
deck with a continuous front face beam for the fender syster. This berth
is presently dredged to a depth of 35 feet, but is designed for a dredged
depth of 45 feet.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
3.        The consultant will be requested to analyze and make cost
estimates for alternative types of structures including the use of pre-
stressed concrete piles, and a steel sheet pile wall, before preparing
the detailed design. Furthermore, contractors will be permitted to sub-
mit alternative proposals. The cost estimates contained in this report
are based upon the consultants' preliminary design analysis.
4.        The transit shed structure will be such that these could be
dismantled and erected elsewhere, in case container traffic develops sooner
than expected.
5.        Administration buildings will provide office space for port
management, marine services, shipping agents and customs. The expenditure
for these items will be kept to a minimum.
6.        The technical assistance program will provide experts in the
field of port administration, mainly in conjunction with the establishment
of the new Port Authority, in the introduction of modern commercial cost
accounting systems, and in port operations generally.
7.        The consultants' services will include preparation of the
detailed design, preparation of tender documents, prequalification
procedures for contractors, liaison rith the Bank, assistance in analyzing
the bids received, and all work related to construction supervision,
including quarterly reports to the Bank. The Government has chosen the
consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (U.K.), -who prepared the
project study, for this assignment.

MAURIT1IUS
PORT PROJECT
Notes on Assumptions Underlying Traffic Forecasts
For Port Louis
1.        Actual and forecast traffic for Port Louis are given in Table 3.
The forecasts are based on data obtained by the consultants, Sir Alexander
Gibb and Partners (Mauritius Port Study, February 1973), and the Bank's
own investigations. The consultants' forecasts are based on a statistical
analysis of past evolution, adjusted to take account of future plans and
programs, including the targets set out in the Government's 1971-1975
Development Plan. For each commodity, high, low and medium forecasts were
prepared. In general, the medium or "best" estimate has been used for
evaluating the project, changes having been made where appropriate. For
general cargo the "high" assumption was used, in view of the Plan's recent
progress and the very significant traffic increases in 1972, which exceeded
previous projections and which are, except for bagged cargo, being main-
tained during 1973. Forecasts are generally more conservative than the
Goverrnment's, particularly for general cargo where the Government's rough
forecasts are about 100,000 tons above the 1980 figure retained in the
evaluation; the Government agrees that their forecasts could be too high.
The table below summarizes the traffic projections used in the evaluation.
Details on principal commodities follow.

2.        Rice and flour are the principal staples. Because of changes in
prices, there has been a sizeable change in the relative consumption patterns
of rice and flour in recent years. Wit-h rising income as anticipated in the
Plan, some substitution of staples with higher protein foods, namely meat,
can be expected. It is assumed that the 1968-70 level of per-capita consump-



Page 2
tion of 270 lbs will remain stable as well as the relative share of rice and
flour, respectively 58% and 42%. On the basis of a 1.7 p.a. projected popu-
lation growth and an estimated domestic production of 3,500 tons of rice in
1980, imports of rice and flour should total about 130,000 tons. The outward
traffic in the main staples consists of re-exports to dependencies, primarily
Rodrigues. Since it is expected that Rodrigues will become self-sufficient in
grains by 1978, exports have been reduced accordingly from 1975 onwards.
3.        Two basic types of fertilizer are presently imported: guano and
NPK. The Mauritius Chemical Fertilizer Company is presently constructing
a factory to manufacture NPK, and imports of this fertilizer will be cur-
tailed starting in 1974.  Initially, the output of the factory will be
40,000 tons a year, increasing to 80,000 tons by 1975 which will allow
considerable scope for export. The price of NPK is expected to be very
competitive with the current price of guano, and imports of guano are
therefore not expected to increase beyond their current level of about
9,000 tons. Approximately 5,000 tons of various fertilizers other than
NPX or guano are imported annually and it is assumed that these will also
continue at about this level.
4.        The import of NPK fertilizer will be replaced by imports in bulk
cbhemicals required for its production, namely anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric
acid and potash. At planned capacity the factory will require 80,000 tons
of bulk chemicals annually.
5.        Sugar represents over 90% of Mauritius export earnings and about
one-third of GNP. The scope for increasing production is restricted by the
limited availability of land. Production varies appreciably from year to
year depending on the vagaries of the climate, particularly adverse in the
1960's. While local consumption has remained fairly constant at about
30,000 tons per year, stocks have fluctuated considerably according to
world market conditions.  Because of very favorable weather conditions
(no cyclones), sugar production in 1972 was very good (685,000 tons), and
the outlook for 1973 production is also favorable. With the increased use
of fertilizers, improved methods of cultivation, and planting of improved
varieties of cane presently underway production of sugar is expected to
increase to about 7)40,000 tons by 1980, or more in a cyclone-free year.

6.        Sugar is normally sold under a quota system, the most important
being the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement (386,000 tons).  The balance of exports
is sold under the International Sugar Agreement, the U. S. Sagar Act and on
the world free market. Prices are presently exceptionally good on the world
market, nearly USf 10 per lb compared to an average of US$ 4.5 per lb in 1971.
World demand is expected to increase at about 3.0% a year through 1980. The
longer-term export prospects for Mauritius sugar are generally favorable;
however, they will depend on the position taken by the European Economic Com-
riunity when the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement expires in 197h. Export fore-
casts were prepared by taking into account schemes to increase productivity
and anticipated weather conditions (based on "normal" cyclone and dry year
patterns experienced in the past decade) after making due allowance for stock
carry over and domestic demand.

7.        The main export markets for molasses are the U. K. and the U.S.,
which bought abouti 30,000 and 69,000 tons respectively in 1970. On the basis
of the above sugar production estimates and assuming an average rate of 246
tons of molasses from every 1,000 tons of sugar produced, with due allowance
for domestic consiumption, about 162,000 tons of molasses are expected to be
available for export in 1980, compared to an actual of 149,000 tons in 1972.
There are preliminary plans to establish a fodder yeast plant in Mauritius
(production capacity 25,000 tons p.a.) which would require an input of about
38,000 tons of molasses. In the absence of firm evidence that this project
would be implemented before 1980, it has been assumed that most molasses pro-
duction would continue to be exported.
S.        Cement imports are handled by the Mauritius Cement Company which
imports it in bulk from Mombasa. Imports declined from 95,000 tons in 1965
to 65,000 tons in 1970, but increased to 93,000 tons in 1972.  Cement demand
is strongly correlatedwith GDP per-capita and this probably explains the
decline in the late 1960's. On the basis of the investments envisaged under
the Plan (including the construction of major civil works such as the new
airport and the port) and rising per-capita income, an average annual growth
of 1.5% over a base of 140,000 (1973) is forecast. Imports of 160,000 tons
in 1980 are considered a conservative minimum. A regression analysis on
forecast GDP puts the demand in 1980 at 159,000 tons, which correlates very
well with the above projection.
9.         Refined petroleum products are shipped mainly from the Arabian
Gulf. Demand forecasts were arrived at by analyzing past trends broken
dowin into domestic consumption for kerosene, motor fuel and gas oil;

aviation fuel; and the requirements for bunkering and Rodrigues. The
major uncertainty conceriing these forecasts is the future status of the
Suez Canal. With its closure, bunkering at Port Louis increased consider-
ably; it has, however, decreased slowly since then.  It has been assumed
that the Suez Cana'. will remai  closed through 1980; its opening could
mean a loss of some i40,00). tons per year of the bunkering trade.  Domestic
demand (excluding aviat½<  is expected to increase at about 7% per annum,
taking into account increased industrial activity, while demand for aviation
fuel is expected to increase by 9.5%.  Imports of fuel should total about
330,000 tons in 19801.

10.       General cargo imports in 1972 were exceptional, totalling 213,000
tons, an increase of a third over the previous five years. While this
sizeable increase is considered to be due in part to an overflow of cargo
from 1971 because of a strike in the port, and the combination of exception-
ally high sugar production and very favorable world market prices causing
an increase in incomes and consumption, the 1972 and partial 1973 figures
indicate a steady upward trend from this level.  Forecasts are based on
the anticipated development of industrial production during the period 1973- 80
in accordance with the targets set out in the Development Plan and the pro-
jected growth in GDP.  On the basis of an industrial growth of 11.3% per annum
and a 6% increase in GDP, total general cargo imports are estimated to increase
from a level of 232,000 tons in 1973 to 349,000 tons by 1980, the equivalent
of an average annual increase of 6%.  Under lower growth assumptions for
industry (6.3% p.a.) and GDP (5% p.a.), the total in 1980 would be 326,000 tons.
The table below relates the expected development.

Principal Assumptions used in Financial Forecasts
The financial projections are based on the following principal
assumptions:
1. Port traffic increases as forecast in Table 3.
2.  Creation of NPA on January 1, 1975, the initial balance sheet
of which is given on Table 9, net fixed asset values being
based on the valuation of Sir Al.exander Gibb and Partners
(Consultants) and working capital on Bank staffTestimates.
3.  Completion of Berth 2 on July 1, 1977, and Berths 3 and 4 on
July 1, 1978.
4. Staff remuneration and retirement benefit levels and annual
increments based on application of the Sedgwick Salary Report,
1973, and cost of living increases of 7%--p.a. in fiscal 1977
ard 1980; (this assumes that the cost of living will rise by
at least 10% between July 1, 1974, and June 30, 1976, and
similarly between July 1, 1976, and June 30, 1979).
5.  Increase of 5% p.a. in reclurrent material costs except fuel
which is assumed to rise at 15% p. a.
6. Decrease of Mau Rs 80,000 p.a. in craft maintenance and repair
costs in 1976 and beyond due to replacement of two old tugs.
7.  Stevedoring and cargo handling labor to continue to be provided
by private firms but under license by and subject to overall
supervisory control of NPA. No forecast is made of any related
net revenue which might consequently accrue to NPA.
8. Additional revenue is secured by tariff increases as shown
in Table 7.
9. Revenue from overtime in 1978 and beyond will be largely replaced
by standard two-shift eharges when operations coamence at the deep
water berths.
10. Quay dues of Mau Rs 1.50/ton will be charged for cement over the
proposed new cement jetty.
11. Surplus cash will earn 5% p.a. interest



ANNEX 8
Page 2
12.  The sale of two old anall tugs will each realise Mau Rs 250,000
and the deep-sea salvage tug  "Corsaije"l, 1au Rs 4 million.
13.  The following loans will be made to the Government and onlent
to NPA on identical terms:
IBRD Mau Rs 54.7 million for 25 years including 5 years grace
at 7.25wo p. a. interest;
ODA  (a) Mau Rs3,32 million (for one tug ) for 20 years including
4 years grace at 7% p.a. interest; and
(b) Mau Rs 3-.l million (for cargo handling equipment) for
11 years including one year's grace at 7% p.a. interest
NB. A loan of Mau Rs 5.50 million (for dredging) has
already been approved for relending to NPA for 20 years
with h years grace at 7% p.a. interest.
14- Foreign exchange rate of US$1=Mau Rs 5,47 is assumed for debt
service and investments.
15. Any operation or capital investment at Port Mathurin
(Rodrigues Island), whether or not under the supervision or
responsibil.ity of NPA during the period 1975-1980, will not
adversely affect NAP's financial results or cash resources.
16. No return will be made either by way of interest or repayment
to Government on its NPA equity during the period 1975-1980
except that in 1979 it is assumed that old buildings and space
in the lighterage quay area with a total net value of Mau Rs6
million will be returned to the Government, and the equity and
net assets correspondingly reduced.
17.  No income tax will be payable by EPA during the forecast period.
18.  Lighterage quays and storage areas with a net value of
Mau Rs 4 million have been classified as not-in-use for
purposes of computing the financial return in 1979 and
1980.
