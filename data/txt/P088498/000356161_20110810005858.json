Tertiary Education\n            Finance for Results Project for Chile were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory; the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible; the Bank's performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance\n            was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            competent and stable leadership and team in the Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) were a key component of project\n            success. Rigorous results scoring in Academic Innovation\n            Fund (FIAC) subprojects increased comparability and\n            performance tracking. Realistic timelines for implementation\n            require taking into account the borrower's cycle for\n            budgetary approval in congress and the internal approval\n            processes for the various legal documents needed throughout\n            the life of the project. Execution of performance based\n            funding requires experienced staff to mediate between the\n            universities implementing the agreements and the Ministry of education."}, "docdt": "2011-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
