In 2005, the\n            quality of tertiary education in Chile varied considerably,\n            data was unreliable, and students from poor backgrounds\n            faced an uphill battle to reach graduation. Internal\n            inefficiencies plagued the tertiary education system, with\n            first year dropout rates upwards of 20 percent in even the\n            best universities, and overly long degree programs that\n            dragged on more than planned. There were virtually no\n            remedial classes to strengthen basic competencies. Finally,\n            there was insufficient accountability and transparency in\n            the use of direct public funding for tertiary education.\n            With partial assistance from International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) funding and expertise,\n            Chile passed legislation on quality assurance and student\n            financial aid, set up a tertiary education information\n            system, increased the availability of advanced human capital\n            and research capacity, and piloted four performance\n            agreements with universities. The success of these\n            agreements provided proof-of-concept for results-based\n            financing. Tertiary education enrollment in Chile rose by 51\n            percent between 2005 and 2010, from 646,000 to 973,000\n            students. Chile was able to improve both quality and equity\n            of education despite this massive expansion."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T07:52:03Z"}
