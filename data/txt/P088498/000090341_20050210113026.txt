                    CHILE: - Tertiary Education Finance for Results Project

1. Project Background

Objective. The Chile Tertiary Education Improvement Project aims to improve the performance
and equity of the Chilean higher education system. One of the key objectives of the project is to
encourage and facilitate access to tertiary education for students from the most vulnerable
households. This project is part of the commitment that President Lagos' Administration made to
the poor and indigenous peoples, as stated in "Un Nuevo Trato entre el Estado y Los Pueblos
Indigenas y la Sociedad Chilena. (June 2004)"                  1


Population. According to the latest census (2002), the total Chilean population reached 15.1
million. The population growth rate between the latest Censuses (1992-2002) was 1.2%; slightly
less than the population growth rate between the prior two Censuses (1982-1992), which was
1.6%. Despite the lower growth rate of the national population as a whole, urban population has
grown at a faster rate during the latest inter-census period, in part, due to migration to urban
areas. Between 1990-2003, total rural population decreased from 18.5% to 14.0%, and today, in
2004, about 86.0% of the population lives in urban areas. The regions which reported the greatest
decline in population were those that had the highest percent of rural populations in 2003. These
regions are: Araucanía (44.6% to 32.5%), Aisén (34.1% to 21.5%), Los Lagos (42.1% to 32.9%),
Del General Libertador Bernardo O'Higgins (40.2% to 30.7%) and Del Maule (45.3% to 35.5%)
(CASEN household survey).

1The Commission of Historical Truth and the New Deal with Indigenous Peoples and Chilean Society was formed
in 2001, and headed by former President Alwyin. The commission was created to gather diverse opinions and views
regarding indigenous peoples in Chile and to develop strategies to reach a conciliatory resolution. Recommendations
made by the Commission contributed to the creation of the New Deal Policy with Indigenous Peoples and Chilean
Society presented by President Lagos in June 2004 at the first inter-governmental meeting organized by the Latin
American Indigenous Peoples Fund, which took place in Chile.

Poverty. Chile made great strides in the fight against poverty during the 1990s, and the last two
governments increased the share of public spending on investments in human capital and social
protection, in a concerted effort to increase equity. The combination of targeted social programs
with macroeconomic stability and high levels of economic growth enabled poverty rates to drop.
During the period 2002-03 there was a 2.1% reduction of poverty and the population living under
indigent conditions was reduced by 7.2 % (CASEN 2003).

Despite these advances, Chile remains a country of high income inequality, with marked
differences between demographic groups. Indigenous peoples, youth, female-headed households
and rural residents are especially vulnerable. Notably, there is a strong correlation between
poverty and rural areas. The indigent rate in 2003 was 6.2% in rural areas, as compared to only
4.7% nationally and 4.5% in urban areas.

2. Indigenous Population and Poverty

Indigenous population. According to the 2002 Census, 692,192 people or 4.6% of the
population identified themselves as indigenous. The Census classified as indigenous those
groups identified by the Indigenous Peoples Law. These groups are: Alacalufe (0.4%),
Atacameno (3.0%), Aymara (7.0%), Colla (0.5%), Mapuche (87.3%), Quechua (0.9%), Rapanui
(0.7%), and Yamana (0.2%). Most of the indigenous population lives in Regions I, VIII, IX, X,
and the Metropolitan Area of Santiago. About 35.2% of indigenous people live in rural areas,
while 64.8% live in cities. However, in rural areas the concentration of indigenous groups is
higher than non-indigenous peoples. Gender composition is quite equal among indigenous
peoples; women account for 49.6% of the total indigenous population.

Poverty among indigenous. There is a strong correlation between indigenous peoples and
poverty. In 2000, approximately 10% ofh indigenous peoples were indigent or extremely poor,
while only 5.4 % of non-indigenous were. Even amongst the already-vulnerable rural
inhabitants, higher rates of poverty are seen amongst the indigenous population. In 2000, 14.7%
of indigenous rural residents were indigent, as compared to only 7.5% of non-indigenous rural
residents.2 While 10% of indigenous poor households depend on subsidies, only 7% of non-
indigenous households do so. Social policies and programs need to be refined and adapted to
address the needs of these most vulnerable groups. Regions VII, VIII, and X, where the majority
of the Mapuche live, have the highest levels of the population living below the poverty line
(Table 1).

Indigenous Peoples Law. According to the Chilean Indigenous Law 19.243, the institution in
charge of indigenous peoples' development is the National Corporation of Indigenous Peoples

(CONADI). The Chilean Indigenous Law recognizes the rights of the indigenous peoples,
including the right to secure ownership of land, the right to self organize, and the right to define
"Areas of Development," (Areas de Desarrollo Indigena ­ADI) among others. With the New
Deal Policy with Indigenous Peoples and Chilean Society presented by President Lagos in June
2004 there is greater recognition of the political rights of indigenous peoples, including their
right to formally participate in decision-making processes within State and Governmental
institutions at the national and local level.

3. Ethnicity and Education

Education trends. During the last ten years Chile has significantly improved education at all
levels. In 2002, about 96% of the population was literate.3 As expected, higher education levels
are achieved in urban areas, both in terms of attendance rates and the highest level completed.
Yet, the greatest educational gains in the past 10 years were in rural areas, where the literate
population increased by about 3.2% in contrast to an increase in urban literacy rates of only
0.5%.4 In 1992, about 10% of the population was enrolled in some type of tertiary education.
This increased to 30.5% in 2003. Despite overall increases in the number of years of education
attended, disparities between rural and urban areas persist.

Previous studies conducted by CONADI state that demand for education has increased due to a
number of interrelated factors. Over the past 20 years Chile has seen rapid urbanization, which
has brought with it an increased demand for highly qualified professionals, leading to a widely
held view of education as a means of social improvement and mobility. Partially as a result of
this view, rates of enrollment and completion of the secondary level have increased, leading to
greater demand for continuation at the tertiary level. Two decrees have made an important

Indigenous Population and Education. The rate of illiteracy among the indigenous population
is higher than that of the non-indigenous. While 96% of the non-indigenous population is literate,
only 92% of the indigenous qualify as such. 54% of the indigenous population has completed
primary education as compared to 66% of the total Chilean population. The differences in
enrollment rates between indigenous and non-indigenous students increase further at the tertiary
level. While   leve16% of the total Chilean population has completed some type of tertiary
education, only 8% of indigenous peoples did so.

The current Administration has been fostering specific actions to improve the well-being of the
poor and more vulnerable, including the indigenous peoples. One of the actions taken has been to
expand the scholarship programs for tertiary education. These scholarships include; "Beca
Primera Dama, Millennium, Presidente de la Republica, MINEDUC, Juan Gomez Millas,
Pedagogia, Hijos de Profesionales de la Educacion, and Beca Indigena (First Lady, Millennium,
President of the Republic, MINEDUC, Juan Gomez Millas, Pedagogy, Children of Professionals
working for the Educational system, and Indigenous Scholarships). In theory, indigenous
students could apply to all of these and others. While the criteria for selection varies, in general
there are three basic considerations: (a) grades; (b) poverty and vulnerability (as measured by the
"Ficha CAS" or CAS dossier, that measures a household's vulnerability through variables such
as the physical condition of the house, and income); and (c) admission test (PSU) scores.

As the following table shows that Chilean tertiary education, despite significant improvement
between 1990 and 2000, is still highly inequitable. In 2000, persons belonging to the richest 20
percent of the population comprised 33 percent of the enrolled students, whereas the poorest 40
percent make up just 18 percent of the student body (Graph 3).

4. Programs Targeting Indigenous Population

Indigenous Scholarship Program. The indigenous scholarship is administrated by the
Indigenous Scholarship Program, part of the Ministry of Education's Intercultural Bilingual
Education Program. In accordance with the law (Ley 19.253), the scholarship is reserved for
indigenous students who have demonstrated economic difficulties, that are enrolled in accredited
Universities, Professional Institutions or Technical Information Centers, and who perform well
academically. The annual scholarship (approximately US$ 803 in 2004) is paid monthly directly
to the beneficiary. The scholarship is only renewed if recipients maintain an established
minimum grade point average, and remain in the same course of study (see Table 4).

As can be seen from the above table, indigenous scholarships have been increasing steadily in
the last years. However, the Indigenous Scholarship, like most of the other scholarships, only
includes the tuition and matriculation fees which are transferred directly to Universities and do
not provide for additional costs, such as meals, transportation, clothing, and books. Thus, few
indigenous and poor students can afford to continue their education, even with a scholarship.
Consequently, in order to cope with poverty, many students opt to work rather than study, mostly
searching for jobs in cities. Therefore, lack of educational and job opportunities in rural areas are
increasing rural-urban migration. As a result, 64.8% of indigenous peoples live in urban areas,
whereas only 35.2% live in rural areas, according to the latest CASEN 2003.

Students Residencies. Between 1999-2003, CONADI financed the Program `Subsidio a la
Residencia para Estudiantes Indígenas de Educación Superior' (Subsidy for Housing for
Indigenous Students at Superior Education). The program finances residencies in urban areas
where indigenous students from all communities and of both genders can live while attending
school. There are 9 residences in total, 2 of which are in Santiago. In 1999 the average annual
cost per student was CLP 550,000 (or US$ 916). In 2003, this cost increased to CLP 1.0 million
(or US$ 1,666).

5. Main Problems to Access Tertiary Education.

The poor and the indigenous face two main impediments in access to tertiary education: (i)
difficulty in competing academically, due to poor academic background and (ii) difficulty in
affording education due to low income levels. These two factors make them vulnerable to
exclusion from the benefits of education as a means to improve their social and economic
conditions, thereby perpetuating the vicious circle of poverty. Most of the consulted population
stated that the poor and indigenous peoples also face forms of social exclusion.

Social Exclusion. Whereas a study on indigenous post-secondary students, conducted as part of
the Chile: Science for the Knowledge Economy Project, found that there was no legal
discrimination (Repetto, 2003), consultations revealed that social exclusion is a factor
influencing indigenous students access third level education; this phenomenon is not racial,
rather it relates to social and cultural standards difficult to fulfill for some students, which make
it difficult to access or complete their education. The indigenous students concurred that
exclusion was prevalent, but reported varying degrees of the problem, and visualized different
resolution strategies. Some of the indigenous people stated that they preferred to focus on
personal success, then to devote attention to social exclusion; some disagree with the alternative
to focus on ethnic background.

Benefits to Indigenous Peoples As Viewed by Indigenous Students
 Indigenous students in Santiago who emigrated from rural areas stated the following: The criteria for
 awarding scholarships and benefits to indigenous peoples should not be based only on ethnic and
 gender variables. Currently, the selection criteria and process is poor as is the monitoring and
 evaluation of student performance. These factors lead to a waste of funds invested in scholarships and
 residences. The students suggested that the selection process include: (a) an interview, (b) an emotional
 test to determine student capacity to live by themselves far away from home, (c) grades, (d) an
 assessment of the student's willingness to learn English--because the goal is to have access to all
 educational materials produced in Chile and abroad, and to explore the possibility to study overseas.
 They also recommended that the students sign a contract that they will stay in their Region for at least
 two years as a requirement of the scholarships. Finally, they stated that the "ficha o dossier CAS" does
 not accurately reflect vulnerability and therefore contributes to the exclusion of valuable students.

 Mapuche indigenous students born in Santiago stated the following: Scholarships mostly benefit
 rural students and provide almost nothing for urban students. They agree that the dossier CAS is not
 useful, but differ in their approach in how to improve it. According to them, the CAS criteria should
 only be applied to people who are really indigent and would otherwise not benefit from a scholarship.
 The urban Mapuche expressed a greater need than their rural counterparts, to maintain roots and
 traditions and incorporate them into urban life.

Consultation revealed that results of affirmative action (discriminación positiva) are not always
positive. It was reported that males and non-indigenous peoples were beginning to react
negatively towards efforts specifically designed to promote and facilitate university access for
the poor, indigenous and female. In addition, some indigenous students themselves, had
reservations about affirmative action out of concern that it might convey the impression that they
had been admitted solely for ethnic reasons, and not for their academic merits. Some of those
consulted, including officials from CONADI, pointed to a potential for revising selection criteria
in order to provide a stronger emphasis on academic performance as well as ethnic origin.

To this end, an assessment of the indigenous scholarship would be very helpful to improve its
targeting. The indigenous peoples development strategy takes this into account as it proposes to
finance a study on the targeting of the indigenous scholarship program. Such a study and the
dissemination of lessons learned and good examples of successful students would contribute to
counteracting the false perceptions related to actions seeking to mitigate exclusion related to
ethnicity, poverty, and/or gender issues.

To combat social exclusion and to ensure that the New Deal's commitments made by President
Lagos to the indigenous peoples and Chilean society are met, the Ministry of Planning
(MIDEPLAN) is designing a nation-wide campaign to create a broader consensus on ethnic
equality and inclusion. It is highly advisable that MINEDUC complements MIDEPLAN's efforts
to ensure that educational institutions are targeted in the campaign.

Inadequate preparation. Data and consultations carried out with key stakeholders including
professors, indigenous students and MINEDUC staff suggest shortcomings in the quality of basic
education for indigenous students living in poor and rural areas. As a result, indigenous
secondary graduates are more likely to fail the university admission test (PSU) and their access
to tertiary education remains limited (Table 2). Graph 4 reveals a strong correlation between
PSU test scores and income.

Financial constraints. The few students from poor and rural areas that do score well on the PSU
exam or are able to enroll in some sort of tertiary education face financial problems. Poor and
more vulnerable are often only able to afford the most inexpensive subjects of study, which
might not be the ones they have the skills or vocation for. During consultations, some professors
suggested that indigenous students generally prefer to enroll in the social sciences (e.g.
anthropology and history) in search of their roots and ethnic identify. This seems to be a
misperception. Although some study anthropology and equivalent subjects choice, others are
limited to the social sciences because they cannot afford more expensive programs of study such
as medicine, dentistry, architecture, etc.

6. Indigenous Peoples Development Plan

Based on the above analysis and recommendations drawn from consultations, the main objective
of the IPDP is to combat constraints faced by the poor and indigenous to access tertiary
education. Notably, the IPDP proposes to: (i) implement measures that would increase PSU
scores for indigenous students; (ii) explore ways to ensure adequate funds for tuition and cost-of-
living allowances for poor indigenous tertiary students; and (iii) to include a regional target
approach to address identified lack of opportunities in areas where the indigenous population and
poor are a majority.

It is proposed that the first phase of the project would be used to launch preparatory courses for
indigenous students. Based on lessons learned the second and third phase could be used to scale
up activities. Concretely, the following activities are proposed for the first phase:

Social Target Assessment. As an activity under sub-component 1.2, a Social Target Assessment
will be carried out. The target assessment would review selection criteria used in current
programs of affirmative action taking into account recommendations received during
consultation. Moreover, the assessment would develop eligibility and selection criteria for a
special round of the innovation fund targeted at financing preparatory courses for inadequately
prepared indigenous students. The assessment would focus on the following areas: (i) regions I
and II in the north to target the Atacamenos and Aymaras; (ii) regions VII and IX in the south to
target the Mapuches; (iii) vulnerable villages or "comunas" as identified by the CASEN survey

and the vulnerability index created by JUNAEB; and (iv) indigenous students living in urban
areas.

Special round of the innovation fund. It is proposed that a call for proposals under the
innovation fund (sub-component 2.1) is made for PSU preparatory courses for indigenous
peoples. Sub-projects that best satisfy developed selection criteria would receive support for an
initial period of two years.

Monitoring and Evaluation. An assessment administered under sub-component 1.2, would
evaluate results of the pilot indigenous preparatory courses. The assessment would track the
academic performance of students participating in the program and examine the social impact
through the perceptions of participating students and professors. Moreover, the assessment
would reflect lessons learned and recommend ways to improve the social impact and scale up
activities in the second phase.

Indigenous scholarships. It is proposed that a study be organized under sub-component 1.2 to
evaluate the existing scholarship program for talented but poor indigenous students. The study
would identify issues preventing success, and would suggest means for improvement and viable
ways to expand the coverage of the existing program and better targeting. In addition, the study
would explore possibilities for awarding students who performed well in the preparatory course
and the PSU exam a full scholarship with a cost-of-living allowance to study the material of their
choice. Upon completion of the study, the Bank and the GoC would discuss this proposal, and
conclusions drawn from the study and assess how to implement these recommendations.
