                         The project development objective is to increase the effectiveness of public funding for tertiary education by enhancing coherence, responsiveness, equity and
                         quality in the system, through stronger accountability for performance.

                         This loan is fully disbursed and all four of its triggers have been met. These were:
                         (i)      statistical compendium containing updated data on tertiary education published by the Ministry of Education;
                         (ii)     at least 2000 students enrolled in supported preparatory programs;
                         (iii)    increase in the share of students from income quintile 1 and 2 in CRUCH universities from 18 percent in 2000 to 21 percent in 2007; and
                         (iv)     the first two-year cycle of performance agreements completed in at least 4 state universities.

                         An independent evaluation of program performance commissioned by the Project Implementation Unit was very positive. Regarding the 4 performance agreements, they said, "while

                         they involve a relatively limited investment, they have resulted in notable achievements and have had a significant impact both at an institutional and national level." These
                         performance agreements have been implemented according to plan. They have been meeting the indicators agreed upon and publishing them routinely for the outside public. The
                         agreements represent a commitment to change on behalf of the institutions. "The Committee believes that changes in mentality and in the management of each of the universities
                         have a good chance of staying." This report is available on the WB website.

                         Both the performance contracts and the Fund for Academic Innovation (FIAC) supported by the project follow comprehensive reporting procedures to ensure their transparency and
                         increase their accessibility to the general public. Information on them can be found on the websites of each university.
