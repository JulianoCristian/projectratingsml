THE\n            DRAINAGE SYSTEM OF BANDA ACEH PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Emergency Rehabilitation\n            of the Drainage and Flood Protection System of Banda Aceh\n            Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include: in an emergency situation, an international\n            non-government organization (NGO) can successfully execute,\n            as the grant recipient, and implement a medium-size, but\n            technically challenging project. It also became clear that\n            in such a case, the NGO needs to have an outstanding local\n            manager, a highly qualified project manager, and the NGO\n            must be fully supported also financially by an experienced\n            head office. In an emergency situation, project execution,\n            and especially implementation, can be done without the\n            direct involvement of any government agency in order to\n            relieve them from being overburdened with too many\n            reconstruction tasks. A competent, experienced and well\n            supported NGO can implement a project successfully while\n            still fully involving the government agency concerned to\n            make sure they develop ownership and operate and maintain\n            the infrastructure after project completion. A successful\n            outcome is more likely if good support is available for the\n            NGO from competent international consultants who provide\n            technical expertise and support with capacity development of\n            the NGO's staff. Regular, i.e. twice yearly and\n            intensive supervision by a full Bank team comprising all\n            necessary specialties can contribute significantly to a\n            successful outcome. Additionally, the presence of the TTL in\n            the project city facilitated quick responses and instant\n            support when needed. Ample supervision resources\n            (supplemented from the trust fund) do make a difference, and\n            can help to turn a project-at-risk around and then keep it\n            on track."}, "docdt": "2010-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
