assisting Government in\n            its aim of shifting urban growth from the capital to\n            regional centers. The urban transport component would\n            provide transport infrastructure (expansion of the\n            high-speed express bus network, construction of primary\n            roads in the low-income Banco area, pedestrian facilities,\n            bus terminals and a bus depot), traffic management measures\n            and programs to improve circulation (road maintenance,\n            junction improvements, traffic signals, etc.), technical\n            assistance in road safety, public transport management and\n            traffic management, and training of traffic engineers. The\n            secondary cities component would, on an experimental basis\n            and on a limited scale, provide Daloa and Korhogo with urban\n            infrastructure, equipment and materials to improve delivery\n            of municipal services, and technical assistance to the\n            municipalities and the central Government to improve\n            municipal management and to carry out an investment\n            programming study for secondary cities."}, "docdt": "1981-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
