oil refining; (ii)\n            improve the overall efficiency of refining and other\n            PETROPERU industrial operations; and (iii) strengthen\n            planning for PETROPERU's industrial operations. The\n            project would consist of: (i) preparation of a program to\n            reduce operating costs through the introduction of equipment\n            and techniques for energy saving, process optimization, and\n            pollution and corrosion control; (ii) development of a\n            maintenance program and reorganization of the maintenance\n            system for industrial plants; (iii) training for the staff\n            of the Technical Department which is responsible for\n            PETROPERU's industrial operations; (iv) other studies\n            to improve industrial operations and project planning."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
