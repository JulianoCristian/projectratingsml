PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PETROLEUM REFINERIES ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 2117-PE)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Petroleum Refineries
Engineering Project in Peru, for which Loan 2117-PE in the amount of US$ 7.3
million was approved on March 25, 1982. The loan was closed on June 30, 1987,
three years behind schedule. It was 87% disbursed and about US$ 0.7 million was
cancelled. The last disbursement date was on June 15, 1987.
Parts I and II of th' PCR were prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy
Division of Country Departmenc IV of the Latin America and the Caribbe.ln Regional
Office. In accordance with the old procedures for preparing PCRs, the Borrower
prepared a summary report on project implementation, the findings and conclusions
of which have been reflected in Part I of this PCR. Subsequently, the Borrower
was requested to prepare Part II, but has asked that the PCR be released without
it.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final supervision
mission of the project in November 1987, and is based, inter alia, on the
President's Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision
reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda. However, the information contained in this report comes from Bank
files with limited information related to recent developments in the sector,
since, after Bank disbursements suspension in May 1987, little direct contact
with country or sector officials has been made on this project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PETROLEUM REFINERIES ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 2117-PE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The loan under review was appraised in December 1981 and approved by the
Board in March 1982. The loan provided US$ 5.3 million to finance the expected
foreign cost of the project, out of a total cost of US4% 7.3 million. The balance
was  to be  financed by  PETROPERU.    Final  total  cost  probably  totalled
TJS$7.3 million. For this purpose, US$ 4.6 million were disbursed from the loan,
and US$ 0.7 was cancelled.
Qkbjctives
2.       The project was designed to complement the Bank's efforts under the
Petroleum Production Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1806-PE) to strengthen
PETROPERU's petroleum production operations, with the objective of providing
consultant and technical services and training to improve overall efficiency of
PETROPERU's refinery operations, as well as its other industrial plants, with
particular attention to maintenance, organization and management. The project
also represented the first effort by the Government to plan for energy
conservation in its largest energy-intensive industry-- oil refining.
Implementation ExDerience and Results
3.       After some initial delays which caused disbursements to be slower than
planned, implementation of the project progressed satisfactorily. The project's
main objectives were achieved. All components were completed as planned and
implementation of the consultants' recommendations have been implemented as far
as PETROPERU's  financial limitations have permitted.   This  is a notable
accomplishment taking into account that Peru went through serious economic
difficulties  during project  implementation.   Consultants'  performance was
satisfactory and PETROPERU's staff benefitted greatly "rom its involvement ir the
development of the studies and implementation of the results. The main benefits
from the project arise from improvements in operatiuns efficiency, upgrading of
technical and managerial skills through a training program, and environmental
benefits arising from pollution control measures.
4.       Peru stopped making service payments to the Bank in early 1987, and the
Bank suspended disbursements on all loans to Peru on May 5, 1987. This decision
partially affected the project as some equipment could not be procured. As a
result, and because of lower than expected cost of studies, some US$ 0.7 million
was eventually cancelled when the loan was closed.



iMi
Sustainability
5.       The sustainability of benefits from training staff requires reasonable
staff continuity. This has been undermined, however, since key personnal have
been removed from their positions since project completion. Further, salaries
were not allowed to increase as expected, which also contributed to staff
turnover.   However, benelits from pollution control and energy conservation
measures and systems implemented are expected to continue to be derived.
Findings and Lessons
6.       Lessons learned from this project are:  (i) that an engineering project
can greatly serve to strengthen an oil company when its own staff is actively
involved in the consultants' studies and operation; (ii) project initiation and
implementation can be seriously delayed by Government's cumbersome -pproval and
bidding procedures; and (iii) sustainability of gains derived from training is
undermined if incentives to retain staff are not offered.

Country          Peru
Sector           Energy
Subsector        Oil and Gas
B. Bakgkround
1.         Petroleum Sector: Petroleum is the dominant source of energy in Peru,
supplying about 80 percent of the country's commercial energy requirements, and
will supply the major part of Peru's energy requirement for the rest of the
century. Peru's first oil wells were drilled in 1863. making it one of the
oldest oil-producing countries in the Western Hemisphere.  The country rapidly
became a net exporter of petroleum. However, during the late 1940s and 1950s,
when gasoline and fuel oil prices were among the lowest commodity prices in the
world, producers' profits margins were reduced and growth in domestic consumption
outstripped that of production so that the country became a net importer in 1958.
In 1968. the Peruvian G)vernment entrusted Empresa Petrolera Fiscal (EPF) to take
over the assets of the International Petroleum Company (IPC) and several other
privately owned oil firms. EPF later became Petroleos del Peru (PETROPERU). the
producer of 90 percent of Peru's crude output.   While production from the
traditional coastal and offshore fields in northern Peru rose slowly throughout
the 1960s, consumption continued to grow rapidly and Peru became increasingly
dependent on crude oil imports to meet its own domestic requirements.
2.         As a result of petroleum exploration and development in Peru's
northern jungle, which began in the early 1970s, the country had become self-
sufficient by mid-1978.   Total oil production in 1981 -- primarily from
Occidental and PETROPERU -- reached 70 million barrels, of which about 27 percent
was exported.  Nevertheless, because of low levels of petroleum exploration and
F            development in the second half of the seventies, and growing domestic demand,
Peru faced the possible need to import petroleum in the late 1980s.   As a
consequence, the Government's strategy since 1980 has been aimed at increasing
petroleum production through accelerated exploration and development, while
attempting to restrain domestic demand and encourage efficient use of petroleum
products, mainly through pricing policy. The government adopted legislative and
policy measures designed to attract foreign oil companies.   The liberalized



2
petroleum law encouraged a considerable amount of interest in oil exploration.
Several foreign oil companies signed production-sharing contracts with PETROFERU,
both offshore and in the Amazon rogion, and a number of additional firms are
investigating exploration opportunities in Peru. In 1989 some corrections were
made to the existing legislation, to allow for more incentives and flexibility
to private investors.
PETROPERU's Refinery Operations.  At the time of appraisal of this
Project, PETROPERU had six refineries, with a total capacity of 178,400 bpd. Two
of these-- the La Pampilla Refinery, near Lima, with a capacity of 100,000 bpd
and the Refinery at Talara, 1,000 km northwest of Lima, with a capacity of 65,000
bpd, together accounted for approximately 92 p.-cent of the total refining
capacity in Peru.  The remaining four refineries are small--with an average
capacity of 3,350 bpd. Although the two major refineries were operating at an
average rate of 90 percent of capacity, this was achieved by operating them
continuously, without allowing for reasonable maintenance.   The refineries
therefore, were facing the risk of breakdown and consequent stoppage of
production over long periods.   In general,  the maintenance system in the
refineries was weak, as inadequate attention was given to forward planning of
maintenance needs and to carrying out preventive maintenance on a systematic
basis. Moreover, energy consumption in the refineries was high, since they were
built at a time when energy was cneap, and the main emphasis was on keeping
capital costs low. As a result, inadequate attention was paid to energy savings.
The present loan was aimed at helping PETROPE'IU carry out studies and develop
programs for overhauling the maintenance system, achieving energy savings and
improving the operational efficiency of the refineries.
4.         SuARly/Demand Balance for Refinery Products. Consumptionofpetroleum
products grew at an annual average rate of 6.2 percent during 1960-75, reaching
1.78 billion gallons in 1975. During 1975-80, however, consumption grew at only
2.3 percent a year, mainly because of the economic crisis and increases in
petroleum prices. The consumption of light and middle distillates -- such as
gasoline, diesel, kerosene and jet fuel -- accounted for nearly 70 percent of
total consumption.
5.         Although Peru had a surplus of some petroleum products in 1980,
imports of most refined products (except gasoline) were forecasted, unless the
country's refinery capacity was expanded.   The size and configuration of
additional facilities required would depend largely on the demand for individual
products which, in turn, would depend on overall energy demand growth and the
success of conservation and inter-fuel substitution efforts. It was therefore
important that future refinery investments be based on careful planning and on
analysis of alternatives using the planning assistance included in this project.
6.         The maintenance system of PETROPERU was considered weak at the time
of appraisal, particularly in Talara, where maintenance services were centralized
for refineries and related chemical plants, as well as for oil exploration and
production, creating serious problems with respect to scheduling urgent
maintenance work. This also hindered adequate specialization of staff to meet
the maintenance needs of different units. Lack of an adequate preventive
maintenance, and an effective system of spare parts inventory control, aggravated
the problem in both refineries. These aspects were to be considered under the



3
project with a view to reorganizing the maintenance system and developing a
modern maintenance program.
C. Project Objectives and Description
7.         The project was designed to complement the Bank's efforts under the
Petroleum Production Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1806-PE). aiming at: (i)
improving energy and operatiouial efficiency at La Pampilla and Talara refineries
and chemical plants of PETROPERU;  (ii) improving operational efficiencies at
Talara chemical plants (fertilizers, IPAC, Acetone and Carbon black); (iii)
improving industrial planning capability at the above-mentioned chemical plants;
(v) training for operating, maintenance, supervisory and management personnel;
and, (vi) improving production operations and qualities of lubes and greases at
the Talara plant. The project represented the first effort by the Government to
plan for energy conservation in its largest energy-intensive industry-- oil
refining-- and to improve the overall efficiency of PETROPERU's refinery
operations, as well as its other industrial plants.
8.         The project consisted of the following four components:
(a) consulting services and procurement of related laboratory
equipment and instruments to carry out studies of energy
savings,  efficiency  improvement  and  corrosion  and
pollution control, new investments for the La Pampilla and
Talara refineries and other PETROPERU industrial plants;
(b) consulting services to develop a maintenance program and
reorganization, within the framework of such program, of
the maintenance system for the La Pampilla and Talara
refineries and other PETROPERU industrial plants;
(c) consulting services to develop and implement a training
program for PETROPERU's industrial staff, including
specialized overseas training for about 40 staff members;
and.
(d) consulting services to strengthen PETROPERU's Technical
Department to carry out industrial project planning,
studies of possible improvements in PETROPERU's chemical
plants, and to develop a program to improve product
quality in its grease and lubricating plants.
D. Project Design. Organization and ImRlementation
9.         PETROPERU considered the technical scope of thir loan essential to
upgrading its operations. Substantial institutional buildin, Was a major feature
of the projects. whili sector policy issues were being addressed under the other
ongoing project.   The project was designed having in mind that for the
engineering studies to be effective, PETROPERU's staff should be actively
involved with the development of the consultants' studies and operations.



4
lO.        The project's initial pace was very slow.  After the project was
approved b;y the Board, it took about six months for the formalities involved in
government review if the legal documents to be completed befcre the loan could
be signed. It took another four months to register the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements with the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Commerce before the loan
couid become effective. There were further delays in inviting and evaluating
bids for the studies to be included under the project, partly due. to the
Government's bidding procedures. As a result of the above delays, the project
completion was delayed for about one year, and disbursements were slower than
anticipated. However, implementation of the project progressed satisfactor'ly
thereafter.
11.        Energy Savings. Process Ogtimization and Pollution and Corrosion
Control Program:   The study to investigate energy conservation and process
optimization possibilities at the La Pampilla and Talara refineries was
contracted out to an American firm. The program was envisaged in two phases. It
was intended that Phase I of the study would recommend specific subproject
investments for improvements and would also bring out preliminary techno-economic
justifications.    PETROPERU,  in consultation with  the Bank,  would select
appropriate subprojects for which basic engineering would be carried out by the
consultant as Phase II of the study.  The program included installation of
instrumentation and laboratory equipment necessary to carry out the study and
prepare program implementation.
12.        The consultant satisfactorily completed the main study in October 1985
(Phase I). after some delays due to difficulties for the release of materials and
instruments by the suppliers, and to obstacles in transportation to the
construction site caused by strikes of Peruvian Port and Customs personnel.
However, extensions to the contract did not cause any additional cost to the
program.
13.        Two Energy Surveys,  required as preparation for initiating the
program, were completed under this program at La Pampilla and Talara refineries,
and at the industrial plants, after the required instrumentation, which suffered
procurement delays, was installed. Since the surveys allowed a more accurate
technical control for process optimization and energy conservation, and based on
the experience gained by PETROPERU'S staff involved in the development of the
surveys,  periodic  surveys  were  programmed  making  use  of  the  acquired
instrumentation, in order to be able to detect new prcblems in the future.
14.        Under the Energy Savings portion of Phase I of this program, the main
energy consuming plants were involved. Different studies were carried out such
as& steam and condensate systems, fuel gas heat recovery for heaters or boilers.
fuel conversion for gas turbines and boilers. cogeneration of electric power,
etc. The results proved the existance of great potential for improvemont in
processes and in energy savings. Inclusion of the main recommendations into a
program of energy conservation and savings, as part of Phase II, have resulted
in reductions of energy consumption per unit of production of between one percent
and ten pp.-cent in refineries and chemical plants, since early program
implementation in 1983.



5
15.        The main purpose of tho Process ORtimization part of the program was
intended to achieve fuller capacity utilization of the two refineries through.
inter XUAl. removal of equipment and systems bottlenecks, and improved
operational and control methods.  The baeic engineering for Talara refinery
atmospheric and vacuum unit debottlenecking would increase its nominal capacity
from 65.000 bpd to 75,000 bpd.
16.        The final report of the study made major recommendations for La
Pampilla and Tal%ra refineries, and for cogeneratlon at the Malacas power plant.
After techno-economic review of the recommendations, PETROPERU in consultation
with the Bank, concluded that some of the options (fuel gas recovery, fuel
conversion in heaters and boilers at Talara, and modifications to overflash
liquid control at La Pampilla) were economically unattractive (economic rates of
return were less than 25 percent).
17.        The following studies were selected as economically attractive, and
basic designs were carried out by consultants as Phase II of the program and
completed between January 1986 and June 1987:
(a) Increase in process capacity of the catalytic cracking unit and of
the primary and vacuunm distillation units in the Talara refinery.
(b)  Firing of vacuum residtuals in boilers and furnaces at La Pampilla
refinery
18.        The following studies were done by the consultants and implemented by
PETROPERU's staff:
(a) Technical Department staff carried out the basic design for the new
tempered water system for fuel oil at La Pampilla based on the
consultant's analysis of the system.  A chilled water system for
diesel was implemented by the La Pampilla engineering staff.  No
economic evaluation was done for these systems since its necessity
resulted from safety and operating considerations, and
(b) PETROPERU's staff also handled the fuel gas recovery scheme proposed
by the consultant for La Pampilla, involving recommissioning of the
existing off-gas compressor and routing the compressed gas to the
suction of the gas compressor in the gas recovery unit.
19.        Under the Pollution and Corrosion Control part of the program, a
general revision of the pollution levels in the air and fluid effluents from
chimneys and furnaces, effluent leaks, residual waters, etc., in refineries and
plants was carried out. Recommendations from the studies are gradually being
implemented according to PETROPERU's priorities and financial resources.
20.        Data processing  was significantly upgraded through the acquisition
of microcomputers and software under this program.   Following some studies
carried out by consultants hired by PETROPERU to evaluate its financial
information systems, the Bank approved the financing of a database management
system. Acquisition of 12 additional personal computers, software and related
supplies, also approved in October 1985 to be used in the Industrial Production



6
Department, was immediately facilitating faster solution to operative problems
such as optimization of propylene production and optimization of cooling and heat
exchange in the refineries, and giving support to quality control, projects.
research and training activities.
21.        Maintenance Program. The study on improvements in maintenance systems
was carried out by a French firm. Ten engineers from PETROPERU were involved in
the study which permitted the expected technological transfer. Recommendations
were related to management of maintenance parts and materials. The results were
evaluated by PETROPERU and by the Bank and approved for implementation. Action
was taken in relation to the recommendations on improvement of internal
communications and information systems, reorganization of the maintenance
department, improvements of systems for preventive maintenance, documentation,
materials inventory and control, and training of selected personnel. In general,
relative progress has been made in relation to maintenance effectiveness.
However,   some  recommendations   requiring  replacement  of  equipment  or
infrastructure work could not be implemented due to lack of financing, such as
improvement programs for the shops.   The most significant improvements were
accomplishee in Talara where decentralization and training programs were
implemented.
22.        Techno-Economic Studies.  An American consulting firm was contracted
to develop this three-part-program.
23.        The  first part  involved the determination of the viability of
continuing operations of certain chemical plants in Talara. through technical
analysis of operations at each of the three chemical facilities. It focused on
the situation of international prices and marketing (including the definition of
target markets a"d exports), and on the optimum use of installed capacity in
three areas:   Solvent Plant, Fertilizers and Carbon Black.   The study was
completed in March 1985. Regarding the recommendations concerning the solvents
and carbon black plants, PETROPERU reevaluated the recommendations taking into
account changed market and price situation and continued producing acetone for
domestic demand, and IPA also for exports.
24.        Under the second part of this program, the consulting firm developed
the PETROPERU PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION MANUALS, a set of four procedures manuals
with new guidelines to improve implementation and control of industrial projects
for new and for existing refineries and chemical plants.  The specific areas
covered under each manual are:   (i) Planning Phase Manual;  (ii) Manual for
Engineering Contractor Selection; (iii) Commissioning Phase Manual; and, (iv)
Engineering and Construction Phase Manual. The final report was received by
PETROPERU in April 1984. The procedures manuals were reviewed and approved by
different departments in PETROPERU.
25.        The third task under this program was to improve the existing
refineries mathematical model, more in line with the various stages of project
evaluation for new projects and new process of refining units. The new model
resulting from the study was completed in October, 1984 and implemented for
immediate use.



7
26.        As agreed by PETROPERU and the consultant, selected personnel from
PETROPERU took part in the development of the program. The plants carried out the
low cost energy and operational efficiency improvements recommended by the
studies. In addition to the efficiency improvement recommendations pertaining
to the fertilizer plant. PETROPERU had a separate study done by a Japanese
consultant with the intention to carry out a portion of the recommendation aimed
at improving the operating service factor of the fertilizer plant (from the
current 65-70 percent to close to 100 percent of design capacity) without any
increase in the plant's overall capacity. The Bank agreed with PETROPERU on this
approach.
27.        Training and DeveloDment Program.   The contract to carry out this
program was awarded to a French consulting firm who satisfactorily completed its
objectives. The types and extent of training needs of all levels of PETROPERU
personnel  were  identified under  the study.   With  the assistance  of the
consultant, PETROPERU carried out the major part of the training and acquisition
of training aids as recommended in the study.   It developed a core training
group, as well as a structural training program. Acquisition of some audio and
video equipment was not possible, as it was not available at the time the order
was placed and later on Bank disbursements were suspended.
28.        The  program  resulted  in one manager,  27 junior  engineers,  37
supervisors and 78 technical operators being trained, during an 18-month period
in relevant areas of interest to each group. The experience with the initial
core group helped to identify other training needs, and to develop the structural
training program for skills improvement that was to be gradually implemented
across all personnel at operating, supervising, and management levels.
29.        Grease and Lube Oualitv ImRrovement Study. Initiationofthisprogram
was delayed for three years, after implementation of the initial recommendations
made by a consultant in 1981 was completed. By the time of contract award, the
Bank had suspended disbursements to Peru (para. 32). PETROPERU considered it
very important to carry out the proposed study and proceeded independently to
appoint a domestic consultant to carry out part of this study.   The main
recommendations of the study were on operational improvements, cost reduction,
quality control, and training.   Use of part of the funds allocated to this
component was approved by the Bank to finance acquisition of laboratory and other
quality inspection instrumentation, not contemplated under the initial plan, for
the Grease and Lubricants Plants at Talara.
*        30.        Upgrading the Talara grease plant has helped to obtain increased
productive capacity, lower costs, and better quality products.   As far as
training is concerned, two engineers from PETROPERU were trained in the USA, at
*        grease and lube plants and laboratories, and a seminar on grease production was
undertaken by the consultant for 20 engineers of PETROPERU. Technicians were
trained to formulate greases and were able to experiment with variations of
ingredie:.XL to obtain new and more sophisticated grease products.
31.        Translation of studies  into projects,  although not part of the
project, was slow, due to changes in PETROPERU's management.



8
32.        The Bank suspended disbursements on all loans to Peru on May 5, 1987
following a decision from the Peruvian government to stop making service payments
to the Bank. The measure partially affected acquisition of some complementary
equipment contemplated under the Energy Conservation component.
E. Project Results
33.        Overall, the objectives of the project were essentially accomplished.
There were some delays at the start, caused by obstacles in government
procedures.    All  the  components were  successfully completed,  except  for
acquisition of some laboratory equipment, due to suspension of Bank
disbursements.
34.        Benefits  from  the  project  are difficull: to quantify,  such  as
significant strengthening of PETROPERU's technical capabilities, reduction in air
pollution and corrosion, and improved management due to upgrading of information
systems.   The major objectives accomplished and benefits obtained were as
follows:
(a) More accurate technical control for process optimization and energy
conservation, through energy surveys using instrumentation acquired
under the project;
(b) Reduction in energy consumption per unit of production, reaching
between one   percent and ten percent in refineries and chemical
plants, since implementation of the consultant's recommendations in
1983;
(c) Preparation of basic designs for economically attractive refinery
capacity increases. Their implementation, however, will depend on
future availability of financing;
(d) Implementation of recommendations on efficiency improvements in
refineries, such as new water systems for fuel-oil and diesel, and
fuel-gas recovery at La Pampilla;
(e)  Implementation of pollution control measures have already resulted in
reduced air pollution and corrosion in plants;
(f) Improvements in maintenance organization and management.
35.        Through technical assistance and training, and the experience gained
by the involvement of PETROPERU's professional and technical staff under the
project, PETROPERU significantly upgraded its technical skills, and by the end
of the project was in a better position than before to undertake expansion
projects of its refineries operations. Direct participation of staff with the
consultants in their studies and implementation, resulted in overall improvement
of process and operations engineering practiLes, corrosion and contamination
control,  and project  implementation.   These benefits,  however,  have been
undermined somewhat by lack of staff continuity (para. 37).

F. Bank and Borrower Performance
36.        The performance of the Bank from project identification to completion
should be considered satisfactory.  It ldentified the right issues at appraisal,
provided appropriate covenants to ensure proper action and maintained a
constructive relationship with PETROPERU. The Bank was flexible in dealing with
the Borrower as evidenced by its handling of PETROPERU's requests for acquiring
additional equipment and instrumentation items for the natural gas plant, and at
the Pucalpa and Iquitos refineries, and by extending the Closing Date of Loan as
requested by the Borrower.
37.        PETROPERU's refinery operations have been considerably strengthened,
and its technical staff has greatly upgraded its skills in many areas of refinery
technology.  PETROPERU had a capable project team to supervise, coordinate and
get involved with the work being done by consultants under the project.
Sustainability of the benefits of the project were dependent on PETROPERU's being
able to ensure reasonable continuity of its staff through a competitive salary
structure. Unfortunately, after the change in Peru's central government in 1985.
key personnel from PETROPERU were removed from their positions and salaries were
not allowed to increase. Vacant positions were filled by promoting lower level
staff with insufficient training to perform satisfactorily.
38.        So far as PETROPERU's operational performance is concerned, delays in
contracting of consultants and the resultant delay in disbursements are worth
mentioning. The initial delays suffered by the project were exclusively caused
by complicated Government approval and bidding procedures.   Initially, t'ie
project was delayed over one year. However, matters improved subsequently and
overall Lmplementation of the project could be considered satisfactory.
G. Financial Performance
39.        PETROPERU had a very disappointing financial performance during late
1985 through 1987, partly caused by depressed international oil prices, but also
by the freeze of domestic petroleum product prices at a time of very high
!Ma*egti' inflntAnn  Tnuring that nvnriA PRTRnPRR1J's a narati4^na r?niiltad in not
losses exceeding US$450 million on an inflation adjusted basis. It would appear
that during those years PETROPERU lost close to half of its equity capital. The
huge 1986 loss of US$200 million caused serious operational difficulties, such
as late payments to suppliers, suspension of debt service to the Central Bank,
and to a reduction of PETROPERU's capital expenditure program.
40.        Under Loan  1806-PE, consultants  studied the pricing issue and
recommended rationalization of domestic petroleum product prices.  These were
followed only partially at the time of the study. Later, worsening economic
conditions in Peru led to a decision in April 1989 to tie petroleum prices to
international levels. This action will definitely help PETROPERU to obtain a
more adequate income to cover its operating costs and, hopefully, to generate
enough cash to invest in the implementation of those recommendations under this
project that require additional funding.

H. Consulting Services
41.        Overall  performance  of  the  consultants  could  be  considered
satisfactory. Their performance contributed significantly towards the training
of PETROPERU's technical and supervisory staff. All contracts were executed in
a timely and satisfactorily manner.
I. Lessons to be learned
42.         Lessons to be learned from this project are:  (i) that an engineering
project can be a very effective means to strengthen an oil company when its own
staff is actively involved with the development of the consultants' studies and
operations, and with implementation of the recommendations; (ii) even when staff
gets involved in development of consultant activities, and intensive training
programs are implemented, the sustainability of gains is in danger if incentives
to retain its personnel are not offered by the company; (iii) that project
successes could be jeopardized by government's cumbersome approval and bidding
procedures.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.         Following old procedures for preparation of Projecr Completion Reports
(PCR). the Borrower prepared a summary report of the work undertaken by
consultants, including information on equipment procured, recommendations made,
chronological progress, and allocation of loan funds. The observations of the
report were essentially summarized in Part I of this report, and the original
version in Spanish is in files at the LAC Information Center.
2.         Subsequently, this PCR was sent to the Borrower for preparation of
Part Ii. The Borrower responded by authorizing the release of the report without
Part II.
