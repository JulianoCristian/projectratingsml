environmentally sound manner.\n            To this end, the project will help: 1) increase port\n            productivity, efficiency and capacity to meet the demand of\n            port users and operators at competitive rates through\n            extension of facilities mechanization and improved\n            management of the Mauritius Maritime Authority (MMA), Cargo\n            Handling Corporation (CHC), and Mauritius Freeport Authority\n            (MFA); 2) re-define the role of MMA as a landlord port\n            authority working through a system of competitive concession\n            contracts with performance indicators for port opertaions;\n            3) support the development of MFA to promote Mauritius as an\n            attractive tax-free base for regional entrepot trade; and 4)\n            accompany port development with sound environmental\n            protection, including control of maritime pollution, and\n            port operations and vessels' safety enhancement."}, "docdt": "1995-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
