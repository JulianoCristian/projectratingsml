The following\n            lessons may be drawn from the experience of this project: 1)\n            Keyfactors for a successful infrastructure port reform\n            project are strong commitment from government, consistency\n            of political will even when administrations change, and an\n            inclusive participatory approach with a broad consultation\n            process. 2) A good monitoring indicator system can help a\n            port operator to adapt both its operating strategy and\n            productivity level quickly when it needs to respond to\n            changes in market demand. 3) Once a port has proved to be\n            commercially successful, private sector investment should be\n            a strong option for any future development, since its\n            viability will encourage potential investors to take on the\n            risks involved. The participation of the private sector\n            usually also ensures a speedier response to changing market conditions."}, "docdt": "2005-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
