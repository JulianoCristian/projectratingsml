        IEG Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence inevaluation.


 About this Report
      The IndependentEvaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
 ensure the integrityof the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the expected results,
 and second, to helpdevelop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from
 experience. As partof this work, IEGannually assesses about 25 percent of the Bank's lending operations. Inselecting
 operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to
 upcomingstudies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested
 assessments;and those that are likely to generate important lessons. The projects, topics, and analytical approaches
 selectedfor assessment support larger evaluation studies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion Report
 (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department)and fieldwork conducted by IEG. To prepare PPARs, IEGstaff
 examine project files and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit the borrowing country for
 onsite discussions with projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the information
 provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interestto broader IEG studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer reviewprocess and IEG management approval. Once cleared internally, the PPAR
 is reviewed by the responsible Bank departmentand amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then sent to the
 borrower for review; the borrowers'comments are attachedto the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive
 Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEGare suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, projectdesign, or sectoral
approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Followingis the definition and
rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the IEG website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
      Relevance of Objectives; The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's current
development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistancestrategies and corporategoals (expressed
in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers,CountryAssistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,Operational Policies).
Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance.Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity
cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
This rating is not generally applied to adjustmentoperations.
      Sustainabilify:The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely, Unlikely,
Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutional Development Impact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region to make
more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a) better definition,
stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutional arrangements and/or (b) better alignment of the
mission and capacity of an organizationwith its mandate,which derives from these institutional arrangements. Institutional
Development Impact includes both intendedand unintendedeffects of a project. Possibleratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevantobjectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently.Possibleratings:Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and supported
implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements for regular
operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure quality
of preparation and implementation,and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the achievement of
development objectives andsustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

         This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) prepared by IEGfor
the MauritiusPort Development and Environmental Protection Project. Two single-
currency dollar-based loans were approved by the Board o f Directors on June 20, 1995,
with atotal value ofUS$30.5 million. The first (Loan 3909-MAS) for US$23.4 million,
was to the MauritiusMarine Authority (MMA) for civil works and technical assistance.
The second (Loan 3908-MAS) was to the Republic ofMauritius inthe amount o fUS$7.1
millionfor on-lending to the Mauritius Freeport Authority (MFA) and to cover a grant to
MMAandtheDirectorate ofShippingto improveconditions for marineenvironment
protection and the control o f vessel safety. Bothloans were made effective as plannedon
March 4, 1996.

         There was also significantproject cofinancing support. The Japan Export-Import
Bank (Jexim) financed an equivalent amount to the Bank loan for the new container
terminal (US$23.4 million), while the European InvestmentBank (EIB) approved a loan
(US$19.7 million) to finance ship-to-shore container handling equipment for the new
terminal, The Government o f Luxembourgalso participated andprovided a grant for the
buildingofnew warehouses (US$l.O million).

         The final project cost was US$70.0million, which was lower than expected
compared with the appraisal estimate o fUS$100.2 million. The difference was mainly
due to competitivebidsreceived for civil works, appreciation ofthe U.S. dollar against
the French Franc duringthe implementationo fthe civil works contract for the container
terminal, and a reduced scope o fwork for the oil berth.

         At the request ofthe MinistryofFinance for Mauritius, anundisbursedamount o f
US1.4 millionwas cancelled from Loan 3908-MAS on December 14,2001.Two amounts
were cancelled from Loan 3909-MAS, US$7.0 million on July 1, 1999, and US$l.O
million as o fAugust 1,2001.

         IEGpreparedthis report based on an examination o fthe relevant Appraisal
Report, ImplementationCompletionReport (ICR), legal agreements, project files and
archives, as well as other relevant reports, memoranda, andworking papers. Inaddition,
the project was discussed with relevant current and former Bank staff inWashington,
D.C., as well as inMauritius. An IEGmission visited Mauritius inApril 2005, conducted
site visits and discussedboth the project and the effectiveness o f Bank assistance with
relevant officials and stakeholders. Their kindand helpful assistance i s greatly
appreciated.

        Following standard IEGprocedures, copies o f the PPAR was sent to relevant
government officials and agencies and comments have beenincluded as Annex C to this
report.

 Summary

          TheMauritius Port Development and Environment Protection Project was
 approved by the Bankin 1995 andwas completed on schedule in2001. Itwas conceived
 inthe context ofthe MauritianGovernment's policy on economic development andthe
 Bank's 1994 and 1997 Country Assistance Strategies (CAS), which aimed to help
 Mauritius achieve and sustain a higher level o f economic performance through increased
 competitiveness and diversification ofproductionand exports, as well as the development
 o f skills-intensive and service-based activities. This strategy was reliant, inter alia, on
 improving the efficiency and competitiveness o f key infrastructure, includingthe
 country's mainport. The final project cost was US$70 million andwas cofinanced by the
 JapanExport-Import Bank (Jexim), the European InvestmentBank (EIB), and the
 Government o f Luxembourg.

          The overall objective o f the project was to enhanceMauritius' transport andtrade
 competitiveness inthe maritime sector inan environmentally sound manner. This was to
 be achieved through:

 9 Increasingportproductivity, efficiency, andcapacity to meetthe demandofport
     users and operators at competitiverates through the extension o f facilities,
     mechanization, and improvedmanagement o f the Mauritius Port Authority (MPA),
     the Cargo HandlingCorporationLtd, andthe Mauritius Freeport Authority (MFA);
 9 RedefiningtheroleofMPAas alandlordport authorityworking througha system of
     competitive concession contracts with performance indicators for port operations;
 9 Supporting the development ofMFAto promoteMauritiusas anattractive tax-free
     base for regional entrepSt trade; and
 9 Accompanyingportdevelopment withsound environmental protection, including
     control o fmarinepollution, as well as port operations andvessels' safety
     enhancement.

     To accomplish these goals transport costs were to be loweredthrough reduced ship
and cargo waiting time, land use would be improved - inparticular for prime areas
reclaimedfrom the sea, and the needs o fprivate investors and operators would be
addressedthrough strengthenedregulatoryroles and organization o f the port authorities.
Environmental risks would be reduced through less pollutedport water, improved
handlingo f hazardous cargo, andbetter ship safety control.

          The outcome o fthe project i s rated highly satisfactory; all four objectives were
achieved infull and well within budget.Port productivity improved substantially and the
cargo volume handledgrew dramatically. This generated economic benefits andboosted
transshipmentoperations for theport. Followingthe promulgationofanewPorts Act, the
Mauritius Port Authority's role was redefinedas the regulator and landlord o fthe port,
and the Mauritius Freeport Authority was also strengthened. Sound environmental
protectionmeasures, such as safeguarding against marinepollution from oil spillages and
ships' waste were also introducedinthe port.

          Institutionaldevelopment i s rated substantial, especially inview o f the solid
legislativeand institutionalreforms, accompanied by enhanced staffing skills and

                                                X



innovativeparticipatory interactionwith the trade unions and other stakeholders. The
success o f the project i s inpart also due to the excellence o fthe participatory approach
andbroadconsultation process. Therewere substantial social implications arisingfrom
the new institutionalframework with implications both for employment and conditions of
service. Bringinginthe trade union at an early stage helpedto overcome potential
misunderstandings and created a mutually supportive instead o f a confrontational
situation. Because o fthe large number o f stakeholders the participative approach to the
Master Study Plan and the creation o f the Port Users' Council were very helpful and led
to general agreement on the way forward.

        Sustainability is ratedlikely, rather than highlylikely, since continued growth
dependson further expansion and further urgentinvestment decisions ifthe momentum is
to be maintained. Linkedto this conclusion a further urgent andpropitious course o f
actionwould be to bringina secondport operations company to introduce a more
competitive situationto improve productivity further. The recent loss o f the traffic o f a
major transshipmentoperator i s a warning sign that the port needs to move quickly on
these matters to elevate its performance to an evenhigher level inkeepingwith the
demands o f the market.

        BothBank andborrower performance are rated highly satisfactory. Inthe former
casethe ratinghas improved over the ICRrating inrecognition o f the exemplary
encouragement o f a participatory approach to sector reform and outstanding financial
advice andtechnical support. Borrower performance reflects the high level o f
commitment and enthusiasm as well as the professional quality o fboththe government
officials and implementing agencies' staff. Monitoring indicators proved to be very
effective inadjusting both strategy andproductivityto changes inmarketdemand.
Perhaps the only negative note i s the losses incurred on foreign exchange transactions,
which have since resultedinthe introductiono fnew hedginginstrumentsby the port
authorities.

        The following lessonsmay be drawn from the experience o fthis project:
>   Keyfactors for a successfbl infrastructure port reformproject are strong commitment
   from government, consistency ofpolitical will even when administrations change, and
    an inclusiveparticipatory approach with a broad consultation process.


9 A good monitoring indicator systemcanhelpaport operator to adaptbothits
    operating strategy andproductivity level quickly when it needs to respond to changes
    inmarketdemand.

>Once a port has proved to be commercially successful,private sector investment
 should be a strong option for any future development, since its viability will
 encourage potential investors to take on the risks involved. Theparticipation of the
 private sector usually also ensures a speedier response to changing market
 conditions.

 800 kilometers east o f Madagascar inthe IndianOcean. Its maritime, subtropical climate,
volcanic mountains, lagoons, and sandy beacheshave beenconducive to the development
 o f a thriving tourist industry, attracting some 700,000 visitors annually. Inaddition, sugar
production, light industriesincluding clothing manufacturing, and financial services
 contribute significantly to the economic base. More recent developments have beenthe
 establishment o f a free trade zone and a planfor Mauritius to become a "cyber" island
through investment ininformationtechnology. This i s slowly becoming a reality andthe
country now aspires to be the world's first nationwith "coast-to-coast" wireless internet
coverage.' Mauritius has a competitive economy, enjoys political stability through a
multi-party democracy, and its GDP growth has averaged 4.7 percent annually during the
period 2000-04.*

 1.2        The island's 1.2 millioninhabitants are relatively urbanized, with ahigh
populationdensity o f 590 people per square kilometer. Annual per capita income i s about
US$3,830, thus outperformingmost economies on the African continent. The nation's
environment andtopography, however, pose special challenges for the development o f .
transportation. While significant investments have beenmade inthe harbor at Port Louis
andthe international airport, roadtransport has tended to lagbehindand the capital now
experiences serious peak-hour traffic congestion, which is to be addressedinanother
project inthe near futures3The Bank has contributed to the upgradingo fthe port facilities
through a port modernizationand extension project in 1974, which financed the
construction o fthree deep-water berths completed in 1983, and through the project under
review inthis PPAR, the Mauritius Port Development and Environmental Protection
Project. Currently the port has twelve berths, handles five millionmetric tons o f cargo
and 240,000 twenty foot container equivalents (TEU) annually.

1.3         Thisprojectwas approved inJune 1995, became effective inMarch 1996, and
was completed on schedule inDecember 2001. It was conceived inthe context o f the
Mauritian Government's policy and the Bank's CountryAssistance Strategy (CAS) for
Mauritius. To help the country to achieve and sustain a higher level o f economic
performance based on increased competitiveness and diversification o fproduction and
exports, it included the development o f skills-intensive and service-based activities. A
keycomponent ofthis strategy was to improve the efficiency and competitiveness o fkey
infrastructure, including the mainport. Such improvements were to be undertaken inan
environmentallysound manner, especially as it was vital to preserve the country's scenic
beauty -one o f its major assets - from potential pollution from port activities.

1.4         The project was cofinanced by the Japan Export-Import Bank (Jexim), the
European InvestmentBank (ELB), and the Government o f Luxembourg. Several benefits
were envisioned inthe project concept. These includeddeveloping an international and

 regional entrep6t4trade by improvingboththe harbor andFreeport facilities; lowering
 transport costs through reduced ship and cargo waiting time; better landuse, inparticular
 for prime areas reclaimed from the sea; betterresponseto the needs o fprivate investors
 and operators by strengthening boththe regulatory roles and organization o fthe port
 authorities; andreduced environmental risks through less-polluted port water, improved
 handlingo f hazardous cargo and ship safety control. Overall, the project was expected to
 have a substantial positive impact on the island's people through the generation o f new
 business, employment, and trade opportunities.



 2. The Project

 ProjectObjectives

 2.1     The overall objective ofthe project was to enhance Mauritius' transport andtrade
 competitiveness inthe maritime sector inan environmentally sound manner. To this end
 four specific objectives were formulated, and these have remained unchanged since
 project appraisal:

     e   To increase port productivity, efficiency, and capacity to meet the demand o fport
         users and operators at competitiverates through the extension o f facilities,
         mechanization, and improvedmanagement o fthe Mauritius Port Authority
         (MPA), formerly the MauritiusMarineAuthority (MMA),the Cargo Handling
         CorporationLtd(CHCL), andthe Mauritius Freeport Authority (MFA).
     e   To redefine the role o fMPA as a landlordport authority working through a
         system of competitive concession contracts with performance indicators for port
         operations.
     e   To support the development o fMFA to promote Mauritius as an attractive tax-
         free base for regional entvep6t trade.
     e   To accompany port development with sound environmentalprotection, including
         control o fmarinepollution, as well as port operations andvessels' safety
         enhancement.

2.2      These objectives were clearly formulated, and were inline with the Bank's 1994
and 1997 CAS'S-aswell the policy o fthe Mauritian Government. Onepillar ofthe Bank
strategy was to improve the efficiency and competitiveness o fkey infrastructure inan
environmentallysound manner. By supporting and guiding the modernizationand
extension o f the port, the project strengthened the nation's goal to reach a higher level o f
economic Performance. Inaddition, the environmental component was significant for its
potential demonstration value for other countries inthe area o fmarinepollution
preventionand vessel safety control.

ProjectComponents

2.3     The project hadthree components as detailed inBox 1below. There i s a good fit
between the components and the objectives andno component was revised duringthe
implementation o f the project. Port Louis Harbor is the general name given to the entire
port area. The new container terminal forms part o f this harbor. The Freeport is a duty-
fi-ee zone where all goods imported, stored and processed prior to re-export are exempted
fi-om import duties. It occupies 45 hectares o f land inproximity to the container terminal.

ImplementationIssues

Quality at Entry

2.4     The project design predated the existence o f the Quality Assurance Group, so no
separate assessment was made ofthe project quality at entry. However, the project

                                                     4


implementationcompletion report found the quality at entryto be satisfactory. The
project objectives were consistent with government priorities and addressedthe most
critical needinthe transport sector at the time. Lessons from earlier projects inMauritius
were takeninto account andthere was evidence of substantial government commitment
to proceed with sector reform. This PPARmissionconcurs with this view and believes
that a very positive factor was the participatory approach right from the start that
involvedthe port trade unions as well as plans for regular consultation with the private
sector.

2.5      Perhapsthe only area inwhich the Banktook a riskwas by not formally linking
the approval o f disbursements with progress insector reform. However, the Bank decided
to finance the container terminal without conditions inthe light o f the commitment
indicatedina formal Letter o f Government Policy as well as the substantial climate of
trust and confidence built uponthe past credentials o f the country, which had a very
positiverecord. Inthe event, this confidence was not misplaced.

 FinancingArrangements

2.6      The Bank financing arrangements were considered innovative for Africa at the
time o f appraisal andthe single-currency (US.dollar-based) loans (SCL) at the Bank's
LIBOR-based5variable lendingrate appeared attractive to the borrower. Two loans were
necessarybecause o f the different responsibility areas, but the loans were clearly for one
integratedproject with common objectives. The SCLs, with a 15-year maturity, gave a
better spread for the annual financing costs than any alternative financing option at the
time. Similarterms were securedfrom theproject's co-financiers, while private sector
equity financing reduced reliance on debt financing. However, inthe event, the dollar
appreciated muchmore strongly than expected, by an average annual rate o f 8 percent
against the MauritianRupee between 1996 and 2001,leadingto losses for MPA
associatedwith these foreign exchange fluctuations. M P A decided to partially repay
US$lO million o fthe loan6earlier than originally plannedand has since introducedan
improved strategy to bettermanage its debt servicingrequirements.Although normal
risks hadbeenrecognized up-front andthe volatility issue hadbeen discussed inthe
memorandum on the loanpresented to the Board o f Directors, it would havebeen
unreasonable to have expected the parties to anticipate the extent o f the Asian financial
crisis and the unexpected difficulties inbuyingUS dollars on the local Mauritian market
to hedge against exchange rate variations.

Capacity to Deal with Legal Matters

2.7      I t became apparent that MPA lacked sufficient support to deal with legal matters
on sector reforms because it hadto rely on the State Law Offices for legal advice. This
ledto delays becausethese offices hadnumerous competingpriorities. However, the
matter was resolvedbythe provision o f legal advice under project-financedtechnical
assistance, inparticular for the drafting o f a new Ports Act andrelatedregulations.

 3. Results

 Objective 1: To increaseport productivity, eflciency, and capacity to meet the demand of
port users and operators at competitive rates through the extension of facilities,
 mechanization, and improved management of the relevant authorities.Highly achieved.

 3.1      The development ofthe new container terminal at MerRouge, a site on land
reclaimed from the sea, has significantly increased the capacity o f the harbor at Port
Louis, which had limitations inrespect o fthe draft and lengtho f vessels that could be
 accommodated as well as its ability to handle the growing demand for containerized
traffic. The new specialized terminal consists o f three berthswith a total lengtho f 560
meters and a dredged depth o f 13.1 meters, quayside gantry cranes, and a container park
with associated facilities, equipment and supporting roadinfrastructure. Although the
terminal occasionally experiences large waves due to cyclonic conditions, inpractice,
operations are disrupted on averageby no more than 10 days annually.

3.2       Incalendar year 1994theMPAhandled86,504 containers. WhentheMauritius
Container Terminal (MCT) commenced operations on January 15,1999, the number o f
containers handledannually by the port had already grown to 119,970 (a growth o f over
five percent per annum). After the new facility was opened the number o fcontainers
grew muchmore rapidly to 227,160 by 2004 (anincrease o f over 13 percent per annum),
revealing a significant latent demandfor container services. M C T also exhibited a trend
toward handlinglargercontainers; 40-foot containers represented 14 percent o f all
containers in 1998, but by 2004 this figurehad doubled to 28 percent. (See Tables B1and
B2, Annex B).

3.3       The number o f containers handledbythe Mauritius Freeport Authority (MFA)
grew from 2,036 to 3,022 (over 12percent per annum) duringthe same period, indicating
an increased demand for entrepdt facilities. (See Table B3, Annex B.) A similar pattern
emerges ifthe traffic i s expressedintwenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) for the period
covering fiscal 1998/99 to fiscal 2003/04, a growth o f 16percent per annum. (See Table
B4, Annex B.) The number o fvessels handledby M C T grew from 386 in 1999 to 632 in
2003 (an increase o f 64 percent). Mauritius also experienced strong growth inthe value
o f its trading account and inits economy as a whole duringthis period.

3.4       After the openingo fthe MCT operationalperformance improvedsignificantly
and the averagenumber o fmoves per gross crane hour rose from 14.4 in 1999 to 15.7 in
2003. Similar improvements can be observed from Table 1for moves per ship working
hour andmoves per ship hour at berth. Ifonly the largervessels hadbeen included, ship
productivity would have reached 40 moves per hour, the international standard for
competitive service at largeports. The success o f the strategy to establish Mauritius as a
regional logisticsplatform by attracting transshipment operations exceeded expectations
andby 2003 pre-berthingdelays were beingexperienced due to the unprecedented
volume o f traffic andproblems experienced after one o f the cranes was damaged inan
accident. This accelerated the introductiono fmeasures to maximize the use o f the berths
and plans for further expansion were viewedwith greater urgency. The issue o fthe need
for additional capacity i s further addressedunder the sustainability section (paragraphs
4.9-4.13).

3.5     The project ledto significantimprovements inthe management efficiency o fport
operations, the Cargo HandlingCorporation(CHCL) was established to carry out such
operations and on June 1, 1997 a concession contract became effective. This was a key
event inthe modernizationo fthe port andwas the result o fninemonths o f discussions
between MPA, CHCL, and the unions. The concession introducednew working hours,
enhanced operational flexibility, a new competitive tariff structure, and a clear
commitment to achieve measurable minimumproductivitytargets. A new salary structure
for MPA staff also was implemented,which linkeda pay increase to a performance
management system. With the support o f a grant from the EuropeanUniona Port and
Maritime Training Center was established inJune 2001. This center could be expanded to
cater for broader nationaltraining needs. Inaddition, the Port Master Planwas updated to
cover the period to 2025 and recommended phased expansion o fnot only the container
terminal but also facilities for passenger liners, oil tankers, and fishingvessels.'

Objective2: Toredefine the role of MPA as a landlordport authority working through a
system of competitive concession contracts withpevformance indicatorsfor port
operations. Highly achieved.

3.6     A newPorts Act was enactedonAugust 1,1998, whereby MMA (which hadbeen
renamed MPA) become the regulator and landlord o f the port, and subsequently awarded
a concession contract to CHCL, which became the authorized operator whose activities
andperformance would bemonitoredbyMPA. Yardhandlingequipmentwas soldby
MPAto CHCL inaccordancewiththe provisions ofthe Ports Act. Complementaryto the
new legislationrevisedport regulations came into effect covering port operations, safety,
hazardous cargo, licensing, finance, and environmental protection. MPA also beganto
receive substantial rental revenue (approximately US$700,000 a year) directly from land
lessees and a royaltypayment for use o fthe facilities at the MCT. A Port Users' Council
(PUC) was also established with a broad range o f stakeholders as a permanent
consultative forum. The Bank supported this reform process through funding institutional
strengthening activities and givingadvice as needed.

3.7     Incompliance withthe spirit ofthe Act, the Government ofMauritius formally
withdrew MPA's 40 percent shareholding from CHCL to pave the way for CHCL to
enter into a strategic partnershipwith an internationalcontainer operator at a later stage.

 Targets for performance have been agreedand are publishedinthe Strategic and
 FinancialPlan,8while the concession agreements are detailed inthe CHCL Annual
 report^.^

 Objective 3: Tosupport the development of MFA topromote Mauritius as an attractive
 tax-free basefor regional entrep6t trade. Highly achieved.

 3.8      The Bank provided similar support to MFA to assist the organizationto
 modernize. This involved dividingthe organization into two independent entities: a
 Freeport RegulatoryAgency incharge o f issuingFreeport licenses andregulating
 Freeport operations and an operating company, known as Business Parks o f Mauritius
 Ltd.(BPML), with amandateto implementbusiness andindustrialparks. An enabling
 Freeport Act was passedon July 17,2001. BPML established a new subsidiary called
 BPMLFreeport Services, which was incorporated onNovember 19,2001, andthe
 Freeport Agency was reconstituted as the Freeport Unito f the Board o f Investment. The
 Freeport i s a duty-free zone covering 45 hectares o f land inproximity to the terminal (see
 map) andwhere all goods imported, stored, andprocessedprior to re-export are
 exemptedfrom import duties. To enhancethe Freeport's attractiveness the new
legislationhas enabled an incentivepackage that includes corporate tax incentives,
reduced port handlingcharges, free repatriation o fprofits, and accessto offshore banking
facilities. Logistics needs are supported by computerized services, an e-marketing
capability, and an InternationalExhibition Center." The outputs from all the above
activities have been the growth intraffic at the Freeport (see paragraph 3.3) as well as
increases inincome for MFA from office andwarehouse rental, and an increase inland
values. Inall cases the targets set at appraisal were exceeded.

Objective 4: To accompany port development with sound environmental protection,
including control of marinepollution, andport operations and vessels'safety
enhancement.Highly achieved.

3.9       Followingthe completion o f an environmental impact assessment for the new
container terminal," a study to define the requirements and to design facilities for the
collection and disposal o f landand ship-based oily waste was also undertaken. The IEG
mission observed that facilities have now beenestablished to collect and pre-treat such
waste and that construction for the relocationand safe-handling o f oil and LPG storage
has been completed. Oil spill contingency plans are now inplace, while training courses
have beensuccesshlly completed to enable staffto combat oil spills and control vessel
safety. As regards ships contravening port regulations through illegal discharge o f oily
wastes into the sea, heavy fines have beenintroducedto deter potential offenders''. A
Port Safety andEnvironment Committee (PSEC) i s now functioning. Since its inception,

 PSEC hasput inplace a Port Safety Management Plan, heldseminars onport safety to
 increase local awareness, and ensuredharmonybetween the port and the city o f Port
 Louis on these issues. Sector reform was achieved through an effective social plan and an
 agreement concerningredundancies was agreedwith the unions. The IEGmission noted
 that this approach hadbeen so successful that it hadnow beenadopted bythe local sugar
 industry.



 4. Ratings

 Outcome

 4.1     Based on the ratings for relevance, efficacy, and efficiency discussed below in
 paragraphs 4.2 -4.7 the outcome o fthe project i s rated highly satisfactory. All
 objectives were highly achieved with no shortcomings, includingreform of the sector.
 Port productivity improved substantially and the volume o f cargo handled grew
 dramatically. This generated various economic benefits andboostedthe transshipment
 opportunities causing the Freeport to develop to a new level.


Relevance

4.2      Projectrelevance i s high. It was hlly consonant with the Bank's 1994 CAS for
Mauritius which aimed to help the country achieve its development priorities and sustain
a higher level o f economic performance basedon increased competitiveness and
diversification o fproductionand exports, including the development o f skills-intensive
and service-based activities. This strategy was dependent on improving the efficiency and
competitiveness o f crucial infrastructure, includingthe mainport. A key pillar o f this
approach was the encouragement o f transshipment opportunities and the expansion o f the
Freeport. Protectiono fthe environment i s also crucial inMauritius to sustain the
country's natural assets for the benefito fboth the localpeople andthe tourist industry.

Efficacy

4.3      The efficacy o fthe project i s rated high becausethe project objectives were fully
achieved without any major shortcomings and the Bank was complimentedby the port
authorities for its advice and support. All physical works were completed as planned. Port
productivitywas greatly improved andboth the volume of cargo handledand the level o f
productivity achieved exceeded expectations. All legislativereforms and institutional
restructuring arrangements were successfully concluded, while the management system
was overhauled andperformance agreements introduced. More flexible work
arrangements were agreed with the unions, training was carried out, and the Port Master
Planwas updated. A transshipment study aimed at assessingthe potentialfor Mauritiusto
provide regional container operation services was not undertaken duringthe project
implementationperiod, but the assessmentmissionfound that the study has since been

                                                   9


 concluded and a policy paper was completed inApril 2005.13All environmental and
 safety aspects were attended to including the establishment o f oily waste disposal
 facilities, as well as stafftraining and safety planning,which also involvedthe city o f
Port Louis.


Efficiency

4.4       Project efficiency is rated substantial. Substantial cost savings were achieved due
to competitive bids for the civil works. The ERR at appraisal was 20 percent. The
recalculated ERRi s 17percent ifbased on the most conservative scenario o f future
container growth andnumber o fvessel calls and 21 percent based on the best scenario
presentedinthe updated Master Plan. However, there are good reasonsto believe that a
higherrate o fbenefits may accrue, inparticular since some global carriers are now
investinginthe Freeport. For example, Maersk Logistics subsidiary Maersk-Sealand has
already set up a branchinthe Freeport to market additional logistics services to domestic
and regional shippers.Additional revenues are also accruing to a number o fMauritian
traders, which were not taken into account as such benefits were too difficult to quantify.
(See Annex ByTable B6 for further details o f assumptions and calculations).

4.5       MPA assets have grown from RS2.0 billionin1995to RS3.6billionin2000 and
RS4.7billionin2004. MPA's profitability, measuredby the return on assets, was 2.6
percent in2000, 11.5 percent in2003, and 10.9percent in2004. This information i s
shown ingreater detail inTable 2.

4.6      The debt/equity ratio, which peakedat 127percent in2000, has decreas-l to 32
percent in2004 as much o f the loan indebtedness has beenreduced through loan
repayments andpaying off loans earlier than originally planned; the level o f liquidityalso
was found to be satisfactory. The improvement inoperating income can be attributedto
the port investment,improvedoperational performance, and appropriate tariff
adjustments. Overall, the result exceeds the appraisal best case scenario.

4.7      The Freeport, meanwhile, has grown strongly and the fixed assets were valued at
US$12.6 million in2000; this growth has continued since then.By 2000 MFA had
already succeededincovering its operational costs.

InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

4.8     The institutionaldevelopment impact o fthe project is ratedsubstantial. The Ports
Act o f 1988, redefinedthe role o fMPA as the port regulator and landlord, the concession
contract to CHCL, and the inception o f the PUC were all successful steps toward the
transformation o fthe port sector. MPA, inits landlord capacity, has started receiving
substantial rental revenue.The Social Planimplementedunder the project was
instrumental inoptimizing staffnumbers and improving operational efficiency. It also has
facilitated an enhanced role for trade unions indecision-making. Courses offered by the
Training Center have also beenhelpful inachieving productivitytargets. The Freeport
Act o f 2001 enabled the separation o fthe regulator activities under the Freeport Unit o f
the Board o f Trade, while operations are undertaken by private sector operating company,
incorporated under the Mauritius Companies Act o f 1984.

Sustainability

4.9     The ICR, prepared inFY02, considered project sustainabilityto be "highly likely"
based on the momentum experienced following the introductiono f the institutional
reforms and the degree o f commitment to the project shownby the Government o f
Mauritius. Revenues and profits were improving substantially andproductivity, quality,
and efficiency had also risento a new level. As a direct result o f the project, Port Louis
experienced an accelerating and unprecedented growth inits transshipment operations.

 This IEGassessment, however, revises the sustainability ratingto likely. The fieldvisit
 focused on understanding the present (changing) situationand the current institutional
 dynamics. Since the growth indemandwas part o f MPA's strategy to establish Mauritius
 as an entrep6t destination such an expansion was o f course to be welcomed, but the
 growth at the M C T was very muchmore rapidthan anticipated and an internal Bank
 memorandumnotedthat it hadtested the limits o f the institutionaland operational
 arrangements; inother words the problems were largely the results of the initial success.
 Once berthoccupancy rates at M C T reached 90 percent, delays became unavoidable. A
 temporary solutionwas thus devisedusing a "berthing window" scheme that guaranteed
berthavailability at fixed arrivaltimes. This was combinedwith efforts to further
 improve container handlingproductivity. Some harmwas nevertheless done to the
reputationo f Port Louis as a transshipment destination because o f delays experienced
before the new scheme was introduced. Although the impact o f the initiative quickly
vindicated its introduction, with pre-berthingdelays dropping significantly, P&O
 Shipping, a major transshipment operator, decided to stop calling at Port Louis "for the
time being." A further problem then encountered was that crane productivity worsened
when one ofthe gantrycranes could only operate at 40 percent capacity after being
damaged inan accident and the consequential more intensiveuse o f the remaining cranes
ledto more frequent breakdowns.

4.10     I t i s also apparent that CHCL hasbeen undercapitalized and has beenunable to
make timely investment decisions. CHCL hasbeenunable to react sufficiently quickly to
rapidly changing market conditions -a good example beingits failure to complete an
emergency purchase o ftwo gantry cranes inearly 2004 to address the capacityproblem.
The advice givenbythe Bank according to internal documents is for CHCL to revisit the
immediate needfor an additionalmobile crane while the acquisition o f two additional
new gantry cranes is pursued(delivery is not expectedbefore late 2006).

4.11    Ithas also beenthe intentionofthe MPA, supported by CHCL, to bringina
strategic partner as a second operator inthe port. A public-private partnership could
mobilize private financing for both infrastructure and equipment needs. However, before
this can be accomplished CHCL needs assistanceto strengthenboth its capitalization and
market response capacity to put it on an equal footing with any prospective competitor.
This course o f actionwould minimize public financing inthe sector. The existence o f a
very goodmonitoring indicator system, whereby potentialinvestors can track port usage,
productivity and the extent o fthe financial soundness o fthe port authorities and operators
i s a positive factor inattracting more private sector involvement.

4.12    Finally, inthe mediumterm and inaccordance with the MPAPort Master Plan,
the CHCL Strategic andFinancialPlanand the Transshipment Policy documents, a
decision needs to be taken to increase MCT's throughput capacity. Several appropriate
infrastructure improvement options are possible, including extending the existingberths
or upgradingthe adjacent multi-purpose terminal to a full-fledged container terminal,
accommodating gantry cranes and offering a depth o f 16 meters. At the time o fthe IEG
missionthe climate was not right for such decisions because a national election was
pending.Onbalance, the recordo fthe government andport authorities indicates that
such decisions will not be deferredfor too long, but the fact i s that a new initiative i s

                                              12


needed to launchthe port into a new era and assure sustainability. There is now an
opportunity to allow the private sector to provide most o fthe requiredinvestment.

Bank Performance

4.13    Bank performance i s ratedhighly satisfactory, which i s an upgrade from the ICR
rating o f satisfactory. The Bank adopted aparticipatory approach indesigningthe project
andthis was one ofthe first Bankprojects to recognize trade unionleaders as part o fthe
negotiationteam. The Bank formally invited, with the concurrence o fthe government,
the President o fthe Port Louis Harbor and Dock Workers Uniontojoin inthe
negotiations conducted inthe Bank's headquarters inWashington, D.C. Regular
consultations were heldwith the private sector as well, which ledto the establishment o f
the PUC. The Bankwas also proactiveinpursuingdialogue with the government for the
sector reform.

4.14    Supervision was frequent, appropriate, and timely. The Bank worked closely with
boththe government and implementingagencies, providedthem with extensive
assistance including suggestions for the drafting o f laws andregulations as well as
excellent technical advice. Enquiriesby the assessment missionconfirmedthat the
Bank's input was ofahighcaliber andhighlyvalued. MFA inparticular commented on
the remarkable response time inrespect o fpayments to contractors andnoted that
becausethey had the opportunity to meet with the Bank disbursement officer at project
inceptionthis provedinvaluable inclarifying the various procedures. The Bank's
exceptional ongoing support after project closure was also mentioned.

Borrower Performance

4.15    Borrower performance i s rated highly satisfactory. Both government officials
and staff o f the implementingagencies displayed a highlevel o f commitment and
enthusiasm for the project. Despite changes inadministrations the government remained
firmandresilient inits commitmentto sector reformbecauseofa sharedvision. MPA
andMFAhave available on a continuous basishigh-qualityprofessional staffthat,
throughout the project, was well-organized and effective indealingwith problems as they
arose. The handlingo f financial matters was exemplary andthere was complete
transparency on the part o fthe implementingagencies, which contributedto achieving
good industrial relations.



5. Conclusions and Lessons

Strong Government Commitment

5.1     This project was highly successful becausefrom the outset there was strong
government commitment, supported by the implementingagencies, to reform the port
sector inthe interests o f the country. There was consistency inpolitical will and a
constant vision o fwhat was to be achieved despite changes inadministrations. The

                                                13


project i s now seen as a model for the implementation o f other projects inMauritius. For
 example, the voluntary retirement scheme has also beenreplicated inthe local sugar
 industry.

 Participatory Approach

 5.2     The success o f the project is, inaddition, due to the excellence o f its participatory
 approach andbroad consultation process. There were substantial social implications
 arising from the new institutional framework with implications both for employment and
 conditions o f service. Bringinginthe trade union at an early stage helpedto overcome
potential misunderstandings and created a mutually supportive instead o f a
confrontational situation. Because o f the large number o f stakeholders the consultative
 approach to the Master Study Planandthe creation o fthe PUC were very helpfuland led
to general agreement on the way forward.

Exchange Rate Risks

5.3      MPA didexperience some lossesdue to adverse movements inthe U S dollar
exchange rate on its borrowings. This indicates the importance o f a comprehensive
assessmento fthe risks associatedwith different financial instruments andthe importance
o f a financial hedging strategy evenwhen there appears to be no impendingmarket
problems. While both the Bank and the borrower were aware o fnormal risks and
discussedthis matter duringnegotiations, neither party could reasonably have foreseen
the extent o fmarket volatility causedby the suddenAsian financial crisis, and the
unexpected difficulties inbuyingU S dollars on the localMauritianmarket to hedge
against exchange rate variations.

Monitoring Indicators

5.4      Part o fthe reason for the ability o f MPA to adjust its operating strategy and
productivity to changes inthe market it serves i s its maintenance o f a very good
monitoring indicator system. This was also useful duringproject implementation and will
be of interest inthe future to potentialinvestors from the private sector. Typical
indicators include financial indicators (such as working ratio, debt/equity and frequency
and extent o f tariff increases), cargo handlingrates, productivity measures and equipment
availabilityrates.


Future Port Development

5.5      The developments inthe port sector inMauritius have beensuccessful andhighly
viable, but further expansion i s urgentlyneeded. A t the same time increasing demands on
public sector funds make the idea o fprivate sector port investmentmore attractive. This
would transfer the risk and enable a speedier response to changingmarket conditions.

                                            14


5.6    The following lessonsmaybedrawn from the experience ofthis project:

>  Keyfactors for a successful infrastructure port reform project are strong commitment
  from government, consistency ofpolitical will even when administrations change, and
   an inclusiveparticipatory approach with a broad consultation process.


>  A good monitoring indicator system canhelp aport operator to adapt both its
   operating strategy and productivity level quickly when it needs to respond to changes
   inmarket demand.
>  Once a port has provedto be commercially successful,private sector investment
   should be a strong option for any future development, since its viability will
   encourage potential investors to take on the risks involved. Theparticipation of the
   private sector usually also ensures a speedier response to changing market
   conditions.

Note: Assumptions onfuture container traflc and vessel calls are based on the 2002 MPA Port Master Plan using the
low case scenario to keep with a conservative approach. Thegross ERR is 21%. Based on the SAR assumption that
75%only of the benefits would accrue to theMauritian economy, theproject ERR would be 17%. Given, however, that
there is evidence ofd new vakue-adding services being developed it is more likely that 80%of the benefits would apply
to Mauritius. This wouldput theproposed ex-post ERR at 18%.
