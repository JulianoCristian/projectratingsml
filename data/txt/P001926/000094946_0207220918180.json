outcome is highly\n            satisfactory, with a highly likely sustainability, and\n            substantial institutional development impacts, and,\n            similarly, ratings assess the Bank performance as\n            satisfactory, and that of the Borrower as highly\n            satisfactory. Lessons of success are attributed, first, to a\n            consistent political will, government commitment, and strong\n            ownership, irrespective of administration changes. Likewise,\n            the participatory approach, and consultation process helped\n            dilute social risks, during project preparation,\n            negotiations, and implementation, especially with trade\n            unions, and, in particular, the Master Plan Study\n            participatory management, and appropriate Project Steering\n            Committee complemented the nature of this project. The\n            project is thus looked upon as a role model in the\n            implementation of projects in Mauritius, a project which was\n            instrumental in creating a new vision for port management,\n            as well as for social aspects with the introduction of the\n            Voluntary Retirement Scheme concept. Regardless of success,\n            the exchange risk issue, faced by the Mauritius Ports\n            Authority (MPA), exposed the limitations of the existing\n            financial market arrangements, to a large extent, beyond\n            MPA's control. This suggests the Government should\n            consider other financial instruments, to provide\n            institutional ability to hedge against foreign exchange\n            risks; similarly, the Bank should consider introducing some\n            mechanisms/formula to limit client's exposure on\n            foreign exchange as a percentage of its revenue."}, "docdt": "2002-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
