      of agricultural information to facilitate the\n            decision-making process in both the public and private\n            sectors. The project has five components. The Agricultural\n            Policy component 1) strengthens sector policy analysis\n            capacity; and 2) strengthens the budget analysis and\n            investment monitoring and evaluation process at the Ministry\n            of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG). The Agricultural\n            Information and Dissemination Service component improves 1)\n            information services on crops and livestock; 2) market\n            prices and news services of MAG; 3) agroclimatic impact\n            evaluations; and 4) MAG Computer Center services.  The\n            Agricultural Sample Census component supports designing,\n            preparing, and executing the national Agricultural Sample\n            Census; and strengthens the data processing capacity of the\n            National Statistics and Census Institute.  The Agricultural\n            Farm Production Survey component improves the national\n            agricultural production survey methodology, speeds\n            processing turn-around, conducts two production surveys per\n            year, and executes one farm expenditure survey during the\n            life of the project. The fifth component is project management."}, "docdt": "1997-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
