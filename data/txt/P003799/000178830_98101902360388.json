coconut development program. In particular,\n            the project would: (a) plant, replant, and maintain until\n            maturity, about 37,600 ha of coconuts of which about 85%\n            would be with high yielding hybrid material; and develop\n            about 3,500 ha of immature coconuts (local tall variety);\n            (b) rehabilitate about 38,000 ha of mature coconuts; (c)\n            establish three 180 ha hybrid seed gardens; (d) strengthen\n            70 existing Coconut Working Centers (CWCs), and establish\n            and staff 15 provincial offices and a Head Office; (e)\n            provide training and technical assistance; and (f) finance\n            studies covering, in particular, the copra marketing and\n            processing system, and the preparation of future projects."}, "docdt": "1980-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
