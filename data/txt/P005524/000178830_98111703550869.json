The first establishes a\n            rehabilitation or grant facility to support private\n            initiatives in historic building conservation, including\n            innovative rehabilitation of historic housing; and develops\n            new tourism itineraries, coupled with the conservation or\n            rehabilitation of historic buildings. The second component\n            1) provides access for emergency public services extending\n            to the center of the medina; 2) improves critical links with\n            medina entrances; 3)facilitates ease of movement for\n            residents, businesses, tourists, and goods; 4) increases\n            parking spaces to the level of demand; and 5) improves\n            traffic management. The third component aims to improve\n            solid waste collection by providing equipment; and minimize\n            pollution by providing improved workshop facilities for the\n            most polluting traditional activities within the medina. The\n            fourth component rehabilitates the medina wall and launches\n            emergency action for occupied housing falling in ruins in\n            order to promote labor-intensive job opportunities and to\n            promote small-scale private sector contractors. The final\n            component finances a resource mobilization program;\n            strengthens the agency responsible for rehabilitating\n            Fes-Medina (ADER-Fes); sets up a conservation laboratory;\n            and sets up a training program."}, "docdt": "1998-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
