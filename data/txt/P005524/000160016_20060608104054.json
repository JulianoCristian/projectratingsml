The performances of both the Bank and the\n            Borrower are rated unsatisfactory. Several lessons were\n            cited from this project experience. They are in brief: 1)\n            Reversing the urban decay of historic cities is a long-term\n            endeavor. 2) Social participation is essential for the\n            successful rehabilitation of the historic housing stock. 3)\n            The tenure of land and buildings is a critical difficulty in\n            the rehabilitation of historic cities. 4) Municipalities\n            should consider delegating urban rehabilitation operations\n            to competent agencies. 5) Urban rehabilitation projects\n            should be designed according to simple objectives and\n            design. 6) Project restructuring, when needed, should take\n            place and be formalized as early as possible."}, "docdt": "2006-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
