The\n            project will help finance the expansion and improvement of\n            about 1.9 million tons of storage capacity for corn, rice,\n            dry beans, wheat and soybean. Beneficiaries would include\n            farmers, cooperatives, grain processors, warehouse and mixed\n            enterprises.
