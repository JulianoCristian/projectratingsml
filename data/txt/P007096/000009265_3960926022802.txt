ECUADOR
SECOND GUAYAQUIL AND GUAYAS PROVINCE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:             Guayaquil Municipal Water Supply Company (EMAP-G)
Guarantor:            The Republic of r'.uador
Amount:               US$31.0 million equivalent.
Termz:                Repayable over 17 years, including 4 years of grace,
with interest at the Bank's standard variable rate and
charges.
Co-Financier:         Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) is expected
to provide the equivalent of US$8 million as Joint
financing on terms similar to the proposed Bank loan.
Project
Description:          The project would  support  the Government's  service
goals in the sector, improve water supply service lev-
els in Ecuador's largest city and strengthen EMAP-G by
improving its managerial, technical and financial per-
formance. It would include components to: (i) expand
the water supply system; (ii) improve EMAP-G's opera-
tions; and (iii) undertake studies related to future
system expansion, rehabilitation and organization.
Benefits:             The project would directly benefit about 0.9 million
people, of which 68% would be the urban poor.   Fur-
thermore, the project would help improve EMAP-G's
efficiency and financial performance.
Risks:                There is little risk regarding  the physical works.
There is some risk, however, that the management sta-
bility and local political support needed to sustain
the financial and operating improvement programs can-
not  be  maintained.    Moreover,  EMAP-G's  financial
improvement is based on satisfactory tariffs, on a
major connections program and operational improve-
ments.   Several actions have already been taken or
are proposed to minimize these risks: EMAP-G has been
authorized to implement a satisfactory program of tar-
iff hikes and increased service charges effective
January 1, 1987; EMAP-G has agreed on a rolling action
plan to improve its performance based on concrete tar-
gets; EMAP-G's Board has approved an operating
improvement program; a pragmatic technical cooperation
program has been designed; and a revolving fund to



-iv-
Risks: (Cont.)        assist in financing house connections would be estab-
lished, thereby making water sales targets more feas-
ible.   In addition, operating and financial targets
are realistic and within EMAP-G's capability.

I. THE SECTOR
Population and Service Levels
1.01       The estimated end-1984 total population of Ecuador was 9.1 mil-
lion, of which about 4.6 million (51%) was urban. The total population is
growing at an estimated 2.8% p.a.   Long-term population trends show an
increasingly urbanized population and a marked migration from the highlands
to the coast.  Over 50% of the urban population is concentrated in Guaya-
quil,  the  nation's  principal  industria.  and  commercial  center,  and in
Quito, the capital city.   In 1982, life expectancy was 63 years.   Infant
mortality was 76 per thousand live births, as compared to 54 in Colombia,
53 in Mexico and 27 In Chiie.  Enteritis and other diarrheal diseases were
the principal causes of mortality.
1.02       Between 1960 and 1984 water supply and sewerage service levels
improved considerably: from 37% to 53% of the population served by water
supply and from 15% to 29% of the population served by public sewerage.
Another 18% of the population was served by latrines or septic tanks. At
the end of 1984, 75% of the urban population and 25% of the rural popula-
tion had domestic water connections.   Despite these improvements, service
levels are still among the lowest in South America.  Moreover, metering
levels are very low; water quality control is generally very poor, and
intermittent servic- is the rule.
Water Resources
1.03       The Ecuadorian Water Resources Institute (INERRI) is responsible
for planning and monitoring the country's water resources.   Countrywide,
Ecuador is generously bestowed with rainfall. Its water reaources are suf-
ficient to supply the needs of the country for many years to come.
Although groundwater resources are plentiful, about 90% of all water for
domestic use comes from surface sources and is transported mostly by grav-
ity.   Sources generally yield high quality water, and little treatment is
needed. Despite the overall adequacy of water resources, geographical and
seasonal imbalances exist, particularly in Quito and some areas in the
southern coast.
Sector Organization
1.04        Conceptually, sector organization is adequate; however,  indi-
vidual sector organizations are weak.  The Ministry of Health's National
Sanitary Works Institute (IEOS), in coordination with the National Develop-
ment Council (CONADE), has responsibility for sector planning and setting
investment priorities.   The Ecuadorian Development Bank (BEDE), since its
start-up in 1979, has become one of the principal financing agents for the
sector.
1.05        IEOS establishes standards, prepares projects, constructs and
supervises works, manages a rural sanitation fund and operates some 20
small water supply and sewerage systems.   IEOS may also set tariffs and
promote and participate in the organization of autonomous water and sewer-
age companies, but only at the request of the municipalities.   IEOS is



- 2 -
plagued by political interference and suffers from severe budgetary con-
straints.  It is highly centralized with more than one-half of its 1,000
employees headquartered in Quito.   IEOS' role has been gradually eroded
over the past 20 years, largely because of its lackluster performance in
meeting its commitments and its increasing involvement in the Ministry of
Health's functions (hospital and health care center maintenance).
1.06        CONADE's effectiveness is hampered by its limited analytical
capacity and i8s relative isolation within the public sector.  BEDE runs a
relatively efficient operation and has assisted in moving the sector toward
greater financial discipline.
1.07      At the local level, only the eight largest cities have autonomous
municipal water and/or sewerage companies.  Most of the other municipal-
ities have poor water and sewerage services characterized by a lack of
autonomy and a resulting shortage of qualifieJ manpower and a limited reve-
nue base.
Sector Performance and Prospects
1.08       The Government has recently revised its Water Decade targets to
nerve 70% of the population by water house connections and provide 70% with
sanitation services by 1990.   These more modest targets will probably be
attained after 1990. The 1985-89 National Development Plan (NDP) allocates
US$90 million annually to the sector.   The NDP projected investments are
about 70% of estimated requirements to meet Water Decade goals; however, as
a result of the recent oil price decline these investment levels have been
reduced. Major sector investments in the NDP (about 30% of total invest-
ment) are programmed for the country's two principal cities.   In Quito,
investment includes short-term water supply solutions, operational improve-
ments in Quito's Water Supply Company and final design and preparatory
works for the city's long-term water supply solution (Micatambo project).
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is assisting in the financing of
these works and studies.   In Guayaquil, investment includes the execution
of water supply works defined in a well-conceived Master Plan and comple-
mentary sewage works.  The water supply investment forms the basis for the
proposed project.  IDB is assisting in the financing of the sewage works.
Internal funding of sector investment is mainly through Central Government
grants and, more recently, BEDE loans.   IDB has been the principal source
of external financing. The Bank atisisted in the financing of water sunply
works in Guayas Province and the above mentioned Master Plan for the City
of Guayaquil. Foreign suppliers have also provided external credits.
1.09      Past sector performance has been adversely affected by:  (a) lack
of autonomous water entities; (b)  IEOS' failure to exercise its role as
the lead technical agency; (c) poor projlect design criteria; (d) procure-
ment tied to suppliers' loans; and (e) lack of capital cost recovery poli-
cies.  Government actions in the sector have been carried out principally
on an ad hoc basis, responding to emergency situations and municipal pres-
sures with funding allocations and little thought to the management of the
sector. Investments are not subjected to least-cost solution analysis, and
design periods are uneconomically long, ranging from 20 to 40 years. Proj-
ects, as a result, are overdesigned. Moreover, the selection criteria are
applied by IEOS on a "first-come, first-served" basis.   Suppliers' loans



lead, in many cases, to inappropriately high capital-intensive invest-
ments. In addition, these investments are not properly operated and main-
tained because poor management and limited revenues result in a lack of
trained personnel and availability of spare parts. Current water and sew-
erage tariffs generally do not cover operating and maintenance costs.
Country-wide,   average  water  tariffs  are  low,  amounting  to  about
US$0.04/m3.   In a sample of 50 systems, total income in 1983 covered inly
45% of current expenses.  The resulting operating deficits are covered by
municipe; budgets and debt service by the Central Government.  Most rural
systems cover at least their operating expenses, with many accumulating a
surplus for future extension.
Ban!_ Experience in the Sector
1.10       The Bank helped finance the Guayaquil and Guayas Province Water
upply Project (Loan 1030-EC, signed July 1974, US$23.2 million). The loan
was fully disbursed in 1982.   The Bank, under a pre-investment project
(Loan S-006), also financed feasibility studies in the sector.
1.11      Project completion and performance audit reports for Loan 1030-EC
have been prepared. These reports conclude that while the important proj-
ect objectives have been met:  (a) the main project component was prema-
ture; (b) the project execution period was optimistic; (c) slow and cumber-
some procurement procedures contributed to execution delays; (d) financial
and operating parameters were unrealistic, and improvements were limited;
(e) the Board of the Guayaquil Municipal Water Supply Company (EMAP-G),
with strong municipal government Influence, was involved in the day-to-day
management of the company; and (f) the technical assistance for institu-
tional improvements was too ambitious, not clearly targeted and did not
address the Aorrower's felt needs.
1.12      The findings and lessons learned have been taken into account in
the preparation of the proposed project. The proposed project is based on
full feasibility and final designs and an eight-yea: implementation sched-
ule. Standard bidding documents are being prepared. Financial and operat-
ing targets are conservative. The proposed technical assistance is tied to
a specific plan of action to strengthen EMAP-G's management and opera-
tions. The plan, based on EMAP-G's staff diagnosis, was approved by the
Company Board.
Bank Sector Strategy
1.13        Since 1976 the Bank has attempted to develop a secondary city
operation focussed on sector policies, the strengthening of national insti-
tutions including IBOS and BEDE, and the development of autonomous water
companies. In iddition, IDB has repeatedly undertaken efforts to strength-
en IBOS through non-reimbursable technical assistance programs and lending
operations. Despite these efforts IOS remains ineffective.
1.14       Bank strategy in )the sector would therefore focus on creating
strong autonomous regional water and sewerage companies, for the time'
being, bypassing IEOS.  Such companies would allow the more efficient use
of scarce human sad financial resources and contribute to economies of
scale. The Bank would concentrate its first efforts to develop EMAP-G as a



- 4 -
model company which could be used as an example for the country. Through
BEDE's close association with EMAP-G in the context of its ongoing financ-
ing of works complementary to the proposed project, the lessons learned
under the project would be institutionalized within BEDE for dissemination
to other water projects countrywide.
Guayaquil and Guayas Province
1.15       Guayaquil had an estimated mid-1985 population of about 1.4 mil-
lion people; the rest of Guayas Province had a population of about 0.4 mil-
lion. Guayas Province experienced a population growth of 3.9% p.a. between
1974 and 1982. Guayaquil is the largest city in Ecuador (15% of the total
population).  Its main source of water is the Daule River.  EMAP-G is the
water supplier for tbe entire Guayas Province.  A separate Municipal Sewer-
age Company (EMA-G) provides sewerage services in Guayaquil.  Service lev-
els in the companies' charter areas in 1985 were 58% of the population
served by public water supply and 48% of the population served by public
sewerage. A description of EMAP-G's existing water supply system is avail-
able in the project files.
II. THE PROJECT
Project Origin
2.01       The proposed project is based upon the Water Supply Master Plan
for Guayaquil and Guayas Province, which was financed under Loan 1030-EC
and satisfactorily completed in 1981.   The project was identified in May
1985 and was prepared by EMAP-G with the help of Bank staff.   It was
appraised in February 1986.   Negotiations for the proposed project took
place in Washington from October 6-10, 1986. The Ecuadorian delegation wT'3
led by Mr. Jaime Zeas, Subsecretary of Public Credit and Coordination.
Mr. German Ode, President of EMAP-G, represented that institution.
Water Demand
2.02       EMAP-G's annual production is projected to increase by 41% from
122 Mm3 in 1986 to 173 Mm3 in 1994.  These projections are based on a 1994
population of 2.1 million served (Master Plan projections and 1982 census),
on the reduction of the average sale per connection from 40.8 m3/month in
1984 to 37.3 m3/month in 1994 (distribution system reaches low-income popu-
lation) and on the reduction of unaccounted-for water from about 50% to 30%
(operations improvements). The production capacity required, based on max-
imum day demand and emergency requirements, is estimated at 130% of average
consumption (Annex 1). A detailed discussion of water demand is available
in the project files.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.03       Bank strategy in Ecuador is to support macroeconomic and sector
reforms titrough a series of sector and project loans, including those
intended to develop social and economic infrastructure. Within individual
operations special attention will be paid to Improve performance of public
enterprises. The proposed project would supply needed physical infrastruc-
ture to Ecuador's major industrial center and port; assist E4AP-G in



- 5 -
gaining a solid operational and financial footing; and bring the low water
service coverage in EIIAP-G's service area (58%) to levels compatible with
national urban coverage (80%).  An estimated 600,000 persons living at or
below the relative poverty level would benefit from the proposed project.
EMAP-G is at the threshold of becoming an efficiently operated company.
During project preparation the Bank assisted EMAP-G to develop a pragmatic
technical cooperation program and identify a well run water utility to
carry it out, and required EMAP-G to prepare draft tender documents.
Close Bank monitoring of the technical cooperation program is essential to
EMAP-G's efforts to move ahead.
Project Objectives
2.04      The proposed project would support the Government's service goals
in the sector, improve water service levels in Ecuador's largest city, and
strengthen EMAP-G by improving its managerial, technical and financial per-
formance. It would have the following objectives:
(a) Expand the water supply system to increase water supply coverage
frcm 58% to 81% of the population ser-ed by 1994 through house
connections   benefitting   about   900,000   additional   people
(Annex 1).  It would provide increased water production, treat-
ment and storage, rehabilitate the most deteriorated part of the
distribution system and expand service to low-income neighbor-
hoods; and
(b)  Improve EMAP-G's performance to handle an increased customer base
in a more efficient and financially sound manner.  It would also
assist sector development by employing EMAP-G as a model for
establishing efficient regional water supp.i; companies. In addi-
tion, recommendations for a merger or better coordination of the
activities of EMAP-G and E1lA-G would be made.  Engineering ser-
vices would also be included to assist EMAP-G in its planning
through the year 2010.
P jiect Description
2.05      The proposed project would include three components (Annex 2):
(a)  Expansion of water supply system consisting of:  (i) rehabilita-
tion of La Toma treatment plant to increase capacity from 42C,000
m3/d to 660,000 m3/d; (ii) construction of an additional storage
tank to increase capazity by 22,000 m3; (iii) rehabilitation and
construction of 400 km of distribution system- and (iv) a revolv-
ing fund to finance house  connections.   The water production
increases would be achieved by optimizing the existing civil
works. Changes in the treatment process would be introduced to
take advantage of modern and widely used technology.  The reha-
bilitation of La Toma would provide sufficient water production
to meet projected peak demand in 1997 at about one-third the cost
to build a new treatment plant;
(b)  Operations improvement and training consisting of:  (i) technical
cooperation and training provided through a twinning arrangement
with a well managed water supply authority with emphasis on

operations and maintenance and leak detection, human resources
development and financial and commercial management; (ii) pur-
chase of operations and maintenance and leak detection equipment;
and (iii) purchase of production and domestic meters and rehabil-
itation, If needed, of X meter workshop; and
(c)  Studies providing for:  (i) an update of the second stage of the
Master Plan; (ii) rehabilltation of La Lolita treatment plant;
and (iii) merger or better coordination of activities of the
water ane sewerage companies. Assurances were obtained that the
study of EMAP-G and EMA-G merger or coordination would be com-
pleted by December 1990, together with a program to implement
study recommendations (para 3.01).   By that time, the institu-
tional capacity of both agencies should be improved sufficiently
to make enhanced coordination or merger more feasible.
Terms of references for the twinning operation and the study to merge or
better coordinate activities of EMAP-G and BMA-G are presented in Annex 3.
Project Cost and Financing
2.06      The estimated total project cost would be US$50.5 million equiva-
lent, including US$4.3 million in interest during construction over the
four-year grace perlod of the proposed Bank and Commonwealth Development
Corporation  (CDC)  loans  (Table  2.1 and Annex 4).   The  total foreign
exchange cost would be US$31.9 million (632). The base cost, expressed in
December 1986 prices, would be US$39.9 million, net of taxes. Construction
costs are based on unit costs developed by EMAP-G for on-going works.
EMAP-G is exempt from direct domestic and import taxes.  Physical contin-
gencies include 10% for civil works and 52 for supplies and equipment.
Price contingencies assume:   (a) that the purchast½g parity of the sucre
versus the US dollar would not change during pr).Ject execution; (b) an
eight-year project execution period (1987-94) (para. 2.17); and (c) pro-
jected international inflation of 32 for 1987, 1% p.a. for 1988-90 and 3.5X
p.a. thereafter.

Total            50.48     100
The proposed Bank loan of US$31 million would include US$25.4 million
towards the estimated foreign component and US$5.6 million towards local
costs. EMAP-G would finance US$11.5 million from internal cash generation,
and CDC is expected to provide US$8 million in cofinancing to close the
financing plan.   Negotiations between EMAP-G and CDC are expected to be
concluded by March 1987.   CDC loan terms are expected to be similar to
those of the proposed Bank loan. It is anticipated that CDC would finance
approximately 20% of the cost of goods and services financed by the Bank.
The financing plan calls for both the Bank and CDC to finance interest on
their respective loans during the project's first four years to allow time
for initial project works to generate revenues.   Financing of some local
costs by the Bank is justified on account of the decisive actions by the
Government to mobilize domestic resources and curtail expenditures in the
face of declining fiscal receipts resulting from falling oil prices. Exe-
cution and delivery of the CDC loan contract and satisfaction of its condi-
tions of effectiveness would be a condition of effectiveness for the Bank
loan (para. 3.03).
The Borrower/Implementing Agency
2.08       The Borrower and implementing agency, as under the previous Bank
loan, would be EMAP-G, an autonomous municipal company created in 1970.
The Mayor of Guayaquil is nominally the President of the Board of Direc-
tors. However, this position is delegated to one of the municipal council
members.   Other members represent civic, professional and labor groups.
Frequent mayoral changes in Guayaqvil have induced turnover at the top man-
agement level. The President effectively runs the Company. The organiza-
tion structure is functional, needing only minor changes.   EMAP-G has a
seasoned corps of 33 professionals at the upper and mid-management levels
backed by a staff of 45 lower level professionals. EMAP-G has reduced its
number of employees per 1,000 connections from over 16 in 1974 to 10.7 in
1986; however, staff is still excessive.   There is a strong union struc-
ture.  Professional salaries are low, and training opportunities are lim-
ited.  EMAP-G serves 58% of the population with house connections.  About
half of these connections are effectively metered.  In addition, the Com-
pany provides service through over 100 metered standpipes and some 75 out-
lets  for  private  water  tankers,  which  retail  the  water.    Estimated
unaccounted-for water is about 50%.   Systematic maintenance of EMA*-G's
water supply system is hindered by lack of funds, equipment and trained
staff. Administrative and financial systems need to be improved. Standard
commercial financial statements are prepared with some delay. An excellent
program budget is produced; however, approval of the budget is late in the
year.   Comprehensive management reports, available through 1983, are no
longer prepared. EMAP-G has maintained its tariffs in real terms over the
past decade.   The average water tariff as of January 1, 1987 will be



- 8 -
US$0.20/m3, which is reasonable by Latin American standards and high within
the Ecuadorian context. On account of EMAP-G's adequate tariff level, Its
heavy reliance on non-utility revenues (principally taxes on telephone ser-
vices provided within EMAP-G's service area) has been reduced from 64% of
operating revenues in 1973 to 16% in 1985. The Company has managed to ser-
vice its debt despite major devaluations of the sucre.
2.09       EMAP-G's staff has reviewed the Company's current situation and
set targets in priority areas, which are included in the technical coopera-
tion and training program  (para.  2.12).   The Board  of  Directors  has
accepted these recommendations and established a permanent planning commit-
tee composed of a management team and a working group to work closely with
the twinning institution, which would be responsible for technical coopera-
tion and training.   In addition, EMAP-t2 has agreed on an action plan to
improve its managerial, technical and financial performance (para. 2.20).
The present Board President has strong political support and is committed
to improve the existing situation in EMAP-G.
Project Implementation
2.10        Project implementation would take place over eight years with
completion expected by end-1994. EMAP-G's project execution unit would be
responsible for project implementation.  This unit was created under Loan
1030-EC and prepared the proposed project with the assistance of consult-
ants.   Staffing of the unit is satisfactory.   Project implementation has
already started with EMAP-G preparing the draft tender documents for 75% of
the physical works.   The timetable for project implementation (Annexes 6
and 7) calls for bidding on all works by mid-1988. EMAP-G would hire qual-
ified consultants, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, for
construction supervision.
2.11      Two complementary works, which have already been awarded and are
being financed by the Government and BEDE, are essential to project execu-
tion and completion.   The first, construction of a 100,000 m3/d treatment
plant, must be operational before the rehabilitation of La Toma treatment
plant can begin.   The second,  construction of main transmission pipes
(BEDE-1), should be timed to meet distribution system expansion. Satisfac-
tory evidence that sufficient funding would be available to complete the
treatment plant would be a condition of disbursement for the component to
expand the water supply system (paras. 3.02 and 3.04).   Assurances were
obtained that the emergency treatment plant would be completed by July 1987
and the main transmission pipes by July 1989 (para. 3.01).
2.12      The technical cooperation and training program is proposed under
a twinning arrangement.   Draft terms of reference have been prepared by
EMAP-G (Annex 3).   Negotiations are ongoing with the Miami-Dade County
Water Authority to provide this assistance.   The arrangement would offer
technical support from an operating entity and draw upon the entity's
in-house resources to address EMAP-G's needs in a practical manner. EMAP-G
management and staff would, through training visits to the supplier, have
the opportunity to study and work in a more commercial and technical envi-
ronment, and use this experience to correct deficiencies in EMAP-G.   An
external consultant would be hired at project start-up to coordinate the
activities under this program.    Advance contracting of US$300,000 and
retroactive financing of US$150,000 from July 1, 1986, would be provided to
allow early start-up of this vital component (para. 3.05).  Submission to



- 9 -
the Bank of a signed contract between EMAP-G and the twinning institution
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.03).
2.13       A revolving fund to finance house connectlons would be estab-
lished under the proposed project.  This fund would help EMAP-G to expand
rapidly its consumer base--an essential element for EMAP-G's improved
financial performance--and assist the population, especially the low and
lower-middle income groups, to obtain in-house water service. All residen-
tial consumers pay the same connection fee; cross-subsidy is achieved
through a progressive tariff structure.   All new residential  consumers
would be eligible.  An estimated 80% of the new customers would apply for
loans to finance the house connection fee. Agreement was reached on lend-
ing terms, which would include a 5% down payment and an amortization period
of up to five years, at a variable interest rate sufficient to maintain the
real value of the fund (para. 3.01). EMAP-G would handle billing and col-
lection through its normal procedures.   EMAP-G's working capital require-
ments for house connection loans receivable would peak after four years
from project initiation. To support these working capital requirements the
Bank would front load its disbursements for the foreign exchange cost of
all house connections financed over the eight-year project execution period
(para. 2.16).
Procurement
2.14        Procurement under the proposed project would be in accordance
with Bank Guidelines (May 1985), including goods and services cofinanced by
the CDC loan. The Bank would supervise all procurement under the proposed
project.   EMAP-G has prepared draft tender documents in accordance with
these Guidelines and submitted them to Ecuador's Controller General (CG)
for approval.
2.15      EMAP-G's experience shows the convenience of bidding through sup-
ply and installation packages. Most civil works under the proposed project
are expected to be bid in this manner (Annex 7).  Force account works are
not foreseen.   Contracts for supply and installation of goods or civil
works estimated to cost US$1.0 million or more and equipment purchases for
US$100,000 or more would be procured through international competitive bid-
ding (ICB). Contracts for supply and. installation of goods or civil works
estimated to cost between US$100,000 and US$1.0 million, and equipment pur-
chases estimated to cost between US$10,000 and US$100,000 would be awarded
under local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures, satisfactory to the
Bank.   The aggregate amount of contracts  so procured would not exceed
US$4.0 million. Contracts less than the above LCB limits would be procured
on the basis of a minimum of three quotations subject to an aggregate limit
of US$600,000.   Qualifying domestic manufacturers would receive a prefer-
ence in bid evaluations of 15% of CIF price, or the prevailing import duty,
whichever is less.  The limits for prior Bank review of bidding documents
(US$500,000 for supply and installation of goods or civil works and
US$100,000 for supply of goods) would result in a coverage of about 85% of
the estimated project cost.   Consultants would be selected in accordance
with Bank Guidelines under terms of reference, satisfactory to the Bank. A
summary of procurement by method is presented in Annex 8.  Project cost by
procurement method is as follows:

1/ Figures in parenthesis are the amounts financed by the Bank.
Disbursement
2.16      The Bank loan would be disbursed against (Annex 9):
(a)  40% of expenditures for civil works;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for equipment and materials, 70% of
expenditures for imported goods procured locally, and 40% for
other local expenditures;
(c)  100% of the cost of residential connections up to a total of
US$4.7 million, and 39% thereafter;
(d)  100% of expenditures for consulting services and training; and
(e)  amount due for interest on the Bank's loan within its grace per-
iod up to a maximum of US$3.3 million.
2.17       Consistent with procurement prior review limits (para. 2.15) and
Bank practice in Ecuador, for contracts valued at less than US$500,000
equivalent for local expenditures and US$50,000 equivalent for foreign
expenditures, disbursement would be against statements of expenditures.
Documentation for these expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank,
but would be retained by EKAP-G for periodic inspection by Bank staff. To
expedite project execution, a Special Account would be opened in the Cen-
tral Bank with a deposit of up to USS2.5 million, representing four months'
peak disbursements.   The Closing Date of the proposed loan would be June
30, 1995.   The disbursement period is estimated at 8.5 years, consistent
with the Bank's sector profile for Latin America. Disbursements during the
first year are higher than the profile because of the advanced stage of the
procurement process (para. 2.14), advance contracting (para. 2.12) and
establishment of the house connection revolving fund (para. 2.13).   The
disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 10.
EMAP-G's Financial Performance and Prospects
2.18        EMAP-G's 1984 and 1985 financial results are consistent with a
policy of financing investment through debt and Government grants. Operat-
ing revenues and tax receipts covered operating costs, working capital



- 11 -
needs and debt service (Annex 11). Despite operating losses in both years,
net income, which includes non-operating tax receipts, was positive,
reflecting tariff increases effected mid-1984 and scheduled to be main-
tained through 1986. Accounts receivable are high, representing about 3.5
months of sales. The account with the University of Guayaquil, which rep-
resents over 10% of EMAP-G's service receivables, is in arrears. EMAP-G is
carrying out a major program of service cuts in order to improve its col-
lections. Moreover, the Government has agreed to pay the University's past
dues by end 1987 (para. 3.02). Measures to further reduce accounts receiv-
able, including continuation of the service cuts program, have been incor-
porated into EMAP-G's action plan (para. 2.20).
2.19       EMAP-G's estimated 1986 operating results have been affected by:
(a) an erosion of the tariff base (estimated inflation of 23% versus tariff
increases of 20%); (b) increased personnel costs resulting principally from
newly negotiated labor contracts; and (c) a 27% devaluation of the sucre.
As a result, EMAP-G has been authorized to implement a satisfactory program
of tariff hikes and increased service charges effective January 1, 1987.
In addition to these tariff increases, projected financial results are
predicated on water production increases, a major connection program and
EMAP-G operational improvements. The above actions are consistent with the
project execution schedule and EMAP-G's capabilities and would allow the
Company to finance a gradually increasing share of its investments from
internal sources. Operational and resulting financial targets are conser-
vative and consistent with project design. Estimated financial results are
satisfactory. Internal cash generation would be sufficient to complete the
emergency treatment plant (para. 2.11) and meet the proposed project's
counterpart funding of US$11.5 million. EMAP-G's estimated ceitribution to
overall investment would be 35%.  Commitments to fund ongoing major works
in EMAP-G's investment program have already been secured from BEDE and the
Government. The working ratio is projected to fall from 90% in 1985 to 66%
beginning in 1991.
2.20        Assurances were obtained that EMAP-G would provide funds from
internal sources and tax receipts sufficient to cover its operating
expenses, debt service, working capital needs and not less than the follow-
ing percent contributions to the financing of the proposed Bank-assisted
project:  15% in 1987, 20% in 1988, 25% in 1989 and 31% thereafter through-
out project execution, to yield a weighted average of 25% for the entire
project (para. 3.01). Also, agreement was reached on a rolling three year
action plan with operational and financial targets to allow EMAP-G to meet
its required counterpart funding (Annex 12). Assurances were obtained that
EMAP-G would update the action plan and jointly review the plan with the
Bank by September 30 of each year and take all measures necessary to meet
the covenanted funding levels (para. 3.01).
Auditing and Reporting
2.21       Ecuador's CG is responsible for ensuring that EMAP-G's financial
statemnents are audited. In recent years the audit has been carried out by
a private firm.  Assurances were obtained that EMAP-G's financial state-
ments, the Special Account, the revolving fund for house connections and
the statements of expenditure would be audited annually by independent
auditors, satisfactory to the Bank, and that the auditors' reports would
be provided to the Bank not later than six months (four months in the case



- 12 -
of the Special Account) after the close of each year (para. 3.01). Assur-
ances were also obtained that EMAP-G would submit to the Bank:   (a) by
March 31 and September 30 of each year a report on progress made in project
execution and the action plan and monitoring indicators; and (b) a comple-
tion report not later than six months after the Closing Date of the Bafnk
loan (para. 3.01).
Environmental Impact
2.22          The proposed project would  improve  sanitary  conditions  in
EMAP-G's service area by providing a safe, continuous supply of water and
improving operations and maintenance of the system.  Complementary expan-
sion of the sewage system is being carried out by EMA-G with IDB financ-
?>.J  These works would adequately dispose of most water produced by the
project. Per capita consumption in marginal areas not covered by the sew-
age system is relatively low and would be adequately removed through indi-
vidual disposal systems.
Project Justification, Benefits and Affordability
2.23        The proposed project would enable EMAP-G to satisfy projected
demand to the year 1997 and to prepare it to adequately undertake system
expansion which will be needed in the future. At project completion (end-
1994) approximately 900,000 additional persons would be provided with piped
water; about 68% of these beneficiaries would be the urban poor.  Further-
more, the efficiency and planning capabilities of EMAP-G should improve on
account of the technical cooperation program.
2.24        The proposed project would finance only items of high priority
and immediate impact which are consistent with long-term objectives
detailed in EMAP-G's Water Supply Master Plan.  Project components repre-
sent the least-cost solution for achieving objectives and would not involve
the use of unusual or unproven technologies. Each element of the constrnc-
tion program was selected on the basis of analyses of at least three alter-
natives.
2.25      The internal rate of return (IRR) for the project has been 'alcu-
lated at 14% (Annex 13). Revenues from consumer charges (based on author-
ized January 1987 tariffs) were used as a minimum measure for economic ben-
efits. As in all water supply projects, revenues do not fully capture full
project benefits including, inter alia, improved health, higher property
values and employment generation.   The consumer surplus is also excluded
from  the  calculation.      EMAP-G's  authorized  January  1987  tariff  of
US$0.20/m3 exceeds the average incremental cost (AIC) over the medium term
of US$0.17/m3.   The satisfactory economic results derive from the more
efficient use of existing facilities and improvements in EMAP-G's opera-
tional performance.
2.26      The entire population in EMAP-G's service area would benefit from
the proposed project.   For those already connected to the system, safe
water would be available on a continuous basis. By 1994, a; project com-
pletion, about 900,000 additional people would be served. Over 400,000 of
the beneficiaries now residing in the metropolitan area do not yet have
house connections.   This population is now mostly served by private water



- 13 -
trucks and pays about ten times EMAP-G's average tariff for limited and, at
times, unsafe water. Based on income distribution data and the location of
project works, an estimated 58% of total project cost would directly bene-
fit the poor, while 57% of the Bank loan would! directly benefit the poor.
The poverty group is defined as families earning a monthly monetary income
of less thar. US$155, corresponding to about 30% of national per capita
income and a family size of 5.4.  An evaluation of the affordability of
services was 'ased on authorized January 1987 tariffs. At that time a fam-
ily with a monthly income at the poverty threshold would pay a reasonable
charge of little more than 2% of its income for a minimum monthly water
supply of 15 m3, plus monthly amortization over five years of the house
connection fee (Annex 13).
Project Risks
2.27      There is little risk regarding the physical works.  Final designs
are 90% complete; draft tender documents are under preparation; technology
is proven and straightforward; and an eight-year implementation schedule is
contemplated. A higher risk exists, however, that the management stability
and local political support needed to sustain the financial and operating
improvement programs cnnnot be maintained.   Moreover, EMAP-G's financial
improvement is based on maintenance of satisfactory tariffs, on a major
connection program and operational improvements.   These risks have been
minimized through a number of already taken or proposed actions:
(a)  EMAP-G has been authorized to implement a satisfactory program of
tariff hikes and increased service charges effective January 1,
1987 (para. 2.19);
(b)  EMAP-G has agreed on an action plan to commit the Company to
improve its performance based on concrete targets.   The action
plan would be closely monitored during supervision and formally
reviewed annually (para. 2.20);
(c)   EMAP-G's professional staff has evaluated the Company's needs
and prepared recommendations for improvement, which have been
incorporated into the above mentioned action plan.   EMAP-G's
Board has approved these recommendations and established a high-
level committee to implement them.   The Board President has
strong political support to carry out the recommendations
(para. 2.09);
(d) a pragmatic technical cooperation program through a twinning
operation has been designed for the project. Several visits have
been made to the likely twinning institution; draft terms of ref-
erence  have  been  agreed,   and  negotiations   are   ongoing
(para. 2.12);
(e) a revolving fund is included in the project to facilitate the
connection to the system by new consumers, especially the urban
poor population (para. 2.13); and
(f) operating and financial targets are conservative and within
EMAP-G's capacity.



- 14 -
2.28       Sensitivity analyses show that a reduction of 202 in the number
of  connections  would  still  leave  an  IRR of  about  92.    Further,  if
unaccounted-for water targets were not reached and unaccounted-for water
remained at the current level, the IRR would still be about 10%, and water
production capacity would still be sufficient to meet projected non-peak
demand through the end of the project execution period.
III. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS

ECUADOR
SECOND GUAYAQUIL AND GUAYAS PROVINCE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Project Description
I.    EXPANSION OF THE WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM
Rehabilitation of La Toma Water Treatment Plant.  This subcomponent
would be the second expansion of La Toma; the first one increased its
production capacity to 320,000 m3/d and was financed under Loan
1030-EC.   Under the proposed project the total production capacity
would be 660,000 m3/d, including the additional 100,000 m3/d provided
by the emergency plant now under contract.   The water production
increase would be achieved by optimizing the existing civil works.
Changes in the treatment process would be introduced to take
advantage of modern and widely used technology.   The modifications
would: (a) change the sedimentation process by installing modules of
plastic tube settlers and changing the sludge removal system; (b)
improve the flocculation by constructing four hydraulic flocculators;
and (c) increase the filtration capacity by constructing five
declining rate filters in each old settling tank.
Pu!mping Station.   This subcomponent would increase thf capacity of
the existing raw water pumping station of La Toma Water Treatment
Plant from 445,000 m3/d to 670,000 m3/d by supplying and setting up
two electric pumps and one diesel driven pump, each of which would
have a nominal capacity of 75,000 m3/d. Totetl dynamic head would be
about 86 meters. Discharge pipes, valves and fittings, all of which
would be needed for the operation of the new equipment, also would be
included.
Rehabilitation of the Distribution System in Downtown Guayaquil.
This subcomponent would include the replacement of about 1.3 km of
main pipes and 50 km of the distribution system where the pipes are
too small or have deteriorated to the point that it is cheaper to
replace them than to repair them.  The works would require a long
construction period because of the heavy traffic conditions in down-
town Guayaquil.
Expansion of the Distribution System in El Guasmo, Mapasingue,
Suburbio Oeste,  and Prosperina.    This component would  serve  the
low-income population highly concentrated in El Guasmo, Sectors 1
through 6, and the above-mentioned  areas.   This component would



- 18 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 3
consist of the installation of about 325 km of pipe with diameters
between 80 mm and 1000 mm, as well as supply and installation of
valves, fire *nydrants and fittings.  House connection costs are not
included  in this  subcomponent.    Coinections  would  be  installed
through a revolving fund described below. Primary and secondary dis-
tribution would be constructed for low-income neighborhoods.   Only
main distribution pipes for the other areas of the city would be
provided under the project.    Private developers would build  the
secondary systems.
Supply and Installatioi of a Subaqueous Pipe.   This subcomponent
would improve the water supply to "Suburbio Oeste" by connecting its
distribution network with a main transmission pipe on 23rd Street and
Rosendo Aviles.  This pipe has a total length of 100 meters and a
diameter of 600 mm.
Reservoir.   This subcomponent would include the construction of the
Tres Cerritos storage tank, with a capacity of 22,000 m3.   Total
storage capacity of the system would be 187,000 m3, which represents
about 26% of the end-of the project production capacity.
Works Supervision.  This subcomponent consists of the supervision of
all  above-mentioned  works and would require about 400 consultant
man-months, of which about 25 man-months are expected to be provided
by international consultants.
House Connection Fund.   This  subcomponent consists of a fund to
assist In the financing of house connections. EMAP-G would add about
136,000 new consumers during project execution. About 80% of these
new consumers (109,000) would request financing.
II. OPERATIONS IMPROVEMENT AND TRAINING
Operations and Maintenance Equipment. This subcomponent consists of
the purchase of spare parts  water quality control laboratory, leak
detection,  communication  ad  topography  equipment;  vehicles  and
micro-computers.
Technical Cooperation and Training. This subcomponent consists of a
5-year program to Improve the operations of E(AP-G and training of
its staff.  The technical assistance and training would be provided
through a twinning operation with an efficiently-run water water com-
pany.   The most probable supplier is the Miami-Dade County Water
Authority. Annex 3A describes in detail this subcomponent.
Meters and Workshop. This subcomponent would replace defective pro-
duction and domestic meters, provide meters for unmetered production



- 19 -
ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 3
and existing unmetered domestic connections and expand the meter
repair workshop, if a study, financed under the project, shows that
this is the least cost solution for EMAP-G.
III.  STUDIES
The studies included in this component are as follows:
Update the Master Plan.   This subcomponent would: (i) update the
existing Master Plan through year 2010; and (ii) define the
least-cost solution to provide potable water for the year 2010 popu-
lation. This subcomponent would require about 140 man-months of con-
sultant services, uf which 40 man-months are expected to be foreign.
Rehabilitate La Lolita Treatment Plant.   This subcomponent consiuts
of two studies: (i) the first study would assist in analyzing alter-
natives to increase water production capacity through rehabilitation
of La Lolita or the drilling of deep wells in the area; and (ii) the
second study would design the least-cost solution defined above.
This subcomponent would require approximately 40 man-mo ths of
consultant services.
Merge or Better Coordinate EMAP-C and EMA-G. This study would review
the present and future sitcation of the water and sewerage companies
in Guayaquil (EMAP-G and EMA-G) and would recommend a concrete action
plan and a timetable to merge or better coordinate efforts of the
companies (Annex 3B).

ECUADOR
SECOND GUAYAQUIL AND GUAYAS PROVINCE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Study to Merge or Coordinate EMAP-G and EMA-G
Suggested Terms of Reference
Introduction
Two separate and independent municipal companies provide water
and sewerage services in Guayaquil: the Municipal Water Supply Company of
Guayaquil (EMAP-G) has the responsibility for water supply service and the
Municipal Sewerage Company of Guayaquil (EMA-G) is in charge of the city's
sewerage.
A feasibility study should be carried out to determine the
advantages and disadvantages of maintaining two separate enterprises and
recommend actions to (a) merge the two entities, if deemed appropriate, or
(b) establish coordination in specific areas to improve efficiency in the
operation of both systems.
This document contains terms of reference for completing the
recommended study.
EMA-G
EMA-G was established in 1967e Its functions include the design,
construction, operation and maintenance of sanitarr sewerage and storm
water drainage.   It also has responsibility for protecting the region's
water resources, controlling water pollution and advancing programs for the
recovery of the Salado estuary area.
EMAP-G
EMAP-G was created in 1970.  The Company supplies potable water
to the city of Guayaquil and towns and rural areas located in Guayas
Province.
Present Situation
- The institutions are independent and autonomous organizations
with their own assets. Their Boards of Directors are chaired by the Mayor
of Guayaquil and, in some positions, are interlocking.



- 25 -
ANNEX 3B
Page 2 of 4
-  200,000 potential consumers exist in Guayaquil.  EMAP-G has
121,000 water connections, while EMA-G has 75,000 sewer connections.
EMAP-G has over 10 employees per thousand connections, while EMA-G has
about 8 employees per thousand connections.
- There is little coordination of the activities of the two
institutions, even though their objectives are very closely related:  the
supply of potable water, the collection of waste water and the conservation
of water resources.
- Mediumr- to long-term planning is done ..ndependently. Design
periods are different.
- Operations and maintenance of the water supply and sewerage
systems are performed independently, with no coordination and with
deficiencies brought about by a lack of financial resources and obsolete
equipment, vehicles and tools.
- Adequate management and planning information systems do not
exist in the institutions nor is there an interchange of operational
information. There is no related use of computer services, except billing,
for the benefit of both the institutions.   There is no coordination to
optimize vehicle fleets, warehouses and repair shops.  Some conversations
have taken place to construct a suitable site for EMAP-G and EMA-G.
-   EMAP-G  bills  and  collects  water  and  sewerage  services.
Sewerage service collections are subsequently transferred to EMA-G.
-    There  are no joint  programs  of  sanitary education  and
community promotion and customer services.
-   A strong labor movement exists in Guayaquil.   EMAP-G is
heavily unionized, perhaps more so than EMA-G.
- EMA-G is currently carrying out a technical assistance program
of institutional development with PAHO/WRO. EMAP-G has relied on ptivate
consultants for the improvement of specific areas in the Company* It has
initiated a process to obtain technical cooperation from Miami-Dade Water
and Sewer Authority Departmento
- Both institutions lack sector specific training programs.
-   EMAP-G and EMA-G both use external loans as part of their
financing: EMA-G from IDB and EMAP-G from the Bank.



- 26 -
ANNEX 3B
Page 3 of 4
Consultancy's Objectives
The consultant should study the present situation of the
Guayaquil water supply and sewerage companies, including their internal
structure and their external relations with the community, the Government
and other related institutions, especially INERHI, IEOS, the Ministries of
Health and Finance, the Mayor's Office in Guayaquil and the Provincial
Government of Guayas.
The consultant should review studies that have been completed for
institutionally strengthening both EMAP-G and EMA-G.
The consultant should study EMAP-G's and EMA-G's development over
the past five years and future developments through 2000.
The consultant should produce a brief document in which he
explains the current and prospective situation and specifies the advantages
and disadvantages, including estimated costs and benefits, for integrating
the two institutions or for maintaining them separately, bearing in mind
technical, political, economic and labor considerations.   The consultant
should recommend a concrete action plan and a timetable to merge or better
coordinate efforts between EMAP-G and EMA-G and among other related
entities.
Priority Areas
Special attention should be paid to:
1. Coordination of EMAP-G and EMA-G at the Board of Directors level.
2. Integration of the planning operations in the medium- and
long-term and coordination of efforts toward an integrated
information system.
3. Joint work for the expansion and support of the consumer
market, tariff studies and recovery of accounts receivable.
Sanitary education and community support.
4. Coordination of training programs and research.
5. Integration of operations and maintenance including improvement
of the central offices, warehouses and repair shops.
6. Joint actions for securing credit and national, local and inter-
national contributions.   Coordination of efforts for obtaining
international technical collaboration, with emphasis on An insti-
tutional development program.
7. Coordination of actions for controlling the quality of the water-
supply sources.



- 27 -
ANNEX 3B
Page 4 of 4
Methodology
EMAP-G and EMA-G authorities agreed that the present situation
should be studied and alternatives proposed that may improve coordination
or merge the two systems.
The consultant should begin with a review of the positions on
merger or tighter coordination with the Mayor, the Presidents of the Boards
of Directors, EMAP-G and EMA-G Managers and the consultants for technical
cooperation for the two companies.
The consultant should work with an ad hoc committee for the
development of activities, comprising EMA-G's Chief of Planning and
EMAP-G's Planning Committee Executive Secretary.
Technical  interviews  shouLd  take  place  with  members  of
Guayaquil's Council, EMAP-G and EMA-G union leaders, the appropriate
national and local institutions, and EMAP-G and EMA-G managers.
The report should be addressed to the Municipal Council and the
Mayor of Guayaquil for their knowledge and final decision.

EMAP-G Actual and Projected Financial Statements
General
1.             EMAP-G's  1984 and 1985 financial statements are audited.
E1AP-G's 1986 results are based on June 1986 unaudited financial statements
extrapolated to December 31, 1986. The auditors qualified their opinion on
fixed assets and inventories.  'Measures to correct these accounting defi-
ciencies are included in EMAP-G's action plan (Annex 12). Financial state-
ments are presented in sucres.  Estimated inflation rates are as follows:
23% - 1986; 20% - 1987 to 1988; 15% - 1989 to 1990; and 10% thereafter.
Based on Government's policy, the sucre is projected to maintain purchasing
power parity with the US dollar. Actual, estimated and projected financial
statements are presented in Attachments 1, 2 and 3.
Revenues
2.         Water tariff revenues are based on continuation of 1.5% monthly
tariff increases through 1986 and newly authorized tariffs effective
January 1987 (25% step increase plus 2% monthly increases through 1988).
For later years, the tariff is expected to be maintained in real terms.
Improved financial performance is predicated on a major connection program
(about 155,000 connections in nine years) to increase the population served
from the present 58% to 81% by 1994. A revolving fund is included in the
project to assist with connections.
3.         Other operating revenues currently represent about 16% of water
tariff revenues and include principally installation and supply rights,
meter sales and meter maintenance fees.   These revenues are projected in
line with the number of new connections (installation and supply rights,
meter sales) and average connections (meter maintenance fees) and with
ivreases in inflation after taking into account a 30% increase in new con-
nection fees beginning 1987.
Operating Costs
4.        Projected personnel costs are based on labor contracts negotiated
in 1986, and in later years adjusted for inflation and 2% ',.a. real term
salary increases.   The total number of employees is projected to remain
constant through 1991 until a ratio of 6.5 employees/1000 connections is
achieved. This ratio is maintained for 1992-1994.
5.           Unaccounted-for water is estimated to remain constant at 52%
through 1987 with phased reductions to 30% by 1994.   A major technical



- 44 -
ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 3
cooperation program is included in the project to address unaccounted-for
water.  Chemical costs are based on 1986 unit costs adjusted for inflation
and devaluation of the sucre for foreign produced chemicals. Power costs
are based on 1986 unit costs adjusted for inflation.   Chemical and power
costs are projected in line with water production requirements.
6.          Material costs are projected on 1986 unit costs adjusted for
inflation and in line with the average number of connections.
7.           Connection costs are projected on December 1986 unit costs
adjusted for inflation and in line with the number of new connections.
8.        Bad debt expenses are projected at 1.5% of water tariff revenues.
9.        Administrative costs are projected to increase with inflation.
10.         Depreciation expense is calculated at a 2.5% rate on revalued
fixed assets.
Non-operating Income
11.        Non-operating income consists principally of a tax on telephone
usage in EMAP-G's service area and miscellaneous municipal taxes.   These
non-operating receipts represented an estimated 15% of operating revenues
in 1985 and are projected to fall to 3% of operating revenues in 1994. Tax
receipts are projected to increase in line with inflation.
Working Capital Requirements and Connection Loans Receivable
12.       Accounts receivable are projected to be reduced from 3.5 months'
sales in 1986 to 3.0 months' sales in 1988. Estimated inventory require-
ments are based on a three months' supply of chemicals and operating and
connection materials.   Other current assets are projected mainly in line
with inflation. Accounts payable are projected to achieve a phased reduc-
tion compatible with inventory levels.   Other liabilities are projected
mainly in line with operating costs.  A program to finance house connec-
tions will be made available through the project. Credit terms would allow
a five year amortization with interest rates set to maintain the value of
the fund in real terms.  Net cash flow requirements for house connections
are included in the projected financial statements.
Debt Service
13.        Debt service is based on outstanding and yet to be contracted
long-term loans. Debt service tables for existing loans are in the Project
File.   New loans include:   (a) BEDE loan for S/.1.9 billion to complete
transmission mains; (b) IBRD loan for US$31 million equivalent for the
projeict; and (c) CDC loan for US$8 million equivalent for the project.

SECOND GUAYAQUIL AND GUAYAS PROVINCE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Economic and Social Analysis
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Marginal Cost Calculations
1.         The internal rate of return (IRR) has been calculated at 14.3%
for the project. Revenues expected to be generated from tariffs effective
as of January 1987 together with January 1987 connection fees have been
used as a minimum measure for economic benefits in the analyses.
2.       Marginal costs over the medium term were calculated at US$0.17/m3
for the project using an 11% discount rate.  All costs are expressed in
December 1986 prices and include engineering and physical contingencies and
are exclusive of taxes and duties.  IRR and AIC calculations and assump-
tions are included in Attachment 1.   Detailed data and other information
are available in the project file.
3.       The results of the analyses are summarized below:
Internal rate of return              -    14.3%
PV of incremental investments        -   43.08 million
PV of incremental operating expenses  -    26.70 million
PV of water billed                   -   336.82 million m3
Marginal cost                            US$0.17/m3

Urban Poverty Impact
5.           By the project closing date (year end 1994) approximately 0.9
million additional people in EMAP-G's service area would benefit from the
project.   About 600,000 of these beneficiaries would be the urban poor
(families earning less than US$155/month). The distribution of population
by income at the beginning and closing of the project is as follows:
(000's)
Poverty Level
Total    Above   At or Below
Existing population with house con.         1,000       850       150
Existing population without house con.        412        -        412
Additional population with house con.         485       291       194
1,897    1,141        756
Income distribution  data  show that  41% of the population in
Guayaquil lives at or below the poverty level.   Based on analysis of
EMAP-G's distribution system by defined areas, only 15% of the existing
population with house connections is at or below the poverty threshold.
All existing population without house connections is also at or below the
poverty level. Additional population served as a result of the project is
assumed to be at the same distribution of the actual population in poverty
and above the poverty line. Study in Project File.
Project cost and Bank Loan funds were assigned to beneficiaries
at or below the poverty level as follows:

Affordability
Charges for minimum consumption and repayment of house connection
fees have been calculated and compared to monthly family income at the
poverty threshold as follows:
US$
House Connection Fee                           180.00
Down Payment (5%)                                9.00
Net to be Financed                    171.00
-----
Monthly Payment (60 months, 8.5% interest)       3.51
Minimum Consumption Charge (15m3/m)              0.25
Total Monthly Charge                    3.76
Family Income at Poverty Threshold             155.00
% Monthly Charge of Family Income                2.4
The total monthly charge of US$3.76 is an acceptable 2.4% of monthly family
income.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR IRR AND AIC CALCULATIONS
1.           Incremental population served includes all additional people
attributable to the project and connected to the system beginning in 1987,
when production from new plants begins to come on stream, extending through
the year 1997.   Incremental population excludes population already con-
nected whose service would be improved.
2.          Incremental number of connections and consumption is based on
SMAP-G's connection program and project implementation schedule, excluding
those connections not attributable to the project. Consumption is based on
historical data.
3.        Revenues include tariff charges and connection fees.  Tariff lev-
els and connection fees are based on authorized January 1987 charges.
4.         Investment includes all project costs, except for studies (1.5%
of project cost), plus complementary works, house connection costs and pri-
vate  urbanization  distribution  systems.    The  revolving  fund  was  not
included in the project cost as it is a financing mechaaism for house con-
nections.   All investment costs include engineering and physical contin-
gencies.
5.          Operating costs include direct and indirect costs for operating
personnel, chemicals, energy and material. Personnel costs were calculated
assuming a gradual decrease in the number of employees/1000 connections to
6.5 as described in the financial assumptions.
6.        Shadow prices are applied only to the unskilled labor portion of
investment and operating costs.  The unskilled labor portion is estimated
at 18% of each of these costs. Foreign exchange is not shadow priced since
Government's policy is aimed at maintaining a real exchange equilibrium
level in relation to the US Dollar. The efficiency wage rate is derived on
the assumption that without the project, an average of about 80% of the
available unskilled labor force in Ecuador is engaged in productive activi-
ties. The market wage rate is assumed to represent the marginal productiv-
ity of labor and the efficiency wage rate (EWR) is estimated at:
EWR - R x P - 0.93 x 0.80 - 0.744
where R is the consumption conversion factor used to convert the opportun-
ity cost of labor into border prices and P is the probability of hiring a
previously employed worker.
