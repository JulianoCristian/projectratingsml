with the provisions
of paragraph
(a)
of Section

of this
Agreement; or
(ii)

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for any expenditure or in any amount not eligible

Page  11
furnished pursuant to paragraph

of this Schedule, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank, deposit into the Special Account
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount

deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has made
such deposit or refund.
 
(b)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in the  Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the
Bank such outstanding amount for crediting to the Loan Account.
