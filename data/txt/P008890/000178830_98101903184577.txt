REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $10 million and a pro-
posed credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $15 million
to the Republic of Turkey for a fruit and vegetable export project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.      In February 1970, the Turkish Government requested Bank Group assis-
tance in financing this project, which forms part of Turkey's export develop-
ment program. The proposed loan and credit, totalling $25 million, would be
the first lending for Turkish fruit and vegetable export development. The
project was appraised in October/November 1970. Negotiations with representa-
tives of the Government and the Agricultural Bank of the Turkish Republic (ABT),
took place in Washington during April 22 - 30, 1971. The Government delegation
was headed by Mr. Ahmet Tufan Gul, Chief Counselor for Economic and Financial
Affairs of the Turkish Embassy, and included Mr. Mutlu, Division Chief of the
State Planning Organization, Mr. Oktar, Research Director of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Mr. Karol, Deputy Director General of the Mlinistry of Village
Affairs, and Mr. Koprululer, Financial Counselor of the Embassy.   The ABT was
represented by its Secretary General, Mr. Parman.
3.      The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to
Turkey as at April 30, 1971:

PART III - THE PROJECT
6.     A report entitled "Turkey - Appraisal of Fruit and Vegetable
Export Project;t (PA-87a, dated May 26, 1971) is attached.
7.     As the main economic activity in Turkey, wlich accounts for
80 percent of exports, agriculture has to be looked to for a continuing
and, where possible, increasing contribution to the balance of payments.
The markets for the traditional export products - cotton, tobacco, hazel-
nuts, raisins and figs - offer only limited prospects for expansion,
and it is therefore on new products that the future growth of exports
should be based. Turkey's second five-year development plan introduced
ambitious targets for the expansion of fruit, vegetable, livestock and
meat production. Market studies have shown that good prospects
exist for increasing exports to European markets of fruit and vegetables,
provided Turkey can meet the needs of these highly selective and com-
petitive markets with regard to quality standards, continuity and timing
of supply and organization of marketing. To achieve this requires
appropriate transport,handling and processing facilities and institu-
tional arrangements.
8.     The project aims at improving various stages involved in the
export of fruit and vegetables, including production, collecting,
grading, packing, marketing and transport. It proposes a ferry ship
system, a completely new mode of transport for Turkey, involving two
ships, about 380 refrigerated trailers and about 100 towing units. It
would also include export handling facilities with a capacity of about
150,000 tons and the development of about 8,000 ha of citrus planta-
tions. The toal cost of the project would be about $h4 million, of
which the Bank/IDA would finance the foreign exchange component amount-
ing to $25 million. Up to $23.8 million would be re-lent through the
Agricultural Bank (ABT) to ferry ship, truck, and export-handling oper-
ators with the assistance of a coordinating unit (Project Unit) in the
newly established Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, as well as
to farmers with the assistance of a Division in the Ministry of Agri-
culture (Citrus Extension Unit). It is estimated that 2000 farmers
would require credit for an average of 4 ha of citrus development each.
Farm size in the area is about 10 ha and the project would encourage
diversity in cropping patterns. A typical sub-loan would amount to
US $1800 per ha and the farmer would contribute about US $360 per ha
for which his own labor could qualify. A large part of the on-farm
citrus development area lies within the area served by the Seyhan Irri-
gation Project financed by Bank loans and IDA credits in 1963 and 1969,
and arrangements will be made for the integrated Seyhan Extension Unit
(also under the Ministry of Agriculture) to provide on-farm development
and part of the extension services within its boundaries.



9.        Turkey's fruit and vegetable net export earnings, aided by the
Project, would grow from about -?o million at present to about $50 million
by 1975. The Project would provide transport facilities for about one
third (100,000 tons) of the projected 1975 market for the main products,
and export handling facilities for about half of this market (150,000 tons).
The on-farm citrus development would provide for groiing domestic needs and
additional exports beginning in 1978. The savings in transport costs, plus
the increase in incomes to farmers and exporters, would result in an economic
return of 27 percent. Estimated financial rates of return for ABT's sub-
borrowers average 20 percent, except for trucking companies for which about
30 percent has been forecast.
10.       Following the general reform in the interest rate structure intro-
duced in Turkey concurrently with the currency devaluation and the stabili-
zation program of August 1970, it was considered desirable that rates applied
to sub-borrowers under the project fit as closely as possible in the pattern
of rates now applicable to similar activities. Consequently ABT's relending
rates to its sub-borrowers would be 8.4 percent for ferry ships, 9.5 percent
for on-farm citrus development and export handling facilities, and 10 percent
for trailers and towing units. Repayments of sub-loans would be over periods
ranging from 5 to 15 years including grace periods, depending on the type of
sub-project being financed.
11.       The Agricultural Bank (ABT) with vwhom the Association concluded a
project agreement under the Intensive Dairy Production Credit (236-TU) in
February 1971, was founded in 1863, and is now the country's second largest
financial institution, holding 25 percent (about $580 million) of all de-
posits in the banking system. Though profit is not its primary objective,
ABT is administered as a profit-making institution, and all profits are re-
invested. The Bank expects to continue to expand its relationship with the
ABT in the coming years. ADT's Projects and Development Loans Departments
have a good record and a staff well trained in banking practices, A second
livestock project through ABT is planned for FY 1972, while the agricultural
credit survey, incorporated in this project, will review and define Turkey's
medium and long-term agricultural credit needs and could lead to Bank assis-
tance to ABT in this general field in addition to present specialized fields,
12.       The balance of the Bank/IDA finance, about $1.2 million, would be
used by the Government to meet the foreign exchange expenditures on training,
technical assistance and the agricultural credit survey.



-
13.     All transportation equipment and export handling facilities would be
procured following international competitive bidding procedures under the
supervision of the Project Unit.   Contracts for refrigerated trailers and
towing units for the various sub-borrowers would be bulked and the success"
ful supplier would be required to set up satisfactory service and spare
parts facilities in Turkish towns selected by the Project Unit.   Because of
the integrated nature of the export handling facilities each such facility
would be procured through a single contract, including civil works, and the
supply, installation and trial running of equipment.   For purposes of bid
comparison local manufacturers would be allowed a 15 percent margin of
preference or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower.   The Bank
and IDA would disburse the full cost of transportation equipment, which is
expected to be supplied by foreign manufacturers, and the foreign exchange
component of the export handling facilities, estimated to average 43 percent
of total cost.
14.     On-farm citrus development would not be suitable for international
competitive bidding, because it consists largely of labor, land preparation,
and the purchase of nursery stock, fencing, fertilizers, and pesticides,
which are readily available through existing commercial channels.   The
Bank and IDA would finance 20 percent, representing the estimated foreign
exchange component, of all ABT sub-loan disbursements for on-farm work.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUI,ENTS AND AUTHORITyr   :
15.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the
Bank, the draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Turkey
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank, the
Association and the Agricultural Bank of the Turkish Republic, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association, and the text of a Resolution approving the loan and the
credit are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
16.     The relending to ABT under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank and the Association is provided for in
Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement and Section 3.01 of the Development
Credit Agreement.   The Subsidiary Loan Agreement would stipulate the
relending rates mentioned in paragraph 11 above; its execution is a
condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan and the IDA credit.

PART V - THE ECONGMY
17.       A report entitled "The Development Prospects of Turkeyt" (EMA-30a,
dated February 1, 1971) which was recently distributed to the Executive
Directors, described Turkey's economic performance and appraised the
country's prospects. Reference is also made to Part V of the President's
Report on an education project, dated May 7, 1971 (No. P-930) which up-
dated the findings of the economic report. A basic data sheet is attached.
18.       If Turkey is to maintain a growth rate of about 7 percent, its
needs for external assistance are likely to be considerable. Debt service
obligations in 1970 were about 19 percent of foreign exchange earnings, in
spite of the highly concessionary terms of aid in the past. In the future
Turkey may have to accept a gradual hardening of terms. In these circum-
stances, Turkey's borrowing capacity will have to be kept under continuing
review. Turkey has a margin for borrowing on conventional terms but should
seek to obtain as much aid as possible on concessionary terms. In the light
of these factors I consider that Turkey is eligible for the Bank and IDA
lending recommended for this project.
PART VI - CCMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
19.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would comply lwith
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association respectively.
PART VII - RECavMENDATION
20.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan
and credit.
