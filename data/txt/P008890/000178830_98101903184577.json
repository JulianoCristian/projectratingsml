It proposes a ferry ship system, a\n            completely new mode of transport for Turkey, involving two\n            ships, about 380 refrigerated trailers and about 100 towing\n            units. It would also include export handling facilities with\n            a capacity of about 150,000 tons and the development of\n            about 8,000 ha of citrus plantations. It is estimated that\n            2000 farmers would require credit for an average of 4 ha of\n            citrus development each. Farm size in the area is about 10\n            ha and the project would encourage diversity in cropping\n            patterns. A typical sub-loan would amount to US$1800 per ha\n            and the farmer would contribute about US$360 per ha for\n            which his own labor could qualify."}, "docdt": "1971-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
