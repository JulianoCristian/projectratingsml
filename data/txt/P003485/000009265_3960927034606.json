"The Nanchang-Jiujiang highway and the\n            Nanchang bridge are part of the plan to fulfill the Jiangxi\n            Provincial Highway Project's objective to provide\n            adequate capacity in one of the most important corridors of\n            Jiangxi Province. The new Nanchang - Jiujiang highway will\n            provide urgently needed expanded capacity in the important\n            transport corridor between the provincial capital, Nanchang,\n            and the inland water port of Jiujiang. The bridge will help\n            channel through traffic from the highway to bypass the\n            already congested Nanchang City. Specific policy,\n            institutional and technological objectives to be addressed\n            by the project will cover the improvement of road planning,\n            preparation of a pavement strengthening and maintenance\n            management program and staff training."}, "docdt": "1989-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
