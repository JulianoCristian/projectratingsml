SUMMAARY
i.        The projeCt proposed for Bank finanicng for-Ms part of a lager
program aimed at resolving the severe transport problems in Caracas, the
densely populated and economically active capital of Venezuela. These
problems are the more difficult because of the city's constricted situ-
ation in a mountain valley.  Tne project is an urban expr-ess-way along thfe
northern side of the valley with connections to the existing city streets.
The urban transportation program is already well advanced arid several olher
expressways have been built, partly with the help of Bank financing; a matjor
study for a rapid transit system (the Caracas Metro) to be coordina ed w.th
the expresswvay systom is now in its final stages.
ii.       The total cost of the project from inception is estimated at
US$119.8 miLlion equivalent. Right of way will cost US$bL.2 million,
construction US$54.7 million and consulting servicos US$4.7 million; an
allowance of US$19.2 million has been made for contingencies.
iii.      The project was initially appraised in 1966, but there were lorg
delays in Government obtaining legislative approval for borrowing for it.,
Because of the urgency of the project, the Government proceeded with part
of the construction.. It is proposed that the Bank would participate only
in expenditures after loan signature which, for the purposes of estimatinig,
was taken as June 1., 1969. The total cost of constructimn works and con-
sulting services rermiaining at that time is estimated at US$h3.2 million,
of which the foreiga exchange requirement (which is the basis for Bank
financing) is US$20.0 million. The Government is financing all expendituires
before loan sianature and the local cost thereafter.
iv.       Execution of the project is the respmnsibility of the Ministry of
Public Works (IMP) through the Directorate of Transport (DT) which has, with
the assistance of local consultants, designed the expressway and will super-
vise construction. A firm of US consultanlts acceptable to the Bank will
advise the Ministry on supervision; the same firm prepared the feasibility
study for the expressway. The construction contracts in the financing of'
which the Bank will participate have been or will be let on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Construction is expected to be com-
pleted by mid-1973.



V.        This would be the third highway loan to Venezuela. A loan for
US$45 million was made in 1961 for two expressways near Caracas and this
project was satisfactorily completed. The second loan for US$30 million
was made in 1964 for two trunk highways in southeast Venezuela and two
urban expressways in Caracas; this project is 95% complete but is behind
schedule. Costs for one of the trunk highways have been much higher tharL
anticipated, largely due to unforeseen technical problems. No similar
problams are anticipated for the proposed project.
vi.       The main benefit of the project will be the alleviation of tral'-
fic congestion in Caracas. The investment will yield a return estimated
at 13  and is econorically justified.
vii.      The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$20.0 miLLion.  On country. economic groundi:a term- of 20 vears. inclhdiLng
a 41*-year grae: period, would be appropriate.

APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD HIGI-WAY PROJECT
1. IINTRODUCTION
1.01      The Goverrment of Venezuela has requested Bank financial assist-
ance for a project consisting of (a) the completion of the construction
of an urban expressway 21.5 km long on the outskirts of the city of Caracas
including accesses and the reconstruction of the Avenida El Panteon, and
(b) consulting services for assisting the Government in carrying out the
project.
1.02      The Bank has made two loans to Venezuela for highway works.  The
first loan (No. 306--VE) was granted in December 1961 and provided, US$45
million equivalent towards the cost of constructing two sections of ex-
pressway totalling 94 km (Coche-Tejerias, 59 km and Valencia-Puerto Cabello,
35 km). The two expresswavs were completed satisfactorilv and oDened to
traffic in 1965; present daily traffic volumes are about 10,200 and 4,80C
vehicles resnectivp[vl.  The Rank agreed to use savings on the loan account
to finance the fore,ign exchange cost of extending the Valencia-Puerto
Gabello expnressway and an access roadi to the Glc-he-Teierias exnressway;
these works were completed in early 1968. The second loan. (No. 390-VE)
was gran+ed in Avugtmi  1QJ1 and provrided US$30 million eqAivalent for con-
structing or improvLng two trunk h-ighways in southwest Venezuela (Barinas-
La Pe--ra   205 .km iv  La P-arera=Sar. G        130 km) and two M rcan
expressways in and near the city of Caracas (La Arana-Puente Mohedano,
3.8 k  and ra Arana- u+-p-s+n del 7, 11  4 .I). *Ti.s pro,,ect is now

2. BACKGROUND
A. Geography and Population
2.01      Venezuela, with an area of about 910,000 km2, is larger than
Texas and twice the size of Spain. The plains of the Orinoco River and
its tributaries run roughly west to east in the middle of the country,
separating the rolling hills to the south from the mountainous spur of
the Andes which runs almost parallel to the Caribbean coastline in the
north. The climate of the Orinoco basin and the areas south of it is
tropical with heavy rainfall, while the north is generally drier and
more temperate.
2.02      Venezuela's population is estimated at about 9 million and is
increasing at the rapid rate of about 3.5% a year. Over 85% of the peo-
nle live in the uDland northern belt and over half of these in the nine
largest urban centers. Caracas, the capital, has a population of about
2 million.
2.03      The most jimnortant scptnr of thA Vpnezuplan econorv is netro-
leum which contributes about 26% of the gross domestic product (GDP),
Tr1th, mrn1lf'art11-rwn (15)  om-c  (16t)  services (25%), agriculturA
(8%) and others (10%). Although it produces only one-twelfth of GDP,
na-rieir.iI+ r  .npr%lmry almync+t nn.mird of the r%vP +.ho       GDP
at constant market prices, increased at about 5% a year durirng the last
fivTe years anrd reached Bs 42 millionn in 1967 (UsT9 b±llion eqnlvalent).
Per capita income amounts to about Bs 3,600 (US$800 equivalent).

metropolitan area of Caracas where the combination of the heavy concentration
of commercial, Governmient an.d industr-ial acti-vity, the elon,gated configu-
ration of the city, and the limitation of space, has led to badly con-
gestued taL.Li.c condiUtionrs.  Tli probiem  is being UackleU tIhUroug  t,,
planned construction of an expressway system which started early in the
sixties and of which the proposed project forms a part.   A rapid transit
system, which will complement the expressways, is also being planned.
All transportation planning for metropolitan Caracas is coordinated by
the Executive Committee for Transportation in the Metropolitan Caracas
Area (para. 3.17).

2.06      The country's hIghway network in lQAR consis+d rf ovr 37,5oo

-InI 1967, Venezuela had about        iLLJI.J VVc.LU     wrhi v4es, of which
190,000 were trucks and buses (see Table 2). About 200,000 vehicles, or

last ten years, the vehicle fleet has grown by 9% a year, passenger cars
by l0,8 and trucks by 7%. Trle ratio of population to motor vehicles is
about 14 to 1, comparable to Argentina and better than the ratio for Spairl.
2.08     'The highway transport industry in Venezuela is free of all Gov-
ernmental regulation, except for the requirement to pay license fees.
There is no regulation of routes or tariffs. About 7053 of the trucks are
operated yr organized enterprises which face stiff competition frora the
owner-drivers who operate the remainder. Inter-urban bus services are
mostly provided by co-operatives ow¢ning a few buses each.
c. RaiL Transport
2.09      Vienezuela has now only one rai:Lway Line in operation.  This is
the 174 km Puerto Cabello-Barquisimeto line constructed about ten years
ago, which was to have been the beginning of a national railway network:;
the idea has since been abandoned and there are no present plans to ex-
tend the system. The line carries about 80,000 tons of bulk traffic,
most of which is for the Petrochemical Institute which has plants near
Puerto Cabello. The railway is managed by the autonomous Railway Insti-
tute, under the Ministry of Communications. Since 1965, three other old-
er lines totalling about 320 km, all separate lines unconnected with
each other, have been abandoned owing to lack of traffic.
d. Air Transport
2.10      Internal air transport is relatively well developed.   There a7re
two international airports and five other major airports which together
handle roughly one million passengers a year and some 35,000 tons of car-
go, mainly beef from the southern part of the country. Internal traffic
is shared by two a:Lrlines, one privately owned and the other Government
owned. External services are provided by a number of international air-
lines, including VIASA, a Venezuelan airline.



e. Coastal and Inland ShipPing
2.11       Deep-draft shipping channels are maintained in Lake lMaracaibo for
oil tankers; and in the lower Orinoco River for iron ore and other bulk car-
riers, engELaged in international trade. Onlv a small volume of domestic
traffic is carried by coastal and inland shipping.
C.  Transport Coorcination>
2.12       The Directorate of Transport in the liUnistry of Public Works (MOP)
is nominally in ov.erall charge of the Advelopment of all modes of trar.sport
in Venezuela, but the railways are run by the Railway Institute, the ports
by the i;2ti.0nal Port Ser. ces Ad iflsl       arm the a+wai nnad *w-. aterways by
the National Canals Institute.    However, owing to the predominance of high-
waysrc in t.>.e- intr.a trasp.+            IT------ of ~ 5enzlA and   -0e  C)o rol  o

Of +he 1vMP which alsso 1 ooks after norts. airports. hydraulic works and

highways.
3.03      The present staff of the DT is generally competent and experienced
in hLandlig all aspects of highway works. in additioon to professionl
training recei'ved in Venezuela, most of the senior staff members have at-
tended engti- neerig courses abroad.
B. Hkhwda Bg ine ring
3.041      ne Manistry of Public WNorks has recently revised highway design
standards and these conform with modern engineering practice.
3.05      Until a few years ago, most of the design and supervisory work on
roads, bridges and tunnels was done for the Government by local consulting
engineers and the DT maintained only a small experienced staff for super-
vising and coordinating the consultants' work. During the past few years,
however, the technical staff of the DT has been greatly increased and is able
to undertake much more of the design and supervisory work.
3.06      As a result of the earlier policy of usming outside engineers for
highway design work, a large number of local consulting firms has been
established. These firms are usuallyhighlyspeqialized& (in soil investitations,
highway design and structures) though limited in staff and capacity; the;y
produce some excellent engineering designs.
3.07      A major p:roblem facing the DT is the nded for enforcement'
of vehicle weight reagulations.  Studies prepared by MOP and its consultants
MNW have shown that the gross overloading of vehicles is damaging the high-
way network and unduly increasing the maintenance expenditures. MOP has



prepared a program for enforcement including the installation of a number
of permanent and mobile weighing stations, and plans to carry it out on a
systematic basis. During loan negotiations assurances were obtained from
the Government that adequate measures will be taken for the enforcemnent of
weight control regulations.
C. H hway Construction
3.08      Miost highway construction work is directly under MDP which also
coordinates minor construction programs of feeder or local roads carried
out by the Iinistry of Agriculture, the National Agrarian lnstitute, the
local authorities and private companies.
3.09      Ihe quality of highway construction is generally satisfactory.
Construction works are undertak6n by unit price contradts -isual2y awarded
through domestic competitive bidding.
3.10      The local construction industry is capable of handling large scale
highway works and is well organized. However, local firms specialize in dif-
ferent aspects of highway constructiaa (earthworks, base and pavement or
structures), and prefer, therefore, contracts by type of work instead of
complete sections of road. Occasionally they grnup themselves for carrying
out complete sections of road under one single contract. In view of the
large number of firms, MOP normally requires prequalification and then
invites selected firms to bid.
3.11      There is no restriction on foreign firms submitting bids, but they
have to register in Venezuela. No difficulty in registration has been ex-
perienced by competent applicants. The presence of well equipped and com-
petent domestic contractors has resulted in keen competition and the parti-
cipation of foreign contractors in highway construction works has been
mainly by joint ventures with Venezuelan firms.
3.12      Eccept fcr light trucks and vehicles, which are assembled in
Venezuela, all heauy construction equipment is imported and there are no
import duties on such equipment. The Government permits import of con-
tractorsl equipment recuired for tlle construction of roads and has agreed
during loan negotiations to facilitate its re-export after completion of
the works.
De Highway   hintenn ce
3a 3      1I)P, throligh its !hintenance Division,; is directly resrcnsible for
the maintenance of the National Highway System (about 19,000 km); maintenance
of the remainder (18,500 kin) im b  the Ministry of Agriculture; the National
Agrarian Institute and the States (all assisted by MOP) and by private com-
panies   Routine maintenance is carried oLit. by the Government's oni forces
and is satisfactory. The Maintenance Division, which is well organized and
staffed, operates throluh the ten Zone DiTectorates uhich have ia:terna-nce
sections with equipment, repair shops, stocks of spare parts, radio and
telephone coun  i r.ncations, hous-g and ot+her fac;iities.



- 7 -
3.14      In mid-1967, MOP engaged Stevenson, Jordan and Harrison, a US
consulting firm, to prepare a studr of maintenance equipment requiremeats
and make recommendations for the reorganization of warehouses and repair
shops and a training program for supervisors, mechanics and operators.
A pilot maintenance zone is being established in Maracaibo where the recom-
mendations are being implemented; if the operations of this zone are ful:!y
satisfactory, the system will be extended to the remaining nine zones. The
preliminary estimate by the consultants of the amount needed for the renewal
of maintenance equipment is about Bs 52 million (US$11.5 million equivalent)
which would be financed through budgetary appropriations.
3.15      Total maintenance expenditures during the 1962-1968 period are
shown in Table 3.  The average maintenance cost of the National Highway
Network per km/year is about Bs 10.000 (US$2,200 enuivalent) including
depreciation of equipment; roads are maintained to satisfactory standards.
3.16      Assurances xTere obtainen   during loan negotiations that the
Government will crnntinue to maintnin thn national hhwav vsytem adequately.

3.21      Relatively little external financing for highway works has been
prn4d  to VeL1 nezuela.  Tn .i4U) a lo_n  LILuWinL to Uio 6 m ion C.uIV.lt
was made by the U.S. Export-Import Bank for financing the steel structure 
the bridge oover the Orjnoco River.  In, 1961 nd[IU 1964 ALJ BanmK  two loans
totalling US$75 million equivalent for financing the construction of ex-
pressways and trunk highways (para. 1.02). The Baniks role in hignway devei-
opment in Venezuela has been a relatively minor one.
3.22      Highway user charges include fuel taxes, purchase taxes on vehicles,
components and spare parts, license fees and tolls on toll roads and bridges.
Toll charges are generally designed to raise only half the cost of the faci-

cause of the developmental impact of such works; toll facilities include the
Caracas-Vale-ncia, Caracas-La Guaira and Valencia-Puerto Cabello expressways
(totalling about 235 km) and the Lake Maracaibo and River Orinoco bridges.
3.23      Road user contributions in Venezuela total much less than the
costs which could reasonably be alMlocated to the users. In 1964, such
revenues totalled about Bs 100 million and almost covered road maintenance
expenditures; by 1967 these revenues had risen to about Bs 200 million -
rather more than maintenance expenditures, but only about 35 of all high-
way outlays. The Venezuelan Government considers that imposing a higher
level of user charges is unnecessary since there are no competing modes;
it views roads as essential to economic development and consequently to be
financed from general resources. The question of an adequate level of
charges on road users in metropolitan Caracas (where congestion will re-
main a problem) needs to be investigated, especially in the context of the



II. THE PROJECr
A. General Description
4.01      The project consists of:
(i) the completion of the construction of the Cota Mil
exnre,sway. an urban exnresswav about 21.5 km long
adjoiting the northern part of Caracas, together
itrih a conneertinn to the Autonista del Este. about
14 interchanges and 6 km of access roads;
(ii) the assistance of consultants on the supervision
of ths construction of the PmrerqWay;
chargas in metropolitan Caracas; and
(iv) the reconstruction of the Avenida El Panteon.
B. The Cota Ilil Expressway
4.02      The Cota Mil expressway will be a four-lane, limited access divid-
ed highway and is one oI several high-priority projects for relievinL  the
traffic congestion of metropolitan Caracas. It will increase by approxi-
mately 2550 the traffic capacity of the existing east-west urban thruway
system; at its eastern end it will connect with a new expressway being
construction from Petare to Guatire (contracts for the first 5 km section
of this latter expressway have been awarded).  The western end is at the
El Retiro interchange; it is planned that eventually the expressway will
be extended westward to join the existing Caracas-La Guaira highway.
4.03      The proposed expressway is located along the northern slopes of
the Caracas valley where topographical and soil conditions are difficult.
Earthworks are substantial and account for about 40% of the construction
costs; the structural works including four bridges with a total length of
about 400 m. and the 14 interchanges account for a further 40% of costs.
The road wlJl be paved with asphalt concrete on a crushed stone base.
Because of the large quantities involved, the long haul distance (about
15 km) for select and pavement materials and tne problems of construction
close to a congested urban area, the cost of the road construction is high.
4.04      Construction work was started late 1966 and one major access road
1.6 km long and a 3.5 km section of the expressway, which includes four
interchanges, have been completed.  Construction of a fifth interchange will
start shortly. Details of contracts already awarded are shown in Table h.
The Bank wil1, therefore, participate in the financing of the completion of
the construction works comprising 18 km of expressway, 9 interchanges andL
about 4.4 kmn of access roads connecting the interchanges with existing city
streets and avenues (see Map 2). Four of the interchanges will include
connections to streets and avenues planned to be built within the next
five years.

necessary for the diLstribution of the traffic moving to and from the west
end of the Cota l'u"l expressway and is incluued in the project. The Bank
will not, however, participate in its financing, but during Inan 1e-ot` ;ctnons
assurances were obtained from the Government that the right-oo -w,±y brll ie
acquired on time and that the work will be completed by the time of the
opening of the Cota Nil expressway (para. 4.23).
4.06      The design standards for the project expressway (ITable 5) were
prepared by the Ministry of Public Works. They are similar to those used1
for projects under Loans 306-yE anci 39Q--VE and are satisfactory. During
loan negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that these
design standards will be followed.
C. Design and Consulting Services
4.07      The feasibility study for the Cota Mil expressway was prepared by
the consultant MNWr, and detailed engineering has been carried out by MOP as-
sisted by several local consultants. 1WW has reviewed the engineering and
found it satisfactory.
4.o8      The technical competence of the Ministry staff connected with the
design, administration and supervision of highway works is such that fulL tlie
outside consultants are not necessary. However, in order to provide an inde-
pendent check on various aspects of project execution such as bidding proced-
ures, analysis of bids, changes in designs and other engineering matters,
supervision of construction, materials testing, review of loan withdrawal re-
quests, etc., the Government proposes to employ TWM which has been retained
for previous Bank-financed road projects; this is acceptable to the Bank.
During loan negotiations, a preliminary draft contract between the Govern-
ment and the consultants for supervision of construction was reviewed. A
number of points in this draft contract require amendmentg the loan will
not be presented for signature until agreement has been reached on those points.
4.09      The Government will appoint consultants acceptable to the Bank to
carrv out the studv of road user charees in metronolitan Caracas.  The tarms
of reference for th3 study will be agreed with the Bank (see paras. 3.23 and
5.12).
D. Cost Estimates. Financing and Disbursement
4.10      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ll9.8 million
eauivalent and is summarized as follows (Table 6):

Of this the Bank will participate only in the financing of (a) expenditures
for construtction of the Avenida Cota NU±). (excluding right-of-way, lighting
costs and contracts let already following procedures not acceptable to the
Bank) to be made after loan signature. and (b) services provided by foreign

of the Bankl s experience of studies of a similar nature carried out elsewhere.
4.13      A contingency allowance of about 10% of the construction cost has
been Licluded for possible quantity increases.  An additional 1u0% contzLgei3cy
has been included to cover price increases during the four-year construction
4.14      Tne foreign excnange component of construction cost, which the Bank
will finance, is estimated at 45%, taking into account the substantial eLmount
o1 earxtwor ks involved, on which the foreign exchange component is high.  The
estimate is based on the assumption that about one fourth of all the works
would bDe carried ouLt by foreign contractors. Past experience on Bank p:rojects
shows that foreign contractor participation in road works has been limited and
mrainly in jhe form of joint ventures (para. 3.11j.  However, the proposed
changes in contracting arrangements (para. 4.22) are expected to attract more
foreign contractors. The loan will finance the estimated foreign costs indi-
cated above and the actual foreign exchange cost of consulting services.. Any
balance reraining undisbursed in the loan account after completion of the project
will be cancelled.

4.18         Since the pace of disbursement of previous highway loans has beeni
very slow compared with the pnysical progress of the worKs, te possibiI.ty
of introducing more expeditious procedures within the Government for requesting
disbursemlen1t was discussed during loan negotiations. The Government agreed
that it would pursue this matter.
4.19         In view of the urgent need of the expressway for relieving the
traffic congestion in Caracas and of the long delay in obtaining legislative
approval for externml financing, the Government started the construction works
in 1966. 'rhe Bank knew this situation and informed the Government that i.ts
participation would be limited to expenditures to be made after loan signature.
4.20         As mentioned in para. 4.04, construction of the expressway has al-
ready started, and is expected to be completed in mid-1973. Eleven contracts
totalling about US$14.7 million equivalent, or about 32% of the construction
cost of US$4L4.7 million equivalent (excluding contingencies), have been a.ward-
ed for expressway works. Seven of these contracts were awarded under procedures

The Bank will participate in the financing of items 1 (iii) and 2 above
totalling US$34.8 million equivalent.  Apart from certain minor or special-
ized items which may be awarded to local contractors after competitive bid-
ding, the remaining construction on the Cota Mil expressway totalling about
US$29.0 million equivalent will be carried out by contractors under unit
price contracts awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's established procedures.
4.21     In order to encourage the participation of foreign firms, con-
tractors will be invited to prequalify for all remaining expressway works
at one time. This will be repeated annually as long as contracts for prc,-
ject works are still to be awarded.   Prequalification is to be starteC
shortly, but the Government does not intend to award -any further contracts
until after loan signature.
4.22      Die to the specialization of the local construction industry, con-
tracts are usually awarded by type of work (earthworks, base and pavement, or
structures) instead of by section of road including all works (see para.
3.10). Altlough this system is acceptable for very specialized works, e.g.
complicated structures, for normal highway construction work can only be
coordinated effectively and the responsibility for failure and delay defined
if all works in one section are carried out by one main contractor; also
the present system reduces the attractiveness of works to prospective for-
eip,r bidders.  The B.ank has suggested to fMOP that contracts should be ot'
adequate size and should be awarded for complete sections of road, and Oil
that basis the fnllowing schedule of contracts was agreed:

schedule. A formal assurance that funds will be provided for this purpose
will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. Right-of-way

5.01        The rapid growth of the VenezuelaPn eonAmy and of +he vehIcle

v O3       The Caracas valley, in which the city is located, is approximately
25 km long and about 4 km wide at its maximum point.    The population of the
metropoltLar.  area is now about 2 mi.llion and has been growing at about 6"' a
year.  In addition to being the capital of the country, Caracas is the most
inpor tat firancial and commercial center, with a large number of industries
in and around the city.   Consequently it is the nation's most important em-
ploymaent center, providming employment to more than 500,000 persons, or to
over one-fifth of the labor force in the country. Even if efforts being
made to discourage the further setting up of industries in the Caracas
area meet with success, the city's importance will continue to grow. The
Comisiorn Nacional de urbanismo conservatively expects a 3.5% annual grow-th
in population in the future, the same rate of growth as the population of
tile country as a wnole. The actual growth rate is, however, likely to he
closer to 5Az,
5.04 .     At present transportation in the metropolitan area is provided by
900 buses (which carry 800,000 passengers daily), 9,000 taxis (which move
500,000 persons) and more than 150,000 private cars (which make 1.2 million
trips). in addition, about 200,000 trips are made by other means, making



a total of 2.7 mill.ion trips daily. There are three foci areas for traffic:
wie centra]. buszx_essi dis'urict, where nliost, go-verrmient offices are located, a
major shopping and office area east of the business district, and a res-
taurant anci entertainment area further east. Residential developmiient bas
tended to concentrate working and lower middle class housing in the western
part of the city and middle and upper class housing in tne eastern part.
5.05      rene northeastern sector of the city, which would be the most
important part of the city the Cota MU] expressway would serve, has at
present 2F% of the total land area and population of metropolitan Caracas
and generates over 27% of its traffic, most of it to and from the center of
the city along the'east-west thoroughfares. Population in the northeastern
sector is growing f'aster than the metropolitan average and is being acccm-*
modated in large numbers of new apartment blocks, and it is forecast that
in another 10-15 years this sector will have about 28% of the population.
and account for a correspondingly higher proportion of traffic.
5.06      The linear development of the city with several areas of emplcynent
concentration has created a simple but congested east-west traffic pattern.
Transportation on this east-west axis is, at present, mainly provided by
four thoroLghfares, which together in 1968 carried a peak-hour traffic cf
over 12,00C) vehicles in each direction under congested conditions and a
total daily traffic: volume of 150,000 vehicles in each direction on six
week-days. Owing to the three-hour break around mid-day, there are four
peak hours of traff'ic . Further. peakohour traffic ;is only
slightly 'higher  than  the hourly   average  of 13-hou=   traffic between
7 a.m. and 8 p.m., indicating the existence of congestion during most of
these hours. East-west traffic on these thoroughfares is expected to g3
at about 6%? a year in line with Dast experience, reaching a peak-hour
volume in each direction of 13,500 vehicles in 1970 and 15,000 in 1975 and
a daily traffic volume in each direction of 170,000 in 1970 and 225,000 in
1975.
5.07      ]n order to reduce the traffic congestion, the Government has al-
ready improved three of the east-west thoroughfares to accommodate 10,000
vehicles per hour in each directinn at an acceptable level of service and
the other east-west road could accommodate a further 400-.500 vehicles per
hour in each direction at present and 1,800 after some improvements. The
Cota Mil expressway would be a major and much needed addition to these
facilities to tackle the present congestion and to provide relief until a
long-term solution involving construction of a rapid transit system is pro-
vided.  Owing to the topographical res-trictions (which would mean much
higher cost for a larger facility) nnd the limited capacity of streets con-
necting with the expressway, it has been designed Aith four lanes which cO&Eld
Drovide an accentable level of servzice +o 3,000 vr.-.h. in each direction.  .'1
the east-west thoroughfares could, when improved by mid-1973, provide an
acceptable level of servine to about 15,000 v.ph= i'n each direction, compareJ
with the forecast peak-hour traffic of 13,500 in 1970 and 18,000 in 1975.

C. Economic Return
5.08      A principal economic benefit of the project will arise from the
fact that on its completion. it will nermit all vehicles in the east-west
thoroughfare system to operate during the 13 busy hours under normal con-
ditions at. hoht. Ah4 kmt/hr cnmnaer w_+ith nnpration in congested conditions

30%. For eaxample, in the case of passenger cars, comprising over 95% of
the traffic, for an avverage trip of  le k., +the saving is estm.nated at
Bs 1.80 or US$0.40 equivalent. The total of these benefits would be about
increasing to Bs 72 million in 1975. Beyond 1975, in as much as the system

D. Long-Dhrm Solution
5.10      The completion of the Cota Nil expressway will not by itself
provide a :Long-terMn solution to te transportation problems of metropoL'Ltan
Caracas. ]y 1990, the city is expected to have a population in excess of
4 milli on and a labor force of over 1 million and will have to accommodate
some 6 million trips daily. Studies by the Govermnent and its consultarnts
indicate that peak-hour transport capacity requirements on the east-wes1;
axis would approach 25,000 vehicles in 1980 and 32,000 vehicles in 1985,
but the topography of Caracas severely limits the extent of additional
expressway construction that could be undertaken.
5.LL      The Government has set up a special unit in MOP to study the metro-
politan transportation needs, and a scheme for the development of a rapid
transit system in stages has been drawn up and would form an integral part
of an overall plan. The overall transportation plan will be based on the
urban and :Land use planning studies that are being carried out and will cover
new highways, improvements to existing roads and streets, and improvement of
bus and taxi services - all related to each other and to the rapid transit
system with-in the context of the general development of the city.  The pro.-
posed Cota Mil expressway forms an essential part of the long-term tran;-
portation system being planned for metropolitan Caracas and would, in view
of the ant:Lcipated traffic growth, continue to carry substantial volumes of
motor vehicle traffic even after the planned rapid transit system goes into
operation, and even in the event of any changes in the level of user charges
in the future.
