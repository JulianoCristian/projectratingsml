        As set out in the Terms of R.eference, the objectives of this study are to
        provide information that will assist the Government of Venezuela to form-
        ulate and implement a policy of road user charges for Caracas which would:

                                  Encourage an economical distribution of
                                  traffic between available modes of transport
                                  in the urban area.

        and implementable road user charges schemes.            The basic approach
        entailed, firstly, a description and evaluation of the effectiveness of the
        present regime of road user charges in the Caracas Metropolitan Area

and the selection and design of the one most suitable for potential imple-

in the economi_c usage of the CMA road network; and, finally, an evahi.a-
tion of appropriate charges to be levied, the likely economic benefits and
fiscal revenues the proposed scheme would likely generate, and the
scheme's longer-term interaction between charge levels, benefits and
investment levels in the highway system over the period 1971-80.


L 2.1   Present Road User Charges Regime

This initial part of the study called for the collection and analysis of the
data describing the manner in which national and municipal road user
charges are levied in the CMA, and the amounts of fiscal revenue that were
raised from these various charges during the decade 1960-70:                Data was
also obtained for the same period on national and municipal expenditures
to be clearly and separately displayed and analyzed according to outlays
for road construction and improvements, road maintenance and cleaning.
traffic control and highway administration.              Attention was also given to ·
the administrative process for planning and programming investments in
      . h . .    . . t . CMA ( l)                     .
new h ig way proJeC s m      .


With this data in hand, the present road user taxes and charges regime in
the metropolitan area was evaluated    ~;Grimarily        on the basis of the following
criteria:
                                              ·-...'._



                      Economic efficiency - the extent to which payments
                      by road users (i) encourage an economical use of
                      existing transport facilities, and (ii) indicate the
                      need for further investment;

                      Equity 1 - the extent to which payments are equitably
                      distributed among different classes of road users
                      and others; and




(1)     See Appendix 7.




                                     -2-
- --   ---   -------------~-------------------------




                                       Administrative facility - the extent to which
                                       revenue collection is convenient, enforceable
                                       and cheap.

               The application of these criteria indicated weaknesses in all three areas
               covered, especia.lly in that related to economic efficiency.


               1. 2. 2   Identification and Design of Road User Charges Method to Raise
               the Level of Economic Efficiency in the Use of Roads in the CMA

               This second part of the study called for a review of available methods of
               imposing road user charges such that traffic is restrained to a level
               consistent with the optimal economic usage of the road facilities (which
               in theory is obtained when a charge is imposed on road use that approxi-
               mates the sum of the track costs and the congestion costs generated by
               each vehicle type in the traffic stream, i.e. the marginal social cost
               of travel).    Th~   methods identified for pricing road use on this basis
               were systematically appraised against the same criteria as used to appraise
               the existing regime of road user charges: namely, economic efficiency,
               equity and administrative facility.     While the road pricing methods
               appraised were limited to those-feasible to implement in the near future,.
               some attention was given to a longer-term possibility (automatic point
               pricing)(l) likely to be more effective, had the lapsed time for a scheme's
               implementation not been of importance, but into which it would be desir-
               able that the selected method, though more immediately implementable,
               would easily merge.


               The scheme selected as a result of the evaluation process (a simple
               variant of the supplementary licensing of vehicles to permit their entry
               into a designated area, or areas, of the city) next called for the delinea-
               tion of the area, or areas, over which the charge would be levied.       This
               critical task was treated with considerable care.      Though relevant
               traffic data (mentioned in the next section in connection with subsequent




               (1)       For instance, Appendix 9.




                                                     -3-
methodological steps) were made available, resources did not permit the
application of methods to sift systematically through the many possibilities
the CMA offered in order to arrive at the optimal priced area.         Thus
theoretical economic determinants of the size and shape of the priced area
were admitted only indirectly through an evaluation process that appraised
possibilities against a set of criteria using the traffic data in combination
with intelligent application of professional judgment.       This process deter-
mined the central business district (CBD) as the most appropriate area
over which to apply the selected pricing method.


The next step called for an examina,tion of the pricing method's physical,.
administrative and legal feasibilities.         The methodology applied was
essentially empirical in that it required the design, and costing, of the
means for charging users and of the administrative 9rganization necessary'
to put the means into effect; the development of a strategy and program
for implementation; and a careful appraisal of existing legal aspects in
order to identify legal barriers and to suggest possible modifications if
necessary, to laws and regulations to secure conformity.          The resulting
scheme, evaluated against criteria of convenience and administrative
facility, signalled its partial feasibility from the physical, administrative
and legal   standpoints~       The criterion of cost was subsequently introduced
when the scheme's costs were compared with the economic benefits expected
to be generated from its application.


1. 2; 3   Appropriate Charge, Benefits Generated, Revenues Obtained.
and Investment Expenditure Implications

The methodology next evaluated the economic a_nd financial feasibilities of
the scheme.     .This implied, first of all, the identification of the appropriate
charges to be levied on traffic entering the priced area..
                           ~
                                                                 To achieve an
approximation of this charge, the pricing scheme was introduced into a
transport .simulation model replicating 1971 travel demarid and behavior,
in order to evaluate the consequences, in terms of net benefits, i.e., the
difference between economic gains and losses, for CMA travel behavior
of the scheme's application over a range of increasing charges applied in

             Metro (Pro-Patria - Petare) assumed to be in service, as well as
             without it.       The variables of importance in the results that enabled. the
             economic benefits (brought about by these consequences) to be quantified,
             were changes in CMA travel speed, travel mode and travel··distance.

             The charge levels found to be responsible for the higl;lest level of benefits
             generated with the Metro and without it were taken as being the charges
             consistent with the optimal economic usage of the CMA highway network
             as constrained by the maximum potential of the scheme. (l)           For compara-
             tive purposes, the consequences of applying the scheme over the whole
             of the CMA was also studied.


    /   I    The simulation procedure, however, required some considerc;ble ground-

             work to make it operative.        First of all, much traffic data had to be

             of the marginal social costs arising out of the use of roads.        To the

             routes in the study area at different speeds and levels of cong_estion were ..__
             developed.        The analysis procedure disaggregated "these costs into three
        [
             categories: private costs, including fuel and other vehicle operating costs,

    ,I       time costs, and the costs of vehicle depreciation resulting from use, .borne
             directly by those who operate and use road vehicle; track costs, including
             the costs of wear and tear in the road, road cleaning, traffic control and
             all the costs to the road system arising directly from the movement of
             vehicles; and congestion costs, including those costs imposed by vehicle ·
             users upon one another under conditions of congestion.         Environmental
             cost considerations were also given some attention in qualitative terms.

transport simulation model, modifications to travel b·ehavior, such as
route changes and shifts to the public transit mode, (resulting from the
imposition of the range of supplementary licence charges) would show
modifications to travel_speed corresponding to changes in the level of
network congestion.         They also enabled marginal travel-cost results
to be applied to the output of the simulation model for the purpose of
quantifying economic gains and losses in monetary terms as a consequence
of:

                           reduced travel time consumption;
                           reduced vehicle operating costs; and
                           loss of status, privacy, etc. to those required
                           to change mode.

While these three factors are not the only ones to be considered, they
are probably the major ones.          Other factors that the methodology did
not admit for quantification comprise:

                           red1:!_ced air pollution, noise, etc.;
                           effect on road safety;
                           implications for employment patterns;
                           conservation of oil and other finite resources.

Nor was the marginal cost of the track taken into account since travel-
      .             .
dependent costs for wear-and-tear not only are very difficult to identify
but are typically small compared with time-dependent costs for the same
item; while the total of these two was found to be not significant in
proportion to total marginal social costs of travel situations of congested
traffic.       Furthermore, the other components of track costs mentioned
previously, such as those for street lighting and traffic management and
control, were deemed to be non-travel-dependent in the densely developed
CMA.


With the identification of the approximate price level that would maximize
th~       economic potential of the pricing scheme adopted in terms of benefits
derived from the economic usage of the CMA highway system, the method-
ology permitted a crude appraisal of the economic feasibility of the scheme       I

of the following chapter, Chapter 2, which treats its subject matter at the
beginning of the supplem.ent more because it can give the reader early on
a sense of the Caracas transport environment rather thaq because the
components analyzed are used in any activity described soon thereafter.


Thus, for instance, while much of the chapter deals with the existing
transport system, the present use of roads, and the present cost of road
use, the opportunity for applying much of this analytical work does not
come until after the road pricing method has been identified at which point
the results of the work are required (1) to help identify the area over
which supplementary licensing might apply, ( 2) to develop the 1971 transport
simulation model, and (3) to develop the net benefits derived from the
possible imposition of the pricing scheme.

        2.1         PHYSICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

        The particular physical and socio-economic characteristics of the
        Caracas Metropolitan Area (CMA) are by no means irrelevant to an

        those charged with the formulation of transportation policies for the
 I      region.      For this reason, this chapter beRins with an analysis of the
        city's physical setting, its past growth and its present land-use         dis-

        tribution and physical environment.        Also examined are those character-
        istics of present and future population and employment that are closely
        related to travel behavior.
    I

        2. 1. 1     Physical Setting

        Caracas lies in a valley 850 meters above sea level yet is located
        only some eleven kilometers distant from the Caribbean shoreline to
        the north (Figure 2. 1).       Shielding the valley from the sea is the_Sierra
        del Avila,    part of a dominant mountain. range knowri. as the Cordillera
        de la Costa, that rises 2, '765 meters out of the water to reach its
        highest point at Pico Naiguata before dropping steeply down to the
        northern edge of the city.


        Located on the coast are Venezuela's two principal ports: La Guaira,
        its largest general seaport; and Maiquetfa,       its main international air-
        port.     Both of these have access to. the city by way of a four- lane
        ?ivided turnpike', ·the Autopista La Guaira, that winds uphill across
        the Sierra del ·Avila to enter the northwest end of Caracas at Catia.
        This road,     opened in 1954, replaced a less steep but longer two-lane
        road that still carries a considerable amount of commercial traffic.


        The valley of Caraca~,         drained by the Rfo Guaire,   is some 27 kilo-
        meters long stretching from Ant:rmano in the southwest to Petare in
        the east.    To the north, the valley is sharply defined by the Sierra del

      Avila while to the south, steeply rolling topography marks the valley's
      edge more irregularly.      Three subsidiary valleys penetrate the hills
      to the south and south-east.     The most important of these is El Valle,
      pointing south, through which passes the Autopista El Valle,       a freeway
      that continues on to Valencia 150 kilometers to the west.        The other
      two valleys are more shallow and softer in their land formations as
      they approach the 'Colonial settlements of Baruta and El Hatillo in the
      southeast.


      To the west is the short stubby valley of Catia.      This provides the
      most convenient, access to the coast, arid is joined to the main valley
      at a critical point where the latter changes its northeastern alignment
      ~rom      Antfmano to take up its eastern axis towards Petare.    This point
[     of intersection of the two valleys imparts to the site of the city its
      characteristic "Y" configuration; and becaus·e of its natural locational
      advantages,     particularly in terms of accessibility to the region, this
      point of intersection not only marks the place of the original colonial
      settlement, but is today the city's central business district ( C:BD).


      Seasons are more discernable by rainfall thari by temperature. Average
(.
      daily temperatures range between l8°C and 21°C.         Heavy showers
      characterize the months of May to November leaving January to March
      for the dry season;, June has the most rainfall with an average of soine
      125 mm. spread over some eighteen days.


      2. 1. 2     , Past Growth and Present Physical Environ.ment

      The physical development and expansion of Caracas occurred at quite
      a slow rate until the second decade of tl)is century.     The city, for
      instance, on becoming the nation's capital in 1811, though larger, was
      much the same in chara,cter as it was some 250 years earlier when
      founded in 1567.     Nor did the succeeding 100 years witness any radical
      change.      It was in the 1920's that a remar.kable transformation com-
      menced.       This was the decade that saw the city indulge in the riches
      that began to flow from the young oil industry in distant .Maracaibo.



                                            -11-
Its first suburb of affluent mansions, begun at the turn - of the century,
expanded rapidly towards the southwest in El Parafso.           But this break-
away from the strict grid-iron pattern of colonial streets and row
houses firmly switched its .impetus away to the east in the 1930' s
with the coming-of the automobile.         Here the fertile valley of sugar
and coffee provided plentiful space,       and 'its colonial villages of   Chacao~

Los Dos Caminos anq Petare were, by the end of the Second World
War, integral parts of the urbanized area. (Figure 2. 2).


Thus, by 1950 the city's population of 694, 000 was more than six
times larger than it was in 1920; while its share of the nation's total
inhabitants had jumped from 4. 8 percent to 13. 8 percent (Figure 2. 3).
During this period, the developed area of the city increased initially
at a much faster rate than the population, thereby producing that
characteristic drop- in city density that usually accompanies suburban-
ization (Figure 2. 4).      But by 1950 the first indications of a land short-
age began to be f-elt resulting from the steep topography surrounding
the city; and ever since then population density has been steadily ristng.


Much of the city's high-density environment, made up of all tall apart-
ment buildings and office blocks,- is post-1950,        This is the period that
transformed Caracas from a town into a metropolis.            Today, the city
accommodates about one-fifth of Venezuela's ten-million inhabitants,
and produces more than one-quarter of the nation's gross domestic
product.        In 1966 its mean annual household income of Bs 22, 900
($5, 100) was about 70 percent higher than that for the nation as a
whole.     But like that of the nation, much of the wealth of the city is
concentrated in the hands of a minority who live almost exclusively in
the east of the city (Figure 2. 5).


With two million inhabitant's now crowded into some 170 square kilo-
meters     o~    developable land within the city's interconnecting valleys,
the rugged topography along the periphery, though giving the city its
wonderful setting, is working against the easy and efficient urbaniza-
tion of the area.       Competition for land has been growing at an alarming

rate as a result of the fivefold increase in population during the last
25 years   ( 6. 65% annually as against 3. 4% for the nation).   This has
_brought about a marked intensification of land use not only for re-
sidence -- with over 30 percent of the population living in apartment
buildings whereas almost no one knew this style of life at the end of
World War I (Figure 2. 6) -- but also for employment, recreational and
transportation purposes.   Yet in spite of a high density in excess of
15, 000 persons per developed square kilometer the city's transporta-
tion system now relies exclusively on the motor vehicle for moving
its goods and people on a road system consisting of 1, 078 kilometers
of roadway including 69 kilometers of freeway.


But Caracas also reveals other characteristics, less superficial; and
these   mostly arise from the conflict between its high rate of popula-
tion growth and its shortage of developable land .. In general, the re-
development activity that has taken place to overcome this conflict has
prevented the city in recent years from having sufficient stability to
consolidate its social structure and improve its appearance.      Few areas
are free from upheaval as blocks of apartments replace houses, more
ranchos crowd in between those existing, streets are torn up to install
more utilities, and rights-of-way are cleared for extensions to the
freeway system.   As population densities increase, the competition for
land is such that the development of the additional space needed for
public use including parks, schools, highways and the like, fails to
keep pace with demand.     This inevitably causes an erosion of commun-
ity standards and an enormous problem of traffic congestion.       Both of
                                                          '
these ailments are especially prevalent in the older parts of the city,
particularly in the central business district.


On the other hand, high population densities have given the city a
decid_edly urban character over a wide area.     Even upper-income sub-
urban areas like Prados del Este to the southeast _have net population
densities of more than 80 persons per hectare.     However, with lack
of space for physical expansion, this marked urban character changes
at the city's periphery where it gives way sharply to the rugged open

The central business district, or Casco Central as it is often called,
                                                                        .   '   '
is by far the most important employment center in the city.                 Its more
prestigious establishments are concentrated almost exclusively between
Avenida Bolrvar and Avenida Urdaneta in the northern half of the ol<;l
colonial town site.       It is here that the nation's government, financial
and legal institutions are locatecL            It is also the commercial heart of
the city with its many multi-storied offices and retail shops.              There
are no department stores in the CBD; all retailing, as· is the case in
most parts of the city, is done through small outlets usually· found on
the ground floors of office and r.esidential buildings.           Wholesaling estab-
lishments are open to the general public and therefore fall more proper-
ly into the\category of discount houses.             The other part of the CB,D,
lying to the south between Avenida BoUvar and the River Guaire, is
less active largely owing to its poorer accessibility to· the rest of the
city.    This area is characterized· by small ret13.iling, wholesaling and
warehousing facilities, as well as by auto-repair and light manufacturing

center, structured around its main east-to-west street, Avenida
Abraham Lincoln, is about two kilometers long stretching from Plaza

            Venezuela to Chaca'ito.    Chacaito is one of the more important public
            transportation transfer points in the city.   Though narrow relative to
            its length and covering only some 150 hectares (small in comparison
            to the CBD which encompasses some 430 hectares), Sabana Grande's
            easy access to the Autopista del Este to the south and Avenida Liber-
            tador to the north makes it a prime location for both business and re-
            sidence.    Trading to the higher-income families in the east of the city,
            Sabana Grande has' the greatest prestige for shopping in the metropo-
            litan area.    The functional relationship of Sabana Grande to the CBD
            is akin on a very small scale to that between Midtown and Lower
            Manhattan in New York or the West End and the City in London.


            Other main commercial centers are found in the middle-income areas
            of Las Acacias to the south of the CBD and in Bello Monte to the
            south of Sabana Grande; and in the lower-income areas of Catia at
            the west end of the city and in Petare at the east end.      A very sub-
            stantial amount of commerce is also located along the main avenues

                        is in Bello Monte. In addition, there are some 15 to 20 auto-
            mobile-oriented district supermarket centers mostly located in upper-
            income residential zones close to other local shopping facilities.     Five
            public markets function in lower-income areas such as Catia, Chacao
            and Petare.     The main wholesale produce market is in Cache at the
            southern end of El Valle.


            Although Caracas is predominantly an administrative center, its ser-
            vice and manufacturing activities a,ccount for about 30 percent of the
            nation's non-petroleum production.     The availability of skilled labor
            in the city undoubtedly outweighs other locational considerations of
'.
I
I           high land values,    restricted site conditions and often poor local acces-
            sibility.   Most of the city's industries are employment intensive, par-_
            ticularly those located in the CED.    In this part of the city, the garment
            industry is important as well as service industries such as printing,
            equipment repair and other establishments requiring close linkages to
            offices.    In other densely developed parts of the urban area,   such as


                                                -19-
Catia and Chacao, an assortment of back-street manufacturing indus-
tries exist ranging from small artisan establishments to joinery and
metal workshops.


The city's more extensive industries are mainly grouped in two indus-
trial parks, Los Ruices to the east, between Chacao and Petare, and
La Yaguara to the southwest on the road to Antrmano.             A third newly
developed industrial park, La Trinidad, near Baruta to the south is
helping to relieve accommodation pressure.


The nation's largest university, the Universidad Central de Venezuela
with its 30, 000 registered students and 7, 500 staff, located on an im-
pressive publically-owned campus immediately to the southwest of
Sabana Grande, dominates the city's educational institutions.         There
are also four other smaller universities in the city as well as some
30 to 40 technical and commercial schools - - private and public --
that are mostly located in     the~western   half of the city.   Primary and
secondary schools are interwoven into the urban texture with very
little play space available.    Reflecting the family income structure of
the city, most of the private schools are to the east of the city while
the public schools are to the west .


.Administratively, the Caracas Metropolitan Area is dividec;l into two
distinct areas:    the Department of Libertador (one of two departments of
the Federal District) and the Sucre District of Miranda State.          As men-
tioned previously, the latter comprises the eastern sector of the city,
and the former the western sector (Figure 2. 5).        Each of the two areas
has its own urban planning authority.        Recently the Federal District
office assumed the role of coordinating physical planning policies with-
in the Metropolitan Area.      This new arrangement still leaves some
room for jurisdictional conflicts, but to no greater extent than exists
in many large cities in other countries.

     federal government (in addition. to its annual cash grants to the Federal
     District and to the Sucre District via the governor's office of Miranda
     State) channels money in kind· to Caracas to subsidize the inadequate
     funds raised through property taxes and road user charges.

     politan Area bf Caracas ·for the year 1966~ the Oficina Ministerial del
     Transporte made a ground area inventory according to 17 land.;.use

I    tion of these uses in i966 over the .metropolitan area's 31, :200 hectares.
     It· also shows the same uses,                        excluding agricultural and vacant land

        While commerce and services occupy shares, of metropolitan urban

        and coded to 362 traffic zones indicated that 77 percent of the eity' s

                     per 1, 000 inhabitants.

1, 720, 000 population and 78 percent of its rancho inhabitants were
concentrated in the older western sections of the city encompassed by
the Federal District.   The Catia district, for instance, to the west of
the CED housed in 1966 over· 30 percent of the city's population, while
San Mart:rn-Parafso to the southwest and Las Acacias and El Valle to
the south together accounted for almost another 30 percent.       Though
this ·concentration of population is partly a consequence of the inertia
inherent in the development of the city since its foundation,    a major
locational determinant must be accessibility to the very active employ-
ment area comprising the CED around which much of this lower income
population is situated: Obviously, the CED itself would be the best
location for resi_dence from this standpoint, but more profitable com-
mercial and other non-residential uses preempt much of the land
especially in the district's core.    Even so, the CED ?-ccommodated over
five percent of the city's population in 1966.


In the eastern part of the city,. in the Sucre District of Miranda State,
the remainder of the population in 1966 was distributed fairly evenly
over the central valley between Chacaito and Petare.       Closer inspection,
however,   reveals that the population was (and still is) orie0tated around
Avenida Miranda, grouped into a series of densely developed nodes such
as Chacao, Los Palos Grandes and La Carlota.          In the case of Chacao,
gross residential density was as high as 650 persons per hectare; and
has continued to increase since then,       However, it is at the extreme
eastern end of the valley, within the urbanized area surrounding Petare,
that almost one. quarter of the total population of the Sucre    Distr ict.
                                                                      1




reside.    This is the district that is most dominated by squatter set-
tlements housing over 90 percent of its population in ranchp-type
structures.

In view. of the minor proportional shifts of households between income
groups hipothesized for the year f970, as compared with the 1966
distributions,     and the insignifiqrnt change in the mean -household in-
come for the CMA as a whole over the four-year period, the 1966
distribution was considered applicable to 1971 (as well as 1970) for
subsequent transportation analysis work in spite of the fact that it
was known that car ownership had increased in the intervening years.
                                  2
This apparent inconsistency, ( ) had to be accepted in the absence of
alternative .CMA estimates. ( 3 )


The study methodology did not ·call for estimates of 1980 household
incomes.

analytical purposes, it is convenient to group employmem into three

       4

            Table 6. The results of this survey indicate a household income
            distribution mor~ heavily biased to the lower-income levels (with
            the mode occurring in the Bs. 500-1, 000 · group) than the OMT /MOP
            estimates. The mean of Bs. 1, 921. 55 is very close to that esti-
            mated by OMT.

( 2)        It is possible that increased car ownership was achieved during
            the period 1966-1970 partly because of the minor porportional
            shift in the income distribution bringing relatively more people

         from the first daily work-trip end identified in the origin and destination

         16 percent of the city's total employment with close to this percentage
         share in each of the three employment categories.      Though Catia has
         a substantial share of the city's employment opportunities, and has a
         relatively high employment density, the large proportion of the city's
         residential population (30%) that it accommodates results in it being,
         except for Petare in the east, the district least served. by employment
         opportunities.

While Catia and Petare have a lack of employment opportunities and
the Casco Central has an abundance of therri,     it is evident from the
1966 _origin and destination survey that the proportional shares of
total employment in other parts of the city closely resemble their
proportional shares o( population.   Even when analyzed by employment
category, the similarity is striking, not just in the commerce and
services sector, but also in manufacturing.

      into those owning cars (C.O.) and those not owning cars (N.C.O.) on
      the basis of income level using a relationship derived from the 1966

          survey.    Adhering to-the belief of local economic authorities who main-

          other influential variables such as relative car prices and standard of
          public transport service appeared not to have,    in aggregate,   become

Trip production and at traction data were available for 1966 in a usable
format.     These data needed to be updated to 1971 by growth factors
for each district.       Educational and non-educational purpose rates vary
significantly between C.O. and N.c;.o. households (0.3585 and 0.1819
                                                          3
trips per hoµsehold per morning peak hour respectively). ( ) Consequent-
ly', production     growth factors were calculated for each type of house-
hold,   equal to the respective per district growth factors according to
the numbers of C. 0. and N. C. 0. households, established by the initial
analysis described in the previous paragraph.                Because     several and
separate basic data problems made it impossible to calculate educational
trip attraction growth factors to any worthwhile degree of precision,
production growth factors only were used in this cont ext.                   As a result,
the educational trips-end attractions in 1971 match those in 1966.                     This
small source of error in the methodology· is ameliorated somewhat by
the fact that trips attracted to major establishments recently opened, ·
such as the Sim6n Boltvar University,              do not concentrate on the
morniri!5 peak hour.


In contrast, for both attractions and productions of non-educational

          and 1971, possibly even if the mean had not changed, i.e. lbw
          income immigrants could have counterbalanced rising incomes
          of C araquenos of longer standing.

purpose trips (almost exclusively for work), separate growth factors
were established thereby reflecting any differential secular distribu-
tional trends.    Trip production growth factors for C. 0. households
were simply derived by dividing 1971 district C. 0. household totals
by ,the 1966 equivalents.   A pp lying these factors to the 1966 trip
volumes resulted in a total number of C. 0. household                     trips of ·
146, 313 in 1971.    This number was in excess of the estimated 1971
trips attracted from C. 0. households as calculated by multiplying
the 1966 trips attracted to each district from C. 0. households by the
district growth in employment.      That this should be so follows from
the fact that the number of C. 0. households was increasing over the
period.   Thus, these crude C. O. attraction factors were inflated on
a pro-rata basis so as to meet the constraint imposed by the estimated
growth in C. 0. trip productions.


An identical process to that outlined for C. O. household                    non-educa-.
tional trips was followed in the connection of N. C. O. household
non-educational trips.   However,    quite obviously, the attraction growth
factors had to be deflated versus those indi9ated crudely by the district
mark-ups in employment, since the numbers of N. C. 0. households was
relatively in decline.


Goods-Vehicle-Trip Productions and Attractions.                  The basic source of
goods-vehicle-trip data was a survey conducted in 1968. (l)                     This source
was used to develop equations explaining goods-vehicle-trip productions
(assumed to be coincident with attractions) for a typical morning peak
hour using socio-economic· data adjusted to 1968 by interpolation.                       These
equations enabled the development of 1966 trip generation estimates
from each district so that the transport model could be calibrated to
replicate as nearly as possible actual events during that year, as well
as approximate the 1971 situation required for model _application.

2. 2. 1   Highway Network Characteristics

The highway network in Caracas is composed of some 1, 078 kilometers
of roadway of various types occupying approximately 16 percent of the
                                                                       '

facility type for the 1971 existing network as constructed and the 1971

          for instance, are usually assigned more than a single p. c. u.
          depending on their mobility characteristics. The context within
          which vehicles operate, i.e., the characteristics of the road
          system also have a bearing on the p. c. u. weighting allocated
          to a vehicle.

of the highway network included in the 1971 schematic network.         As a
general rule,   all freeways,   arterials and major collectors were in-
cluded as were also some minor collectors and local streets.


Speeds on the highway network vary substantially depending upon the
type of facility,   location within the urban area, functional purpose,
type of adjacent development and traffic density.     In most cases,   speeds
by private automobiles range from a low of 10 kph ·on some segments
within the CBD area to 80 kph or more on outlying freew.ay facilitj_es.
The average speed of automobiles over the entire CMA is 29 kph during
                                                                '·
the peak hour ranging ·from 15 kph in the CBD to upwards of 40 kph
in outlying areas.     The. average speed of buses and por. puestos is 1 7
kph and 22 kph respectively.


The CED,    defined as Districts 1- 21 (Figure 2. 8) for the current study,
contains 68 kilometers of roadway of various types.      Two partially
controlled access facilities,   Avenida E.olfvar in the east-west direction
and Avenida Fuerzas Armadas' in the north-south direction,       divide the
area into four principal quadrants.     The intersection of these two high-
way facilities is a cloverleaf-type interchange in the area of La Hoyada.
The Autopista del Este forms the southern boundary of the CED while
Avenidas San Martrn and Sucre form its western boundary.        Avenida
Urdaneta which cuts across the northern two sectors is the only other
major two-directiOnal arterial facility.    The remainder of the CED
distribution system,    organized on grid system basis, is generally
composed of narrow, one-way streets dating back to the colonial
period.   Most of the narrow streets permit only one lane of traffic
flow often interrupted by loading and unloading activities.    Parking ,
and pedestrian activities cause a high level of interference with traffic
flow.

                        made.        The arterial and major collector systems appear to be generally
                        ample in terms of roadway width and number of travel lanes.             Lane
                        balance, however, is often poor, creating operating conditions that
                        seriously restrict the flow of traffic thereby substantially reducing system··
                        capacity.       Effective controls over operations such as parking, public
                        transport passenger stops, pedestrian movement, intersection movements,
                        . driver regementation, and land-use development, would be likely to
                        increase to varying degrees the capacity of the 'existing system, if imposed
                        more strictly or redesigned to be more effective.         In November 1972,
                        the one-way system of the central business district and its surrounds was
                        $Ubstaritially modified.      At least initially, this seems to have worsened
                        conditions in some important respects regarding overall travel times,
                        although the_ capacity of the system is likely to have been increased.


                         2. 2. 2.    Level and Quality of Public Transport

                        Public transport in Caracas presently comp.rise three modes: bus, por
                        puesto and taxi.(l)       None of-these modes have "reserved-right-of-way"
                        r"°acilities; for instance, no exclusive bus lanes are provided.        The system
                        is largely based upon what one can describe as constrained competition;
                        Basic ground rules are laid down by the Ministry of Communications
                        regarding routes, stops and fares; and, within these constraints, the
                        market mechanism is allowed to equate supply.to demand.


                        Buses are all single-deckers of German, Italian or North American basie
                        design but usually with domesticly-designed and fabricated bodywork.
                                                                                            .   .
                        Most of the older ones comprise lorry chassis supporting bodies _of high
                        passenger capacity.        They leave much to be desired regardin.g comfort.
                        The most usual seatfog capacity is 64; as many as 20 standees are also
                        allowed.       Seats are pitched close together, are often in bad condition,

and those located over wheels are particularly uncomfortable.        More
recently purchased buses are much better.        Thes.e are usually of German
origin and have standard European-styled bodies meeting adequate seating
standards.      On the mechanical side, privately-owned buses seem to be
better cared for than publicly-owned buses but in neither case is the
engine maintenance of high quality as can be seen from the excessive
atmospheric contamination generated by many of the vehicles when
accelerating.


There are two predominantly publicly-owned companies and thes_e tend
to operate the longer distance routes.       One company, EMTSA, runs a
}leet of 220 or so rear-engined Mercedes-Benz buses bought in the mid
1960' s.     These have been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that
by October 1971. only 80 were in service. (l) Already there is talk of
                          2
acquiring 100 new units. ( )  EMTSA charges a flat fare of Bs.0.50
regardless of trip length.      The other predominantly publicly-owned
company, IMTC:- has some 380 buses of which no more than 120 are

wound up.       Its buses are not of any standard type, and are typically in
a very run-down condition.      . Like private companies, IMTC buses
charge Bs. 0. 25.      Fare zones are recognized, and passengers crossing
, boundaries pay an additional Bs. 0. 25.    Like privately-owned buses,
all publicly-owned buses are one-man operated using turnstyles and
fare trays. <4 )

        Private companies, however, operate the majority of bus routes in
        the city.   Normally, a private bus serving a particular route is dis-
        tinguished by its color and the names of destinations painted onto its

        rout.e and appears to vary inversely with iL       Frequencies are generally
        good, and are effectively increased by the overlapping of routes, although
        this is countered to some extent by a practice of splitting one route
        between parallel thoroughfares.        It is pro~able that frequencies of the
        bus service in Caracas are slightly bi;;tter than in most European cities,
    t   but comfort ratings are very low,



II      Often the public or private bus companies do not attempt to schedule
        services.    Operators consider that at present levels of traffic con-

        frequencies at dispatching points since resulting headway intervals

        of an uriofficial por puesto has a set of destination boards any one of
        which can be .attached to the windshield according to his assessment
        of the market situation.       The legalized par puesto industry is organized
        into some 50 "associations" which negotiate with the Ministry of
        Communications route concessions and the permitted number of units
        operating on them. (l)       Many taxis transform themselves to unofficial

 usually production model sedans of U, S. design.               However, Volkswagen

  on most routes.        Generally, tdps of less than four kilometers cost
 Bs. 0. 50.      Longer trips cost Bs .1. 00 and occasionally Bs. 1. 50.

  interests, although pressure from bus interests was relevant here too.
  There was some decline in por puesto patronage and industry capacity

 Taxis operate as nassociations 11 and also individually.            Fares vary
  according to distance and to time of day or night.            The minimum
  daytime fare is usually Bs.3.00;· the maximum is about Bs.9.00 for
  a trip from Catia to Petare.       Taxis are fairly numerous and operate
  much as they do anywhere else.         However, some taxi associations,
  especially those tied to major hotels, limit their services to certain
  passengers     or   to geographical areas or to both.        Some associations
  operate primarily as radio-cabs.·

_Traffic Composition - Vehicles.       Table 2.   4-,.   presents a·summary of
information .developed from the screenline observations regarding the
composition of traffic by vehicle type.       Screenline traffic data combined
for the total Caracas Metropolitan Area indicates little change in
.vehicle composition since 1966.       Screenline data for individual crossing
points indicate changes of up to plus or minus three· percent of the total
flow for some vehicle types (CBD screenline excluded), which may be
interpreted as actual shifts in traffic composition but could also be
attributed to differences in field observation procedures and levels of
accuracy.


The information for each screenline summarized in Table 2. 4. is
graphically illustrated in Figures 2.11 and 2.12.             Figure 2. 4. presents
the results for the west and middle screenlines for two directions of
traffic flow.   Figure 2.12 represents the west, middle and. exter~al CBD
screenlines and includes only the inbound flow of traffic.           Though
absolute numbers have increased, significant changes in traffic compo-
sition by veh:icle type are not evident.

speed-flow relationships discussed later in the report.            The volume
counts were obtained using automatic counters which record the voluI?-e
for 15-minute intervals.      The counters merely record the quantity of
vehicles; they do not distinguish between vehicle types.         The latter is,
done by manual by counting traffic volumes at the screenline crossings.


Data was gathered throu'ghout the CMA area for all hours of the day and
for all days of the week.     These counts were combined with similar
data assembled by OMT staff during 1971 as part of its on-going volume
survey program.      The two sets together produced a wide coverage of
measurements over the major road network within the CMA.              Figure
2. 15 illustrates the locations for which traffic volume information for
1971 was made available along with the actual peak-hour volumes for
a portion of these locations.


The 'traffic volumes, together with the manual screenline classification
                                                  ---.
counts, were used to test the 1971 transportation model developed for
the study.   Using projections of population, land use and economic
activity, a travel volume for 1971 was establis.hed using growth factors
derived from regression analyses and more simple mark-up procedures .

travel volume was assigned to the 1971 transport networks using the
network assignment portion of the transportation model to determine
network loadings.·   These loadings., in terms of vehicles and      pass~n­

gers, were compared with 1971 mechanical volume counts and manual
screenline counts to check the model's validity and to identify necessary
model adjustments.     The reader is referred to Appendix 1 for a de-
tailed description of the development, calibration and testing of the·
transportation model utilized for this study.

 analyzed in a variety of forms to meet specific requirements of several
 study tasks.       One such form was a comparison of the traffic volume
- crossing two seleCted screenlines_ for 196-6, and 1971 to determine the
 magnitude of traffic growth within the CMA during this period.        Table
 2. 7 presents a summary of the number of vehicles crossing the two
 screenlines (BO and BM) for 1966 al1;d 1971.       It indicates a growth in
 traffic volume of 1 7 percent for the area wes~ of the CBD and 38 percent
 for the area east of the CBD, or an average growth of 32 percent ..
. This magnitude of growth in traffic volume is further supported by ari

 2. 3. 3.     Speed-Flow Relationships
 The term "speed-flow relationship' is an abbreviation used to denote
·the points of correspondence between the amount of traffic flowing
 i:i.long a road(~) and the speed at which such tr_affic moves. Traffic
 flow has been found to be best denominated in terms of passenger car
                    4
 units (p. c.u. 's)( ) per unit of time. Typically, each level of flow
 between     ze~o   and the capacity of a road may be associated with two
 speeds.       Thi~ "double-valued" ~elationship with sj)eed occurs because,
 traffic moves at declining speeds as demand builds up from zero until
 a mazimum throughput occurs; then, as demand continues to build up

 (3)        Reasoned judgment would imply that areal speed-flow relation-
            ships shou_ld be more successful in urban studies. However,
            in this study the relationships found acceptable were link-
            specific.

beyond the limit at which it coincides with sucI:i a maximum throughput,
increasing proportions of it go unaccommodated, within a fixed time
interval.   In this state of congestion extra demand decreases both
flow and speed.

It is in this range that the marginal social costs imposed by the presence
of an additional vehicle in the traffic stream are typically very high;
and that a tax on congestion, Le. road pricing, is of rriost value.
Under existing pricing regimes road-users pay only a fraction of these
costs, if at all.


The Procedure Used to Derive the Relationships. (l)             Large amounts
of data were gathered to provide    th~   basis for the derivation of the
speed-flow relationships in Caracas.        In total, travel time data were
collected over more than one half of the major road system in Caracas,
although volume information suitable for correlation with the travel
time data could only be collected for ab0.ut one-sixth of the major road
system.     The "floating car" method of speed measurement was used.
In this procedure data are collected by a driver and ol?server travelling
over predetermined links.     The driver attempts to operate the vehicle
                                     2
at the average speed of the traffic ( ) while the observer- records the
time at which predetermined control points are passed. , Traffic
volume data were collected using mechanical counters set to accumulate
volumes at 15 minute intervals.

the study on the dynamics of traffic in the CMA, three promising

    types .of relationship between speed and flow. which have been used in
    other studies, were exhaustively tested for their applicability to the
    area.


    The three types of relationship which were investigated were: (i) a
    simple linear relationship between speed and flow; (ii)           ~   quadratic
                  .             '

    relationship between speed and flowf and,· (iii) a logistic type of
    relationship.       Of these three, the most appropriate relation was the
    quadratic one.       The linear relationship fitted fairly well, but only
    over a limited range, and had the disadvantage of grossly over-
    estimating the parameters of maximum volume and maximum speed
    unless constraints were superimposed.            The logistic relationship did
    "n9t fit the data very well.


    Figures 2.16 and 2. 17 show in solid line the relationship derived for.
    Caracas for streets of one, two and three effective lanes and for
    .freeways cons.isting of two, three and four effective lanes (in each
    direction).       One essential difference between streets and freeways
    is that the former contain intersections that cause interruptions in flow.
    In. addition, interruptions are caused by vehicles parking or stopping
    for unloading or loading passengers and goods.            These interruptions
    do not generally occur on freeways, and therefore, Jor a given number ·
    of lanes, ·the freeways -have much higher capacity.


    Theoretical arid Practical Speed-Flow Relationships. Although the
    "doubled valued" speed flow relationships could be fairly well
    approxim~ted       mathematically ..: _ for instance, the relationship for a
    three-:.lane uni-directional road in 1971 during the morning peak-hour
                                          2       .
    was calculated to be the quadratic v = 36v - O. 14q, where v = speed
    in kilometers per hour and q       = hourly   flow in p. c. u. 's - - such
    formulations present practical difficulties when incorporated in.to a
-   transport model.        For instance, if a transport model is asked to
    calculate a speed (for use in the determination of modal split and
    of routing patterns) from an initial desired demand in excess of the

"practical" relationship devised as a single-valued piecewise linear

The need to convert theoretical speed-flow relationships into practical
relationships occurs quite generally in transport modelling at present

and denotes effort to make an essentially static structure reflect an
intrinsically dynamic situation.       The need to do so implies a cost in
terms of the degree of satisfaction to which present models simulate
reality; and such a cost is as important in the .context of this study
as elsewhere.      ~lose surveillance of the op~rations of the model
is necessary so as to obviate the possibility of illogical output being
emitted.

( 2)      "Theoretical" is a somewhat sub-optimal adjective in this

          matches abstract expectations.     The relationships are theoreti-
          cal from the standpoint of transport mo.delling as currently
          pursued and, to be utilizable at all, have to .be transformed to
          more practical equivalent.

 Such surveillance would, for instance, correct an error of the
 following type which might otherwise occur due to the usage of
 practical speed-flow relationships:· a road link may be subjected to
 road pricing in the model; this, in turn, may cause some traffic to be
 diverted to another link, maybe qne not subjected to road pricing,·.
 which is already operating on the lower horizontal segment of the
 relevant practical speed-flow relationship from Figures 2. 16 or 2. 17.
 Clearly any such extra traffic added to the existing flow on the latter
 link would have no effect on the speed at which this link would operate
 as estimated from the practical speed-flow relationship (but not from
 the theoretical speed-flow relationship).    Thus, unless corrected
 following detection by close surveillance, it would be implied that the
 cost of running a car along this link would be completely independent,
 of the amount of extra traffic assigned to this link. . (However, if
 traffic should have been subtracted, instead of added to this link, _there
 would come a point at which this complete independence is transformed
 into violent interdependence when the lower, almost vertical, section
 of the practical relationship is first reached).


 Speed-Flow Relationships in Caracas.      There are valid reasons why
 speed-flow relationships which are good representations of traffic and
 road capacity interactance in Caracas could differ from corresponding
 ones in other cities.   Relative to Caracas, conditions generally differ
 in such .relevant respects as road maintenance, size of cars, frequency
 of road intersections and pedestrian crossings, power-weight ratios
 of vehicles, frequency of bus stops, personal travel time valuation,
 degree of adherence of drivers to recommended highway practices,
 and the weather.    Conse-quently, it was considered that speed-flow
 relationships should be developed which have specific relevance to
 Caracas and much effort was allocated to the accomplishment of this
· goal.   The single-valued piecewise relationships,· concluded to be the
 most appropriate for practical application, involve four separate slope
 characteristics: (i) up to a moderate level of flow; speeds and flows
 do not interact and speeds remain constant at a free-flow level;

                 slight rate of change of speed with respect to flow prevails; (iii) at

                 (iii) at yet greater flows, and up to the capacity of the road, a constant
                 and stronger rate of change of speed with respect to flow prevails; ·and
r,,...,.. ....

                 (iv) finally, in the _imaginary range beyond capacity, for reasons of
                 modeling convenience, the aforementioned non-response of speeds to·
                 further changes in flow applies.         Discrete sets of parameter values,
                 applied to traffic flows in each direction, were used to. specify seven
                 different relationships, one each for freeways of two, two-and-a-half,

                 relationships are illustrated by broken lines in Figures 2. 16 and 2. 17.


                 The .general form of the relationships illustrated is somewhat at variance
                 with previous practice which itself has shown considerable variation.
                 In the U.S.A., similar relationships with only one, as opposed to two,
                 negative slope characteristics are popular.          In the U. K., in addition
                 to these, quadratic relationships have been used offering continually

                 contrast, a recent study in Bogota, Coloml?ia, employed a set of areal
                 speed-flow relationships confined to the inner sections of the city.
                 However, in this present study of Caracas, link-specific relationships

As can be seen in subsequent sect ions of this report that explore the
potentiality. of road pricing in Caracas, the configuration of the
relationships adopted influenced many of the estimated ..implications of
this pricing mechanism.     For instance, the steep negatively slope.d
section of the general form in the range of flow just below capacity
(found in both the theoretical and practical speed-flow forms) results
in a sharp rise in the mean traffic speeds in the CBD when this area
is subjected to its first price increment.   Further increments may
remove comparable traffic volumes; but once most of the relevant
link flows ·are ranged within the slightly negatively sloped section such
additional reductions have little effect upon speeds and an even smaller
                                               2
effect upon journey times and cost savings. ( )    This effect, as
simulated by the speed-flow relationships, contributes to the net
disadvantage associated with the raising of CBD supplementary price

levels very much beyond Bs.1. 25 per peak hour.


2. 4. PRESENT COST OF ROAD USE

The cost of road use can be usefully subdivided into three major
categories: private costs which are those borne directly by those·




(1)   Speed-flow relationships is one of several areas of transport
      modeling in which precision has proven incapable of achieve-
      ment because of a large amount of "background noise" affecting
      the interactance.

(2)    With no Metro, CBD mean traffic speeds in a 1971 peak hour
       are·15 kph, 25 kph, 26 1/2 kph, 29 kph and 32 kph for peak
       hour licence charges of Bs. 0. 0, Bs.1. 25, Bs. 2. 50, Bs. 5. 00
       and Bs. 7. 20 respectively.

(3)    The exact slope coefficients are calculated for Caracas con-
       ditions. The generally strong interactance between speed
       and flow near to maximum flow levels has been identified
       elsewhere and conforms to the theoretically specified
       relationships.

who operate and use road vehicles; track costs which are those that
are incurred for road maintenance, traffic control and management,
cleaning and so forth resulting from the vehicular use of road
facilities;    and, thirdly, congestion costs whicg are those imposed
by vehicle users upon one anoth.er under conditions of congestion.
Another cost of road use, certainly felt by communities indirectly,
diffusedly and mostly (at present) in non-quantifiable terms, is the
consequent deterioration of the environment.        This cost, together
with the other three major categories, are reviewed and evaluated
below for the CMA in its present context.


2. 4. l,    Private Costs

Private costs, borne ·directly by those who operate and use road
vehicles, are incurred on two main accounts: the first is due to
vehicle operating costs, and the second arises from the consumption
of travel time by vehicle occupants.


Vehicle Operating Costs.       This section presents the vehicle running
costs for passenger cars, por puestos, buses and trucks as related
to their overall travel speed.     Costs include fuel, tyre wear, repairs
and depreciation.      Overall travel speed is defined as that speed
obtained by dividing the distance travelled in a specific mode between
                                                                        1
any two points by the total elapsed time of travel between the points. ( )
This time includes idle time when the vehicle is stopped,- as may occur
at traffic signals and in traffic jams,      The methodology used in
deriving these costs, and the detailed results are fully discussed in
Appendix 8.       The results were used subsequently in this study to
estimate reductions in motor vehicle running costs obtained from




(1)        Overall travel speed as defined herein thus differs from the
           meaning of the same term elsewhere, where it may denote
           the rate at which one whole journey is made, possibly
           embracing many modes of travel,

 changed traffic flow conditions consequent on the application of a
modified road user charges regime in Caracas incorporating road
 pricing arrangements.


 Vehicle running costs under conditions of ~niform travel speed have
 been developed many times before in past transportation studies.
 What makes the cost developed in this study different is that they are
 for overall travel speed and thereby reflect the traffic conditions
 corresponding to the highly congested urban environment found in the
 Caracas Metropolitan Area. · In contrast, costs based on uniform
 speeds are more appropriate for travel on rural highways or for
. uninterrupted flow on freeways where constant speeds can be maintained
 over long distances.


 Congested conditions cause a vehicle to incur a large number of
 changes in speed.   _Because both vehicle speed and the number and
 magnitude of changes in speed are the prime factors affecting the
 running cost of a road vehicle, this study began with obtaining field
measurements of speed, speed changes, and travel time on a sele-eted
 route system in Caracas.    Calculations of running costs frorri the
speed and speed- change data was accomplished by use of the running
cost tables and the tables giving the cost of speed changes derived in
the United States. (l)   Because these tables state costs, distance,
speed and other relevant data in terms of U.S. monetary and measure-
ment units, the following four basic activities had to be performed:
· (a) convert costs of vehicle fuel, engine oil, and vehicle maintenance
and depreciation to reflect Venezuelan prices;    (b) convert the tables
of running cost and cost of speed changes from U ._S. dollars to bolivares,
and from miles to kilometers; (c) observe actual speed, changes in
speed, and travel times by driving test vehicles over specified routes
 in Caracas; and (d) develop final running-cost tables for Caracas b-y

R.unning costs at overall travel speeds are given for four classes of
vehicles representative of those found in Caracas: passenger car, por
puesto/taxi, bus and truck.     The costs are given for speeds ranging.
from 5 to 100 kph. (l)    For comparison purposes, Column 2 of these
                                                                               . I
tables gives the running cost at uniform speed, i.e., where the
vehicle maintains a constant speed such as may be encountered on
uncongested highways and fr,eeways.        Column 3 of these tables gives
the running cost at the overall travel speed as calculated from the
speed profile data collected during the fiel.d measurements.      Generally,
the costs at overall speed are considerably higher than the costs at
ui;iiform speeds, especially at relatively low speeds.     This is because
low overall travel speeds imply much more stop-and-go driving than
the higher overall travel speeds.    For the passenger car for. example,
the overall travel speed cost at 5 kph is 7 2 percent higher than the cost
at uniform speed.     At 100 kph, the cost at overall speed is only 15
percent higher-.


Column 4 of the tables allows for an adjustment factor to reflect the
judgmental incorporation of factors that could not be quantitatively
introduced in the analysis.    For example, in Table 2. 9     the running
costs of por puestos obtained using field measurements and costs for
uniform speeds of private passenger vehicles, incorporate a 10 percent
increase over the calculated running cost at overall travel speed
(Column 3) to allow for the fact that the average por puesto vehicle is
somewhat heavier than the ave.rage private vehicle; and it was data




(1)       For speeds larger than 100 kph the costs are expected to
          rise again because rolling friction and wind resistance become
          dominant at these higher speeds.

for this average private vehicle that was used to obtain the running
cost at uniform speed.      The same adjustment figure also is used as
an allowance for the much heavier usage of. por puestos as compared
to the average private vehicle.       Column 5 gives the running cost at
overall travel speed including the adjustment made in Column 4.


Vehicle depreciation is included in Column 2.         About 80 percent of the
depreciation cost is attributable to wear-and_.tear due to mileage
driven.      The remaining 20 percent is attributed to time exposure to
the environment.      A straight line depreciation method was used.


The cost of interest in the capital investment in the vehicle was not
included in the depreciation as is sometimes done.         It was treated
separately and is shown in Column 6.          Since no interest can be earned
from this capital, this loss of income is considered as an opportunity
cost.     Interest costs are especially applicable to commercial vehicles
and are properly includ·ed in running costs since they allow for the
fact that decreased traffic congestion and the associated higher oper-
ating speeds of all vehicles   w~ll   increase the utilization of commercial
vehicles.     Thus, a commercial fleet operator will be able to reduce
the size of his fleet, thereby reducing his inventory and the capital
investment.      With private passenger cars, the situation is somewhat
different.     .As further discussed in Appendix 8, the reduction in con-
gestion as caused by road pricing is not expected to change automobile
ownership significantly.     In brief, the reasoning is that, though the
imposition of congestion taxes will cause some people to derive less

use from the,car for the home-to-work·trips, the mere fact that a car
is potentially available for usage is sufficient incentive to maintain
car ownership at its non road pricing level.        With car ownership
constant, the interest cost can be expressed as Bs. 480. 00 per year
as calculated in Table AB-. 2 of Appendix 8, and does not have to be
expressed as a function: of overall travel speed.


The methodology of calculating vehicle operating costs for Caracas




                                       -75-
      conditions by means .of a transformation procedure from costs derived
      for the U.S.A. is admittedly a practical substitute for the more in-
      trinsically desirable solution of directly deri'.'"ing costs from informa-
     - tion collected in Caracas.      This former convenience implies a margin
     - of error, one component of which stems from the differing qualities
      of the road surface and driver behavior which prevail in Caracas
      versus those of more developed lands such as the U.S. A.


      In Caracas the quality of the road surface is allowed to deteriorate by
      the allowance of heavy vehicles to use roads which are not designed
      to accommodate them, the fact that resurfacing is not preceeded by
      the removal of the previous surface which thereby causes manhole
      covers to sink further and further below the running surface, and so
      on.   Bxfra repair and maintenance costs would therefore be occasioned,
      particularly regarding vehicle suspensions, steei'ing mechanisms and
      tire :wear.   Furthermore, though improving_, the lower standards of
     -driver behavior would take their toll on repair bills and further inflate
i·
!
i
      running costs.


      However, the relevance of such considerations to the main objectives
      of the study mai be small: a marginal change in traffic volumes
      would have little effect upon the, probability of the residual traffic
     . being adversely   a~fected   by inadequate road maintenance or erratic
      driver behavior.     There are some instances in which the degree of
      relevance is high, however, for example, when total travel costs are
      quoted, and thus these qualifications should be borne continually in mind ..


      Time Costs.      The values of non-working travel time, which category
      of time is applicable to almost all of the travellers involved during the
      morning peak-hour in a typical city, has been the subject of many
      research studie.s in the U. K., the U.S.A., France, Italy, Australia,
      Japan and possibly elsewhere.        Although there would appear to be
      some consensus regarding the conclusions which have emerged from
      these studies, the statistical methodology upon which the conclusions

                 are based implies that the results obtained should be surrounged by
                 w'ide confidence limits.    This has not always been fully appreciated.


                 In a study of road user charges it may be more prudent to ·select a
                 somewhat conservative" set of travel.:.time values rather than to err
                 possibly on the excessive side, if some degree of uncertainty ·is
                 thought to exist regarding the appropriate range of values.       Too high
                 a set of values, if used in an evaluation, for instance, of road pricing
                 possibilities, would inflate the benefits obtained from increased travel
                 speeds and would also raise unjustly the level of price at which
                 maximum benefits are predicted to occur.          Inflated price levels
                 adopted in the attempt to reap such overestimated benefits could have
                 adverse social and political feedback.      The set of values used in this
                 study is probably more conservative than any used for previous
                 Venezuelan transport .sector projeet appraisals, and would generally
                 be considered to be conservative by New World standards.


                 The purpose, or function, of assigning values to travel time in trans-
                 port studies is twofold; and, it may be argued a different functional
                 set of time valuations could be used for each.       These two sets may be
                 termed (a) behavioral time values, and, (b) resource time values.
                 In the tr. K. the two functions are reflected in different quantitative
                 values.     This is not the practice elsewhere.     For this study the
                 gene.ral convention that the two different uses to which time values are
                 put can be accommodated with only one set of values was followed.


    I            The first function, for which behavioral time values are required, is
I                to assist in the simulation· of travel patterns.     The consumption of
I,               travel time is a component of the relative disutility which a potential
                 traveller places upon each of the mode-and-route combinations which
                 are available to him. (l)    What is releyant to this function is the

amount of money which the traveller personally places upon his time
because the value is required to make .a direct comparis.on between
time and other components of relative disutility, such as        gasoline and
Metro tickets, which are directly traded for money. (l)


The second function of time values is to assist in project appraisals.
However the relevant travel time predictions produced by transport
models for such evaluations derive from the time values as specified
for the first function.    In an evaluation of road pricing potentialities,
this second function has one additional dimension: the most preferred
strategy is endogenously deduced as well as being evaluated relative
to a null situation.    To make this function more J]leaningful would call
for a set of time values which would reflect the valuation which the
comm~nity      at large implicitly or explicitly places upon the time
valuation of each member of the community.          This need bear little
relation to the amount of money which individuals would place upon
thefr own time consumption: for instance, some individuals might
place a relatively low valuation upon money rather than a high valuation
upon time.      This implies that the behavioral, or "first function 11 ,
values might sometimes be excessive when used in an evaluative, or
11
     second function", capacity.   The reverse could also be true.
However, the decision to adopt the same values for both functions in
the study assumed away these welfare implications and may, some
may argue, underestimate to some extent the income distributional
effects.


A distinction needs to be made between the values attached to time




(1)       The time values specified for this first function need not be
          precise reflections of behavior,. although they must not deviate
          too much from such correct values. This is because a model
          can be made to simulate reality by, for instance, using too low
          travel time values in conjunction with too high estimates of ti;me.
          These two wrongs can, quite often, cancel out so as to produce
          a right, although the reliability of the predictions of such a
          model should always be analyzed suspiciously.

 spent in travel during working hours         such as a trip to attend a
 businesE; meeting - - and those attached to travel time spent outside
 working hours, which includes time taken for journey-to-work purposes.
 In this study working time occupied by travelwas taken to be confined
 to operatives of goods vehicles and public transport vehicles.          The
 insignificant proportion of car occupants travelling within their working
 hours during the peak-hour in Caracas, therefore,. was ignored as a
 simplifying assumption.       There is comparatively little argument about
 the principle upon which the valuation of working time should be based,
 and the aforementioned "first function" and "second function" values
 can be reasonably argued to be· coincident.       Economic theory indicates
                                                                  '
 that an   appropri~te   value of an employee's time is reflected by the
 wage rate paid to him plus any consequent overhead payments such as
 social security contributions and accommodation costs which are
 directly incurred by the employer (although greater sophistication may
 sometimes be justly added to this procedure).        Such values (in an
 economy which works in elementary textbook fashion) (1) denote the
 productive capability of the labor involved were it released from'
 traffic congestion for usage else'where.


 For this study, values which were used in the cost-benefit analyses
                        2
 for the Caracas Metro ( ) were adopted, after having first been cor-
 rected so as to incorporate .o'verheads paid by employers.           The re-
 sultant hotirly values were Bs. 8. 0·500, Bs. 8. 0500, and Bs. S. 6250 for
 good~ vehicle crews, for bus operators, ( 3 ) and for por puesto and

Whilst economic theory provides a pr;:i.ctical framework within which
values of working time can be directly derived, it is of no immediate
practical significance with respect to non-working time valuation.
Of the methodologies which are available by means of which non-working
time valuation can be attempted, the most promising and the most .
tried involves the study of personal choice in situations involving the
trading of   mane~   for time, and vice versa.      From such studies,
e.g. of the choice between an array of modal alternatives for travel
between home and place-of-work, statistical procedures of varying
levels of sophistication can be applied in an attempt to yield coefficient
values which can be manipulated so as to produce estimates of implied
time valuation (which are appropriate to the first function of time values
mentioned above but not necessarily to the second).         This approach is
fraught with statistical and other procedural pitfalls but has yielded
estimates of time valuation which, in aggregate, nave been accorded

A 11 of the time values which have been so derived can be criticized,
an_d those which vary too much from the values traditionally believed
to apply frequently are so criticized.         However, some evidence does
exist that time valuation as estimated from these behavioral premises
                                                                      2
varies directly with the income of the subject of the investigation, ( )
and somewhat less evidence exists that the exact form of the relation-

        questioning. Some work in the U. K. is on-going into the
        former, but the latter holds out little chance of success although
        it may be useful as a verification tool.

( 2)    To confer greater e·ase of prediction almost all investigations
        have concentrated upon income-earners. · Normative arguments
       'have been used to accommodate housewives, children, etc.




                                        -80-
ship is more than proportionate.        In the U. K. some thought has been
devoted to the standardization of official policy regarding non-working
time valuation.       It should be useful, therefore, to quote the practices
followed there as being the product of exhaustive sifting of the available
ev.idence.


In the U .X. (behavioral or "first function") non-working time for all
adults in a household is assessed at 25 percent of the hourly wage
rate of the household head (which is equivalent to some 19% of house-
hold income) per hour of travel saved.         This applies to all of those
non-work journey purposes which are significant in most transport
planning studies.       Chil:dren are allowed one-third of the appropriate
adult value.      Evaluation values (the second function referred to above)
are effectively similar although an ayerage income level .is assumed
to apply to all in order that the more affluent do not receive_ any un-
justly favorable treatment in project evaluation (which would infer that
11
     the rich get rich" and ''the poor get poore~ 11 by c'oncentrating invest-
ments in those avenues frequented by the "rich11 ).


What is appropriate in the U. K., however, need not necessar.ily have
much relevance in Caracas or anywhere else.            For instance, it may
be true that many Caraquefios, especially those in the lower income
brackets, are .less l:lkely to feel that their non-working time can be
usefully occupied than U. K. dwellers because of a lower degree of
availability of leisure activities.      This would imply that the values
appropriate in Caracas are less than in the U. K.         On the other hand,
travel conditions in Caracas are often less comfortable than those in
the U. K. and this would infer that travel time values in Caracas are
relatively higher than those in the U. K.       No full empirical study has
been conducted in Venezuela from which guidance can be drawn.


There appears to have been comparatively few transport sector eco-
nomic appraisals in Venezuela which have been framed so that time
valuation is a necessary input.        The values which have been deduced

     One study ( 1 ) had as an objective a compilation of a road user cost manual
     for: Venezuela and argued                   tha~   the values of time for car-owners could be
     estimated at 0. 3 5 of their hourly income.                       This proportion is relatively
     conventional by contemporary standards.                           No equivalent value was sug-
     gested for road users other than car owners.                         It is used by the M. 0. P.
     for the evaluation of the proposed Caracas-Guarenas freeway.                             Another

     to the full wage rate of the travellers concerned.                         This means of eval-
     uation was applied to travellers by all modes.                           It implies time values

                  travel time", so that the average values used in the Metro study
                  would implicitly undercut one-third of the wage rate.     The same
                  consideration could be relevant to the other studie_s cited.

For this study of Caracas road user charges, travel time was valued at
one third of the median hourly income of employed persons in the zone of
origin.     Assuming the typical Caracas household slructure, this implies
that the value of time is equivalent to 19. 2 percent of household income,
coincidentally an almost _identical percenta:ge to that used in the V. K.
Separate values were both calculated and utilized for members of car-:
owning and of non-car-owning households from each zone.              These values
are listed in Table 2. 12 and were used in the transport model when deriving
modal splits at various levels of supplementary licence charge.           The
values are probably somewhat lower than most previously used in Venezuela,
even when travel time is differentiated into in-vehicle and walking/waiting
times.      It is also probably lower than those which would be calculated
from income proportion factors usually used in the U.S. A.            The latter
implication is reasonable in the light of the much higher personal income
levels of the U.S.A. and other considerations.           Caracas incomes are much
closer to those in the U.K. (l) and thus the U.K. may be.a better source
of comparative data in this context."          Nevertheless in any such comparison
ajustments should be made to account for the prevalence of the small pro-
portion of "travel within working hours in a typical Caracas morning peak
hour, the inclusion of school children at the adult valuation rates, and the
fact that 1966 incomes (held by local economists to be identical to 1971 in-
. comes) were used to derive 1971 time values.


The higher valuation of walking and waiting times relative to in-vehicle tii;ne
was explicitly acknowledged as it has a significant affect upon both the
simulation and the evaluation procedures.            A factor of two and one-half
times the values of Table 2· 18 was applied. This factor is commonly used
                                                                        2

could be assessed.


As stated above, time values similar to those derived for their first function
in the transport behavioral model, were employed for their second function
in the evaluation of benefits though with the application of some averaging
to facilitate the benefit calculations.      The resultant values are tabulated
in Appendix 2, Tables A2.1 - A2. 3.


2. 4. 2.   Track Costs
Track costs are required for two purposes in this study.         These are:

           (i)     To act as a component of the marginal social
                   costs which are attributable to vehicle usage
                   and which should be represented in a road charge
                   designed to elicit effici~nt use of a road facility.

           (ii)    To assist in calculations involving the equity of
                   the present system of revenues collected from
                    vehicle owners and users.

These two different purposes necessitate two different definitions of track ·
costs.     The definition of track c"'Osts to meet the needs of purpose (i) is
the monetary value of the resources expended by each marginal change
from the existing situation in vehicle distance travelled so as to maintain
highways at a constant level of quality adequate to meet the demands of
urban vehicular needs.       This definition complies with the short-run margin-
al cost concept of economic science.         It considers, therefore, as irrelevant
all resource consumption that ·is involved in the accommodation of any
vehicles at all;   rather it is concerned with a small change in the current
degree of vehicle accommodation.

      roads and allied services in the U. K. compared with those in Caracas,
      actual charges in Caracas would probably be very much less than this,

However, by Central American standards this estimate does appear to be
exceptionally low: one centimo may be a better estimate. (l)


No attempt was made in this study to cakulate an appropriate short-run
marginal estimate for Caracas conditions.        No cross-sectional data was
available and the time-series data on maintenance expenditures for the ,
      .                  .
Caracas Metropolitan Area exhibits too much extraneous annual variation
to be capable of providing meaningful coefficients.      For instance, in (the
election year of) 1968 Bs. 7m was spent on maintenance, and in 1 !'HlD, only
Bs. 5. 6m.    There was then a jump (to ~'catch up" maybe) to Rs. 8. Dm in
1970.     It could be that the roads in Caracas are under-maintained with th<!
consequent implication that any statistically estimated marginal cost would
be an under-estimate of an ideal value were it developed from time-series
data on maintenance expenditures,


Wear and tear on the road surface may be marginally different for different
categories of vehicle.       Evidence does exist which indicates that repair
costs vary in a highly super-proportionat manner with axle- loadings, although
this may not be wholly true at the marginal level -- it might seem reason-
able. that it .should not be so if the roadway concerned were designed and
constructed to serve all of the categories of vehicle that it does actually
serve in practice.    ·However, some main inter-urban highways in \'enezuela ·
are evidently burdened beyond their designed limits so it might be expected
that many urban roads in Caracas would be similarly situated.        The
suspicion remains that the short-run marginal track costs associated with
heavy goods vehicle and bus usage could exceed those varying with car usage,
and possibly substantially so.


it would appear· that the short-run marginal track costs in Caracas do not
differ significantly from one centimo per vehicle per kilo:rp.eter in general.

heavy vehicles cost very much more.          If this is so, the differential cost
is certainly not reflected in the structure of present fuel duties.         And

Allocation of Total Track Costs.· Appendix All is concerned with the allo:...
.cation of total track costs between the four vehicle types of (private) cars,
por puestos and taxis (PPT), buses and goods vehicles.             In that appendix
the 1970 highway   expend~tures   of Bs. 53, 3 million spent in the CMA on
maintenance, cleansing, ·lighting,· traffic management, and traffic control
for the benefit of vehicular travellers are allocated between these four
categories of vehicle.     The. allocation was somewhat approximative and
relied heavily upon judgment owing to an inadequate data base. (1)


Table 2.13 is a r·epetition of Table All. 3 and summarizes the results
deduced in Appendix 11.


The proportionate allocation of track costs is 0. 6615 to cars, 0.1731 to
PPT, 0. 540 to buses and 0.1114 to goods vehicles.            This compares with
the proportionate allocation of ve.hicle kilometrage in Caracas in 1970,
(which was estimated to have been 3, 426, 600, 000.) of 0. 7302 to cars, 0.1846
to PPT, 0. 0258 to buses and 0. 0594 to goods vehicles.           Thus equating the
costs of a car kilometer with unity; the .costs .of a PPT kilometer were 1. 04,
the costs of a bus kilometer were 2. 3 2 and the costs of a goods vehicle




(1)    For instance, in 1970 cleansing costs for the CMA highway
       system were 191 percent of maintenance costs. In the U. K~·,
       in 1965-66, the equivalent percent was 24, a perhaps more
       plausible figure.  Included items no doubt vary between
       Venezuela and the e. K.    In the former, maintenance may be
       deferred to be reflected later on capital account.

the cost data upon which they were based -- if the maintenance component
of total track costs   budg~t   we re to be erring on the low side, the ratios for

International comparisons are impossible to make with much reliability.
For instance, in the U. K. goods vehicle kilometers on a nation-wide basis
cost 1. 2 times car kilometers. (l)       To compare this with Caracas ratios
is made virtually invalid because of the aforementioned qualificEl;tions
concerning data quality for Caracas, the nation-wide basis for the U. K.
ratio, the high accentuation in the U.    k. on preventive maintenance com-
pared with repair, the difference in goods vehicle sizes and weights, and
the inclusion of additional cost categories in the U. K. data.      In the U.S. A.,
data which extracts capital cost components are unavailable;        nevertheless
nation-wide ratios of betwe.en 1. 05 and 4. 75 are scaled to match small
pick-up truck ranging up to three-axle vehicles.


2. 4. 3   Congestion Costs
In this report congestion costs are defined as the marginal social costs
which a road user forces upon the community by his travel behavior except-
ing those which denote his own resource consumption.          The latter would
          ,
comprise all of the gasoline, oil, servicing, depreciation, tire wear, etc.,
of his own vehicle plus his personal time (if he selects private car travel), ( 2 )
although he may not fully realize just how much these self-inflicted costs
really are.     He also pays a certain amount in taxation, although in Venezuela

(2)       Crude oil is taxed quite heavily at source but such taxation
          can justly be argued to reflect the real value of the oil rather
          than any transfer payment to the government.




                                       -90-
this is a very small amount indeed.        For instance, a Hillman G.T. or
Opel Ascona would pay in fuel duty, in town use, approximately BsO. 0141
per kilometer whilst a small Volkswagen, able to use lower quality petrol
which is much less heavily taxed, would pay only about Bs. 0. 0022 per
.. kilometer.   Though small, fuel duty is the only significant taxation comp-
onent. in vehicle travel at the margin in Venezuela.


In conditions of freely flowing traffic, where no one vehicle impedes any
other vehicle, no one road user costs any other member of the community
(i.e. besides himself) anything at all, assuming away, for the moment, any
 broader environmental impact the use of the vehicle may impose.             To a
first order. of approximation therefore, any Juel duty paid under s1;1ch con-
 ditions is a payment to the community (as represented by its governmental
 authority) for no services rendered.      Assuming conventionally-formulated
 demand relationships, this further implies that too little travel would be
made and that there would be a distortion towards any alternative less heavily
taxed modes, towards shorter trips and so on.         However, it   is~   presumed
that the present minimal degree of imposition of taxation on marginal vehicle
usage in Venezll_ela makes any such distortion wholly insignificant, since
 potential trip-makers must perceive it only very inadequately.


 In conditions when traffic is not freely flowing, the road user would generally
 not be paying (slightly) too much for his travel, but rather too little.      'On
 any particular type of road, traffic can increase up to a certain density
 before vehicles commence to impede each other.          When such impedance
 starts to occur, then congestion can be said to have begun to develop.
 Beyond such critical densities the addition of one extra vehicle to the      tr~ffic

 stream means that extra costs (of extra time consumption, fuel usage,
 engine wear, and so on) are forced upon others rather than simply being
 voluntarily incurred by one's self. (1)      Distortions are generated in the

opposite direction to those which are mentioned above in the connection
of conditions of freely flowing traffic.     These costs forced upon otbers,
i.e. congestion costs, can reach extremely large relative proportions at
slow speeds, more especially so on high capacity facilities;     consequently,
the implied distortions to travel behavior can be correspondingly large.
The rationale for road pricing is that the forcing of each road user to pay
the costs which he inflicts upon others would enable him to make his own
travel decisions in a manner that the community at large would deem to be
devoid of distortion.   He would be presented with a price structure within
the framework of which he would naturally and freely make decisions which
would be optimal from the viewpoint" of the whole community.


The extent to which a road user in Caracas inflicts costs upon other road
users for which he does not pay under the present pricing regime varies
substantially and directly with the amount of traffic attempting to flow along
any particular road in relation to the capacity of that road.    To illustrate
thiS, one can conduct calculations upon a speed-flow relationship specified
for a facility with three lanes available for movement in one direction
(which is shown in Appendix 12, Table Al2. l).


Using cost parameters contained in that appendix it is indicated that under
relatively light traffic, when the flow in one direction is 250 passenger car
units (p.c.u's) per hour, the driver of the aforementioned Hillman G.T.
would be creating congestion costs equal to less than half the amount which
he. would be paying in gasoline taxation.      When the flow has reached 433
p. c. u. 's per hour he would be paying in taxation an amount equal to the
costs which he inflicts upon the rema:lnder of the community of road users
and it could be argued that he is then, and only then, being efficiently taxed
under the current pricing regime.      By the time that the flow has increased
to 1, 000 ·p. c. u. 's per hour he would be costing the rest of the community
some four times the amount which he pays to it.        As the road approaches
its capacity of 2, 400 p.c.u. 's per hour, this factor of four would have grown
to one of 1, 300.

     Over and above the costs which road users inflict upon other road use:rs
     are costs which road users inflict upon occupants of the urban area other
     than road users,     Vehicles emit n.oise and fumes, and cause visual disturb-
     ance and vibrations which detract from the productive efficiency and the
     general well-being of the community.             These are real costs and would be
     included within many interpretations of the encompassment of congestion
     costs.     This may be thought of as being somewhat unfair since more of
     sucl1 costs might/be attributable to each of the first fe"o/ vehicles to travel
     along a road rather than with each of those added to the stream as capacity
      is approached.    This has been shown to be the case with regard to the
                                                                                1

      increasing unitary cost levels.         Thus statements of total congestion cost
      magnitudes are of uncertain relevance, especially beyond the short-term.·
     If one accepts the definition that congestion costs are all costs which road
      users inflict upon other road users by their presence on the road,. then,
      in 1971, in the morning peak hour in Caracas, congestion costs were
      Bs.135, 000, or thereabouts.       About one-third of this sum accumulated in·.
      the central business district (CBD).         A more reasonable measure of the
      costs of congestion in Caracas would be an estimate of the benefits derived
      from the imposition of road pricing in Caracas.

U'sing an approximate and simplistic estimation procedure, the corres-
ponding amount of money paid by morning peak-hour road         user~   was only
some Bs. 5, 000 or so.      This implies, therefore, that morning peak traffic
conditions are costing the community some Bs. 130, 000 per hour largely
because the present road user charges· regime does not encourage road use-rs
to make a rational choice concerning their consumption of travel resources
(including congestion costs) based on payments equivalent to anticipated
marginal costs.     In effect, many road users are receiving a community
"subsidy".


Section 4;.3, and in particular Table 4.4 and Figure 4.7, shows that the
congestion costs created by each p. c. u kilometer vary markedly from area
to area and from road type to road type within Caracas.        The amount of
subsidy shows corresponding variatiOn.        It is not significant in the southerly
outlying area of La California/ El Hatillo whilst a subsidy in excess of a
factor of 100 of the marginal fuel ta'xation is implied in the CBD.      The only
situations in which the present taxation regime achieves reasonable efficiency
in the morning peak hour is on low capacity roads in outlying lower-density,
suburbs.     The reader is referred to Section 4. 3 and to Appendix 12 for a
more detailed presentation of the distribution of morning peak hour congestion
costs in 1971 Caracas.

totalling 8. 4 kilometers, confined to the CBD.      For this circuit an approx-
imate weighted mean speed-flow relationship was derived and used to as-sess
the variability of congestion costs, as incurred per kilometer by a typical
passenger car unit (p. c. u.) on the circuit.    It was assumed that an average
peak-hour combination of traffic flow composition, vehicle occupancy factors,
and persOnal time valuations was applicable to all other times of the day.
Th~   resµlting congestion cost estimates, as a function of traffic flow 1 are
.presented in Table 2.14.

indications which are shown by it are meaningful.         When the traffic
volume is quite low, as it is between the hours of 5:00 a. m. and 6:00 a. m.,
marginal social costs (i.e. congestion costs) are relatively lower still,
 compared to their respective means.          In this range, there is a comparatively
 slight impact of any absolute increment to traffic flow upon the rfse in
· marginal social costs.     An increase in the flow by 343 p. c. u' s ,from the
 early morning level of 333 to the late evening level of 676, is accompanied
by an absolute increase in marginal social costs of Bs. 0. 0493 per p. c. u.
 per kilometer.      In conditions of higher traffic throughput, a greater
 absol~te    increase in marginal social costs (Bs. O. 0528) can be seen to be
generated by an increase in flow of only 90 p.c.u. 's (from the 12.00 -
 13. 00 level to that of between 18. 00 and 19. 00).    Variations in congestion
 costs are highly sensitive to changes in traffic flow in an area as active and
 cramped for road space as the CBD can be appreciated from Figure 2. 18
which is based upon Table 2. 14.


 No adequate data is readily available for other areas of Caracas. --However,
one may anticipate that the lower general intensities of traffic flow in more
 outlying areas compared with the CBD would imply that the corresponding
variation in congestion costs would be relatively smaller.         Road pricing
would tend generally to dampen traffic flows and consequently any given
variation in current congestion costs would be reflected in a less.er variation
of optimal road prices.


 2. 4. 4 Environmental Costs
 The environmental aspects of the present pricing regime are discussed
 more thoroughly in Chapter 4, Section 4. 9, where a review bf the environ-
mental implications of a suggested revised pricing regime provides a more
meaningful opportunity for dealing with the subject matter in a comparative
 rather than an absolute context.     A brief review only is attempted at this
 juncture.


 No extensive atten;pt is made to quantify the various components of environ-
mental disturbance from traffic sources in a generally consistent manner;

and no attempt at all is made to transform quantified measurements into
monetary costs.    The   ~atter   would be a very difficult task given the. present
state of advancement of the relevant arts.       To try to do so could, in the
context of Caracas, produce very_ misleading results,·. more so than in the
                         1

context of northwestern Europe, Australia or North America where most
of the studies of ·the degradation of environmental quality have taken place ..
For example, a shadow cost function for a unit.of nitrogen oxide emission
   .                                                           .               .

calculated for Los Angeles is likely to be too high for reliable application in,
say, Paris where the relevant regulations are less demanding.             In Caracas
few regulations attempting to control the quality of the environmental degrad-
ation associated with vehicle usage exist, and even those which do exist,
such as one limiting the noise emitted from motorcycles, are only inter-
                             .                                     \
mittantly enforced.   A rational interpretation of this status could be that
Caraquefios, in a fast growing city, have to assign higher priorities to other
problems that tend to preempt scarce regulators resources rather to those
problems caused by the intrusion of the motor:- vehicle into their urban
environment.


More attention to the problem will inevitably come with improved ·1evels and
distributions of income and education, further decreases in the quality of the
environment, anc{the more widespread availability of experience and of
simple and durable devices to combat the more se~ious and costly aspects
of environmental pollution generated by the motor vehicle.             However, a
·failure to attend to the problem does not imply in any way the absence of
the economic cost consequences.


Air Pollution.    Air pollution in Caracas derives from a number of sources:
the burning of garbage at the public dumps in Petar.e and Oja de Agua ·at each
end of the city; incinerators in apartment buildings; . diesel exhaust from
buses and trucks; and, perhaps of most importance from the human. health
standpoint, automobile exhaust.

At present there are no controls in force -in Caracas controlling the contamin-
ative quality of vehicle fuel nor the relevant aspects' of the vehicles them-
selves.     Not uncommonly vehicles are badly out of tune, use inappropriate
inferior grades of fuel, (l) or have serious engine deficiencies.     Without
exhaustive quantitave measurements it is not known if the resulting fumes
emitted are merely non-toxic irritants to the eyes (as in the case of diesel
fuel exhaust), or are more harmful to public health. (Z)     Qualitatively,
                       '                               .

there can be little doubt as to the potential dangers inherent in such rampant
pollution, and the car must be a major contributor.


The assessment of costs to society of air pollution from vehicles is in a
primitive state.     The major effects, --as in cigarette smoking, take place
over a long period of time and probably depend on individual dosage
resiliency.     Generally speaking, large concentrations (30 ppm) of carbon
monoxide may impair visual and mental performance, and these amounts
have been observed in heavy urban traffic; hydrocarbons emitted by the
photo-chemical process results in eye and respiratory-tract irritation;
nitrogen oxides can be toxic and cause chronic respiratory disease;      oxidants
are associated with eye irritation, odor and respiratory effects; while lead
compounds can be toxic, but are not known to exist to a harmful degree in
more smog conditions.




(1)       This practice can have an ameliatory effect on the amount
          of lead compounds present in the atmosphere.

  There is no obvious relationship between automobile exhaust pollution and
  road user charges in Caracas.       Higher average charges would probably
  eliminate some of the older cars which may be amongst the worst offenders;
  raising the price of diesel fuel might in the long run encourage more
  polluting gasoline-burning engines; improved traffic flow would result -in
  better fuel consumption (and    h~nce   less pollutants per unit of fuel consumed).
  On the other hand, all of these effects are minor compared to what could
  be accomplished by legislation and regulation, if rigidly enforced.'      Without
  lengthy study, a program for enforcement of prescribed pollution standards
  ,could be established.    However, it would first need to be established what
  values Venezuelan society places upon the beneficial consequences of such
  a program in relation to the extra resource consumption which it would
  entail


  Noise Pollution.   Similar to air pollution, the quantification of noise is
  somewhat inexact, normative, and highly technical, depending on ambient
  noise conditions, spacing df buildings, distance from source, atmospheric
  conditions, and subjective reactions.       The latter are particularly difficult
..__to measure or even to describe.       Some persons are most bothered by high
  pitched noise levels;    others by ·sharp noises; still others by "interruptive"
  noises, such as those produced by horns and some motorcycles.


  In Caracas there is some.thing for everybody ---high ambient noise in con-
  gested areas; deafening diesel exhaust noise; very loud two-cycle Japanese
  motorcycles with insufficient muffling; and eerie musical air horns.          There
  are existing laws designed to control vehicle noise, but they are not enforced.
  The use of horns goes far beyond "informative" purposes.          The musical
  air horns have increased as a fad during the period of the preparation of
  this report.


  The c'oncept of loudness, which takes into account the subjective interpre-
 ..tation of physical sound intensity and frequency spectrum, may well differ
  among societies.    Tolerance is also a matter of conditioning that may occur
  as the average sound level and frequen,cy of loud interruptive noises increases.




                                          -101-
Studies have shown that for noise patterns of certain characteristics, some
persons will be hypersensitive to all noise· stimuli. (l)   A number of factors
enter into the individual's reaction: for instance his feelings about the
necessity or preventability of the noise, his feelings about the importance of
the noise source, the extent to which other thin.gs are disliked in the environ-
ment, and his belief in the effect of noise on general health.


That there is some concern about the increasing noise in Caracas is occasion-
ally voiced in the local newspapers.    This concern is not strong enough to
ensure that the laws controlling vehicle noises are enforced on any permanent
basis.    The introduction of a road user charges regime incorporating the
principles of road pricing could, by redu'cing congestion, el1minate some of
the excessive use of horns, but not all to be sure; but at the same time such
a change might bring about an increase in the bus fleet (to accommodate
erstwhile car occupants) and a concomitant increase in noise from the
diesel motors.    But again, the effects from reduced congestion are probably
minor compared to what can be· accomplished by direct governmental contr6l.
The most valuable research into this area might be a sampling of public
opinion to determine if the population of Caracas wants a quieter city, given
certain restrictions that would have to be plac.ed upon them.


Character of Urban Traffic and Environment.       The one concept which pulls
together the effects of automobile noise and air pollution, as well as other
e·xternal effects of motor vehicles upon society-at-large, might be termed
"loss of social amenity".    It includes such diverse factors as pedestrian
                                                                                   .
inconvenience, loss of business viability, urban decimation from highways,
accidents and driver tension.    Obviously, describing such problems toward
a course of public action leaves much Toom to the imagination.


The degree of pedestrian inconvenience, to take an example, in Caracas is

        striking.     Although one can enjoy considerable freedom in choosing the
        path and timing when crossing streets, the dangers in so doing are every-
        where eminent.       There are few pedestrian underpasses ar;id bridges(l) and
        occasionally no street sidewalks at all.     Walking in any direction, along
        any road, major or minor, entails the crossing of numerous busy thorough-
        fares.      For instance, walking from the fountain at Plaza Venezuela to the
        adjacent Parque Los Caobos is a harrowing experience of conflict with
        rapidly flqwing traffic on the Paseo El Colon that separates the two places.
        Indeed, it is only due to congestion that the crossing of it is possible at all.


        Severe road congestion probably prevents most traffic accidents from being
        serious in Caracas.      But it also is likely to be partly responsible, at least
        indirectly, for the apparent high frequency of such occurrences.        Driver
        tension would seem to be increased because of heavy and unevenly flowing
        _traffic converting otherwise equanimous personalities into agressive
        individuals.     The frequent use of horns, largely out of frustration, is some
        evidence of this.     That Venezuelan magazines and newspapers from time
        to time take to task the motor vehicle as the culprit responsible for much
        of the erosion of the city's social amenities is some evidence of the public's
        awareness of the situation.     If ·it were possible to attach a quantitative cost
        to this social problem perhaps it would receive a higher priority than some
         other considerations of economic growth and free social development.




         (1)     And even such zebra crossings as do exist are unheeded by
                 motorists (and such behavior is accepted as being in the order
                 of things by pedestrians); one cannot even be sure that red
                 lights on traffic controls will halt traffic movement.

                             ON ROAD TRANSPORT



     3.1      . EXPENDITURES 1960-1970

     This section deals with three categories of capital and recurrent expend-
     itures on road transport facilities disbursed by public authorities as well as
     the private sector in the Caracas Metropolitan Area (CMA) during the period
     1960-1970. (1)        The three expenditure categories are composed of:

                   (i)      Road construction and improvements; ·

                   (ii)     Maintenance, cleaning and lighting;

                   (iii)    Traffic management and control.

     Table 3. 1 summarizes these expenditures by category (and subcategory in
     the case of maintenance, cleaning and lighting) at current prices.        Table
     3. 2 gives a rough measure of the total expenditure on road transport
     facilities per registered vehicle (excluding motorcycles and non-motor
                            2
     vehicles) in the CMA ( ) at 1970 prices.   This internal consistency check
     indicates that expenditures per vehicle have been fairly regular at an annual
     average of Bs. 946. 00 per vehicle, though clearly there has been a general
     decline over the period.        This decline is consistent with per capita expend-
       itures in road construction forecasted by the government for the period
                   3

     ( 2)       The annual measures are rough since vehicle registration in the CMA,
[j              at least during the period under study (1960-1970), did not thoroughly
                cover all vehicles whose owners lived in the CMA.     Some of these
                owners registered their vehicles elsewhere. in the country where
                r_egistration fees were cheaper. · It is assumed that the proportion who

in ground transportation facilities comprising both the road and Metro systems,


3. 1. 1.   R.oad Construction and Improvements
Table 3. 3 shows the outlays for major capital improvements in the highway
system in the Caracas Metropolitan Area (CMA) fror:n 1966 to 1970.        Of the
total Bs. l, 084 million spent during the 11-year period, Bs. 870 million, or
80 percent, was invested by the Ministry of Public Works (Ministerio de                         fj
Obras Publicas - MOP) (Bs. 590 million in freeways, Bs. 252 million in
arterial streets and Bs. 29 mil.lion in other roads and bridges).    The remain-                IJ
der was spent by the Federal District and Sucre District municipalities, the
private sector, and the urban redevelopment authority, Centro Sim6n BoUvar,
C. A. (CSB) of which the CSB spent more than a half.      Little significance
should be attached to year-to-year changes in outlay since the data made
available are based on payments made, and not on work done.         In general,
the pattern 6f total expenditures has been irregularly upwards.      The current
level of expenditures, as indicated by projects under construction and their
expected cost and rate of completion, would continue this pattern of increase.


Table 3. 4 shows that the route length of the highway system built by the MOP
in the Federal and Sucre Districts, an area containing the CMA and consider-
ably larger than it, has not increased greatly during the period 1960-1970.
Table 3. 5 iridicates that most of the MOP' s contribution to the system is
paved.     Projects built during the last decade have largely replaced lower
standard facilities.   These projects can be expensive as clearly shown in
Table 3. 6    Avenida Libertador . which replaced Calle La Ltnea, is an
example of this.    This new depressed freeway facility, paid for between
1964 and 1967, cost about Bs. 66 million for property purchase and Bs. 89
million for const'ruction giving a unit cost of Bs. 25 million per kilometer.
Especi'ally in recent years, a large share of total expenditure has been spent
on arterial widening schemes and on the rebuilding and introduction of new
freeway interchanges.     These projects are also costly items.

 is not possible to diffe.rentiate precisely between highway system elements.
 However, it would appear that about 15, percent of the work completed was
                           '
 for interchanges, feeders, and-0verpasses -- projects other than freeways
 and major arteries.


' However, some important new routes have been added to the system.           A venida
 Boyaca, in construction for over ten years along the northern edge of the· city,
 is one of these.   This freeway called for expensive construction methods and
 earth-moving though property acquisition expenditure was not high.       Never-
 theless, the cost to date is estimated as Bs. 400 million giving a _unit cost of
 about Bs.14. 3 million per kilometer (Table 3. 6).     Another new route comp-
 leted in 197.0 is the La Arafia-Caricuao freeway in the southeast of the city.
 This project required some expensive property acquisitions resulting in an
 estimated cost of about Bs. 27 6 million, or Bs. 29 million per kilometer,
 including Bs. 96 million for property acquired.      While the Autopista Puente
 Mohedano-La Arana, constructectin l 968, along the southern boundary of the
 CED, cost Bs. 27 6 million, or Bs. 29 million per kilometer.


 On the other hand, about one-quarter of the total highway construction C?utlays,
 spent by the MOP, municipalities and private developers, falls into the
 minor improvements category.       Some of these outlays were for extensions
 to the local access system in expanding residential areas in the periphery of
 the city., and were undertaken by housing developers, both private and public.
 Extensions to the local system in more central locations are less evident,
 though more costly, and were mostly executed by the municipal authorities or
 by the Centro Sim6n Boli'var, C. A.


 As indicated in Table 3, 7 for 1966, the local street system is greater in
 length than the freeway .and other arterial systems, but the unit cost of these
 streets is very much cheaper than that of freeway and arterial facilities.
 Although most of the length added to the system has been in new local streets,
 low-cost routes are judged to have comprised only a fairly small proportion
 of the cost of construction during this period.   .Even if all the highway

assumption "." - only eight percent of the total of Bs. 1, 084. q million for
highway building by all sectors in the CMA would have been spent in this way.


Table 3. 3 shows that the Ce_ntro Sim6n Bo1 i'.var, C. A., invested some
B.s. 128, 6 :million, or 11. 9 percent of the total spent on highways in the CMA
during the years 1960-1970.            All these funds are shown concentrated over
the years 1961-1964.         Roughly half of this CSB investment (Bs. 66. 3 million)
was expended on Avenida Libertaqor             -~mostly   for right-of-way property
purchase prior to construction of the facility by the MOP; about 38 percent
(Bs. 48. 4 million) on central area street improvements; and the remaining
12 percent on tl;le new Averiida Intercomunal de Antimano in the southwest
of the city.   The CSE has also invested in highway construction and improve-
ments since 1964, such as widening of Avenida Este-Oeste 10 in the central
area, but iliese costs do not appear on the CSB' s highway account records
and are assumed to have been absorbed elsewhere in the             ag~ncy'   s books.


The growth in level of highway coristruction has not been high during the last
decade, as compared with the growth in highway use measured by the increase
in vehicle ownership and vehicle kilometers of travel estimated in Chapter 2
of this supplement.         1n fact, there has been only about a five percent increase
in the length of the system during the last five years.           Nevertheless, though
there is little consensus on how to measu.re overall system capacity, it is
evident that many elements of the city system have experienced capacity
increases.     As the urbaJ'.l area expands, the city's highways are being' upgraded.


The total outlay for highway construction during the last 20 years has been in
the order of two billion bolivares, or Bs.100 million per year at current
prices over the period.        ..The present anriual level of construction is approach-
ing Bs. 150 million.        It is judged that this scale of annual investment at .
present prices, if continued Into the future, would not greatly expand the
system over the next decade, but would be capable of replacing obsolete

     freeway's capacity at a cost of about Bs 25 million.        ·Of course, to continue

     3.1. 2   Maintenance, Cleaning and Lighting·.
     The maintenance; cleaning and lighting costs for the road system in the
     CMA for the years 1969 and 1970 are summarized in Table 3. 8.             Data
     sources, assumptions and resulting costs for the three items, generally
     over the last ten years, are given separately in the subsequent subsec.tions.


     Maintenance Costs.     The maintenance functions for the highway system in
     .the CMA are carried out by the Federal Government and also by the two
     local municipal governments of the Federal District and Sucre District.
     The Federal Government's maintenance work is done by the MOP.                This
     agency builds and   maintai~s   most of the country's arterial highways.         Its
     responsibility encompasses two of the most expensive highway maintenance
     iter:is in the CMA; one is the repaving and general maintenance of urban
     freeways;   and the other is the maintenance of all road bridges.         It does this
     work either by contract or using its own personnel on force account.
     Maintenance of streets and roads· other      th~n   freeways is the resp.onsibility
     of the municipal governments.       In practice, however, the MOP gives .
     considerable assistance to the local governments· because of the limited
     maintenance resources at the municipal level.           An analysis of MOP expend-
     itures on municipal maintenance assistance indicates that the amount of

     work done in this way by the MOP is larger than that effected by the muni-
     cipalities, though such assistance accounts for only about ten percent of the              Ii
     MOP' s total work, including capital expenditure in new highways, within its
     geographical Zone 10.


     Zone 10 is one of a number of zones into which the nation has been divided by
     the MOP's General Directorate of Highways (Dirreccion General de Vialidad)
     for administrative purposes.         The Caracas Metropolitan Area falls into
     this zone.   The zone stretches from the coast in the north to, and beyond
     Los Teques in the s.outh.     It is roughly estimated to contain about one-third
     of the population of the country.       Table 3. 9 shows the total budget for main-
     tenance and new construction in Zone 10 for the last. 13 years which indicates
     that it was spread fairly evenly over the years.


     'I'-he MOP keeps its records of expenditure at an adequate level of dis-
     aggregation for analytical purposes.         Table 3. 10 is a special tabulation
     compiled only for highway maintenance work performed within the CMA by                      \

     the MOP's own Zone 10 staff on force account for the years 1966-1970.
     This table indicates that the level of maintenance in_vestment on this account
     has remained reasonably constant at current prices in spite of growth in
     road mileage and traffic.      The average expenditure for the two-year period,
     1969-1970, amounted to Bs. 3, 072 million as indicated in Table 3.12.


     The MOP also contracts out maintenance work.            The scale of this contract-
     ed work in the CMA, obtained only for 1969 and 1970, called for an exam-
     ination of payments made,       Table 3. 12 shows that the amounts of payments
     varied considerably between these two years giving an annual average of
     Bs.1, 542. 5 million.    However, it is judged that the MOP's outlays for
     highway maintenance contracts increased over the last ten years at roughly
     the same growth rate as did highway construction in the CMA, a rate that
                                                                                            /
     approximates an average annual trend of 3. 3 percen!.


     Table 3. 12 indicates that the average annual total of MOP' s investments in
     highway maintenance in the CMA during the period 1969-1970 amuunted to
     Bs. 3, 072 + Bs.1, 542   = Bs. 4,   614 million.   This is significantly higher than


                                             -117-
the   annu~l   average of Bs, 2, 185 + Bs. 4 7 5 = Bs. 2, 660 million shown in the
·same table expended by the Federal and Sucre Districts on both contracted
and force
        \
          account maintenance work over the two-year period.


To abstract useful highway maintenance expenditure data frem the accounts
of the two municipal. governments is a difficult task.        For instance, the
cost of maintenance work that is contracted is not separated from that carried
out and charged by "in-house 11 direct labor .on the force account.        In
addition, the municipal accounts do not clearly separate work contracted for
maintenance from that contracted for new construction.           A further compli-
cation is that the maintenance departments keep a joint account of expendit- ·
ures for the maintenance both of highways and of other public works, such
as of sewers.       Except in isolated .instances, np records at local government
level are kept on a routine basis of funds spent on highway maintenance in the
metropolitan area.


However, it is thought that expenditures on highway maintenQ,_nce may be
higher per lane-kilometer than might be indicated by municipal government
budgets which clearly reflect a low priority assigned to this activity.         Tri
fact these low budgets prevent systematic inspection of highway facilities;
this failure in turn results in lo.ng delays for urgent repairs thereby increas--
ing costs, not only to highway users, but also the ultimate costs of road
maintenance.        Furthermore, though there are legal instruments controlling
the maximum axle loads of vehicles (which are not enforced)(l) there are
no such instruments that relate maximum axle loads to different road
surface categories.        This defect has important implications for the
municipalities since much of the road system falling within their responsi-
bility is designed for light traffic.




(1)      The maximum permissable single-axle loading is 8 metric tons, and.
         for tandem axles 14 metric tons.     A study carried out by the.
         Dire cc ion de Vialidad of the MOP in 1963-64 indicated that trucks
         were ope rating with axle loads up to 20 metric tons at an annual
         cost to the country of some Bs. 50-65 million in damage to road
         surfaces.    This serious situation has not improved since the time
         of the study.

housing, sewers, parks and the like, the amount of work done directly by
the two m.unicipalities on highways had to be estimated from dis_cussions with
the administrators of the respective departments of public works of each
local government.    The total expenditures of contracted and force account
work on highways incurred by the Federal District and the Sucre District
for the years 1969 and 1970, as well as the average for the two-year period,
is shown in Table 3. 12.


According to the directors of the two municipal maintenance departments the
funds available for highway maintenance are being increased.       Such increases
might raise the level of maintenance or might simply result in municipal work
replacing MOP work, making more funds available to the MOP for both main-
tenance and construction work.     Since the MOP's highway maintenance work,
aside from that for freeways and bridges, varies with the degree of assJ!;t-
ance that the municipalities request, there is no confident means of project-
ing the future highway maintenance expenditures by the MOP in Caracas.


In :summary, Table 3. 13 presents the estimated total maintenance expendit-
ure on the CMA road system for the years 1960-1970.        The estimates
for the years 1960-1,968 were derived by projecting backward at a growth
rate of 3. 3 percent the known average annual total expenditure of Bs. 7. 27 4
million incurred by all inte.rested agencies during the period 1969-1970 as
indicated in Table 3. 12.   The growth rate of 3. 3 percent was applied since,
as previously noted, this approximates the   s~cular   growth rate of annual
investment in highway construction in the CMA.      In other words, it was
assumed that the past growth rate of maintenance expenditures is roughly
equivalent to the past growth rate of the outlays for highway construction:.

Cleaning Expenditures.        As shown in Table 3. 14, the total expenses of the
Division of Residential and City Cleaning (Divisi6n del Aseo Urbano y
Domiciliario) of the Federal District for 1970 were Bs. 52. 9 million.          The
department does not separate out the cost of its street cleaning work
resulting from motor traffic from that caused by pedestrian traffic, indust-
rial waste and other activities.         After discussing the subject in some detail
with the Federal District authorities, it was concluded that about half of the
labor effort of the division in street cleaning, at a wage cost of about Bs. 7. 5
                                                   l

million, is caused by road traffic and that this cost could be considered a
highway-related exJ_:>ense.        The same half share was judged to apply to
related overhead and other costs of the division, and that this share - roughly
one-quarter of the total overhead - - can there be directly attributed to high-
way use.


No data could be obtained on the- cost of street cleaning in the Sucre District.
An estimate was therefore based on the ratio of population in the Distrito
Sucre to that in the Distrito Federal.         This ratio of 33 percent was applied
                               '
to the street cleaning and related overhead costs computed for the Federal
District.   Table 3. 14 indicates that. the pattern of growth for this item has ·
been ri.sing erratically at a rate of about three percent.       A reasonable
projection would assume the same growth rate into the near future.


Street Lighting.   The annual power consumption of public street lighting
facilities for the years 1961-1970 are given in Table 3.15.         Though this
data also -include consumption by some non-street public lighting facilities,
such as those in the football stadium, and in some public parks and public
buildings, these additional loads are deemed sufficiently small to be ignored.
Though the Caracas Light & Power Company (C. A. La Electricidad de
Caracas) provided the power consumption data, it was unable to give a cost
per kilowatt/hour (Kwh).           Instead it provided monthly consumption and cost
figures incurred in 1971 for a sample of arterials-and streets.         An analysis
of these figures indicated an average weighted cost of Bs. 0.1076 per Kwh.
This factor was applied to the annual power consumption data for all years in
the time series to obtafo appropriate annual costs.         In addition to the power

                sumption and cost data supplied by C: A. La Electricidad

and inspection.    This maintenance cost was estimated using a planning
factor of one-,half times the power cost, a factor developed and used by
the Caracas Light and Power Company.


Not all these costs can be allocated to road users, since non-users such
as pedestrians, shop keepers and residents also benefit significantly from
public lighting.   No exact method could be found to allocate these costs
between vehicle users of the roadways and non-users.        The costs were
therefore arbitrarily allocated equally between the two categories.


3. 1. 3   Traffic Management and .Control
Traffic management and control costs in the Caracas Metropolitan Area for
the years 1969-1970 are summarized in Table 3.16.         Data sources, assump-
tions and resulting costs for these two items over longer time-series are
given separately in the subsequent subsections.


Traffic Management Costs.       Traffic management associated with the high-
way system in t,he CMA is almost exclusively the responsibility of the
Directorate of Ground Transportation (Direcci6n de Transito ·Terrestre) of
the Ministry of Cummunications.      The costs of this task comprise expend-
itures related to the administration and management of traffic related
activities, such as licensing, registration of vehicles, record keeping of
accidents, programming and inspection.       They should be distinguished from
traffic control costs for police, signaling an.d so forth, that are analyzed in
the following subsection; and also from those costs incurred for administer-
ing and supervising highway construction and maintenance programs which
have been included in Section 3. 1. 1 dealing with road construction. and improve-
ment costs.


At national government level, the Directorate of Ground T ra:isportation is
reponsible for traffic admin,istraHon, management and control on all classes
of public roads in Venezuela.    The costs shown in Table 3. 17 are those
incurred by the ·directorate for all its activities, including traffic control,

The activities cov:ered by these total annual costs as shown in Table 3. 18
which represe~ts the 1971 budget of the Directorate of Ground Transportat-
ion by activity. (l)    This budget indicates an item for traffic control
expenses (police, signing and signaling, and related maintenance) amounting
to Bs.18. 809 million.      Since this budgeted item more properly belongs to
traffic control activities, it is included in the summary of traffic control costs
for the CMA tabulated in Table 3. 23 fo the following section.      Consequently,
it can be subtra'cted from the budget total of Table 3. 18 in order to obtain an
approximate estimate of only traffic administration and management expenses
for Venezuela for the year 1971.       This results in an estimate of Bs. 38. 043 -
                  I
Bs.18. 609 = Bs.19. 434 million.


About 25 percent of this national traffic administration and management
expense of Bs. 19. 434 million can be allocated to the metropolitan area based
roughly on the proportion of vehicle use in this region to that in the country
as a whole.     This 25 percent---Share is more likely to be high than lbw because
of the probable greater efficiency per vehicle kilometer of administration,
inspection, licensing, etc., in the metropolitan area as compared to that in
the   lower-d~nsity    areas throughout the rest of the country.   However, this_
possible excess may be offset by the fact that it would appear from casual
comparison with other cities in Venezuela that the level of servic_e provided
by the directorate is significantly higher in Caracas than elsewhere in
Venezuela.     Applying this 25 percent share to the 1971 estimate for traffic
administration and management in Venezuela of Bs.19. 434 million          indieat~-

a CMA co'st of Bs. 4. 85 million.      Rounded to Bs. 5 million, this sum is

         Directorate of Ground Transportation whi_le Table 3. 18 indicates
         its budget. It· can be seen that costs exceeded the budget in
         1971 by some Bs. 4. 2 million or by about 11 percent.

        Table 3. 19 is an estimate of CMA traffic administrative and man.agement
        costs for the years 1963-1971 derived by applying to all years in the series
        this 11. 7 percent share of the total costs of the Directorate of Ground
        Transportation (Tab le 3. 17) on the assumption that this share remained
        constant over the period.


        Traffic Control Costs.      Two separate agencies perform the traffic control
        functions in Caracas.       One of these is the Metropolitan Police Department.
        This department is funded jointly by the Federal District and the Sucre
        District, the two municipalities that govern the city at a local level.             Its
        duties are comprehensive in that they cover all routine law arid order main-
        tainance including traffic supervision on all roads e_xcept the freeway system.
        In   t~rms   of cost, only three-to-four percent of all policing activities of this
        department are concerned with traffic control and other highway activities.
                                                               11
        Table 3. 20 shows this part cost, as well as total          all duty" costs for the
        years 1968-1971.                                                 --..


        Traffic control functions are _also. performed by the Directorate of Ground
        Transportation of the Ministry of Communications.              In this sphere of
        activity, the directorate supplies traffic police for duty on all classes of
        public highways, including freeways, processes enforcement measures,
        installs and maintains traffic signals on major streets.                According to the
        Ministry of Communications, about 60 percent of the cost of this activity
        at the national scale is incurred in the CMA.        Taking the m:inistry 1 s traffic
        control budget for ..Venezuela as a guide, the application of this proportional
        share indicates a cost estimate of Bs. 13. 174 million in 197 0 for the CMA
        as shown in Table 3. 21.


        Both the Metropolitan Police and the Directorate of Ground Transportation
        assign some 400 uniformed men to traffic control and enforcement duties in

(1)   The Ministry of Communications estimates that 60 percent of
      the amounts shown in the totals are spent in the Caracas
      Metropolitan Area.
the CMA as shown in Table 3. 22.     Since the manpower and other traffic
control and enforcement costs of both of these local and central government            ~I
agencies are all direct .governmental costs, the reported figures for both
are assumed to be reliable and useable without      adjustments~    It would appear,
therefore, that in recent years there has been only a small rise in the overall
police and other traffic control costs in Caracas in spite of a substantial
growth in the metropolitan population and traffic.      Much of the small
increase observed can be attributed to inflation which has been occurring at
the annual rate of about 2. 5 percent over recent years.


Table 3. 23 gives a. summary of the costs of highway police and other traffic
control requirements in the CMA, together with the costs of associated
overhead administration for the years 1963-1971.        As indicated in Tables
3. 20 and 3. 21, data on police and other traffic control costs exist only for
the years 1968-1970 (and for 1971 in the case of Metropolitan Police) during
which years the costs remained relatively constant.        Without much more
intensive study, no simple, rapid and reliable means could be found to
obtain estimates for earlier years (or for the year 1971 in the case of the
Directorate of Ground Transportation).       Estimates for these years we.re
therefore judged to be roughly equal to the average for the three known years,
but were deflated at the annual rate of 2. 5 percent over the period 1963-1966
to convert them to current prices   for   these years (and inflated at this rate
over the period 1967 -1971 to give 1971 estimates at current prices where
required).


It is believed that the effect of any error introduced by this estimation pro-
cedure is not large enough to affect seriously the accuracy of subsequent
calculations to which these estimates are applied, such as those to obtain
track costs, and to obtain the differences between future revenues from the
road system and the expenditures made on it.        The associated overhead
administrative expenditures for police salaries, equipment and maintenance
costs of the Directorate of Ground Transportation is estimated to be ten
percent which is roughly the proportion of the directorate's total 1971 budget
assigned to programming and .administrative services (Table 3. 18). · The

     (1)    The Metropolitan Police force has operated only since 1968. During previous years, including the
            period 1963-1967, the municipal government police forces of the Federal District and Sucre District
            operated separately in carrying out their duties in the CMA.

     (2)    The annual salary cost of municipal government police on traffic· duty for the years 1963"1967 is
            assumed to have been roughly Bs. 3, 852, 000 at 1967 prices based on the weighted average relation•
            ship (93. 5o/o) of annual salary costs to total costs of Metropolitan Police on traffic duty during the
            years 1968-1971 (Table 3. 20). This salary cost has been deflated at a rate of 2. 5 percent over
            the period 1963-1966. The annual salary costs of the Metropolitan Police on traffic duty for the
            years 1968-1971 are taken 'from Table 3. 20.

     (3)    The annual administrative and other overhead costs of municipal government police for the years .
            1963-1967 are roughly estimated to have been Bs. 268, 000 at. 1967 prices based on the weighted
            average relationship (6. 5o/o) of "other costs" to total costs of the Metropolitan Police on traffic
            duty during the years 1968-1971 (Table 3. 20). This cost item has been deflated at a rate of
            2. 5 percent over the period 1963-1966. The associated annual administrative'·and other overhead
            costs for the years 19 68-1971 are taken from Table 3. 20.

     (4)    Annual salary, equipment and maintenance costs at 1967 prices of the Directorate of Ground
            Transportation police on traffic control duty in the CMA for the years 1963-1967 and for 1971
            are estimated to have appro~imated the annual average of these costs incurred during the period
            1968-1970 (See Table 3.21).    This estimate has been deflated at an annual rate of 2.5 percent
            for the years 1963-1966 and inflated accordingly to obtain the 1971 cost at current prices.

     (5)    Administrative overhead costs for the Directorate of Ground Transportation's traffic controi duties
            in the CMA are assumed to be ten percent based on the directorate's budget allocation for
            programming and administrative services relative to its total budget for operations in Venezuela
            during 1971 (Table 3.21l.

series, 1963-197 0.        As indicated in the table, total highway related police
and other tr;;i.ffic control costs in 1970 amount'ed to some Es. 18 million.
This is about 13 percent of total all-duty policing costs in ,the       metr~politan
area in 1970.(l)

3. 2.     ROAD USER REVENUE, 1960-1971
Excluding toll charges, there are two principal kinds of revenue collected
from Ve.nezuelan road users -- indirect taxation and driver/vehicle charges.
The indirect taxes on gasoline and to some extent, new vehicles, are on
·consumption; and they are collected as an excise on the distributors, and
passed on to ·the consumer.        Since the Government sets both the gasoline tax
rate and the minimum price, which is           qui~e   low, it can be assumed that the
full    incide~ce   falls upon the consumer.     The user charges are in the form of
drivers' licenses and vehicle registration fees, as well as some other minor
charges.       The important distinction between these and the indirect taxes is
·that revenues from the latter are responsive to varying road usage and are
                                                                            . ---.
thus trip-dependent.        As such, the gasoline tax revenue offers a closer
potential measu·re of correspondence to the public costs of road           usage~    it
also provides a major and buoyant source of revenue.


The licensing of drivers and the registration of vehicles involve regulatory
function as well as a charge for road use.             This regulatory function may be
more important than the costs· and facility of administration, and "tax
efficiency" considerations.        However, in many countries registration fees
have been utilized for revenue-generation above administrative costs.
Venezuela is no exception in this regard - - the municipalities of the Federal




(1)       The total cost of all-duty policing in the CMA in 1970 is
          roughly estimated to have been Bs .140 million. This is
          composed of Bs. 111 million for Metropolitan Police activities
          (Table 3. 20), Bs.13 million for the Directorate of Ground
          Transportation police (Table 3. 21 ), and about Bs. 16 million
          for the Judicial Technical Police (Polic:!'.a T~cnica Judicial - -
          PT J) of the Ministry of Justice (Ministerio de Justicia) which
          is responsible for criminal investigation.

District and Sucre raise a substantial share of their revenue from registrat-
ion charges.


The data which reflect upon these and other issues are presented below.
The analysis is directed toward the overall assessment of road user-charges,
and toward promoting constructive policy recommendations.           Logically,
modifications made to road user revenue charges should be considered
comprehensively, and thus should take into account any new forms of charge,
such as congestion pricing, if they are considered appropriate.        Such an
evaluation is limited to some extent in this study by a lack of intimate
familiarity with local conditions, and, in particular, ·.vith the more subtle
budgetary and political exigencies. of the situation.


3 ~ 2. 1   Types of Revenue Source

Road user revenue sources in Venezuela conveniently fall into two broad
categories: national sources where charges are applied equally throughout
the country; and municipal sources where the charges vary according to
the decisions of the municipal authorities.     The various types of revenue
source that comprise each category are dealt with below.


Fuei and Lubricants (National).      The M:lnistry of Mines and Hydrocarbons
(Ministerio de Minas y Hidrocarburos) levies a tax differentially on the
four classes of gasoline sold for motor vehicles, as well as on lubricants.
The revenues so raised are collected from producers when the products are
sold for distribution.   Item 1 in the Table 3. 24 lists the schedule of the tax
rates per liter of product and indicates the percentages that these taxes
represent _of .the effective retail prices.   The tax rates correspond to half
the import duty that would have been imposed on the fuels had they been
imported.      The only tax rate adjustment made in recent years was in October,
197,0, when the high octane gasoline tax was raised from Bs. O. 06 to Bs. O. 11
per liter thus raising the effective retail sale price from Es. 0 :- 25 to Bs. 0. 30
per liter.    The rate related to the 77-84 octane gaso_line was doubled at the
same time but this increase was later rescinded.

(1)   Levied at 50% of the import duties on the same fuels,      if they were to be imported
      (figures rounded off).
(2)   Raised from 0. 06 to 0.11 Bs. /L in October 1970;       a previous doubling of the 15   t
      gasoline tax in 1961 was later rescinded.
(3)   The rates for outlying districts (some only a few miles away) are considerably lower
      thus encouraging many private auto owners to ,register outside their living area;
      however, this practice was effectively curbed in l. 971.

(4)   !he  examination would be extremely difficult for the average Caraqueiio, and it
      is reported that a great many solicit the assistance of an agent ("gestor") at a
      cost of about Bs. 175 additional.

(5)   Also required is a medical certificate issued annually at a cost of Rs. 20. 00 by
      the Venezuelan Medical Federation (Federaci6n Medica Venezolanal.
Vehicle He gist ration (National).   All motor vehicles throughout the country
are registered annually for a charge of Es. 20. 00 by the Ministry of
Communications (Ministerio de Comunicaciones).         They are also registered
when purchased new or on re-sale.       The registration document is taken as
proof of ownership title.    When required, further confirmation of vehicle
                                                                                   \'

ownership can be issued on request.      Item 2 in Table 3. 24 indicates the
charges for all of these registration needs. (l)


Drivers' License (National).     The Ministry of Communications is also
responsible for certifying that a person wishing to drive a vehicle is
competent to do so and for issuing a license as evidence of this. A charge
                                              2
is made for taking the driving examination, (. ) for the initial licence and
subsequent renewals which are both valid     for three years.   There is also
a charge for a one-year validation of foreign licences.    Item 6 in Table 3. 24
shows the charges assigned to these four licence possibilities for automobile
drivers. ( 3 )


Fines (National).   The revenues received by the National Treasury (Minis-
terio de Hacienda) from traffic violation fines mostly result from citations
issued to violators by the agents (fiscales) of the Directorate of Ground
Transportation (Direcci6n de Transito Terrestre) of the Ministry of
Communications.      These fines vary in amount according to the offense.




(1)    The motorcycle registration charge, until !°970, was Bs.15. 00
       A charge of Es .10. 00 is made for non-motor vehicles.

(2)    The Venezuelan drivers' examination is difficult. As a result,
       some candidates employ a private agent or "gestor" for a fee
       of Es.175. 00 to obtain assistance.

( 3)   All licenced drivers are required to carry a health certificate
       issued annually by the Venezuelan Medical Association (Federa-
       ci6n Medica Venezolana) following an ·examination.     The charge
       is Es. 20. 00. If all .licenced drivers complied with the regu-
       lations, the net revenue would be about Bs. 2 million minus
       administrative costs which are not known.

        They are related to the vehicle; not the driver.     Defaults in the payment
        of fines disqualify vehicle owners from registering their vehicles until
        the debts are settled.    No additional fines are imposed for delays in
        payment.


        Cargo License (National).    This is a special licence (more properly a
        registration) issued by the Directorafe of Ground Transportation to owners
        of trailers that are used to carry cargo.    Such trailers are provided with
        a special registration plate that is distinct from that carried by the tractor
        portion of the articulated vehicle set.


        Towing Charges (National).     As indicated in item 5, Table 3. 24 the
        Directorate of Ground Transportation lays down towing charge rates
        for dealing with immobilized vehicles.      The Directorate itself has tow
        trucks to assist the private sector in emergencies, and charges according-
        ly.


        Quarterly (trimestre) Registration Fees (Municipal).      Municipalities
        charge a quarterly vehicle registration fee (1) depending on type of
        vehicle.     These charges vary between municipalities.      Ltem 2 in Table
        3. 24 shows these charges as applied by· the Federal and Sucre municipal-
        ities.     Buses are charged Bs.15. 00 per passenger seat.     The domicile
        of the vehicle owner is the criterion normally applied in the case of
        private automobiles to designate the municipality in which the owner should

Autobus Charge9 (Municipal).      In addition to the registration charge (at
the rate of Bs.15. 00 per passenger .seat), buses may request an additional
licence to carry a limited number of standees.


Parking Meter Charges (Municipal).       In the Federal District, where most
of the CMA' s parking meters are found (largely in the central business
district) the charge is Bs.1. 00 per hour as indicated in Table 3. 24.         The
few meters in the Sucre District mostly need Bs. 0. 50 per hour of parking.


Excise Tax on New Vehicles (Municipal).      This is a tax of 0.1 percent
of the retail sale price of new cars.

(1)     Prior to 1971, asignificant number of Caracas residents regis-
        tered their vehicles in other municipal jurisdictions lying out-
        side of the metropolitan area where charges are cheaper. Such
        people often employed a private agent or ' 1gestor" to provide
        this service.   The agent, of course, showed an incorrect
        address of the vehicle owner.

        Since 1971, the enforcement of the regulations have been
        tightened up.   A number of means were utilized: (1) increased
        public relations and coercion; (2) registration in Caracas be-
        fore registration. began elsewhere; (3) a limited number of
        plates sent to outlying areas; (4) plates clearly distinguished
        to indicate residents of Caracas; (5) in October and November
        of 1971, the police conducted a program of checking cars in
       ·parking lots to determine whether each had a Caracas plate;
        those "improperly" registered were not allowed to leave until
        the driver obtained a Caracas registration.

        It might be noted-that there is still no official tie-in between
                                                                                                I   1

unpaid fines relate to vehicles registered with other municipal authorities.
Thus many such fines in the CMA, which includes parts of both the
Federal and Sucre Districts, go unpaid.      In fact, of the citations issued
for parking meter offenses, only ten percent result in fines collected.             '

3. 2. 2   Revenues Generated by Revenue Sources

Table 3. 25 displays the annual road user revenues generated in the CMA
by all national and
                  .
                    municipal sources identified
                                        .
                                                 in the previous section (l)
during the period 1960-70, with forecasted estimates for the year 1971.
Table 3. 26 indicates annual revenues raised over the same period in
Venezuela from national sources including toll charges for the use of
some inter-urban freeway facilities. ( 2 )


The relationship of national road use revenues generated to the CMA with
those generated throughout the nation is considered subsequently from the
                    3
equity standpoint. ( ) However, it may be noted that the percentage split           J
                                                                                    I
between the various national charges, for the nation as a whole, aside
from toll charges, approximates that for the CMA though a slightly larger
share of total revenues in the CMA are derived from fuel ·taxes and a
somewhat lower share from the remaining charges.


Taking each revenue source in turn, some of the more significant aspects
of the revenue data, for the CMA, presented in Table 3. 25 are discussed
below.




(1)       Except for revenues from towing charges paid to the Directorate
          of Ground Transportation for keeping the highway system clear
          of obstruction9 for which data are not readily available.

(2)       These ..toll charges during the years 1967-71 amounted to more
          than half of the total national road user charges revenues."

           Fuel and Lubricants (National).         Table 3. 27 shows the consumption (in
           cubic meters) of the four major fuels,_ as well as lubricants, together
           with the fiscal revenues derived therefrom in the CMA from 1967 through
           1971.   Summary data is also indicated for Venezuela as a whole for the
           same period. (l)    As mentioned previously, the only tax change was in
           October, 1970, affecting high octane gasoline, raising it by Bs. 0. 05 per
           liter, or 83 percent.


           The average rate of revenue growth, 1968-71 in the CMA from this source
           was 18 percent yearly compared with 14 percent for Venezuela.             The
           yearly trends also show a sharp drop-off in the use of Bs. 0. 10 gasoline
           in the CMA (31 percent annually) possibly because the quality of the cars
           in the city has improved.         There is some indication that the 1970 price
           increase in the high    octane~   gasoline caused a sizeable shift to the Bs. 0. 15
           fuel and mixes in-between, although the -exact affect is uncertain because
           of data irregularities and changes in the types- of vehicles.        It should be
           noted, however, that the Bs. O. 30 gasoline accounts for 70 percent of all
           fuel tax revenue in Caracas.


           By relating fuel consumption by grade to types of vehicle (TaOle 3. 28)
           it can be seen that Bs. 0. 30 gasoline tax     r~venue   is derived almost exclusive-
           ly from private autos while 69 percent of revenue is derived from taxi
          .and por puesto purchases of grades costing Bs. 0.15 or' less.


           Vehicle Registration, Drivers 1 Licences and Fines (National).          Since
           revenue data for these three sources supplied by the Ministry of
           Communications appeared to be unreliable, recourse was had instead
           to data supplied by the National Treasury(l) related to monies actually
           deposited in the Treasury from the sources consolidated into a single
           account item.      The revenues as recorded for Venezuela were aportioned

estimates; ( ) Subsequently the revenues judged to be generated in the·
CMA for each item were developed in accordance w.ith assumptions
summari~ed     in the footnotes to Table 3. 25.


In general the time-series figures are erratic, especially those for 1970
and 1971. ( 3 ) If, however, the average revenue for the first three years
(1960-62) are compared with the average for the last three years of the
period (1968-70); the resulting increase of 195 percent is seen to be
roughly comparable with the 180 percent increase in registered vehicles
                  (4)
in the country.         There are thus indications of a small per-vehicle
revenue increase at current prices over time; and it is likely that this·
holds for the CMA as well, mostly as a result of more income from fines
since the other two charges have .remained unaltered (except for the small
increase in motorcycle registration fees).


Cargo Lie-€nces (National).      In the CMA, as for Venezuela, revenue from
this source is minute amounting in 1970 to 0. 2 percent of national road
user income.      The revenue has however steadily in.creased over the years.


Towing Charges (National)".      No revenue data is obtainable related to
this item.

(2)    Vehicle registration in the CMA accounts for about 12 percent
       of CMA road user revenues destined for the National
       Treasury.

( 3)   In some instances the registration of vehicles begins towards
       the end of a year; in others, at the beginning of a year; or
       the activity may bridge the end of one and the beginning of ·
       the next. This ac·counts for some of the erratic nature of
       the annual figures.

       Quarterly Registration Fees (Municipal).       Local government road user
       revenues in the CMA from this source (about 96 percent of the total)
       experienced an erratic decline, dropping by more than one-third, from
       Bs. 19 million in 196_0 to its lowest level over the intervening years of
       Bs. 12 million in 197 0 in spite of the rising vehicle stock in the region.
       Clearly, an increasing number of veh:lcle owners made a practice of
       registering their vehicles in municipal jurisdictions outside of the
       metropolitan area until the regulations were thoroughly tightened up in
       1971.   Thus in 1960, the municipal registration average was Bs. 17 4, 00
                         \

       per vehicle; but by 1970 this average had declined to only Bs. 51. 00 per
       vehicle (l) (compared with a roughly estimated potential of about Bs. 160. 00
       per vehicle).   Psing the 1971 revenue estimate, approximately Bs.114. 00
       per vehicle was realized under the tightened-up regime.        Though   mun~ci­

       pal data are somewhat unreliable, they are indicative of actual revenue
       collected.   However, they do not in any way indicate the full potential of                'i

       revenue from this source.


       Autobus Charges (Municipal).       Over the period 1960-71, revenue from
       this source was particularly erra:tic owing to changes in tax policy,
       in the number of buses operating, in the number exempted from the tax,
       and in the number entering the CMA but registered elsewhere.         On average
       the revenues generated amounted to about Bs. 530, 000 yearly.       In 1971
       estimates indicate that income from this source was about one percent of
       local government road user revenues in the CMA.


       Parking Meters (Municipal).        The data in Table 3. 25 show the revenue.
       from parking meters in the Federal District only - - ame>unting to about
       one percent of the total municipal revenue in the CMA.       There were no

               (Table 3. 25) to vehicles in circulation (Table 3. 29) in the CMA.

       ( 2)    It is estimated that the full potential is in the order of Bs, 45
               million.   Private autos alone should generate Bs. 30 million.

 Footnotes:
 (1)   The number of vehicles in circulation is greater than the number registered in the area. except for 1971; in that year more stringent registration procedures probably resulted in most
       vehicles in the CMA being registered properly.   The data are of questionalbe accuracy but are presently the best available. 1960-1964 estimated on national proportions.

 (2)   The data for 1970 were not availahle and·had to be interpolated between 1960 and. 1971.

 (3)   The breakdown between public and prb:ate was made on the basis of             lfl6~ 1.·   data.

                      data available for revenue from the small number of meters in the
                      District of Sucre.           Revenues are unsteady over the analysis period.
                      It is not known if this is owing to varying levels of enforcement or to
                       imprecise accounting methods.


                       Excise Tax (Municipal).           Since no data for this item were available
                       revenues shown on Table 3. 25 for the CMA are based on a proportional
                       allocation to the CMA of the annual.number of new vehicles produced in
                      the country during the analysis period.           Although the tax rate remained
                       consistent, the estimated annual revenues indicate a slight increase in
                      their proportional share of total municipal road user charges income over
                      the years.           In 1971 it was almost two percent of this total; in 1960 it
                      was one percent.

                       3. 2. 3         Revenue Generation by Road User Type

                       Table 3. 31 indicates the absolute and proportional amounts of total revenue
                       raised in 1971 in the CMA according to road user type.              These results
                       are only a rough approximation based on crude assumptions noted at the
                       foot of the table.         However, the great difference in the proportion gener-
                       ated by each vehicle type is such that only a very large error would shift
                                                                         '
                       the predominant weight away from the private automobile    which is the
                       travel mode that contributes the most in road user revenues.              Trucks,
                       closely followed by the par puesto and taxi mode, make for smaller contri-
                       butions, while that of the bus mode is almost insignificant.


                       3. 2. 4         Statistical Difficulties and Recommendations

                       The large number of sources that had to be utilized, the significant
                       effort in culling from numerous conflicting sources reasonable compila-
                       tions of data, and the effort necessary to produce consistent summaries,
                       are indicative of existing statistical problems in road user revenue data.
                       There are two inherent difficulties:         (1) the concept of 1'road user 11 is not
                       one that is familiar to Venezuelan. authorities; and,          ( 2) because the

Caracas Metropolitan Area is a relatively new statistical district, much of
the data had to be adjusted to suit the CMA boundaries.     Furthermore,
Venezuelan data related to virtually every area of the transport sector
are extremely poor.


Some procedural criticisms can be made which have more or less general
application:

                      Tables presented without adequate footnotes,
                      explanations, source references or dates.

                      Ambiguous "timing1' of fiscal data becau·se. it
                      is. not clear whether the data represent actual
                      collections at the source, funds received by the
                      Treasury, or those credited to the Treasury.

                      Gross inconsistencies between two references
                      reporting the same source of revenue.

                      Changes in the concepts of time series without
                      adequate explanation or adjustment.


The data available from the Directorate of Ground Transportation
(Direcci6n de Transite Terrestre) of the Ministry of Communications,
which is the source closest to road users and road user revenue, are
extremely primitive. · The data are badly organized, lagging in time, and
contain seeming inaccuracies.     It is difficult to separate crude e·stimates
from actual counts; it is also difficult to distinguish the tmportant from
the unimportant.    For example, there often appear tables in which the
reader is not sure whether bicycles and pushcarts have been included in
the count of total vehicles.


It is virtually impossible to obtain a detailed. breakdown of the cash flow ·
from the various vehicle charges so that a crosscheck might be made with
numbers of payors and nominal rates.      Where the national government
through its ministeries and agencies performs services for the municipal
governments, it is again difficult to trace the flow of funds.   If a computer-
ized statistical facility is established, as has been planned, the generation
of motor vehicle data would be greatly facilitated.    However, this would

                                                                                  I

not obviate the need for better basic procedures, ·a large, trained, statistic-
al staff, and comprehensive, reliable publications.


What seems to be lacking in Venezuela is a single, comprehensive and
detailed government accounting of the flow of revenues and expenditures in
any economic sector, including the transportation sector.            The types of
·data published in the national budget projections, and the Memorias
Fiscales of the various governmerital bodies, are too general for most
econ.omic analyses.         The culling and rationalizing of data from the
primary sources is         a laborious and unrewarding process.      More usable
        '
data;would greatly facilitate the many types of analysis, particularly
fina.ncial, required in the rap;idly growing road transport sector. (l)


It ·is· recommended that all national agencies involved in the road transport.
· sector standard'Ize their data collection and ugly analysis procedures and
the ~orm~at of statistical presentations.         In this context sub-sectional
item identification is of vital importance.         Particular regard should be
given to criteria to enable agencies to make a strict separation of all
exp~Q.ditures
            related to capital investments in road construction and
imp~ovements (upgrading)( 2) from those expenditures.arising from road

use     .inc~uding   maintenance, cleaning, lighting, traffic management and
 cont'.rol, and related admin;istration that these activities incur.      The
mun'icipalities should be      encour~ged   to do likewise.



 (1)        Some examples are: (1) Highway Statistics (Dept. of Trans-
            portation); (2) U.S. Annual Budget; (3) U.S. Government
            Statisticai'Abstracts; and many others.

 ( 2)        ','All expenditures" would comprise expenditures for every
             activity from the planning inc;eption stages through to the
             termination of the. implementation stage when the facility
             is ready for service. See Appendix 7 which includes an
            -analysis of the stages, pro9edures and activity-flows .
            -normally followed in Venezuela in the planning and construc-
             tion of road facilities.




                                        -159-
     This first step towards standardization would facilitate the next step of
     centralizing the preparation and production of transport sector statistics
     in a single government agency.     .Once established, this central office
     would ipso facto be in. a strong position to take the lead in setting standards
     and procedures to be aaopted by the agencies involved in the transport
     sector as regards the organization and presentation of relevant data.
     Each of these agencies would of c_ourse make periodic statistical returns
     to this central office.


     Another desirable step would be to encourage the disaggregation of data by
     urban and rural categories irrespective of municipal jurisdictional .
     boundaries.     This is very relevant to road user expenditure and revenue
     analysis.     Rural highway facilities, on the one hand, particularly in
      Venezuela, have a developmental function; thus it may not always be
     desirable for road user revenues ih this context to cover fully road user
                                 A       •


     costs.    On the other hand, iri urban areas, the reverse may be the case
     even to the extent that 1'.'-oad user revenues would not only cover (traditional)
      road user costs, but that each revenue contributor would cover the full
     (social) costs that his road use causes especially at ·critical periods in
     the more densely developed parts of urbanized areas :subject to serious
     traffic congestion.    Revenue raised in ·this man.ner would thus serve the·
     additional function of efficiently rationing or allocating the various supply-
      components of the transport sector.


     With the implementation of the suggestion to separate urban and r_ural
     transport sector statistics, a logical consequence would be to establish
     in the larger cities local offices (complementing the central office) for the
     . preparation of local urban transport statistics.   Caracas is an obvious
     candidate for such a scheme; and such an office could be incorporated in
     the envisaged (Caracas) Metropolitan Transport Administration (Admin-
     . istraci6n Metropolitana de Transport.e: Caracas - AMTC). (l)




     (1)      This suggestion is enlarged upon in Section 4. 8.

A part from the foregoing more general proce.dural and organizational
suggestions, data collection and statistical analysis activities need to be
strengthened in a number of specific areas.        For instance, much more
we~ght     of importance should be given to the strict collection of accident
information and the rigorous. evaluation of relevant data to enable the
development of cost-effective remedial action programs.         Another area
that calls for urgent statistical attention is that related to axle-loads.
Data potentially obtainable from the issue of police citations should be
studied to guide strategic decisions to c·ontrol differentially the emphasis
placed on traffic enforcement activities and to monitor their effectiveness.
Vehicle ownership data by geographical area is still weak but is improving
with the tighter implementation of registration regulations.       While
statistical studies on a sample basis of the condition of vehicles using the
road system should be considered to guide the government with regard to
the implementation of periodic vehicle checks to reduce accidents and their
consequent high social costs. (l)


3. 3      EVALUATION OF PRESENT ROAD USER TAXES AND CHARGES

This section attempts to appraise present road user taxes and charges in
the CMA as revealed by the foregoing sections of this chapter.        Particular
stress is given to." fiscal balance" (or the extent to which present road
                                  '
users finance the costs attributed to them, arid the implications toward
financing future needs), the assistance the road user charges provide in
transport investment decision-making, the extent to which payments are
equitably distributed among different classes of road users and others, and
the degree to which revenue collection is convenient, enforceable and cheap.

this balance could be of importance to budget planners. ( ) There is,
however,· a special interest in weighing revenue against the costs arising
out of road use.


Table 3. 3 2 compares revenue· raised from national and municipal road

user sources with expenditures attributed to road use ( > in the CMA
during the years 1967 -7 0.     On average there was an excess of revenue
over expenditures on road maintenance and management of roughly
Bs. 8 million yearly;    and a deficit averaging about Bs. 108 million if expend-
itures in road construction are included as well.      Comparative time-series
data for.the years 1960-1966 is not presented as revenue data from fuel
taxes are not available.      This type of revenue accounts for more than
half of the total raised (Table 3. 25) from road users in the CMA.
                                                                                    _i

Economic Efficiency.      It is a necessary condition for economic efficiency
to prevail that a potential trip-maker is confronted by an array of prices,
for each of his alternative travel decisions, which reflect all of the costs
which society would have to bear as .a result of the accomplishment of
each travel alternative.      Quite obviously if this condition were not to
hold, a traveller would be likely to, for instance, travel from A to B by
a mode which costs society in general more than such a movement would

(2)       In most countries, governments refuse to recognize a connec-
          tion between revenues and expenditures not only in the trans-
          port sector, but in some other sector as well.
                ·. '

(3)       Table 3. 32 distinguishes between maintenance, management
          and control expenditures (maintenance -management expenditure)
          on the one hand, and investment in the upgrading of, or
          extensions to, the road system (construction expenditures) on
          the other.

The present system of road user charging in Caracas does not generally
cause potential travellers to weigh their alternative decisions in the light
of the full costs associated with such decisions.             Consequently economic
efficiency does not generally occur.            Travellers presently are confronted
with (i) the implied costs of their own time which is expended as a result

Elements (i) and (ii) are the only significant costs covered by travellers

upon the environment is negligible); in other words, the constraints caused                  !I
by congestion are removed.           When congesti.on prevails however, the
travel decisions of individuals are not mutually independent.                As explained
in Section 2. 4. 4 in Caracas in the peak hour congestion costs, or marginal
social costs, can reach .very high levels.

( 2)    Described in Section 2. 4. 2. It can be taken that, on average
        although not at the margin, public transport fares in Caracas
        reflect public transport operating costs.

For example a      :r:hedium~sized   European car, such as a            Hillm~an        G. T ..
or an Open Ascona, ··each of which is quite popular in Caracas, would pay
in taxation on the   fu~l   it consumes approximately Bs. O. 0141 per kilometer
in typical city conditions. Assuming for simplicity, marginal track costs
to be zero, it can be calculated that on a representative street with three
traffic lanes in one direction such a car would be paying in taxation less
than what it is costing other road users in congestion costs (e.g. extra
time consumption, tire wear, etc.) if the traffic flow is less than 43 3
passenger car units (p. c.u. 1 s) per hour.           The amount of the undercharging
.would be so small as to be completely ignored however; for instance if
the traffic flow were 250 p. c;U.. 1 s per hour the driver would be paying
society (,via fuel taxation) Bs. O. 01~1 per km. and costing society (over and
above hiµi.self) some Bs. O. 0070 per km. less.            If traffic were to build up
to 1000 p. c.u. 1 s per hour he would be undercharged by Bs. O. 0433 per km.
whilst at the practical capacity flow of 2400 p. c. u.        1
                                                                  s per hour he would be
underch~rged     by some Bs. 18. 00 per km.           The insignificance of any over-
~harging    at high flow levels is brought out illustratively in Figure 3. 1.


Thus on,e must conclude that a system of road user charges as prese-ntl!
prevailip.g in Caracas is not conducive to economic efficiency at high flow
levels because the amounts paid in taxation are severe understatements of

often near to, or even beyond, practical road capacities (even though in
many instances hourly volumes disguise somewhat the "peak within the
peak" phenomenon).      Consequently it follows that, in a general s.ense,
the present road user charging system in Caracas is contrary to
economic efficiency to a serious extent.


The extent to which   th~   present system of charging is economically in-
efficient is a somewhat vague concept that may be equated to the extent
to which the best alternative system is more efficient.     Neither quantity
has been assessed in this study, particularly in the case of the latter since
it would be unlikely that the alternatives, subjected to the appraisal pro-
cedure, were optimal; and furthermore the economic evaluation was quite
partial and did not include long-term effects.     Consequently no extensive
attempt at a quantitative assessment of the efficiency of the present system
is made herein.


It is plausible that an average cost pricing mechanism is more wasteful
of resources in Caracas than in any other capital city in the world of
comparable population and level of economic activity.      This is partially a
function of the topographical constraints upon the extent to which the
activity of the city can be spatially dispersed; of the social characteristics
of Caraquefios which adds additional midday and early afternoon peak-periods
to the conventiona_l morning arid evening demands for commuting: travel;
and of relatively low transport price-user income and transport price-
other price ratios.    But wasteful resource allocation could be alleviated
by the existence of a reserved right-of-way transport system -- such as
a Metro s:J'."stem -- supplementary to the present finite road network.      Such
a supplementary system would tend tq act as a safety valve by means of
which the pressures of intense travel demands could be released before
permanent distortions are imparted to the spatial structure of the city.
At present, those people contributing to an increase in travel demand
have few viable and moderate alternatives available to them.      Much of
the time they have to tolerate resulting congestion.     A move to an alter-
native mode does not usually increase journey speeds since all modes are




                                     -167-
           affected by the same congestion; a move to an alternative time of day may
           sometimes be a feasible option but does not confer any worthwhile improve-
           ment if too many people are induced to make the same move; while the
           quite extreme alternative of .a shift to an alternative destination may not
           carry much advantage in terms of ease of movement.

                                                                            '\
           Consequently it is quite probable that many decide to bear the existing
           congestion, this being the least harmful of the options open to them.
           Others may select alternatives that would in more normal conditions be·
           considered to be rather dire in their nature.   These may include those of
           not traveling at all, or one of moving to travel elsewhere where travel
           conditions are not so abyssmal. (l)   Whichever option is selected the
           economic penalty to the nation may be greater than that which would occur
           were a transport system available which would stand free from highway
           congestion and to which demand could be siphoned off as sucp congestion
           develops.


           The economic efficiency of the present system of road user charges in
           Caracas has dimensions additional to those of a marg_inal nature elucidated
           in the foregoing paragraphs.    The overall economic efficiency of the nation
I.
           could be significantly impaired by some ·distortions which are implicit in the
              .         .
           current charging structure.   For instance, compared wHh other cars,
           heavy cars with engines having high compression ratios are burdened with
          _ taxation to a much greater extent than is warranted on grounds of the extra
            costs which they impose. ( 2 ) For instance, an average gasoline-powered
          . Mercedes-Benz would pay Bs. 635 annually for 20, 000 kilometers of

 1                together with the establishment of non-traditional employment
                  centers, such as Chuao, may be. determined by advantages of
                  accessibility (and also the broad environmental advantage:;;; of
                  living and working in areas relatively free from traffic intrusion).

           ( 2)   These greater costs, if non-zero, must be very small.

travel(l) whilst a small Volkswagen would incur only some Bs. 229 in
providing the same volume of travel.       Clearly some potential car buyers
would be mislead into buying cars that are too small and too conserving
of gasoline -than they would wish under ceteris paribus conditions.      If a
Volkswagen were bought rather than a gasoline-powered Mercedes the
purchaser would be quite severely disadvantaged from the standpoints of
status and comfort, though he would experience positive savings in
             2
maintenance ( ) and gasoline costs. Some would consider that the tax
burden would be well-alloted in this instance.     A more typical example;
however, would probably confer less of a sacrifice in terms of the personal
subjective well-being of the purchaser but might, in fact, result in a
positive loss of resources consumed in maintenance, repair, accident
compensation and shortened vehicle life-span.       Few would disagree that
the latter set of consequences are undesirable.


Regarding cars, it is suspected that the degree of distortion imparted by
the prevailing taxation of differing qualities of fuel is probably so small
as to be almost insignificant as a determinant- in the selection of a car to
buy by any_Caraquefio who is affluent enough to contemplate the purchase
of a car demanding the highest qualify of fuel.  More significant would be
the registration dues but these are less progressive than are fuel taxes. (3 )
Ho"."ever, it is possible that goods transport lines and bus lines with more
sophisticated accounting procedures than the average potential car-owner
could be significantly biassed against   petrol~powered   vehicles by the fuel-
tax structures.   Nevertheless, casual observation indicates that such a




(1)    It is noticeable that diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz cars are very
       rarely seen in Venezuela in spite of the fact that a gasoline-
       consuming Mercedes would pay in fuel tax 11, 000 percent of
       the amount which would its diesel-powered equivalent.

tendency is not readily apparent although diesel-driven vehicles are
probably quite rapidly building-up frorri a very small base. (l)( 2 )


As is indicated in Section 3. 3. 3 goods vehicles generally could. be
encumbered by taxation rates which are too high in relation to .the costs
for which they are responsible (although the heaviest vehicles could
contrarily be taxed too low).     Thus freight costs would be unnecessarily
high and there would be some tendency towards an inefficient geographical
allocation of production, an    unn~cessarily   large number of production
facilities for too low a total volume of production, a non-optimal inter-
sectoral allocation of the amount of production which does take        place~   and
so on.    Whether such distortions are very serious is doubted but this can
not be proven without detailed analysis.        What could be of more consequence
is the comparative insignificance to the total revenue contribution of each
goods vehicle beyond the smallest size categories which is provided by
fuel consumption -- most comes from municipal registration fees, which
are especially bur:.Qensome on heavier goods.vehicles.          A consequence of
this would be the overutilization of too small a goods vehicle fleet, which
could confer significant economic penalties.

        multiplicative effect.


        To make too much of the distortive effects of the prevailing tax structure
        would be inappropriate, however:.        Other irregularities could imply
        greater distortion.      For instance all cars in Venezuela are required to
        be lo_cally ass~mbled with about one-half of their weight composed of
        domestically produced items.         This, seems to add at least one third to
        the price of a popular British car(l) compared with what would be its
        price imported in a built-up form.   Thus, the prices of those cars which
                                                                      2

        few would be bought, depreciation periods would be to.o long, and running
        costs may be excessive) -- and the complete non-availability of others
                                         .     (3)
        could have serious consequences.


        One final aspect of economic efficiency concerns the flow of funds represent-
        ed by themselves.       Taxation from road vehicle sources comes mainly
        from the disposable income of the relatively affluent and from the gross
        revenues of companies.        Insomuch that the former source is tapped some
        positive   di~ributional   consequences could be achieved, though without
        necessarily implying gains in economic efficiency; while vehicle taxatic::in
        raised from companies would have a high probability of representing lost

                70% on heavy trucks and 135% on cars. Since the prime
                motive for the variation in the rate charged seems to be
                whether or not a locally assembled alternative of reasonable
                substitutability is available, the new policy has considerable
                distortive qualities, which are not necessarily any lesser

undesirable, attributes of average cost pricing is that it is not conducive
to the precise estimatic;in of the behefits which would accrue from capacity-
expansion pr::.pjects.   This is because average cost pricing does not provide
·any possibility of restraining the extra travel which might be attracted
(as well as newly generated) to and by the improved facility.


The amount of attracted traffic which is allowed is     c~ucial   to the benefits
that accrue from any investment the purpose of which is to provide extra
road· space.    A small amount of attracte.d traffic is generally beneficial
but more than a certain amount tends quite rapidly to cut into the benefit
potential of an improvement with the approach of traffic congestion.
(Each successive unit of attracted traffic accrues less individual benefit
than the previous unit.    It also confers progressively diminishing benefits
on those involved on the route from which it transfers and progressively
greater costs on those involved on the route to which it transfers.
Examples can even be concocted to indicate that allowance of a large

volume of attracted traffic can imply that an investment is actually dis-
advantageous· even without taking the costs of the investment into account). (1)


Attracted traffic can variously comprise (i) genuine newly generated
traffic, (ii) traffic caused to switch towards times of the day when demands
are highest, (iii) traffic occasioned by a change in the land use pattern
which the facility-improvement stimulates, (iv) existing traffic attracted
from other routes, (v) existing traffic attracted from other modes, and
(vi) traffic attracted to use the newly improved facility which previously
flowed between alternative origins and destinations.     Of these six compon-
ents, only the latter thre,e are accommodated by the type of Newtonian inter-
                                                                           2 3
actance model which is usually used in the prediction of travel patterns. ( )( )


Since the benefits from any investment are crudally dependent upon the
am.aunt of traffic attracted to it and by it, and since _the amount of such
attraction is very easily underestimated in a typical urban context, it
follows that any pricing system which restricts the amount of attracted
traffic to below that which would otherwise occur under an average pricing
regime is more conducive to successful transport investment planning




(1)    These examples could be based upon situations in which not
       all of the relevant transport modes and routes are priced
       acco7ding to marginal cost principles!

(2)    Some variants which rarely reach the applied level can accom-
       modate the first and third components. Some, such as the
       one used in this study, omit the sixth.

(3)    This could be partially responsible for that.phase of urban
       transport planning development during which attempts are
       made to quell the congestion consequent on increased d,emands
       for vehicular travel by the provision of more and more road
       space, rather than by effective demand suppression.     Caracas
       is still in thi.s phase. An extreme example is the considerable
       and expensive double-decking of Autopista del Este recently
       inaugurated in the ar_ea of Bello Monte.  Practically no
       attempts are made at the moment to restrict car travel.

         than is an average-cost pricing regime.


         If all of the potential attracted traffic could be suppressed, benefits could
         be very easy to assess precisely.     Under a regime which ensures that
         havel patterns are unaffected by facility improvements, benefits would
         simply be the cost-savings from the constant amount of traffic which uses
         the improved facility.   It is difficult to imagine such a regime, however,
         and it would necessarily imply that the full potential of any investment
         would remain unattained since the small amount of generated traffic which           I
         is positively beneficial would not materialize. (l)


         Under a regime of strict marginal cost pricing, investment planning would'

                 . simple as it would be under the previous hypotheti"cal condition
         not be as                                                         .

    L    since some attracted traffic would generally be allowed.    However, the
         fact that benefits would necessarily have a lower bound, equal to the
         ·savings which would accrue to the amount of traffic using the   fa~ility   prior

                do accrue under the present average cost-pricing regime,
                however.     New construction tends to become quite soon con-
                gested with attracted traffic so that waste occurs.      One could
                cite as an example Avenida Urdaneta which, in the late summer
                of 197 2, was almost permanently heavily congested during
                the daylight weekday hours: in 1961, the South American
                Handbook (an annual business and tourist guide produced by
                Trade and Travel Publications of the U. K.) commented on
                delights of travel on this facility in a manner which is now
                quite inappropriate. At present, the recent opening of a
.    '
                section of Avenida Bolivar enables El Silencio to be reached
1               from Plaza Venezuela in five minutes at the height of the
                peak hour·~    It is suspected that the benefits (about 7 minutes
                per journey versus the previous minimum time-path) will be
                progressively whittled away by the attraction of additional
                traffic in the absence of any restraint mechanism.

occur.


 However, the variants of road user charging which are suggested in this
 study fall short of the strict marginal social cost pricing system which
would permit the. kind of initial sifting that was mentioned in the previous
 paragraph.     Such a system would require that each road link would be
 considered to be a candidate for individual investment expenditure and
 should be able to be individually and spe.cifically priced.


 The argument which has been presented above is an unconventional one.
 There is also a standard mode of reasoning which implies an additional
. base on which to prefer marginal cost-pricing to average cost-pricing in
 the context of the assistance which is imparted to investment planning, thus
 implying that the present Caracas pricing system is     relativ~ly   lacking.
 If a road link gene.rates large volumes of road price revenues it is evidence
 that demand .to use tha~ link is so intense that vehicles are interacting with
 each other and imposing positive short-run marginal costs in spite of being
 called upon to account for th_e consequences of their actions.       A signal
 would thereby be thrown up to   ~dicatethat the long-run marginal costs may
                                         2
 lie below the short-run marginal costs ( > so that to meet travel demands
 by investing in extra capacity would be a more beneficial option than to
 tolerate the costs of vehicle inte_raction and travel pattern distortion
 associated with the limitation of capacity to its pre-existing level.
 The signals may be viewed as an additional variety of initial sifting.




 (1)     Attracted traffic would be allowed until the extra revenue
         which it would generate plus the product of the amount of such
         traffic and one half of the extent to which the prior margin!i!-1
         cost exceeds the subsequent marginal cost is equal to the re-
         duction in the total cost which the pre-existing traffic would
         enjoy because of the improvement.

 (2)     But generally, it may be -..expected that large revenue intakes
         would correlate highly with densely utilized central areas
         where road space provision is excessively costly.




                                     -175-
The indications of such signals would be of reduced authority to the
 extent that   11
                    preparedness to pa/ 1 high road prices is held not necessarily
 to imply that the consumer of road space is engaged upon travel of high
 social merit.


This additional variety of initial sifting is of little relevance to the type of
 schemes suggested for initial application to Caracas.         Revenues may be
high because a small part of CBD road space is in high demand, but here
 capacity expansion costs could be high as well.         To expand capacity
 somewhere in the CBD capable .of accommodating relatively cheap extra
 road space may be a waste of resources.           Even were roads individually
 priced within the CED neither type of initial sifting would be a valid guide
 to the best investment opportunities since no comparable information would
 be available for otht::r roads elsewhere in the city which have to compete
for investment funds.


It is concluded that the current average-cost pricing regime in Caracas is
 of little assistance to the city's transport planners as a guide to profitable
 investment opportunities relative marginal-cost road-pricing applied
 specifically to each road link.        Even schemes that incorporate marginal-
 cost pricing principles in a less specific form, such a-s the imposition of
 a supplementary licence to enter designated (and congested) areas         of   the
 city, would not be of help.


 3. 3. 3   Equity,       The equity characteristics of the present system of road
user charges are somewhat to one side of the main theme of this study.
Nevertheless, equity should not be neglected e.ven in a developing country
which properly tends to weigh efficiency and growth-maximization more
heavily than equity,         Such beliefs ·are consistent with many aspects of
. Venezuelan social and economic practices, and are at times overtly present
 in public-sector decision-making.


 Equity has two dimensions - - horizontal equity and vertical equity.           In
this study the two broad headings have been treated rather casually.




                                         ~176-
Under horizontal equity is discussed the extent to which the current pricing
regime causes the owners of road vehicles to pay to the public sector for
what the public sector spends on them; and under vertical equity is briefly
discussed the extent to which the present pricif?-g regime makes those with
greater financial resources pa:Y- more for any given volume of goods or
services than those with lesser. financial resources.


Horizontal equity demands that those who are deemed to qualify for equal
treatment are not subjected to inappropriate differentiation.          It is an
easy assumption to make that each of the various vehicles in a traffic
stream qualify for equal treatment.          It is less easy to admit to any partic-.
ular structure of inequality and to make such a structure/the basis upon
which an equity comparison should be developed.            This would be required
were vertical equity the guiding principle.         Most would agree that a

of the allocation of fortune is a difficult task . ...._


Horizontal Equity.      Conventionally, an appraisal of a transport pricing
regime compares the disbursements to the public exchequer by different
categories of road user (by      ~ype   of vehicle operated) with the costs borne
publicly which can be allocated to each category.          In this study the
conventional approach was given ·the most attention but a marginal basis of
comparison was allowed too.          This latter approach has close similarities
with the efficiency-denominated rationale for road pricing.


In Section 2. 4. 3, it was reasoned that the marginal road-surface wear-and-
tear costs imposed by vehicle usage in Caracas are typically something
like Bs. O. 01 per vehicle per kilometer.         It is highly probable that the
costs incurred vary substantially with vehicle axle-loading and, to a lesser
degree, with the physi'cal dimensions of the vehide concerned, especially
in   Car~cas   conditions where the accent seems to be upon repair rather



                                        -177-
than on preventive maintenance and generous construction techniques.
The amounts paid in the form of fuel duty average quite a good .absolute
representation of the marginal wear-and-tear costs imposed in total so
that, on an overall basis, roa~ users in Caracas can be said to ~e equit-
ably charged for travel on uncongested roads (such wear-and-tear costs
being the only srgniffrant marginal cost element).             However, within road
users themselves, considerable inequality prevails.              A gasoline-powered
Mercedes Benz 280 would be paying some Bs. 0. 0175 per kilometer in fuel
duty whereas a large Fiat diesel driven lorry would pay something like
Bs. O. 0003 per kilometer.      The marginal wear-and-tear costs imposed
by the latter would be likely to exceed very much those imposed by the
former.    This illustration is, perhaps, an extreme one but it serves to
illuminate the point.


On congested roads, the dominant component of marginal costs comprise
the costs of delay imposed upon other vehicle users.             Of such costs almost
none are paid by road users under the current regime.               In a gros.s average
sense it could be maintained that congestion costs are imposed by            roa~

users upon road users so that equality necessarily prevails; however, even
this argument would implicitly ignore the costs imposed by road users
upon general urban area users in the form of noise, atmospheric pollution,
and the like.


Because the congestion costs imposed by each vehicle are proportional to
a passenger-car-unit (p. c. u.) equivalent of the vehicle concerned, consider-
able inequality prevails at the marginal level from a system of charging
which rriakes no vehicle pay any of the congestion costs for which, it is
responsible.    For instance, the entry of a bus onto a congested road
typically costs pre-existing road users in delay thrice the cost involved
from the entry of ·a car. (1)   In   Ve~ezuela   such   fu~l   taxes as do exist



(1)    In this instance, however, although the. car is unfairly treated
       relative to the bus, each of the persons in the bus is very likely
       to be unfairly treated relative to each of the persons in the car .
       since the number of the former usually: exceeds the number of·
       the latter.

diesel-powered buses and trucks, i.e. the present system runs counter
to that which is equitable on congested roads.


In Appendix 11, the current account expenditures disbursed in 1970 on
maintaining the facilities used by vehicles in Caracas are allocated between
various vehicle types.   Table 3. 33 draws this information tog.ether with
an estimate of the comparable payments to the public sector which would
have then been made by Caraqueno vehicle owners under the present pay-
ments regime.     It permits a comparison to be made as to how much the
owners of and users of   ~ach   category of vehicle pay to public agencies for
what they are directly costing such agencies.
                                         .    {
                                                Any meaningfulness of
of such a comparison is impugned, however, by the following consideration:

          (i)        No allowance was made for the ca~italized
                     value of the road space occupied;( )  ·.

          (ii)       Caraquefios use roads outside of Caracas
                     and should. be a)llocated some extra costs
                     accordingly. ( 2   The converse is true
                     also but is probably less important.

          (iii)      The allocation of track and ancilliary costs
                     to each vehicle type is a somewhat arbitrary
                     procedure in practice since no benefit mea-
                     sures are generally available by means of
                     which s.uch allocation can be accomplished.

From Table 3. 33 it can be deduced that all vehicle types are over-burdened;
except for PPT.    Goods vehicles pay more than twice as much as they

 disadvantaged in the long run by the inequitable charging structure given
 the competitive c:onditions which prevail in Caracas.      The sufferers
 wou.ld tend to be those who pay more than they need for the goods and
 services that such bodies hire out.


~,,On a relative basis, both the bus and PPT modes are favored, while' .cars
 and goods vehicles are excessively burdened.       However, to make any
 worthwhile c·onclusion from the sets of figures presented may be an over-
 ambitious task in the light of the data qualifications mentioned aboye and
 other relevant considerations which are implicitly ignored by the method
 . of comparison, . e.g. perhaps car-owners can gain more than others from
 the standby reserve capacity which the road system offers, e_ven though they
 may but rarely make use of it; and, supposedly, an opposite tendency
 would be implied by the higher amounts of other (non-road use related)
 taxation which car-owners pay and the (presumably) lesser amounts which
  are spent on them compared with non-car-owners.


 Table 3. 3 3 does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the hori-
  zontal equity of the present charges system within each of the four
  categories of vehicle analyzed.     Although cars, buses and PPT are quite
 homogeneous groups, goods vehicles certainly are not. In Caraca::i, they
 range from small Lambretta tricycle-vans up to large Fiat and Mack.
  spoil trucks which are use.d on construction and demolition site work,
  although some even .larger inter-urban articulated truck,..trains are some-
  times seen, especially on the autopistas.     A Lambretta might pay

former sum is 11. 2, and is this high because the taxation system in force
in Caracas (ap.d in Venezuela} requires that owners of high-weight goods
vehicles. pay an inflated levy which dominates the amount paid in fuel duty.
This results in a highly weight-progressive structure ..

 In Caracas, car-owners have· much higher incomes than       non-car-own~rs,

 the respective median monthly incomes of the families concerned being,
 in 196 6, Bs. 2, 015 and Bs. 867.   This is consistent with their relatively
 high payments for the highway services that they receive.      Within the
  category of cars itself the present rating structure for registration and the
·~.differential fuel duty tariff(!) varies progressively with income. ( 2 )
 Inasmuch as the highest income brackets tend to own the most heavy cars,
 which often demand quite high octane fuel.


 The vertical equity of the charges raised on other vehicles is less easy
 to comment upon because the present operators are not affected as they
 can pass on any excess that they may be called upon to pay and would con-
 sequently get no gain outside of the short-run from any under-payment.
 Although many of the charges levied affect fixed costs and do not vary with
 vehicle utilization, any raising .of such charges would affect the number of
 operators involved.    The present system does effectively result in more
 PPT and fewer buses than if the payments versus costs ratios for each of
                             3
 these categories of vehicle( ) were equal to each other and set at unity.
 The income distrib_utive effects of the present system is favorable to the
 extent that the net demand for unskilled labor is larger than otherwise
 would be.    Depending upon the individual interpretation of the relevant
 utilities, ·it could be, however, that this favorable effect is counterbalanced
 in reality by a higher standard· of services provided for PPT travellers and
 a lower standard of services provided for the less affluent bus travellers.

         78 percent of PPT charges are trip-dependent (Table 3. 31).
         It is believed, however, that so competitive is the PPT industry
         that a small change in its cost structure could markedly affect
         industry size-..

3. 3. 4    Administrative Facility

Pndoubtedly the· overall administrative framework governing the road trans-
portation section 'in Venezuela is complica.ted. (l)    Not only are a number
Qf     different agencies involved, such as the Ministry of Communications,
the Ministry of Public Works,        The Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons,
                                                                                   1.

and the local governments, resulting in coordination problems; but in the
agencies themselves procedures are by no means always simple.               This   II
section evaluates within this framework the administrative convenience,
enforceability and cost of current road ~ser charges in Caracas. ( )
                                                                  2

Thdse problems associated with convenience and cost are viewed from
 both the user's and the pub lie administrator's standpoints ..


· Vehicle Fuel and Lubricants Tax (National).      This tax, levied and admin-
istered by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons, is the most convenient
of all road user charges to collect and supervise.      This is because it is
paid by the small number of vehicle fuel and lubricant producers in the
 country in accordance with their domestic sales to distributors.      It is
believed that this tax is not administratively burdensome to .the producers.
One inconvenience related to the chC3.rge is that revenue figures maintained
by the Ministry of Mines are not submitted, say, to the Directorate of
Ground Transportation for centraliz.ed data proGessing and publication to-
gether with other road user revenue figures.        But this observation is not
only relevant to the fu'el tax; it is one that applies to most road user
charges levied in Venezuela.


This fuel tax is simple to enforce since the Ministry of Mines has, in any

           charges and budgeting.

           cost figures.

case, to monitor carefully the production of refined petroleum products
and their sales both overseas and in the domestis:: market.         And because
the tax 1s convenient and simple to administer, the cost to the public
sector of imposing it and to the private sector of making paymen!s, is
low in each case.


Vehicle Registration (National).    The Directorate of Ground Transportation
carries out this legal requirement in an efficient manner without causing
much inconvenience to vehicle owners.        The   regis~ration   form that the
owner has to complete is quite simple and, on payment of the registration
fee, he receives two copies of the form -- one to be kept in the vehicle
and the other to be kept safely elsewhere as proof of vehicle ownership.
He also receives vehicle plates with the vehicle registration number clearly
stamped and painted on them.       In years past, during the 1960 1 s, coded
windshield !!stickers" were _issued thereby voiding the necessity to change
the registration plates.   This method, though saving the government the
cost of new plates, made enforcement more difficult as the stickers tended
to· disintegrate before the year's end (especially if they were not correctly
affixed to the front windshield and rear window) while an ever-increasing
number of vehicle plates were lost, or were stolen.


Vehicles are required to be registered annually over a short period usually
at a year's end or beginning.    This method is fairly costly in      manpow~r

charges for additional physical facilities. A less expensive procedure
would be to spread the registration period over the whole year with the·
registration plates (or stickers) showing clearly the date of expiration. (l)

at least in the CMA, have been computerized.        The scheme was initiated
after storing in the computer all details of 1971 vehicle registrations
in the jurisdiction, (as well as new and re-sold vehicle registrations issued
                                                                                    ·I
during that   year)~   In spite of the existence of this more   eff~cient   data-
processing and information retrieval system . vehicle owners are not re-
quired to validate their addresses on the registration forms where they
themselves of their vehicles can be·found; nor are telephone numbers                ·I
required.     Consequently, the Directorate of Ground Transportation is
not able to check the accuracy of addresses by means of a sample telephone
survey; nor can it easily trace defaulters who failed to pay fines on the
issue of citations, either through the mail system (l) or by visits of
inspectors; and, in the event_ of the recovery of stolen vehicles, it fails
to notify the owners promptly, if at all.


It is understood that the convenience and cost to the Directorate of Ground
Transportation of vehicle registration requirements is not onerous.
Undoubtedly the cost will increase if, and when, the registration information
for vehicles throughout the country is located in a central computer.
However, the benefits derived from such a system should do much to
warrant the additional costs.

Driver's Licenses (National).      From interviews with various vehicle
drivers, having different levels of education, it would seem that the
requiremeµ.ts both to pass a driver's examination and to complete the
form to obtain an initial licence call, for a detailed knowledge of the
traffic law and regulations;     Although the Directorate of Ground Trans.:.
portation publishes a pamphlet that describes the law and regulations in
fairly simple language, for the many less educated members of the
population the requirements are ofteri beyond their capabilities.           Thus
candidates are frequently tempted to suborn the authorities.         In these



                                             '
(1)    The mail system in Venezuela is known to be slow and
       somewhat unreliable.




                                     -186-
circumstances, the issue of an initial licence can be considered potentially
costly from the social standpoint, and highly inconvenient, if it results in
an incompetent driver in legal possession of a vehicle on the road.


Both initial and renewed driver's licences are first issued in the form of
a provisional document (a "comprobante") that includes the finger-print
of the driver.     This document is valid for six months.    However,. the
issue pf the permanent (three year) plastic-enclosed licence is not usually
available for up to one year,    Thus the majority of provisional licence
holders are required to return to the licencing office (of which there are
four in the CMA) to extend the validity period of the provisional document.
Because of the time lost in queuing, many drivers fail to meet this require-
ment and thus drive illegally.    In short, the procedures necessary to
obtain the licence are not designed for the convenience of the motorist, and
can be costly to him in loss of time or in terms of fees unless he e:rp.ploys
a private agen_t to obtain the document on his behalf.


A 11 information on issued licences are filed in chronological order in a
central office.    If a driver wants a lost licence replaced, and has not__
taken note· of the date of issue of the odginal, much time is lost in the
search for the relevant records.     This situation is costly and inconvenient
both to the motorist, who is prohibited from driving meanwhile, and to the
. staff of the Directorate of Ground Transportation.     These considerations
tend to increase the incidence of drivers' failure to renew their licences
(or replace lost ones) at the proper time to the detriment of road user
            ( 1)
revenues.

Enforcement, as in most countries, is not very effective.       It is confined
only to those drivers who are stopped for an infraction of the traffic
regulations, or in the case of accidents at which times the national traffic

       the request for renewal; it is not in accord with the termina-
       tion date of the previous licence.




                                    -187-
police normally inspect all road user documents pertaining to drivers
and their vehicles.       During the last decade no spot-checks of licences
                                                                                     I
have ever been carried out in Caracas.


Fines (National).       As mentioped earlier, (l) citations are issued by the
national traffic police for traffic infractions; and the amount of the
resu1ting fines varies with the gravity of the infraction.        The citation is
such that the police have to note an excessive amount of information about
the vehicle, which not only is time consuming and therefore costly, 'but
for some police, with a low level of education, is sometimes beyond their
capability.   Many ticket recipients fail to pay the fines within the pre-
scribed period since there is no extra penalty for defaulters.          In fact,
there is an advantage in not paying in accordance with regulations since
_it is .costly in terms of time (or messenger-service charges) to visit the
police station (Inspectorfa de Transtto) during working hours to settle the
outstanding fine.       Fines may not be paid by mail.       On the other hand, if
ticket recipients wait until they register their vehicles they can pay at
                                   ---                   .
one time for all tickets issued to them during the year with the off-chance
that, through lax administrative procedures, all the fines may not appear
                    .                        ( 2)
on the books as outstanding payments.


Clearly the existing procedures are cumbersome, inconvenient to police
officers in the field, weak from the enforcement standpoint, and lead to
the subornation of officials.       These factors cause loss of revenues from
this source without substantially reducing related administrative costs.

(2)    Also there is the chance that an unscrupulous police officer
      'may assign spurious fines to a vehicle owner and pocket the
       ill-gained revenue. In such cases, the owner is defenseless
       as he cannot prove that the citations were not issued to him.
       Thus, over a period of years, the cost of spurious fines can
       compensate on average for the failure to enforce the payment
       of genuine fines,

The resultant general lack of respect for citations as an effective means
of enforcement must be taken as a contributory factor to the undisciplined
driving behavior evident in the CMA; and, in turn, makes for an inefficient
use of the road space and costly accidents.


Cargo Licences (National).    Little information was readily available about
the procedures and administrative cost of issuing these licences.        It is
likely, however, that administrative costs are high relative to the small
income derived. (1)    For trucks travelling to other cities, enforcement
is effected at check points along state boundaries outside of the CMA;
while within the CMA checks are only made in the case of     ac~idents     or
traffic infringements.

                                                                         . I
Quarterly Registration Fees (Municipal).      Provided the vehicle owners
cooperate with the municipal authorities by registering their vehicles in
the municipal jurisdiction of their domicile, it can be held that the fees
                                                     2
are convenient to collect. As mentioned earlier, ( ) this was certainly
not the case during the l_ast decade in the two jurisdictions (Federal and
Sucre distriCts) of which the CMA forms a part.      In fact the quarterly
registration form, which is filled up by the municipal staff, has space not
only for the vehicle owner's name, vehicle type and plate number all of
which are noted, but there is also space for the owner's telephone number,
address and identity ·card number, none of which are typically entered.
Thus the municipalities operating in the CMA, through their own fault,
lack the necessary information to make follow-up surveys to check the

  Now that the Directorate of Ground Transportation is making greater
  efforts to see that the national registration of vehicles accords with
  the domicile of vehicle owners, the fiscal income of the municipalities
  from quarterly registration fees has increased considerably since the
  national registration cannot be effected until the quarterly. registration has
  been completed and paid for.    Nevertheless, it is clear that at present
  the method employed for quarterly registrations is not          conven~ent   to the
  authorities and is virtually unenforceable.   Consequently, there has been
                                                                   2
  a large loss of municipal revenues· in the past as noted above. ( ) The

  municipal vehicle registrations have been recently cornputeriZed( ) which

  convenience, as well as in terms of cost reductions.


  It has not been possible to obtain cost estimates for the municipal.regis-
  tration of vehicles since the municipal accounts are not disaggregated
  sufficiently to meet this requirement.         However it is almost certain that
  the cost effectiveness of municipal registration is higher than that of the

          owner's domiciles, since they are content with their additional
          income.

          the beginning of 1973 will relate to 1972.

is primarily regulatory while that of the latter is revenue-raising ..


A utobus Charges (Municipal).    Although this charge is convenient and cheap
for the municipal aµthorities to ..collect and for the bus companies to pay,
payment of the charge is difficult to enforce because the regulations have
changed substantially, in such a way that many buses during past years
have been exempted from their provisibns.         Enforcement is thus haphazard
in the CMA, and is only effective at check points along state boundaries
for those buses registered in the CMA that are routed to destinations beyond
it.   Since the charge is now levied only on those buses that have a need to
carry standees in excess of their seating capacities, the enforcement of
the charge, in practice, can only be effective if a bus is carrying standees.
Nevertheless, it would seem that many of the CMA 's public companies do
in fact conform with the regulqtions and    p~y   the charge since in 1971
revenue from this source reached almost Bs. 380. 000 (Table 3. 25) or about
Bs. 148. 00 per vehicle.


Parking Meter Charges (Municipal).        The system used in the Federal
District(l J to collect meter payments each day and deliver them to the
municipal authorities, is simple, convenient and effective.       Road users
also experience few problems with this type of on-:-street parking charge
mechanism.     The most prevalent weakness is that meters are poorly .
maintained resulting both in a considerable loss of revenue fo the munici-
palities, and in the use of on-street parking spaces for long-term instead
of short-term periods.


Excise Tax (Municipal).    This 0. 1 percent tax on new vehicle sales is
estimated from the books of retail outlets.       Like most sales taxes, it is
fairly cheap and convenient to collect.     However, enforcement is

complicated by the fact that some retail outlets are able to adjust their
sales records to show higher used-car sales and lower new-car sales in
order to lessen the burden of the tax.


Summary of Administrative Facility Considerations."- In short. the
national fuel and lubricants tax is the most convenient, enforceable and
cheap road-user charge to collect from the point of view of both the public
authorities and the payor.    Being a trip-dependent tax it is a charge on
vehicular travel, and not on vehicle ownership; thus it more truly reflects
a charge for the use of roads.    National vehicle registration and drivers'
licences, serving more a regulatory than a revenue-raising function, though
administered reasonably cheaply and enforced fairly thoroughly, could
benefit from modifications to improve levels of convenience and the
systematization of relevant rates that would go some way to ensure that
vehicle owners register in the correct jurisdictions.


 At the municipal level, qua.rterly vehicle registration-...and enforcement
·procedures are lax.    Sin_ce this charge is potentially a substantial
revenue-raising instrument, this factor in the past has caused a large loss
of revenue, inconvenience to all concerr;iec;l. and more expensive adminis-
trative costs than need be the case.


Basic requirements to improve standards of convenience, enforceaqility
and administrative· economy should include greater efforts to coordinate
the operations of all public agencies involved in the collection of road user
 charges; and the centralization of revenue data and statistics (and those
related,
    .,   if possible, to road-user costs as well) is one essential step to

CHAPTER 4:      A POSSIBLE PRICING SYSTEM FOR ROAD USE
                IN THE CAR.ACAS METROPOLITAN AREA



4.1   ROAD PR.ICING: OPPORTUNITIES AND POTENTIALITIES

Section 3. 3 indicated that present road user taxes and changes in the CMA;
based, as in most countri~s, on gross arid indirect measures of roadway
use, are   s~riously   deficient in terms of promoting efficiency of roadway
use! as well as being discriminatory in their impact on alternative types
of use, while being of limited value or even misleading for purposes of
investment' planning, and in many cases ir!-volving fruitless administrative
complexity.    Though it may be that the pattern of charges and taxes is
relatively more   sa~isfactory   for Venezuela as a whole than for the CMA,
it is improbable that there are many countries that would appear under
examination in much better light, especially with respect to user charging
mechanisms that promote the economic _efficiency of road ·use and are of
assistance in investment planning.      Improvements to meet these last two
criteria, as will be enlarged on below, inevitably call for a radical depart-
ure from the average cost-pricing concept to one embracing short-run
marginal social-cost principles, since only mechanisms within this letter
category tend to produce efficient patterns of comsumption.      To date, no
governmental jurisdiction anywhere has yet implemented such a road-user
charges regime; this is partly for technical, but m~stly for political reasons.


In contrast, improvements to administrative facility and, to some extent, to
equity, can be achieved through adjustments within the traditional frame-
work of average cost-pricing mechanisms.        Also fiscal balance, in a quali-
fied form, can be obtained if thought desirable.     For instance, a sense of
fiscal balance at the Federal Government level in the U.S.A. is maintained
between income from road vehicle fuel duties and outlays for new transport
infrastructure development, traditionally in highways, by means of the
Highway Trust Fund which receives and shares out the funds.        There. fiscal
balance·is addressed much more to the longer-term prqblem of providing
                                                                        I

resources to build new facilities.     Fiscal balance is maintained by scaling

                                                                                   a\
_investment to income, and to some extent vice-versa.      This practice,
however, is not necessarily even compatible with an optimal highway
system, much less conducive to a balanced highway program, since when
charges are set without the discipline of competition, charges set at high
levels can yield ·r...evenues exceeding costs without this indicating that more
facilities are desirable, and when they are set at low levels charges can
fall short of costs without indicating that facilities are excessive.    Thus
even when fiscal balance is interpreted to include fixed-cost outlays, it is
not likely to be conducive to meeting the short-run problem of making the
best use of existing road facilities.


On the other hand, both Venezuela and the U. K. discard the notion of short-
term and long-term fiscal balance in road usage.       In the U. K. the amounts
collected for highway usage from both the fixed tax (on vehicle ownership
via vehicle licences) and the variable tax (on travel via fuel taxes) are deter-
mined by balancing considerations of collection costs, the extent to which
demand is   sensiti~   to price, and general budgetary policy. (1)   Revenue
from these sources, credited to the national Exchequer for unspecified sub-
sequent public use, substantially exceed highway expenditures even when
fixed'- cost outlays in .new construction are taken into account.    Though
Venezuela generally adheres to the U. K. model, the charges levied, at least
in the CMA, are such that the CMA exhibits a substantial negative balance
if total road expenditures are included (Table 3. 3 2); though a surplus ~s
 shown if only road maintenance and traffic management and control are
 considered.   As in the U. K., the national road taxation revenues are pal.d
. into the Treasury without limitations on their subsequent sectoral allocation.


The U. K. recognizes that its generalized· road charges regime is much more
a revenue-raising device and bears, in fact, little relation to actual   s~ort­

 run marginal costs.    This being so, surplus funds are neither taken as an

indicator of when or where additional capacity should be supplied, nor
used as in the   T_T.   S. A. as "earmarked" revenues to guide the scale of·
highway expansion irrespective of competing opportunities in other economic
sectors.      Each highway project is considered by the Exchequer. on its
economic merits, relative to projects generated within the same or other
sectors, (l) and are paid for out of the general revenue account.


In Venezuela the MOP receives an annual budget, app.roved by the govern-
ment, that covers its capital investment program in addition to its expected
                               2
administrative expenditures. ( ). Again, there is no relation between the
revenues r.aised by road user c,harges and the planned investments in new
facilities.    In a developing country this practice may be logical in many
instances, since new roads are often built for developmental purposes into
areas where traffic is at first relatively light. · They are con.structed to
spur .the development of the economic potential of a region rather than to
overcome an· immediate highw11y capacity deficit.         In such cases an attempt
to match costs with revenues during the developmental period would seriously
interfere with the full utilization of the facility and retard the development
the facility is intended to R£Omote.       l\l[oreover,_ even if it might be maintained
that in the long rul'l investments would not be justified unless the users were
prepared to pay an amount that in the aggregate would meet the costs of the
facility provided, it is often not possible to collect this amount from users
with~ut   unduly curtailing. the llSe of the facility.


Accordingly,. investment decisions for new highway projects rnust be deaJt
with in a manner som.ewhat apart from considerations of revenue derived

          the second Highway Law, 1975-78. · See Appendix 7 for a review of
          the present highway administrative system in the CMA.

from road user charges.     In areas of flow traffic density, it can be
expected that economies of scale will prevail and that therefore an
optimal level of charges on an optimal level of facility development will
yield a. fiscal deficit, while in high density areas such as the CMA one_
can expect to run into increasing costs, diseconomies of scale and a S-carcity
of space into which to put additional facilities, so that an optimal level of
charges on an optimal level of development will yield a fiscal surplus.
Nor is there any indication that such surpluses will necessarily balance
the deficits.   Fiscal balance is therefore only a very fallible guide to
investment decisions in transportation facilities.


At any given time, indeed, the appropriate approach to the determination of
t_he levels of various road user charges is to. consider past fixed investment
in roads as a "sunk" cost and to structure road user charges in si.+ch a way
that each road user pays a ·price in accord with the marginal cost he imposes
on society when using his vehicle on limited road space.     This form of
pricing would encourage individuals to make rational travel decisions
resulting in the more efficient use of road resources.     That users. be so
encouraged is of great importance in a developing area such as VenezuelCI;.
since capital (though_ relatively plentiful in comparison with most other
developing countries) is scarce given the enormous social    ~ee~s   of the nation.
If such a means could be developed to assist in the better use of existing
highway facilities, and consequently could reduce the rate of investment in
these facilities, the country would achieve both substantial savings in long-
term capital requirements and, perhaps more important, short-run economic
benefits derived from the more efficient use of existing plant.      This point
of view is very relevant in the case of the densely developed CMA where
motorists at present, because they do not pay their full travel costs (including
the loss of travel time they impose on other motorists), make trave1
decisions that provoke severe congestion costs and indirectly" bring to bear
major pressures on the public sector to provide more road capacity for more
uneconomical travel (in large' measure probably for the convenience of the
more affluent car-owning public) in an area where physical space is at a
premium, and therefore exceptionally. costly.




                                   -196-
 Whether or not pricing at levels reflecting .marginal social cost would
 generate the necessary funds to finance the long.-term supply of services
 is not pertinent in terms of efficient road space planning and utilization,
 since under fully      eff~cient   conditions revenues can be either greater or less
 than would be required.to cover costs.           In Venezuela, as In the U .K., the
                                                                   (


 construction of facilities and the provision of services can be organized and
 financed in other ways, such as by appropriations from general tax revenues,
 than oh the basis ofthe prices charged for the use of the existing plant.
 Nevertheless marginal social-cost pricing would act as an indicator to help
 determine the proportion of national resources that might be spent on
 additional facilities since, as implied above, in cases where revenues exceed
 the cost of adding to capacity, the consumer would be         ·commu~icating   his
 desire for an increase in road supply.           And since there would be a steady
 flow of funds, channelled perhaps through a single road-pricing authority·
 in any given area, the longer'.""term planning and implementation of future
 -extensions and improvements tg facilities in that area could proceed on fairly
 'Smooth lines.    Furthermore, while marginal social-cost pricing is quite
 capable 'of coping with problems artsing out of horizontal equity considerations,
 the redressing    o~   inequities in the distribution of income cariJ?e more effectively
 and efficiently dealt with by means other than providing reduced travel cost
 rates to those deemed in need .


. The application of marginal social-cost pricing therefore supposes that }:iigh-
 way authorities
              .  would need to reduce their.
                                             initial preoccupation with th_e role.
 of pricing as a means of financing the supply of services and, to a lesser
 extent, with its distributional effects over the community.           Stress instead
 would be given to the imposition of charges at marginal cost levels such
 that users, in choosing the amount and manner of their use of road facilities,
 would prqperly balance their: own gains derived from- the alternatives avail.-
 able against the burdens they would consequently.place on the rest of the
 community.       Once highway systems are functioning efficiently, public
 authorities would find themselves in a position to turn their attention logically
 to solutions of longer-term problems.

       Since the concept marginal social-cost pricing would appear to present
       a number of very favorabl'e advantages as an important component of road
       user charges, especially in a congested city such as Caracas, it is approp-
       riate at this juncture to discuss, in so~e detail, yet briefly, its theoretical
       underpinning.


       Under average cost-pricing conditions a decision to use a road facility is
       made when the potential benefits to be derived are gre:;ater than the antici-
        pated priv8:te trip-dependent costs of an intended journey (including the trip-
       makers travel time as well as his vehicle costs).          In this situation traffic
        flow reaches an equilibrium ?-t a point where additional vehicles to the now
        enjoy benefits just equal to their private costs.    Where congestion exists,
        however, this level of equilibrium is not one that produces an efficient
; '.
        utilization of road space, since typically rhore traffic is attracted to the
       · facility than it is capable of dealing with optimally.     This occurs because
       the price paid for travel, comprising only private costs and excluding any
       ·considerations of costs thrust on other us.ers, is unrealistically low.
        The result is that the demand-price refations'hip for travel produces an
        excessive, and therefore suboptimal, quantity of travel relative to facility
        capacity.     In theory, an optimal equilibrium would be reached .if road users,
        in addition to their private costs, paid for the marginal sncial. cost of their
        travel,     This social cost is composed, on the one hand, of the extra time
        and vehicle operating costs that vehicles entering the traffic stream cause
        to all other vehicles in the traffic stream (costs that vary directly wHh levels
        of congestion);   and, on the other, of the marginal track maintenance and
        administrative costs (which can be considered constant on a travel basis for
        each vehicle of any given type on a given facility).      Travel time is usually
        the most significant component in the composition of social cost;         and in
        city streets in near-congested conditions, this cost component is very
  i~
        considerable.


        If all these component social costs were to be evaluated at the margin, and
        each vehicle were charged accordingly by the highway authority, a road
        user would be compelled to anticipate ·his true cost of travel including his

t rip-                                         The imposition of a charge covering
these short-run marginal costs would then tend to result in what may be
termed the "optimal economic capacity" of a road or road network.                  This
                                                                     11
capacity is defined, for a given composition of traffice, as              the level of
traffic flow (in a road network) at which those who find it least worthwhile
to use the network receive net benefits equal to the costs imposed by them
                                 3
on the rest of the traffic 11 • ( ) Thus a motorist would only enter the network
and    tak~   the shortest route if he anticipated net benefits for his intended
journey; if he anticipated net disbenefit he might seek a less congested
(and therefore lower-priced) route, or seek a different mode of travel, or
defer the journey to another time of day, or e\Ten cancel it.              Consequently
the introduction of the marginal social-cost element in the pricing of road
travel would encourage road users to make their own travel decisions in
such a way that the aggregate result would tend to optimize the net benefits
that the road network can. potentially generate

away for the moment constraints that other criteria, such as ease of admin-
istration may impose.          Its introduction would also provide an indication of.
the strength of demand for road space according to location and thereby
provide guidance in the planning of new facilities.




(1)       Not only the time component, but also the vehicle operating
          component of private costs tends to _rise with levels of congestion
          as indicated in Section 2;4.1.

( 2)      The true cost of road travel (marginal social cost plus private
          cost) is the road pri-ce a road user would pay if the marginal
          social cost were charged. Some authorities define the term
          '1r,oad pricing 11 ac.cordingly. In 'this study " (congest ion) charge"
          and 11 price" are both used to refer to a tariff equivalent to the
          marginal social-cost element only.        Generally the term
           1        11
          ' charge     is used when the tariff is viewed from the standpoint
          of the public authority imposing it, and 11 price 11 is used when
          it is viewed from the standpoint of the motorist paying it.

 It is not known to what extent demand for road space varies with the price
 of travel.   All that can be said with certainty is that the relationship is
 inverse (as the price increases, demand falls) and that for any given road-
 way segment and for any gj.ven period during the week statistics can he
- obtained describing dema.rrd at the current "price", wl).ich includes both the
 money cost and the congestion cost of travel.         Unfortunately, however, the
 demand that would exist at other prices can only be guessed at with a
 considerable degree of uncertainty, based on reasonable assumptions concern-
 ing the way traffic will divide among alternative modes and the way the
 total number of trips will respond to changes in costs.        Given this uncertainty
 about demand-price relationships - - or in other words, about the demand
 function or curve -- it is impossible to calculate with precision the optimal
                      '
 economic capacity of a facility, even though. private tra'vel costs may be
 thoroughly detailed, since the demand curve, which can also vary from place
 to place and time to time, plays a critical role in the combination of vehicle
 speed and flow that characterizes optimal capacity.         The corollary is that
 there is no way of estimatiag precisely the short-run marginal costs of
 travel on the facility at optimal flow if the latter is unspecified; and consequent-
 ly, it is not possible to estimate in advance with a high degree of certainty
 the amount of a congestion charge, equal to short-run marginal costs
 capable of restraining
              .                                                   . econom.ic
                        road use to a level consistent with. optimal
 flow at which point net benefits accruing to the community are maximized.


 The fact that it is infeasible to predict precisely the optimal economic flow
 on   a   facility in a given context, and thus its corollary, the congestion
 charge to achieve it, does not mean that some rough approximation of an
 optimal charge in a given context cannot be obtained.         One could, for instance,
 hypothesize a series of demand curves straddling likely demand possibilities
 each having a different proportionate response of changes in quantity to
 changes in price;   in other words, each having a different elasticity of
 demand.      These curves, in conjunction   wi:~h   traffic speed-flow and private
 travel cost data, would enable a range to be obtained of optimal economic

probability of simulating reality sufficiently well to guide policy and to
initiate the application of a charge prior to empirical calibration or
"tuning" of the charge in the field, in the light of experience with actual
charges, to obtain practical optimality.


An alternative method, the one employed in this study, would be to assume
a fixed aggregate demand for trips by all modes between origins and
destinations and evaluate, using transportation modelling techniques, the
impact on travel behavior, and the corresponding net benefits derived of
applying a range of congestion charges on the highway network.          Logically,
the charge that induces maximum net benefits would indicate the achieve-
ment of optimal economic usage of the network under the given assumptions.
.                                       -
This could be taken as the charge to be recommended to initiate a scheme
in practice.      This method does suffer from the drawback that the assump-
tion of a fixed aggregate of trips does not take account of the probable
reduction in trip demand across all modes during the time period under

             -
analysis (typically the peak period) following the application of a new charge.
While it is likely that the potential loss to th€ shifting users from a shift to
alternative times or to alternative means of accomplishing the objectives
would be small, since the trips involved are .close to the margin, and the
    potential benefits to persisting users would be relatively large as a result
    of the improved travel. speeds and the larger number of individuals involved,
it is unlikely that the total number of peak hour trips by all modes would
show a sufficiently large decline in the face of road pricing so that the
adjustment required to the .optimal level of pricing, determined on the basis
of an assumed fixed total of trip frequencies., because of an actual change
in total trips, would be small.      Most of the reduction in peak hour traffic
would result from changes in mode of travel rather than changes in time

of travel or changes in the total number of trips, and would thus be
accounted for in the estimates prepared on the basis of modal split models.


Methods such as these of calculating optimal congestion charges deal
baslc.ally with the comparisons of savings resulting from gains in travel
spe-ed and losses from vehicles driven off the road(l) by the charge levied.
The price paid is not a community cost; it is merely a transfer from one
sector of the community to another.         However the savings resulting from
the imposition of the charge are real savings, since a higher level of
efficiency in the use ·of road space is obtained by restraining those obtaining
the least benefit from its employment in order to enable more of th~ space
to be placed at the disposal of those able to reap .higher benefits from its
utilization.


The method of imposing the charge is irrelevant to these calculations insofar
as the charge on the consumer, implied by each method, is constant.
However, since in practice charging methods vary in their ability to cope
       -....
well with consumers at any given level of disaggregation, they dictate to
a great extent the degree of consumer specificity and the gradation in
related charges that can be applied.        In other words, some methods are
much coarser, or aggregative, in their application than others.          Thus an
apprisal of alternative charging methods,      le~ding   to the selection of one
that seems best for the CMA in the short term, is an appropriate step
prior to evaluating an optimal set of charges to apply, and the benefits der-
ived therefrom.


4. 2           CHARGING METHODS INVESTIGATED

This study, concerned with road user charges in Caracas, has as one of

The charging methods investigated can be categorized as follows:

            1.        Those acting upon stationary vehicles·.

            2.       Those acting directly upon moving vehicles, of

4. 2.1   Charges on Stationary Vehicles

These methods comprise charges levied on parked vehicles that cover,
not only the     trad~tional   cost components of parking, but also a rough
approximation of congestion costs caused by a vehicle's trips to and
from the parking facility.         These systems need no new· or untried collect-
ion devices since the levying of charges on parked vehicles to reflect costs
other than marginal social travel-costs is already widespread and of long
standing.      This is a decided advantage; another is the fact that no new
concept needs to be instilled into the minds of consumers.         Any new
concept would be likely to be both politically and socially less acceptable
than a modification to an existing one.


The rationale behind the use of the pricing of parking as a means of raising
charges to reflect the social costs of travel lies in the correlation between
the use of congested road space and the use of high-priced parking space.
The correlatio11 is. not always strong: (l) for instance, traffic passing through
the CBD en route to an outside destination would be responsible for con-
gestion but could not efficiently be made to pay the full costs involved through

imply the over-charging of traffic not using CBD road space.       This
consideration is the major criticism of the use of parking tariffs as a
means of levying traffic congestion tolls.


At present, the raison d '·etre of operative schemes has more to do with the
maximization of the return from a "plot of.central urban land or, in some
cases, with a concept of increased turnover and enforcement of time limits
(allegedly, on occasion for the benefit of adjacent merchants) rather than
with the maximization of community welfare.       In Caracas, official policy
does not acknowledge the resultant conflict.     The essential difference
 between currently-operative parking schemes and ones which are designed
to achieve social objectives lies within the realm of tariff structure.     It
                                                                                  1

 Control of On-Street and Publicly-Owned Off-Street Parking.       A general
 statement that schemes which intrude less upon private sector activity
 are preferred to others, ceteris paribus, would meet with little challenge.
 Publicly accepted norms would be left unviolated and thus the chances of
 social and political acceptability would be raised.   On a more positive level,
. legislative complexities would be lessened.    The scheme outlined below
 should desirably have ,associated with it, however, some means of indirect
 manipulation.   The latter would be via overall planning control and via
 company income taxation.     'To allow the private sector too much freedom

 resources would be wasted.


 Parking could be. allowed on those parts of urban thoroughfares where no
 serious conflict occurs with the movement of traffic.     This would be likely

 Caracas.   Generally, the constraints upon urban traffic flow are dictated
by intersection rather than by roadway conditions.      It would be likely to

 be let out to adjacent land occupants on condition that they act in such a way.

 Tt is difficult to enforce upon users of on-street parking space a charge
which adequately reflects the congestion costs of travel.      A simple expedient
 to serve as an alternative to the possibility mentioned in the previous   pa~a­

 graph would be to allow curb parking for periods of up to, say, two hours,
with no extension allowed though it might be difficult to prevent determined
 drivers ·from, in effect, gaining extensions by subsequently relocating their
 vehicles in vacant spaces nearby.      The prevention of this pra.ctice is made
 more difficult with the desirability of maintaining a curb-side vacancy rate
                     2
 conveniently high. ( ) In general, however, the available curb-side space
. would be of little use to commuters who would have to seek space off-street
where more suitable parking tariffs could be adopted:-- On-street parking is
 more advantageous to those who need to park for short periods and such
 a policy would ensure that this fact were acknowledged.      The price charged
 should reflect the rental value of th_e land (the costs of enforcement), the
 costs imposed upon society in moving between the trip origin, its destination

may be searching for a parking space.


Much of the presently-available central area off-street parking space in
Caracas is under public control.               It could, therefore; _be priced such
that the amount charged re(lects the sum of (i) the costs of the ground space
and servicing required by the parker, and (ii) the social costs involved in
moving between the generation location of the trip and the car park (and ·
back again).      Present charges, on.average, seemingly do not even cover
(i) at the most popular sites. (l)             Item (i) could be covered by a fixed amount
                        (

plus a variable charge dependent upon the duration of the stay; while item
 (ii) would have to be approximated by an amount varying with time of arrival
 and time of departure.     The latter would resemble a            surch~rge.



 Because of the resulting charges would be higher than at present, they
 would provoke a tendency towards the_ expansion of private parking capacity.
 If this were to be tolerated, prices would eventually fal.1 public car parks

                    This would be difficult to do precisely and

    Control of Privately-Owned Off-Street Parking.      The drawback associated
    with directly controlling the prices charged by private corporate bodies is
    less valid in Venezuela than in developed free-enterprise economies.               Such
    intervention is a part of general economic management and is a component
    of a largely successful attempt to control inflation.   Prices of essential
    commodities such as milk, and public transport fares are stipulated by
    . decree as are also prices of certain non-essentials such as cars, and car
    parking space in central Caracas.     The control over parking rates, exercised
    by the Ministry of Development, is that strong to have rec'ently occasioned
    a reduction in the amount charged.

 4. 2. 2   Charges on Moving Vehicles - Direct Mechanisms

 These methods, acting on moving vehicles, include all schemes which attempt
 to price the use of congested road space directly rather than pricing activities
 or commodities which are deemed to exhibit" a degree of correla~ion with use
 of congested road space.      To levy such direct charges in an efficient manner
 is not easily accomplished, otherwise there would be no need to consider
 indirect methods such as those applied to stationary vehicles.        Advanced
 technology needs to be employed in order to attain anything like full
 potential effectiveness.    These advanced systems confer considerable
 ability to charge dirrerentially in the spatial plane and some alternatives
 also make diurnal charge variation quite feasible.      Limits would be imposed
 by consumer perceptibility, however; efficiency cannot be achieved if
 charges are not perceived.      Consumer acceptance would be doubtful also;
 some systems are capable of invading privacy, and some of the alternatives
 would impose considerable inconvenience on the consumer.


 Since the risks associated with all advanced technology systems are high
 and since they are expensive to install, it would require considerable

     boldness and        confidenc~   to implement any such system without having
     initially demonstrated the effectiveness of direct charging by more simple
     means.          More simple sys terns suffer from discreteness and coarseness
     where the former are capable of continuity and graduation.            The former
     properties necessarily imply some reduction in gross efficiency although
     when costs are considered also, the advantage concerning net efficiency
     could He with the simple systems.              The system which is most beneficial
     will vary from city to city and from country to country.           One suspects
     ·that advanced systems would have more scope in Caracas than elsewhere
     because of the unusual physical form of the built-up area.           This physical
                                                1
     ·for!il factor makes the definition of 'priced-areas" which is necessary in
     simple systems, a difficult task to accomplish so as to attain a reasonable
      degree of effe.ctiveness. (l)


      Direct charging is capable in principle of attaining a distribution of prices
      much nearer to the optimum ·than are indirect methods.            The extra costs
      of more closely approaching the optimum may not be worthwhile, however,
      especially when the uncertainties associated with the required technological
            .___
      innovation is acknowledged.          Simple variants of direct charging mechanisms
      may result in less worthwhile solutions than some indirect charging means.
      These simple variants are dealt with first; those needing advanced techno-
      logical input are considered subsequently.           The stress in discussing the
L     systems is on matters of operation as opposed to matters of economics since,
      in contrast to the parking schemes discussed above, these systems have
      little in the way of precursors of the same physical and administrative set-
      up but seeking other objectives.

to enter a delineated priced area (of which conceptually, if not practically,
there could be more than one) at certain times only if they had been bought
a licence   so to do.   Licences would be_ generally acquired in advance.
The charge would reflect the excess of full social costs above private
costs _of the average trip into the priced area in the simplest case.


Entry lanes at the cordon of the priced area would be equipped with structures
similar to toll booths.    _Conventional freeway-type toll booths would not be
necessary unless provision were made for the purchase of licences at
cordon points, thereby implying some mechanical equipment installation.
It is difficult to imagine a system which demands universal pre-payment in
a democracy, however;       it would be likely that a set of booths at any one·
particular location would comp:dse (n-1) inspection booths solely to accom-
modate those who had bought pre-paid licences together with one conventional
toll booth for the dual function of the issuance of licences and the common
task of insp.ecting the permits which prqvide evidence of pre-payment.


It is apparent that considerable :roadway width would have to be_ made avail-
able at each area entry project where travel demands are high since the
capacity of each inspection booth would be unlikely to exceed 800 p. c. u. 's
per hour.     It is estimated that each booth would occupy space equivalent to
one and one-fourth lane-widths.      Thus, to accommodate the existing inbound
peak traffic volumes at the perimeter of the CBD supplementary licensing
area -- assuming some roads were made uni-directional -- the required
roadway width could sometimes exceed that presently available for both
directions together. (l)    It is true that pricing would generally reduce traffic




(1)   . If any extra space should need to be acquired to accommodate
        road-widening in the vicinity of the booth area, significant
        extra costs would have to be sunk into displacing existing land
        use requiring the resiting of existing uses elsewhere (or their
        abandonment), construction of the necessary highway structures,
        alterations to_ behavioral patterns; etc. Such costs may well
        make road-widening subject to considerable public resentment
        and may generally cause it to be a non-feasible policy.option.

 flows from their present levels, but this effect would be countered partially
 at any rate, by a tendency towards   11
                                           peaking-within-the-peak 11 , which would
 necessitate the provision of under-u.tilized inspection booths to avoid the
- generation of a new variety of traffic delay by the pricing scheme. the
 objective of which is to alleviate such delays.         Provision would also have
 to be made for the secular growth in desired demands for travel. (l)


 Such problems might be tackled by extensive traffic management.             A one-
 way system could be developed whereby inbound traffic would be channeled
 onto those facilities where it .could more easily be accommodated.           Some
 minor streets may be closed to through-movements because of low potential
 traffic or because of environmental considerations.           In Caracas peak
 traffic is sufficiently well-balanced directionally to make any such attempted
 solution expensive. in terms of travel costs.         It may have to be "cancellable"
                                            11
 outside of peak hours and "reversible           during the evening peak to occasion
 an acceptable degree of utilization of road capacity.         Anyway, it would
 strain the abilities of the most competent of traffic engineers to devise a
 solution which was undemanding in terms of construction requirements.


 Under a regime of area admission charges, no intra-priced area enforce-
 ment would be necessary and this would permit great economies to be made
 in the manpower requirement compared with a system of supplementary
 licensing;   But an area admission charges system would not cause charges
 to be levied upon vehicles which do not enter the are·a during the periods
 when pricing is applied even though they may make use of such highly

demanded road space.      Inefficiencies and inequalities would be implied
as they are in the instances of parking schemes.


The system would be highly inflexible regarding its spatial coverage.              A
change of boundary would re.quire that booths be resited.          Such an oper- ·
ation would pale into insignificance compared with that of updating the·
traffic management requirements, howevero              Diurnal charge v:ariation
could be much more easily accommodated.


However, it would be quite suitable for "dove-tailing" in to certain systems
of automatic toll collection.    Regular      u~ers   might find it more convenient
to be charged automatically (and to be billed periodically) whenever they
entered a priced area rather than have to buy a set of licences and continua,lly
update and display them as proof of having done so. (l)          Such a progr.ession
is in e·vidence on the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, U.S.A. and is
under discussion for the Mersey Tunnel between Liverpool and Birkenhead
in tl1e l-1. K. (':Vhere an ancillary objective is the testing of road pricing
hardware).


Supplementary Licensing.        Un_der   a   regime of supplementary licensing a
priced area' would be delineated in much the same way as for area admission
charges.     All owners of non-exempted vehicles would be obliged to purchase
a licence which would entitle them to make use of the road space within the
area during a specific period.      There would be no need in this case to con-
sider special traffic management requirements since the display of licences
on vehicles would not call for the channelization of traffic through
limited entry points to the priced area.         It would generally be possible,
although somewhat unwieldy, to specify more than one priced area to each
·of which a different charge could apply.
                                                                                       II

Some variants of supplementary licensing have been envisaged as m.akirig
use of pre-paid daily licences.       This alternative was preferred by the
Smeed R.eport Panelists. (l)     Weekly or monthly licences could be made
available as well.      If this were so the system. would be more convenient
from the standpoint of consumers and ·would not detract much from. admin-
istrative simplicity.     It would be necessary to incorporate in the system
a mechanism for refunds for "unused days" if validities of longer than one
day were allowed; otherwise there would be an incentive to make full use
of the licence by' making vehicle trips that are in social terms not worth-
while.    Refunds would also    ~e   a system requirement if the validity 'of a
daily licence were to be limited to a specific date as opposed to any one
day.     A promising type of system would involve pre-paid daily licen.ces
which could be validated by the user for use on any one day but which would
                                           2
then not be valid for any subsequent day. ( )


The amount of the charge would reflect the average of the marginal social
       3
costs ( \mposed by all vehicles (excepting those exempted) making use of
road space in the priced area.        The system would charge some movements
which would not be covered by area admission charge-s, 'such as those which
exit from, but which do not re-enter, the priced area during the period
when prices are being levied.        Thus, the charging pattern would be more
  equitable and would exhibit greater gross efficiency than could be obtained·

        The charge could be modified quite easily conceptually (but somewhat less
        easy practically) to allow for differing prices to be levied simultaneously
         in areas ·of differing demand pressures. The Smeed Report(l) suggests
                                      2
        ,that a series of concentric ( ) priced areas could_be drawn-up. At the
        center, where demands are envisaged as being most intense, a "red"
        licence would be needed to use this road-space.       In a surrounding area,
        both "red" and (cheaper) "blue" licences· would be accepted.       Also, a
        diurnal charge variation could be accommodated by the validification of
        "blue" licences in the central area when demands are s~mewhat below
        maximum levels and so on.        This would be likely to add significantly to
        administration and enforcement costs.        Elsewhere it is stated that it would
        appear to make some sense to test whether single-price/ single-area pricl.ng
                                          3
        would be practical first.of all. ( )


        Although capital investment costs wc;mld be relatively low, administrative
        costs, especially for the enforcement of a supplementary licensfng scheme
        wou,ld be higher than in the case of area admission... charges and would increase
        rapidly as the geographical scope of the scheme were extended. ( 4 ) This
        is because enforcement would have to be accomplished by _area patrols rather
        than by inspection at the perimeter of the 'area.     Much of the necessary
        observation could be performed upon parked vehicles but it would be inequit-
    ·
        able -and somewhat inefficient (in gross terms at least, i.e., before system
!       operation costs are assessed) if moving vehicles were completely ignored.

        It is difficult to imagine   a successful enforcement mechanism applied to
        moving vehicles which did not r·equire suspected offenders to be halted and

involved both in terms of personnel requirements and in obstructions to
travel movement if attempted evasion reached substanti8:1 levels.         Sub-
sequent inspection would be possible if vehicle registration marks were to
be noted by enforcement officers for the purposes of post-facto tracking
down of vehic;le owners and if a sufficiently fraud:... proof means could be
d'evised which would demand that used licence permits be held for a month
or so after their expiry.   The permit would most likely be displayed on
the windshield of the vehicle. (1)


As with area admission charges, supplementary control devices would.have
to be used on ·conjunction with the pricing scheme to ensure that congestion
would not build up at the boundaries of time and space where large changes
in price occur (which would be of the "all-or-nothing" variety with single-
price I single-area pricing s·chemes).       This would be less impe:r:ative with
a system of automatic point pricing since prices could vary gradually over
time and space.    A system of supplementary licensing may be quite reason-
ably merged with automatic point pricing and anyway might co-exist along-
side the latter to allow occasional vehicles, not equipped for the automatic
system, to be ac;:commodated.


Differential Excise Licensing.       Differential excise licensing, by intended
area of usage has .been distinguished from supplementary licensing by
                2
other authors. ( ) A range of alternative annual vehicle licences would be
available for each type of vehicle.      If, for instance, a vehicle owner should
decide that he needs to use central-area urban road space, he would buy an
expensive licence; for use of peripheral areas only, he would purchase
a cheaper one.

       mentary licensing schemes, if applied in Caracas,· are more

The task of licence-issuing would be      quit~   simple and this seems to be the
motivation behind the proposal.        But this simplicity would be ill conceived
    if vehicles were.to be traded between us.ers who required different types
of -licence.     The schegie would be both inefficient and inequitable·.      Once
a licence had been boUght, then over-optimal use would be likely to be
extracted from it since no incremental charge would be levied for each
additional journey; the licence fee would be the same for_ someone ne:eding
to make use of central-area urban road space once a week for a year, or
every day of the week for a year.

if applied in Caracas, pricing points would be located on roads whe-re
traffic demand pressures are high enough for charging to be W?-rranted
for any significant period of time throughout the day.   At e:;ich pricing
point, powered loops would be embedded into the road surface.       These
would occasion the meter unit on each vehicle passing over the pricing
                                                  2
point to register a charge of a standard amount. ( ) When a charge is
being made, a dial in the front of the meter moves temporarily to a black
and white state (as in the figures) from its usual all-black state. . This
movement, visible externally, would facilitate enforcement.· It would
be desirable for the dial to hold the black-and-white state for some 10 to
30 seconds, depending on the minimum spacing between pricing points,
before reverting to the black state in order to avoid any problem of double
registration and also to make it relatively easy to provide surveillance of
the less conspicuous vehicles,


Although the TRRL meter unit illustrated in FigureS-4.1 and 4. 2 is intended
·to be powered by an internal and independent battery power source, there




(1)    No wholly satisfactory battery technology has yet been devel-
       oped.    However, there is no strong reason for the meter to
       have its own indepenqent and internal power source.       It could
       be connected to the vehicle battery. A power source external
       to the meter does make )t somewhat easier for users to inhibit
       the functioning of the meter; b~t there is, however, no full-
       proof means of preventing such disabling, ultimately by
       shielding the receptor unit from the transmission from the
       point, or possibly by more sophisticated jamming, even when
       the meter has its own internal power source. ··./'.is an alter-

Although a power source external to the meter does make it somewhat
easier for users to inhibit the functioning of the meter, there is however
no fullproof means of preventing such disabling, ultimately by shielding
the responder unit from the transmission from the pricing point, or
possibly by more sophisticated jamming, even when th12 meter has its own
internal power source. ·As our alternative to electric power, the TRRL ·
is presently investigating the possibilities of clockwork power; an.d a
rugged version using such a mechanism is a promising possibility.
Failure to keep the spring would be evidenced by the lack of movement
of the meter dial when passing over a pricing point.


The administrative framework surrounding the system would vary accord-
ing to the local environment.       It would generally have to be intricate and
carefully   devised~     Following manufacture, it might be necessary to trans-
fer meter units to bonded stores for safe keeping since some unscrupulous
vehicle owners might obtain illegal advantages by pt;>ssessing more than
one unit.    Authorized ·garages, assembly plants, and/or vehicle registry
offices would perform the operations of equipping vehicles with meters.
Each meter should be numbered and recorded as having been attached to a
particular vehicle.       The authorized agents could also be responsible, for
meter-reading.         They might additionally perform the tasks of accepting
the payments due or might, alternatively, transmit the results of the meter-
reading operation to a central bureau which would issue bills. (l)


Motorists could have their meters read at any fixed intervals or times.
In addition to having a permanently sealed, non-cycling and non-resettable
counter with a capacity sufficient for the life of the meter, a resettable
countdown counter would be provided capable of being reset with the use of
a key kept at a suitable number of meter-resetting stations, in exchange
for the payment of the appropriate charge.        Resetting could take place




(1)    This would be an inferior solu'tion in Caracas where the
       postal service leaves much to be desired.


                                     -220-
 at any time prior to the running out of the countdown meter, and in any
 amount that the owner is willing to pay for in advance.      Frequency and
 timing of visits to the resetting station would thus be largely at the dis-
 cretion of the user.      The payment of meter fees would be further evidenced
 by an entry in a log kept by the user, and by the delivery of a--receipt
 voucher or stamps or otherwise, the value of the voucher being indicated
 by the manner in which it is detached from its stub.       ~.esetting   stations
would be responsible for the delivery of collections as indicated by the
 voucher stubs remaining in their possession.       At time of annual reregist-
 ration, the user would be required to submit a certificate from one of a
 limited number of official meter reading stations obtained within a reason-
 ably brief preceding period, say six weeks .to three months, giving·the
 date and reading of both registers, and to reconcile these readings with the
 entries in his log book and the vouchers, receipts, or stamps he has
 retained.   Similar procedures would be required in conjunction with the             I



 transfer of the vehicle to another owner.     Thus even if the user were able
 to obtain an unpaid-for resetting of his meter, he would not in the long
                                                                                      I
                                                                                     .!
 run escape detection ..    Nor would forgery of the log book be.of mu.ch avail
 in the absence of the corresponding vouchers.       Meter reading and certifying_
 stations, as distinct from meter resetting stations, could be under close
 surveillance to prevent falsification of meter reading certificates.


 As a matter of. good public relations, if might be advisable to allow ·for an
. initial number of meter units .to be run up either free or on credit with
 respect to each meter installed.      In this way the user might be led to feel
that he was not required to pay in advance,· although those wishing to pay
 a substantial sum in advance in order to avoid the inconvenience of frequent
 meter resetting could still have the option of doing so.


An on-vehicle metering scheme would however, call for a substantial initial
 capital investment for the purchase and installation of meter and receptor
units assuming that most of the CMA's 264, 000 vehicles (in 1971) were to
 be equipped.   Using as a guide cost estimates for vehicle equipment for




                                     -221-
an off-vehicle recording system, (l) discussed below, the costs of purchase
and installation of the meters and responder units for an on-vehicle system
would be substantial; ( ) and to this ~ould have to be added the cost and
                       2

installation of loops in the _roadbed and peripheral equipment which would
vary in accordance with the geographical scope of the scheme.         However,
a scheme that calls for a major initial .investment is unlikely to recommend
itself as a viable candidate for use initially because of its inevitable risk
of the scheme's success.


R.elative to off-vehicle recording systems, discussed below,: on-vehicle
metering also has some failings.      These include:

           (:i)    The battery-powered meter can be activated by
                   by close proximity to certain foreign sources of
                   electric power;

           (ii)    The system is relatively labor intensive and could
                   thus exhibit quite r~pidly risi!J~ costs over time

Automatic Off-Vehicle R.ecording.      If the records of a vehicle's consump-
tion of congested road-space were to be kept at a central bureau .rather than
on the vehicle itself, the most serious disadvantage of on-vehicle metering,
i.e., the inconvenience and other disadvantages of the meter-read.ing
operation, would be avoided.     A system which allows this to be done has
been developed by the TR.RL.      This involves low-frequency electrical

objective of marginal social cost pricing in mind.

 ·.              ( 2)
The Smeed Report      expressed doubts regarding the expense of off-vehicle
recording systems.     However, since the publication of their opinions,
technological developments have advanced to a point where it seems likely
that off-vehicle recording would not be any more costly than on-vehicle
meteri~g, especially for a large scale application. ( 3 )( 4 )

The technology surrounding this form of vehicle identification can be use-
fully employ~d outside of the immediate context of congestion pricing. ( )
                                                                        5

For instance, in another pricing context, the technology is employed to
levy charges on some regular users of the Golden Gate Bridge in California,
U.S.A. <5 > However, off-vehicle recording systems are not necessarily
confined to the use of low-frequency induction to achieve vehicle identifi-
cation; under development in France is a system which uses ,laser beams
to read vehicle identification codes embedded in reflectorized strips placed
on the edge of the windshield:    This method may eventually prove to be an
attractive alternative to low-frequency induction.

        of paper tape recording of the relevant details for billing
        operations.

 With identification by means of low-frequency induction, each participating
 vehicle would have permanently affixed to the underside of its chassis or
 sub-frame a responder unit measuring about 25 x 15 x 5 centimeters with
 a unique. code number identifying it to the vehicle.     The responder would
- not be required to perform energy-consuming mechanical functions and .             ·-
 consequently no internal power source, nor moving parts, are needed. (l)
 Pricing points would be located at sites on congested roads as with on-
 vehicle metering.     The installation of the equipment necessary in the case
 of off-vehicle re'tording would be more complex, however; loops in the
 roadbed would need to receive signals from vehicles as well as transmit
 power to energize the vehicle-borne equipment.         These reception loops
 would have to be specific to each lane to avoid confusion from the       simul~

 When a vehicle passes a pricing point its responder signals the vehicle's
 . identity.   The identity code is clocked synchronously by roadside equipment ·
-in a manner suitable for onwa,rd transmission to a central bureau at which.
  records are kept.     This onward transmission can be by manual or auto-
 matic means.       Manual transmission would require that the roadside equip-
 ment issue punched paper-tape for periodic collection for conveyance· to
 the central bureau.        Such equipment is on view at the demonstratipn project
  on the TRRL premises but is not thought to be the more suitable means of
  onward transmission in the U .K. where the environment favors automatic
 processes.      Automatic transmission to the central bureau would· involve
 the instantaneous conveyance via telephone cable of the vehicle identification ·
  information.     ThiS confers advantages of continually updated ;ehicle move-

When the information (in either tape or telegraphic form) is received at,
at the central bureau it would be         sort~d    by one of two computers which
need to be at the disposal of the road pricing authority.             This sorting
would involve the ordeJ'.'.ing of the incoming information such that it can be
readily processed by a second computer responsible for updating accounts
and for preparing bills.         Bills   ~ould    not need to be issued at regular
intervals since the processing-function computer could be programmed to
emit automatically a bil for presentation to the consumer on a regular time-
period basis, or when a pre-determined amount due is exceeded.


The relative advantages of automatic road pricing by off-vehicle recording
 are effectively the converse of the disadvantage.s listed under on-vehicle
metering.    Its relative disadvantages are ·few,--the one most often cited·
being complications which might arise when vehicles change hands between
.normal billing   peri~ds( 2 )   to which one might add, in the context of Caracas,
doubts which consumers may still have about being presented with bills

        a buzzer or illumination device which would inform the. driver
        when an active pricing point is traversed that would enable the
        consumer to check computer functioning.      It is well to note
        that most public utility authorities in Caracas (and local
        credit car corporations) use the computer to issue bills.

  development stage, at the time of writing( ) and has not been the subject of
 a reliable cost estimation exercise.      Its practical feasibility. is yet to be
 proven.




 (1)    The Smeed Report panelists found three reasons for not pre-
        ferring off-vehicle recording systems. None of these has main-
        tained the same degree of validity since the period of their
        conferring., One related to the costs of the computational and
        data transmission equipment which has since been greatly
        reduced; another was associated with the complications arising
        from centralized accountancy which have since been demon-
        strably overcome· in other applications; and the third was a
        concern that ·the system would permit the autho'rities to track the
        whereabouts of private vehicles which, on the one hand, is no
        more serious than the recording of long-distance telephone
        calls and, on the other, can be countered by arrangements
        whereby any individual can insure himself that such tracking
        is not possible.

The only essential differences between a system based on laser technology
as opposed to low"".frequency induction involve the operation of vehicle
identification.   As mentioned above, participating vehicles would be ,
equipped with a simple .11 scotchlite 11 reflectorized identification strip adhered
to a suitable part of the vehicle such as an edge of the windshield. . If a
warning device to the driver that a charge was being levied(l) were not
deemed necessary, this strip would fully comprise the vehicle-borne
equipment.    It would thus appear to be very cheap.


The strip would contain a binary sequence uniquely identifying the vehicle.
This would be interrogated by a laser beam transmitted from a drum with
reflecting surfaces which would rotate sufficiently rapidly and possess an
adequate field of cove;rage to focus on practically every vehicle within a
pre-determined range.        The reflected flash would be received by a para-
bolic mirror and then stored, decoded, and prepared for onward trans:..
missions (by manual or automatic means).


Because of the optical nature of the system, there would have to be a clear
field of view between the transmitter, the identification strip on the vehicle,
and the feedback receiver.      This would call for the location of the trans-
mitter and receiver assemblies on gantries or gables to minimize the risk
of interference by other vehicles.     Even so, these high-elevation support
structures would not be sufficient to ensure correct identification since the
                                                   2
identification strip would also have to be clean. ( ) In practice, because of
personal financial gain, vehicle owners would have considerable incentive
to keep the vehicle identification strip in _a state of obscurity.   The nature

        equipment.       c




( 2)    The fact that Caracas does not expe,rience snow or frost does
        make it a more feasible candidate for this method of vehicle
        identification than many other cities. Heavy rain, however,
        may prove to be a cause of occasional failure to obtain a reading.

     be_quite liable to mechanical breakdown;(l) it might be difficult to service
     without obstructing traffic movement; and the high structures it requires
     could be visually disturbing.


     The laser beam system does have attractions, however, because of the
     apparent .cheapness o_f the vehicle-borne equipment and may eventually
     prove to be an effective competitor to low-frequency induction techniques.


     4. 2. 3   Indirect Charging Mechanisms

     This last category includes all other method9logies which are not embraced
     by the other two.     Generally they involve more indirect charging than even
     those on stationary vehicles.      The lin°l{ exploited as a basis. for charging
     could be, for instance, that between employee income and congestion,
     acknowledging that those of higher incomes are more likely to generate
     congestion.     Or one could attempt to make use of any correlation between
     amount of gasoline sold in an area and the amount of congestion in that area.
     One could even negatively tax, i.e. subsidize, public transport in order to
     reduce congestion costS:


     In general,   indirect. charging mechan,isms are cheap and simple to
     administer but have a low level of potencial effectiveness.         But their
     potential net efficiency _could imply that they are worthwhile in .some
     situations, especially were they to be used to combat the general ·
     urban congestion to ·which car traffic is a contributor.         They generally
     have attractions of administr·ative. simplicity and cheapness but tend
     to    suffer from· being   excessively "broadbrush"       in approach ..
     Furthermore, they . al90 probably suffer from a transmission loss
     because of     the differentiation- b,etween ·the   activity being operated

      effectiv:eness need not be any less than that of some alternatives.      As
      general-congestion taxes, rather than as specific road congestion taxes,
      they can be attractive.      Th~   number of imaginable variations are quite num-
      erous; only a few of the _more feasible are discussed below.        The lack of
      precision endemic to indirect methods of charging must inevitably imply
      some inequities.


      Employment Taxes.        Congestion on the roads is largely caused by people
      commuting between home and work.             If certain types of employment were
      taxed it would encourage their displacement and could thereby alleviate
      road congestion.


      The degree to which employment generates road congestion is not uniform
      through time nor space.       It is positively correlated with:

                 (i)     the extent to which commuting is by car;

                 (ii)      the extent to which arrival and departure is
                         - at peak periods;

                 (iii)   the amount of available travel capacity between
                         the home location and the work location;

                 (iv)    the amount of accompanying demand for travel
                         on the home-work corridor.                  ·


      A satisfactory employment tax would have to acknowledge such positive
       correlations.     Any blanket tax would likely generate as many disbenefits
      as it would benefits because of its effect on occupations which are not
      responsible for significant amounts of congestion. . Extreme selectivity
      would be accompanied by      ~dministrative    unwieldiness.   One can imagine
      that there would be net benefits from increasing complexity up to a certain
      level beyond which marginal disadvantages would exceed marginal advantages.


      Of. the above four positive correlations (i) could be iricorporated by making
      the tax depe11dent upon income.       The strong relationship between car usage
      for commuting purposes and income paid to each employee would determine




                                           -230-
     the appropriate tax differentials.      (ii) could be acknowledged by selectively
     regarding the type of occupation; for instance, factory workers who tend to
     travel before the main peak, and shop workers who travel after it could be
     taxed less (at each income level) than peak-hour office workers. (l)      (iii) and
     (iv) would be difficult to incorporate; the most that might be practicable
     could be some differentiation by location of work place, although this leaves
     much to be desired because it omits any reference to the home location of
     those being taxed. ( 2 )


     With thought devoted to their specification, such selective employment taxes
     cari be attractive, but perhaps more especially so as counters to genera,l
     urban congestion.    They can be finely graduated and thus may be less open
     to accusations of unfair discrimination than might be, for instance, supple-
     mentary licensing schemes.        They are intrinsically long-term rather than        i
     short-term solutions, however, and may be difficult to structure adequately           I
     because of the lengthy and imprecisely known lead and lag times involved.             I

     Property Taxes.     People create congestion, people are employed, and

     extra link in the chain exists between the creation of congestion and the
     obligation to pay for the congestion created.      Greater inefficiencies would
     be transmitted by the non-fixed nature of employee:space ratios.        These
     would naturally tend to be raised by property taxation.      One may succeed in
     raising the level of congestion at work places rather than in alleviating con-
     gestion i.n the movements to and from work places.        The ability of property

Bus Fares.       At peak hours in Caracas, under the present road-user charges
regime, much car travel is priced at less than the amount necessary to
cover the full social costs which it caus.es.   This implies that total travel
                                                                                    'I
costs would be reduced if car travel were charged at a rate which would
reflect these full costs; the reduction would result from some of the demand
b~ing   diverted to public. transport, which incurs lower full social costs per
trip.


Although such a diversion could be occasioned by an increaseJ,.n the price
of car travel covering full social costs, it could also be occasioned in theory     'j
by a lowering of public transport fares.     If feasible, this second alternative
would probably be more acceptable to the local population since there would
                                                                                    ;j
be no increase in the direct financial cost of travel which would be a com-
ponent of a conventional road pricing scheme.


The scope   for   optimally allocating travel between the various modes through ·
a subsidy of public transport is very small in Caracas, however.        For·
instance, little would be gained by a shift in favor of the por-puesto-taxi
(PPT) mode since such a mode is a significant generator of congestion costs. •
This follows from its low utilization of road space caused by the frequent
stopping and the excessive weaving of PPT vehicles across traffic lanes:_
Major gains could come only from a shift to the bus or Metro systems.
However, the fares charged at the moment on the buses, and those proposed
                                                                                    l

          Bs.19. 00 at_lO kilometers per hour, depending on the type of facility being

         Smeed Report, < J that gasoline and diesel could be taxed at varying rates

 (        depending upon variations in the amount of     ~ongested   roadspace consumed
          by vehicles which are fuelled at different filling stations.    One of the dis-
          advantages of the alternative is that it would be extremely difficult to vary
 {       the amount of the tax to reflect variation in the consumption of congested
          roadspace between vehicles serviced by the same _filling station.       Another ·
          is that'it has been calculated that, under 1971 Caracas conditions,· it would
          not be possible to vary the taxation rate by more than Bs. 0. 01 per liter per

To be acceptable politically it might be s~pposed that filling stations would
have to be taxed/ compensated for windfall gains/losses resulting from the
distortions to purchasing habits occasioned by the system were it to be
partially successful in achieving its objective.     The system is judged to be
unsuitable for application in Caracas as is shown by the objective evaluation
of the following section of this chapter. -


4. 3   IDENTIFICATION OF FEASIBLE PRICING MECHANISMS

The previous section included a description of alternative pricing mechanisms
and a discussion of their relative merits in the context of Caracas.        However,
-no quantified evaluation based upon these relative merits was attempted
therein.   Such an evaluation calls for a quantified technique capable of
weighing the multiplicity of specific advantages and disadvantages of each
variant in order to assist in the identification of those pricing mechanisms
considered worthy of testing in a transport model of Caracas and subsequent
investigation in detail regarding their administrative, legal and costing
aspects.


The evaluation technique that was   develope~    :;and applied suggested that .supple-
mentary ~icensing is likely to be the most suitable system for Caracas in
the short term. More complex variants than the one eventually investigated
in detail were shown to be preferable.        However, none of these was con-
sidered worth proposing for implementation without first proving the
practical feasibility of a simple, cheap, comprehensible, and low-risk
variant of the system.




(1)     This calculation assumes that supplementary fuel containers
        would not be carried, in which case the allowable differential
        would be even less than one centime per lite'r per kilometer.




                                   -234-
In the evaluation, only those schemes having the practical capability of being
implemented within three years or so from the date of Congressional
approval were considered.       Thus, those schemes combining direct charging
                                           ( 1)
and advanced technology were excluded.            Of the latter schemes, on-
vehicle metering pr,esents some doubts about the reliability of alternative"
sources of power for the meters; laser beam technology for off-vehicle
recording calls for more investigation into many of the suspected compli-.
cations which might arise from its application in practice; which off-vehicle
recording by low-frequency induction, though technologically proven in
contexts other than that of road pricing, could not be cost-effective unless
a bold decision were taken to equip a large number of vehicles with the
necessary identification equipment (which would need to be manufactured on
larg~-scale p~oduction linei:,; yet to be planned and established). ( 2 ) Never-
theless, the advantages of automatic pricing should not be underestimated.
The ability of a scheme to be efficiently integrated with an automatic means
of point pricing is a desirable characteristic that should be weighed in a
quantified evaluation of short-term alternatives; and implies that the eventual
 installation of automatic point pricing should be a longer-term objective at
';hi ch to aim. ( 3 )        .


4. 3. 1   Evaluation Criteria

The Terms of R.eference for this study list the following broad evaluation




(1)       And is therefore consistent with the proposals suggested in
          Better Use of Town R.oads, Op. Cit., and also in a recent
          paper issued by the Greater London Council

( 2)      In the "home" of lqw frequency induction for road pricing'
          application, the U. K. official views envisage a five-year
          planning and implementation period.

(3)       Similar views seem to be held by other authors, e.g.,
          Better Use of Town R.oads, Op. Cit., and Traffic and the
          Environment, Greater London Council, 197 2

criteria:

            (i )    Economic efficiency;

            (ii)    Administrative facility; ·

            (iii)   Equi-ty; and

            (iv)    Assistance to transport investment.


These criteria were adopted for the systems evaluation.           Because they
overlap in a few respects, the areas of overlap were uniquely allocated
in order to avoid double-counting; for instance, administrative costs
were included under (ii) administrative facility, rather than under (i)
economic efficiency.       In addition to these four criteria, a fifth, flexibility,
was considered a desirable attribute to warrant inclusion.          A system that
can accommodate changing circumstances should be preferred to one which
is comparable in other respects but which is more rigid.


These five broad evalUa.tion criteria were expanded into five related sets
of consistent objectives.      Each alternative system was then rationally
assessed according to the degree to which it satisfied each objective; and
hence~   how well it measured up to each of the five broad criteria. (l)       Table
4. 1 shows the ·subdivision of each of the five broad· criteria into objectives.


The first criterion, economic efficiency, is conceived of in gross terms
since the initial costs and the running costs of the alternative systems are
dealt with under the heading· of administrative facility.       It is defined as the
degree to which maximum effectiveness i~ extracted from the transport
system of Caracas.        As such it is consistent with the interpretation placed
upon it in the quantified benefit calculations of the supplementary licensing
alternatives subsequently investigated during the study by means of a
transport mod_e l.



( 1)     The criteria themselves are too macrocosmic to be used·
         themselves as muneraires against which the alternative
         schemes can be measured.

  Whilst sufficiently embracing to appraise different variants of the same
  ·basic system, such as supplementary licensing, the .definition can be
  criticized as being inadequa~e· to cope wHh a range of alternative systems •
 . These alternatives may have significantly different effects on the broader
  urban environment, which has a feedback into economic efficiency.            For
                                                                                      -   1

  instance, control by park.ing may encourage through-traffic to be routed
  via a central and presently congested area thereby indirectly generating
  atmospheric pollution, vibration, and a higher-than-necessary accident
                                                                                          l
  rate in the area.      Each of these implications detracts from economic
  efficiency. (l)    In order to meet this deficiency, the capability of the
  criterion to measure the more direct and the more indirect effects respect-
  l.vely of alternative schemes was improved by subdividing it into two objectives,
  namely: "Ability of the (alternative) scheme to maximize the efficiency of
  the transport system"; arid "Ability of the scheme to achieve desirable
  environmental goais".        As shall be subsequently detailed, each of these
  objectives was modified by a perceptability index before submission into                I.
---... the final evaluation calculations.


  Administrative facility was considered solely in cost terms~        The degree
  of public compliance, administrative competence, ability to blend-in with
  the existing institutional set-up may naturally vary between schemes.
  However, they need not.         It would generally be possible to expend more
  resources upon one scheme than upon another which has natural advantages
  in any one of these and other respects so that the two are placed on a par
  with each other; however, to do so may be treating unfairly the scheme
  which is at a disadvantage.        Nevertheless, the assumption that costs are
  adjusted so that each scheme has equivalent administrative facility is quite




  (1)      Economic efficiency is usually interpreted differently by the
           economist than by the non-economist. The latter actually                       fl
           follows an accounting definition.    e.g., to the economist                    II
           a disturbance during a session· watching a favorite television
           program would constitute a detraction from economic efficiency
           even if the level of production of goods and services as
           defined by national income accounts remains unaffected.



                                            -238-
adequate for the degree of accuracy required by this evaluation.        This
approach makes objective assessment a more. readilY. accomplished task.
Thus administrative facility generates two objectives, which ar.e abbreviated
as "Low capital costs", i.e., the extent to which the scheme can be cheaply
established, and "Low operating cost 1 ' , i.e., the extent to which the scheme
can be kept going cheaply.


The third criterion, equity, means different things to different people.        .There
are two fundamental economic concepts of equity .. Horizontal equity is a
concept concerned with the extent to which equivalent persons are not subject
to inter-personal discrimination.     Vertical equity is concerned with the
differential treatment of tho9e· who are better or worse _off than _others.
Few would argue that publicly-financed projects should deliberately deviate
from horizontal equity ideals.     Vertical equity as a gene·ral principle is
held by most(l) but the degree to which those who are, say, worse off than
the average should be hit less hard by any policy change than others is a
subject of some dissention.

tal equity and vertical equity.   However, these name-tags are used loosely ..
Horizontal equity is deemed to measure the degree to which consumers of·
the same type are not distinguished by the scheme regarding payment for
equivalent ser:vices.   For instance the objective .would be pursued if car
commuters were charged uniformly for similar quantities of road space.
Vertic;:i.l equity concerns the relative extent to which benefits and costs accrue
to the poor and the rich.    For instance, if relatively low income por puesto
passengers travelling to one area of the city were occasioned to switch to.
an alternative mode which to the:i:n is inferior whilst relatively high income

terms of vertical equity. (l)


As regards investment guidance, great assistance would be· imparted to the
transport investment planning process if the amount of the road price payable
could be separately optimized for each section of road.       Large amounts of
road price, paid by drivers on a particular stretch of roadway would indicate
that some intense demand pressures exist.       The potential cost-savings to
the initially existing traffic from any capacity expansior;. would place a
minimum value on the total benefits from such an expansion and would thus
facilitate the prepar·atiori of investment priorities. ( 2 )             .


However, none of the schemes submitted into the evaluation methodology
used in this study involve the individual specification of optirp.al prices for
each link; and none can control the allocation of traffic between individual
sections of road to any fine degree.    In fact schemes in whic;:!?. different
areas would be priced in different ways could be void or more misleading
in terms of investment guidance than the current regime.        With the latter
regime, traffic volumes can give some limited guidance since vehicles are
priced similarly throughout Caracas; while with the former, it might become
more difficult to decide whether any variation in travel flow between one
road and another is arising because of differences in supply conditions.
The extent to which guidance to investment planning is imparted by each
scheme is taken to constitute an objective in itself in the evaluation.




(1)    In fact, the evaluation methodology with study could only
       weakly distinguish between alternative schemes on vertical
       equity grounds because of the rather general specifications
       of the alternatives and the lack of sufficient resources to run
       each through the spatially-disaggregated transport model.
( 2)   Although the need for more detailed analyses would not be
       obviated. One would need to evaluate the benefit which would
       accrue from the allowance of extra travel volumes to take
       place on the road. See Section 3. 3. 2.

     Flexibility, deemed to be a desirable system quality in addition to those
     mentioned in the Terms of Reference, has several aspects.            Some of these
     .would be double-counted were they c.onsidered sepa·rately under this heading
     for they are also implicit within the economic efficiency criteria.        The
     two independent efficiency objectives isolated under the ·heading of flexibility
     are ability to adapt to (i) changing demand patterns, and (ii) the introduction
     of electronic charging methods.        (i) would embrace both secular demand
     growth as each of incomes, car-ownership levels, and population levels
     change; and also any abrupt policy-fulfilling changes such as any installation
     of a new one-way system, or the initiation or any extension to Metro oper-
     ations.


     4. 3. 2   The Alternative Schemes

     The alternative schemes submitted into the evaluation are fully identified in
     the previous section of this chapter.         Some of these alternatives, already
     specified in fairly general terms, are here more precisely defined for
     evaluation purposes.        The following is a listing and brief description of
     the schemes selected for evaluation.

                  (i)     Area Admission Charges.     Entry to a
                          single-priced area, would be achieved
                          upon payment of an appropriate charge
                          which could vary diurnally in discrete
                          jumps according to variations in demand
                          intensities.

                  (ii)    Supplementary Licensing with no Charge
fl                        Variation. A single priced area would be
                          defined within.which movement by non-
                          exempted vehicles would be either fully
                          charged or not charged at all
                          upon the time of day as a reflection of variations
                          in demand intensity..              ·

                  (iii)   Supplementary Licensing with only Spatial
                          Charge Variation. This is as (ii) but
                          several areas would be delineate~i)probably
                          on the concentric band principle,  which
                          would be charged differentially.

                      (iv)     Supplementary Licensing with only Diurnal
                               Charge \7anahon. This is as (n) but the
                               amount of tfie charge would be varied through-
                               out the da v in a discrete

                               and Diurnal Charge Variation.

                      (vi}     Differential Excise Licensing by Area of Usage.
                               Use of. a control area for which travel demands
                               are greatest would be aliowed only to vehicles
                               equipped with an expensive annual licence (and
                               to those in exempted. categories).

                       (vii)   Control of On-Street and Publicly-Owned
                               Off-Street Parking.

                       (viii) Control of all Parking Facilities. To those
                              f,acihhes rnctuded under ·(vi} would be added
                              privately-owned but publicly-used 'parking
                              facilities and some influence over privately-
                              owned and privately-used space.

                       (ix)    Differential Fuel_ Taxation. There would be a
                               finely graduated differential tax varying with
                               the degree to which the vehicles. purchasing
                               fuel at each location are deemed to generate
                               congestion.

                       ( x)    Selective Employment Taxes. These would
                               reflect tne extent to which different employees
                               generate different amounts of congestion.

                      (xi)     Selective Property Taxation. This would vary
                               with the way in ·which different properties
                               attract different levels of congestion.

                      (xii)    Specific Subsidies to Bus and Metro Fares.
                               Fares involving travel along corridors which
                               exhibit congestion (primarily created by car
                               travel) would be lowered (but would remain
                               positive) in an attempt to disuade private car
                               use.


         4. 3. 3   Evaluation Methodology

         No comprehensive explanation of the evaluation methodology which wa_s
         developed can be accommodated herein.          Some description, however, is




                                              - 242-
    ·~
             necessary.


             Although quantitative, the methodology involves no transformation of variables
             into a common denominative measurement unit such as money or time.
             Scores are allocated to the various systems and weightings are attributed to
             tpe different objectives and criteria by the evaluator.      Impartiality is
             claimed but non-conscious value-judgemental biases cannot be ruled out
             even though well gu.arded against.     For instance, a non-economist may
             choose to weigh economic efficiency less highly than the weighting specified
             herein.    Thus sensitivity analyses are called for, and were conducted.


             These sensitivity analyses utilized substitute weightings for those thought
             appropriate by the economist, in order to reflect values more likely to be
I    ~       consistent with those held by two segments of the populace denoted by the
             accountant and the egalitarian.     Th.e accountant is typically more concerned
             with tangible monetary transactions, and less concerned with benefits and
             malefits which are not reflected in financial flows, than is the economist.
             He is also likely to place   a greater penalty upon more    distant and more
             uncer.!_ain events than would the economist.       The egalitarian would care less
             about matters of economic efficiency and the maximization of any consumption
             ·.goal than would the economist; he would be more concerned that the distri-
             bution of benefits made for greater social equality.


             Table 4. 2 is a systems evaluation mi;ttrix by means of which the evaluation
             is conducted.   Along the left-hand side of the matrix, objectives are listed.
             A long the top, the small Roman humerals denote the ten alternative systems
             as ordered in the previous sub-section.


             In the top left-hand corner of each matrix element a score is entered.          This
             score shows the extent to which the system fares between the       extreme~     of
             fully meeting the objective (in which case it would score.ten) and doing
                    -                                       ,

             nothing_ to achieve the objective (in which case it would score zero).         The
             scores are not cardinal rankings and do not sum to control totals.

                                                .-243-
In the bottom right-hand corner of each matrix element is thE'. score multi-
plied by the weighting given to the objective, the degree of fulfillment of
which the score measures.       These products are summed to give a unique
total score for each system.


A slight variation is introduced to deal adequately with economic efficiency.
Before the score is multiplied by the objective weight, each of the Jwo
economic efficiency-generated objectives is multiplied by a probability
factor stipulating the likelihood that the amount of the charge would be
perceived and correctly allocated, to the relevant travel movement.
Efficiency cannot be achieved without a high value for this probability factor.


The matrix contains the scores which are judged to be fair and unbiased
·reflections of the merits of the alternative schemes. (l)   The reader could
score differently, however, and still claim that fairness and lack of bias
prevails.     It was found that the scores can be varied over a reasonable
range without having any significant consequence upon the conclusions.


4. 3. 4   Evaluation Results

Summing the products of_ scores and weighting factors as specified in Table
4; 2 indicates that the alternatives should be ranked in order of desirability
for Caracas as shown in column one of Table 4. 3.


All of those schemes which achieve ratings of greater than 5. 0 are variants
of supplementary licensing.     Those variants which involve sophistications
to the charging structure seem to be preferable to supplementary licensing
with charge variation possibilities neither through time nor through space,
other than the binary, all-or-nothing differentation.




(1)       The scores may be liable to subconscious bias by the par-
          ticular views and references of the evaluator. This possibility
          is acknowledged even though considerable care was taken to
          obtain a high degree of impartiality.

Ratings between 4. 0 and 5. 0 were calculated for area admission charges
and pricing mechanisms acting upon parking.         Within those mechanisms
acting upon parking, when control is extended to embrace privately-owned
space, a significantly higher ·r'ating is indicated.


Each of the remaining alternatives rate at less than 4. 0. with the lowest
totals applying to differential fuel taxation and to selective property taxation,


In Table 4.3., the ranking structure shown in column one is denoted as
being that which might result from the preference surface of the economist.
The economist is likely to attribute more weight to aspects' of economic
efficiency than might the average concensus of professional opinion.      The
sensitivity of the ranking to alternative preference surfaces is therefore
tested in the two remaining columns of the table.


The accountant's ranking in column 2 of Table 4. 3 puts more weight upon
cost considerations, and less upon economic efficiency. (l)      It is assumed
for the preparation of column 2 that the accountant accepts the scoring

                                                             -
system of Table 4. 2 but modifies somewhat the relative weights given to
the objectives in Table 4. 1 so that cost considerations are assigned relative
weights of 0. 25 and 0.15 for capital costs and operating costs respectively;
·and economic efficiency in the transport sector and broader environmental
effects are given weights of 0. 15 and 0. 05 respectively.


Using this more conservative preference surface, the supplementary
                                                .                         .
licensing schemes are indistinguishable amongst themselves but jointly
remain the best.    The extra weight attached to matters of cost is outstandingly
evidenced by the demotion of area admission charges from being quite a
close competitor to supplementary licensing to being the least preferred




(1)    The accountant would not recognize many of the components
       which the economist would use to define econom~c efficiency;
       for instance the value of non-working time is zero in the eyes
       of the accountant who generally refuses to admit to the principle
       of opportunity cost.

alternative, and also by the much better relative performance of differential
excise licensing.


The economist might also tend to place less w_eight upon matters of equity
and more weight upon matters of efficiency compared to others members of
society.      The values of the more egalitarian members of society are
reflected in the ranking shown in the last column of Table 4. 3.        The
ranking has once again assumed that the originally-allocated scores, which
define how well each scheme measures up to· each objective, are as initially
reasoned but that the weighting given to certain of the objectives changes.


The egalitarian is deemed to reverse the economist's proportionate weight-
ings of the economic efficiency and equity criteria.        Within the former,
transport and environmental factors are weighted equally; while within the
·latter, vertical equity is given three times the weight of horizontal equity.
The result of the application of the egalitarian' s point of view is to lend
much more support to the ranking of the economist than to that of the
               ( 1)                    .                ,
 accountant.


 If one calculates an unweighted average of rankings, as indicated in each of
the columns of Table 4. 3, a clear manifestation of the superiority of
 supplementary licensing emerges.          ·.After supplementary licensing comes
 parking control which extends to the private sector.       This is then followed
 by differential excise licensing, area admission      charges~   control of publicly-
 owned parking space, and selective employment taxation respectively, with
 the other .options being ranked below these.


 4. 3. 5   Conclusions

 With all but the accountant's preference surface, the more complex variants




 (1)       In the context of road pricing, it could often occur that a scheme
           which would be economically efficient would also be equitable.
           Thus the compatability between the views of the economist and
           the socialist· is not surprising.

        of supplementary licensing prevail marginally over the simple variant·which
        it was decided to investigate in detail for Caracas.    This choice was made
        primarily on the grounds of the risk element and the consideration that a
        more simple scheme would be likely to be implemented within a reasonable -
        time period so as to enable the reaping of some of the potentially-·available
        benefits.       The accountant weighs risk more than does either the economist
        or the egalitarian by placing greater value upon the more immediate and
        more objective factors of cost than on either economic efficiency-related
        benefits or equity implications.


        It is wise to reduce the risk element by firstly testing out the simplest and
        the least expensive variant of the preferred generic category .of system. (l)

        If an unforeseen and unsurmountable. obstruction to the success of the generic
    I   category is made apparent following an initial application of the simple
I       variant, comparatively little is lost.' If no such difficulty arises_, the simple
    t   scheme can be evolved into a more sophisticated variant.       A pattern of
        development can be imagined; initially, simple supplementary licensing is
1   I   applied; this is followed by more sophisticated variants on the latter theme
        capable of dealing with either or both diurnal or spatial charge variation;
        these schemes could be eventually superseded by electronic point pricing.

        In order to focus down on a broad, but operational, specification of a road
        pricing scheme likely .to be feasible and beneficial in the Caracas context
        in the near future, the study so far has identified a number of possibilities,
        and has assessed their implications and suitabnity.      As a result, it has
        ·converged, in general terms, on some simple variant of supplementary

4. 4. 1   Extent of Area

A transport simulation model subjected two alternative areas(l) of. the city
to supplementary licensing.     These areas comprise the Central Business
District (CBD) and the Caracas Metropolitan Area (CMA).         The limits of
the latter, established by Presidential Decree in 1950, roughly conform with
                    "
the periphery of the contiguously built-up area of the city; while the former
embraces the much smaller central area of the city which is currently the
most subjected to traffic congestion and is delineated in Figure 4. 6 .. · The
CBD includes the parishes of Altagracia, Candelaria, Catedral, San Juan,
                                                                                      .\
Santa Teresa, Santa R.osalia, and San Agustin.      This area was selected for        I
subjection to pricing for the following-reasons:

              (i)   Most importar:itly, the designated CBD is that area of
                    the city where congestion costs are presently the.
                    most severe. Congestion costs generated by each
                    p. c. u. per kilometer are presented by road type in
                    a geographically disaggregated format in Table 4. 4,
                    and are summarized in a graphical fashion in Figure
                    4. 7. In the CBD, present congestion costs average
                    Bs. 0. 9023 (per p. c. u. per kilometer).  The area of
                    next most intense congestion in the CMA is Las
                    Mercedes/San Homan where such .costs average
                    Bs. O. 4489, i.e., less than one-half of those in the
                    CBD.

                    The use of the severity of present congestion as a
                    criterion for deliniating a priced area on grounds
                    of economic efficiency must be considered in relation
                    to possible variations in demand responsiveness.
                    There is clearly more rationality behind pricing with
                    the objective of increasing efficiency where demand

           (ii)    Another aspect of the first reason is that the desig-

                   traffic congestion as indicated by vehicle speed and
                   volume measurements. (_2) Some quite serious con-
                   gestion does occur elsewhere in Caracas, for instance
                   in Sabana Grande, but this is more locally concentrated
                   and does not prevail more or less continually through-·
                   out a distinct geographic area. It is considered that
                   pricing should be applied where congestion is seen to
                   occur at the present for reasons of public accept-
                   ability and support although such is not necessarily
                   required for economic efficiency.

                   exceptional treatment with regard to payment for the
                   use of road space, and relatively little retail shopping
                                                                                  I

                   would divert some of their customers elsewhere.




(1)    The rather high congestion costs currently prevailing in Las
       Mercedes I San Roman are to a significant degree the result of
       road construction works (of a temporary nature).

       10 which deals with speed versus flow relationships.                           .   .

                  to the Sabana Grande/ Chacaito area, further to the
                  east, which is more dependent on private car access.

           (iv)   The designated area has a reasonably low ratio of
                  circumference to area enclosed and a relatively small
                  p.umber 1of thoroughfares' crossing.the perimeter.
                  Much of the enforcement activity would be at the
                  perimeter of the area so that any raising of the
                  circumference:area ratio would add to enforcement
                  costs without necessarily contributing an equivalent
                  amount to the effectiveness of the system. This
                  consideration was also weighed when the decision was
                  made to exclude a finger-like extension along the
                  Calle Heal de Sabana Grande to Chacaito. Any such
                  finger-like extension would also be subject to evasion
                  by north-south and south-north drivers who would
                  be encouraged to risk traversing the area without
                  payment since the distance to be travelled within the
                  area would be short and the potential time savings
                  would be large. (1) ·                            ·

           (v)    Car travellers have reasonably good route and mode
                  alternatives for travel to and through the CED; but
                  significantly worse. alternatives would prevail were
                  any extension to this area to be made. Many bus·
                  and por puesto services radiate from El Silencio
                  (San Juan) and movement by public transport through
                  this area often involves a change of vehicle. The
                  Metro will provide a good service to the designated
                  area. Through traffic, having neither an origin or
                  destination in the area and which adheres to its initially
                  chosen mode, can avoid the pricing area via, for
                  instance, for east-west traffic, the Autopista del
                  Este located to the south, while south-north traffic
                  has alternatives to the east of the priced area.
                  Furthermore, the Metro will provide a· good service
                  to the designated area in the near future.    Little
                  purpose is served. by forcing charges upon price-
                  insensitive traffic which has little option but to pay them. ( 2 )



(1)    It would probably be economically efficient to exempt such move-
       ments from pricing. This would very much complicate the
       scheme and would increase the number of attempts at evasion.
( 2)   Such a transfer might serve some purpose in redistributing income
       or in providing for, and giving guidance to the planning of, trans-
       portation investment, but such effects are outside the scope of
       this study.

        The selection of the priced area was accomplished without resort to a
        specific detailed optimization procedure such as would be called for in a
        theoretical economic investigation.        Theoretically, economic efficiency·
        would be achieved when a marginal        ex~ension   to the priced area adds as
        much to the costs of (i) those thereby-encouraged to change route or mode,
        and, (ii) enforcement and administration, as it does to the benefits from
        decreased .travel times to travellers as a whole.         Any such optimization
        procedure should recognize the infinite number of ways in which the priced
        area could be re-drawn, simultaneous variations in the amount of the charge
        levied, and accompanying possibilities to revise the set of vehicle types
        upon which charges are to be leyied.          This is a complex task (to say the
        least~   ).   It would also be difficult in such ari analysis to ·allow adequately
        for social and political considerations which are of prime importance to the
        general degree of acceptability of the road pricing and which determine its
        chances of becoming a matter of fact.


        So as to act as a benchmark for comparison, a quantitative assessment
        was also made of the effects supplementary licensing on the whole of the
        study area, i.e., the CMA. (l)        The enforcement costs of such a scheme
        have not.been investigated in detail but are considered to be substantial:
        perimeter patrols would be ineffective leaving very costly forms of area-
                                                   2
        wide control as the probable alternative. ( ) It is to be concluded from the
        benefit calculations, which are presented in summary form in Section 5, 5,
        that the gross benefits in the morning peak hour of the pricing of the CMA
        at realistic price levels exceed the corresponding gross benefits from




        (1)       When the CMA was tested, the PPT (par puesto and taxi)
                  mode was excluded from pricing.. When the CBD was·
                  appraised, the contrary was assumed.

        ( 2)       A ddit.ional administrative complications would present them-
                  ·selves, e.g., extensive allowance would have to be made for
                   vehicles parked outside of residences throughout the periods
                   of pricing.

    These calculations, however, must .be regarded as not being represe_ntative
    of the actual results to be expected in practice, for several reasons:

                (a) '   The difference in operational enforcement costs,
                        which was not estimated, would shift the result
                        in favor of the smaller. pricing area.

                (b)      No allowance was made in the computations for the
                         suppression of trips as contrasted with shifts of
                         trips from one mode to another.      This suppression
                         of trips would be likely to be much more important
                        ·outside than within the CBD, for several reasons:
                         more of the trip~ are of a non-essential nature,
                         the possibility of substituting trips by public
                         transportation. is generally less attractive and in
                         s.ome cases almost impossible or excessively costly.

                (c)     The use of a smaller priced area would have the
                        additional beneficial effect, not explicitly allowed
                        for in the calculations, of tending to cause a gr.eater
                        concentration of jobs for employees tending to be.
                        more oriented towards public transportation, within
                        the priced area.    The use of the broader priced
                        area would have no comparable effect.


    In any case, the political acceptability of the scheme would rest to a large
    extent on the perceived relationship between the charges and congestion,
    and it is likely that the smaller priced a'rea would rank much higher on this
    score thar:i would the pricing of the entire CMA.

l   However, the smaller area which has been suggested for the application of
    pricing (i.e., the CED), because of its size, has to be treated with some
I   caution.   It comprises only some 4-1I2 square kilometers and thus no
    eventual destination within it is outside of walking range from its perimeter.
    Consequently it is likely that many affected car travellers would attempt

larger price-cl area, should take the form of on-street parking limitations
and controls over the provision of off-street parking limitations and controls
over the provision of off-street parking space beyond the priced area.

4. 4. 2   Levetof Charge·

Transport model simulations of situations with-.CBD pricing indicate that
benefits as· calculated by consumer-surplus procedure (l) are maximized at
a price level of Bs. 2. 00 per .p. c. u. trip, or thereabouts, for the morning
peak hour (07:00-07:59 inc.).   This implies a daily supplementary
                                                       .          , Ucence
charge of approximately Bs. 6. 00, the computation of which is described
later in this section.      Any greater price level may be unattractive for
social and political reasons even though greater quantitative benefits are
indicated by the application of higher charges using an alternative evaluation
               2
:methodology. ( ) Thus a price of Bs. 2. 00 per p. c. u. t!'.'iP is taken as the·
most beneficial price level as indicated by the model work.


For certain technical reasons, explained elsewhere, ( 3 ) the indicated

price level of Bs. 2. 00 for the morning peak hour is likely to be too.high
for the maximization of benefits.      It is conjectured that a charge of. Bs. 1. 7 5
per p. c. u. trip, and maybe even less, would be appropriate were pricing
to be confined to this period and were no congestion to prevail at other times
of the day. (l)   Applying this lower charge level, and given that a PPT
represents l, 25 p. c. u. 's and one a_verage goods vehicle equals 1; 50 p. c. u. 's,
in principle such vehicles would be called upon to pay Bs. 2. 20 and Bs. 2. 60
per trip respectively.     Buses were assumed to be exempted on the grounds
that to price them would deter marginal users and would consequently force
extra costs upon those who continue to use the service because they would be
offered a marginally less frequent service on a marginally less dense route
network.     A similar   argum~nt   could be extended to the PPT service, which
too was assumed to be exempted when pricing was extended to cover the
complete CMA.       To a considerable degree, the pricing of PPT or of buses
would occasion the switching of demand to buses or to PPT respectively,
leading to an indirect raising of the level of service on the competing mode.
The distributional reasons for exempting buses are more persuasive than
those for exempting PPT.      If both were exempted a greater subsidy would
be implied for PPT passengers s-ince, per person trip, this mode is a more
significant creater of congestion.


The charge of Bs.1. 75 per p. c. u. trip is appropriate to the morning peak
hour only.    It was decided on grounds of practicality that the price should
be levied for travel within the priced area between the hours of 06:30 and
18:30 (at least during 'the initial period of the scheme).     Should it be main-
tained that congestion :throughout the day is sufficient to warrant pricing
throughout the day then some economies might be made regarding enforce-
ment activities if policing were to be confined to a more restricted period/ 2 ) ·

( 2)   For example, it might be more efficient to levy charges between
       6:30 - 10:00 a. m. and between 1:00 - 4:00 p. m. on the grounds
       that return trips to the CBD could be covered by the inward ·move-
       ment only.    Efficiency would result by removing the need to pay
       overtime rates to enforcement staff.

        During inter-peak periods in the CED, a greater proportion of total travel
        is likely to involve persons in working time, (l) such as goods vehicle crews,
        and business representatives travelling by car or by taxi, than would be
        the case during the peak hour.      Consequently, mean time-values are
        expected to be higher during the inter-peak periods.       Thus, any given
        tfrhe delay enforced upon other road users would be more costly during
        inter-peak periods than during the peaks.

I.


I       It is likely that, under a road pricing regime, the somewhat paradoxical
        situation would occur whereby traffic volumes are greater, in the CED,
        during the traditional "inter-peak" periods than they are during the
        traditional "peak".     Partially because mean time values arehigher
        during the. inter-p~ak, this conclusion follows from the fact that the price-
        sensitivity of demand for p. c. u. distance travelled is expected to be lower
        during these periods than at the peaks.


        Currently, on a sample of 23 stretches of roadway within the CBD, vehicle
        flows per hour average between 2100 and 2200 per kilometer between the
        hours of 07:30 and 20:00 except from 12:00 to 14:30 when a slight dip, down
        to 1850, occurs.      If a .constant licence charge applies throughout the day,
        . then the effect of the lower inter-peak price-sensitivity would be likely




         (1)    Shopping-pl,lrpose trips and trips for other non-business·

                ation would be accentuated by pricing.

scheme not only would the social CO$ts of a given amount of delay forced
onto other road users be greater during inter-peak periods than during
peak periods, but the assumption of -:_qual g:i,ven amounts of delay is not
valid: .the amo·unt of the inter-peak delay would exceed the equivalent peak
,delay.    However, it should be borne in mind that the statistics upon which
this latter assertion was based used vehicles rather than persons, or even
p. c. u. 1 s, as a denominator so that some doubt must prevail as to its
                                                                                 I

No confident statement can be made as to the distance of heavily trafficked
road space consumed by a typical inter-peak car movement versus a typical
peak car movement.       A case could be made _out in either direction because
of the lack of any adequate ~mpirical statistical base data.     Thus, no firm
foundation exists for a belief _that the congestion costs attributable· to a
component of inter-peak traffic are either more or less than to a component
of peak car traffic.


It would appear that no sound case can be made out on presently available
data that the optimal.                                     . is significantly
                       licence fee for inter-peak car traffic
different in either direction than that for peak car traffic. Anyway, because
of the probable lesser degree of price-sensitivity of inter-peak traffic, the
charge appropriate to peak traffic should be .given a greater weight in the
'decision process for the selection of a reasonable on-day charge.

charge (after routings have been affected by the first increments to price).




(1)       The variation in demand elasticities throughout the day might
          imply that inter-peak patronage would be asked to bear the
          brunt of the licence fee unless fares were regulated (for
          traffit to and from the CBD),

 (2)      It can be argued, however, that the greater is the diversion
          of funds from private to public pockets, the greater is the
          potential contribution to economic well-being.

                  A daily charge of Bs. 15. 00 per goods vehicle would seem to be suitable
                  bearing in mind the use that such vehicles make of congested road space
                  and the amount that car owners are called upon to pay.


                  Goods vehicles vary markedly in power-weight ratio, size, cumbersomeness,
                  and hence, p. c. u. factor in Caracas.       A case might be made out for having
                  separately priced licences for different types of goods vehicles; for instance,
                  a compact Lambretta tricycle-van is quite agile on urban streets (1) and ·.
                  would be called upon to pay less than would a heavy-duty tractor and trailer.
                  This would somewhat add to the complexities of administration and enforce-
                  ment but was mainly deemed to be unworthwhile on the ground that a light
                  vehicle with iow p. c. u. factor tends to make proportionately more use of
                  potentially congested road space than a less nimble truck used for longer-
                  . distance journeys.


                  4. 4. 3   Conclusions

                  The considerations developed in the foregoing discussion, lead to the
                  conclusions that:

                                  1.   The priced area should comprise the CED
                                       as delineated in Figure 4. 7.

                                       CBD road-space between the hours of 06:30
                                       and 18:30 as suggested elsewhere in the report,
                                       then the daily charge should be Bs. 6. 00 for
                                       private cars, a minimum of Bs. 20. 00 for PPT,
                                       and Bs.15. 00 approximately for goods vehicles,
                                       with buses, motor and pedal cycles being
                                       exempted. ( 2)

                            congestion, being highly agile. Pedal cycles in the city are
                            used almost exclusively for recreational purposes on access
                            roads within residential areas.

                  Public acceptance of a supplementary licence scheme, and the feasibility

                  convenience and simplicity of the pricing mechanism used.          One option

     4. 5. 1   Types of Permit

     The nomenclature of the two main types of permit highlights their difference.
     The date-specific type comprises all permits which, through a unique color
      or number scheme,
                 .      or both, have _their
                                      .
                                             validity limited to. a specific
                                                                         .   day in
      a year. Such permits have the advantages that they would not need other
      accessories (such as calendars) to make their meaning clear; they could
      be manufactured immediately and fairly cheaply; and their maximum individ-
     ual size would be constrained only by considerations of driver visibility
      (assuming they would be affixed somewhere on the front part of the vehicle),
      cost and convenience of storage and handling.      Their disadvantages lie in
     that many permits bought might nqt be used and therefore become invalid;
      and facilities for refund, or crediting the- refund equivalent, would have to be
      established to discourage motorists from using out-of-date permits and to
      maintain public respect for the scheme.      Concessionaires charged with the
      sale of per.mits would be tempted· to overstock to cover fluctuations in daily
      demand; and this would waste space and call for more credit arrangeme_nts
      for dealing with unsold stocks.


      The ,non-date-specific type, by contrast, comprises permits valid for use
      during any day of the year; once in use, however, they become invalid at the
     ' end of the day on which they are employed,

/·
      This type of permit could .take one of a number· of forms.     The first, and
      most readily available, would be to use the permits in association with a
      calendar such that the adhesive application of the permit to any specific date
      marked on the calendar wquld indicate the permit's date of validity.        Permits
      would be standard, and would not be wasted by becoming invalid merely
      because of the passage of time.      No refunding facilities would be required
      and concessionaires' stocks would be kept at practical levels.     The maximum
      size of the individual permit would, however, be limited by considerations of
      the maximum size of the calen.dar and the space allocated on it for one out
      of 23 days, the maximum number ·of week days in a month.         This would imply
      a permit   ~onsiderably   smaller than one in the date-specific category.    Also




                                          -267-
concessionaires and users would have the extra inconvenience of having
to handle the calendars·.


Another·form, also readily available, would involve full-si-ze daily permits
val~dated   for a particular day by requiring the user to mutflate it approp-
riately ·prior to use.   This. is a promising method for application as it
would require only five figures (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16) that, in combination, would
sum to any date in a month.        Thus the figures could be made much larger,
and therefore be more visible, than those described for the previous method
wherein the calendar accommodates 23 figures.          To indicate a date would·
only require the removal (or obliteration) of those numbers not required
to sum to the date to be designated.       The permits would need to be coded
to the months of the year, and to years, probably employing color, to
                                                                                     i       I
prevent r·epetitive use of the permits.       Because the permits would, to this             i
                                                                                             I

application or exposure.·      This concept is pre.sently under development in
the U.S.; it is therefore not available for immediate use.        Motivation for
its advance comes from industries dealing in perishable goods such as
photographic supplies, food and drink.        This method, when operational for
road pricing, would eliminate the need for a calendar and would enable the
                                                                                         ;

space on the calendar.        However, . the production cost of such a permit, at·
least in its first year·s of introduction, would probably be significantly higher
than any other using non-sensitized paper.


4. 5. 2   TJser Specificity

As explained in Section 4. 3, the daily supplementary licence charge could
vary according to the type of vehicle entering and circulating in the priced
area.     Thus, permits would need to be user-specific at least to this -vehicle-




                                      -268-
     class level of disaggregation comprising private cars, trucks and PPT's.
     Buses would be exempt, without being required to show evidence of its
     exempt classification; while vehicles owned by residents living in the
      priced area would receive annually, when being registered, a special
     vehicle permit for free, or for a small charge to cover administrative
      costs involved in validating the residence requirement; these permits
     would be marked with th_e registration numbers of the vehicles.


      Permits could also be user-specific to a level of individual drivers, or
     vehicle owners, or else to individual vehicles, thus making them non-trans-
     . ferable at this highly disaggregated level.     Users could be allowed or
      required to stamp their registration number on the permit at the time of.
      purchase.     There is some advantage to tying permits to users in this way·
      in order to reduce the incidence of theft 1 and to prevent owners of vehicles
      resident in the priced area from transferring their special annual permits
      to unauthorized persons.     Legitimate ,transfers of permits could be shown
      to be valid by requiring both t_he original owner and the recipient to counter-
      stamp the permit.     If the mail service were to become more reliable,
      pre-stamped user-specific permits could be distributed through this--Channel.


      4. 5. 3   Design Considerations

      The pe.rmit, irrespective of its type, should conform to certain basic design
      criteria if it is to be acceptable and useful.
 I                       1ts size, color pattern, date (in case of a
                         date-specific permit) and location on a month-
                         specific calendar (in the case of a non-date
                         specific permit) should be such that it is Clearly
                         visible to a trained enforcement officer standing
                         at a distance equivalent to two traffic lanes or
                         roughly seven meters from a vehicle, travelling
                         at 50 kph, to which it is correctly affixed.

                          To avoid forgery the permit would need to be
                          printed on special paper or other material

                             A basic holder for date-specific permits, or for
                             non-date-specific permit calendars is desirable
                             but not essential, .and could be provided and
                              installed free of charge.    The unit would be firmly
                              fixed to the vehicle so that it could not be easily
                              removed or become loose.       It could form part of
                             the registration plate, though its location might
                              prove physically inconvenient to users stooping
                             to attach the permits, a:nd might mean that plates
                             would have to be of a special type for vehicles
                            -resident in the city-region. Or it could be
                              affixed to the front near-side fender or door post
                              (similar to driving mirrors) where permits would
                              be more visible. However, it might be difficult
                             to install the holder, at least on the fender, with-
                              out defacing the vehicle.    Also, occasional out-
                              of-town visitors to the priced area would most
                            . probably not be equipped with this unit.     Thus an
                              optional' location for the permit should be permitted.




i       I
            (1)   The matter of liH~r is important since for CBD road pricing
I                 in Caracas, upwards of 100, 000 used permits might be thrown
                  on the streets each day in addition to the protective sheets
                  stripped off the 100, 000 or so .fresh daily permits that would
                  replace them.

            (2)   However, as the layers of used permits or calendars became
                  thicker, it would be easier to steal them without ripping
                  apart th.e valid permit or calendar freshly stuck on the top
                  surface .. Theft of this description would be made mpre
                  difficult if permits carried the users (rubber-stamped)
                  registration numbers.

                    An optional or aHernative location for the display
                    of permits on vehicles could be the exterior near-
                    side top corner of the windshield in the case of
                    automobiles, and the near-side lower corner in
                    the case of trucks provided that windshield wl.per
                    operations give adequate clearance.       ·

                    Another alternative display location could be
                    identical to that mentioned previously •for auto-
                    mobiles and trucks respectively, but on the
                    interior surface of the windshield. The presence
                    of anti-glare tinting on the upper portion of an
                    automobile windshield could be sufficient grounds
                    for the owner to place the permit in the lower
                    corner.


4. 5. 5   Format Considerations

Date-specific permits could be issued individually, or in booklets containing
supplies for one week or one month.      Non-date specific permits could also
be issued individually but weekly and monthly supplies would best be made
available in sealed transparent envelopes or else formatted in booklets-.


Monthly calendars for the non-date-specific permits requiring calendars
could also be issued singly or in one-year booklets.      These could be supplied
free of charge, or for a token charge.       They should be color coded to each
month with the week day dates clearly printed on the space reserved for each
daily permit.     The month and year should also be included.


The size of a permit should be limited to one suitable to fit a man.' s jacket
pocket provided this is consistent with other size determinants.


4. 5.   n Factors R.elevant to Permits in the Caracas Context
The design, display and format considerations mentioned above not only
occasionally conflict with one another but also are not necessarily uniform
in the_ir relevance throughout th_e world.    It should be useful therefore to
identify some behavioral attitudes in the Caracas Metropolitan Area that
might influence the manner in which the supplementary licence permit is
presented and prescribed for use in order to improve public response.            The

reader should be prepared to accept in this section of the report some gross
generalities which have. been introduced to keep the text within useful limits.


There is, perhaps, in Caracas (and in some other Latin American cities) a
less aeveloped concern for community interests than might be found in
Anglo-Saxon countries.     Much of the life of the life of the people revolves
. around the extended family and the family's friends.        Prior concern is for
the interests of this small group.       Thus, relatively small measures enforced
by a public authority in the. interests of the community at large - - measures
that create some inconvenience but also some benefits to most members of
the community -- do not provoke a high level of cooperation unless the
benefits derived appear to accrue directly to the family circle.        For instance,
                 .                 .
. regulations controlling traffic operations do not command much respect
unless the benefit is immediately perceived by, and accrues in some direct
way to, the motorist (such as avoidance of a serious accident by drivi.ng on
the correct side of the road).   Regulations bestowing benefits diffused over
a wider area, such as increased road capacity benefits through off-street
parking prohibitions, do not 'Command a gbod response.


This attitude is re-enforced by a fairly high per-capita income level which
 enables many, and particularly the car-and-home-owning population,· to
. take a rather cavalier attitude with respect to laws related to tax matters.
Tax evasion' appears to be prevalent, and fines and other penalties low in
 comparison to per-capita resources.           Even these are often avoided by
corrupt practices.


To acquire property is an approved aspiration in the city, though often the
property is not well maintained.        Once acquisitiveness is satisfied, and
the benefits derived from novelty and status decline, the time and other
investments necessary to kee13 .the property in a fit state are not perceived
to compensate adequately for the foregone benefits to be derived from
investing in competing obligations to maintain expected behaviour patterns.




                                       -273-
Systematic crime in the country is prevalent in some areas, especially car
theft, cattle rustling and forgeries of bank-notes, and to some lesser     e~tent,

state and municipal lottery tickets.    Ve.nezuelan immigration papers :;i.nd_ .
national identity cards are also forged in neighboring countries.      Fairly-
high priority is placed on enforcing the law against most of these types of
offense, as well as against other grave crimes of a less systematic nature
such as murder.      Enforcement of laws of a regulatory nature, or laws
against petty crime, appear to receive a lower priority; thus reliance is
                .                   '
often placed at this level on crash-action programs of a short duration that
have only short-run effects.


Protest against imposed systems is occasionally expressed through the
defacement of guidance facilities such as traffic signs; and the normally
slow r:ate at which the damage is rectified might indicate the degree to
which cultural attitudes affect the commitment of public authorities to the
systems they themselves initiate and enforce.


The educational level of the police operating in the city is low.     It is likely
to remain so in the near future until the impact of improved and more wide-
spread education programs affect the quality of the nation's work force, and
th.e wages of the police are increased 1n attract higher caliber personnel.
Inevitably, with the present manpower available, even the simplest enforce-
ment procedure may pose difficulties which would not be encountered else.-
where.


These foregoing highly generalized considerations suggest that any road
pricing scheme established in Caracas should be one where the elements of
it that are handled by the public, namely the permit, and its accessories
if any, should:

            (i)     be highly convenient in user operation;

            (ii)    facilitate enforcement officers to the maximum
                    extent possible in the exercise of their tasks;

            (iii)   require little maintenance of any physical
                    facility;




                                   -274-
             (iv)    not produce litter;

             (v)     be highly proofed against forgery;

             (vi)    be proofed against fraudulent behavior; . and

             (vii) ·be very secure against theft when on the
                    vehicle.


 4. 5. 7 ·Design of Date-Specific Permit

· Figure 4. 8 shows an illustratio11 of a supplementary licence permit valid for
 a private automobile on the eleventh day .of a specific month of a specific
 year. It would be diamond in shape, ·measure 12 x 12.centimeters, fit
 into a jacket pocket, be highly visible under daylight conditions, and be fully
 effective in the Caracas context.      The date would _always be printed in white.
 A serial number would be printed on the face of the permit to help guard
 against bulk theft.·   Each month would be distinguished by a two-fold    com~
 bination of col()rs created out of the following six: blue, green, yellow, red,
 orange and black.      This combination allows 30 months to be identified
 before reversing color masses across the diagonal indicated in Figure 4. 8;
                              .                                '
 this would allow a second set of 30 months tO be identified.      A further 90
. ·months could be identified if the diagonal line separating the colors is first
 set vertically: the two.:.fold color combination would be used and afterwards
 reversed. The dividing line would then be set horizontally with the use of
 the colors following the same dir~ct and reverse procedure. The month
                                  \

  an.d year corresponding to each color combination would be printed on the
. rear of the 'permit. In total, 120 moriths or 10 years could be covered ·in.
 this way which should be sufficient to discourage people from storing used
 permits (not initially affixed to the vehicle in the authorized manner) for reuse;
 and would probably encompass the period during which automatic point
 pricing would be instituted.


 The permit for trucks w'ould be octagonal, and that of por puestos and taxis
 rectangular, cut to roughly the same dimensions as those for the automobile •
.The shap.e of the permit with respect to each cla;ss of vehicle is such that
 there would be no monetary benefit derived from tampering with the shape

of an octagonal one to make it diamond.      If required, or desired, the
user-registration' number would be stamped on its front surface.


The permit, made out of cardboard incorporating colored threads to prevent
forgery, would be accommodated iri a plastic holder affixed to the exterio_r
surface of the vehicle winds"hield, on the near-side top corner in the case
of automobiles, and on the near-side lower corner in the case of trucks·
(or as low as windshield-wiper operations allow).      The rear of the permit·
would be of a light color so that the counter-stamping of user registration
numbers could be effectuated legibly in the event of the permit's transfer .
of ownership.

When sold, either individually or in booklets, the permit would have as an
integral part of it a talon conveniently detachable along a perforated line.
To validate the permit would merely require the user to tear-off the talon
prior to placing the permit in its holder.    The dimensions of the holder

                                                               -
would be such that it would not accommodate .the double thickness of the
cardboard if the user were to bend back the talon so that it might appear
later that the permit was unused and t:herefore apparently eligible for a
refund. (l)   A further precaution against such fraud might.require the permit
to be manufactured.with a hole punched close to·the talon through which the
talon would be visible if folded back.     The inside surface of the holder
could be provided with a brightly .colored but difficult-to-counterfeit pattern
so that its simulation on the back of the talon, or on a.material affixed to
the back of the talon, would be extremely difficult to achieve.

The theft of date-specific permits might not be a serious problem since
the short peric_:>d of the validity of the permit, and its relative cheapness
would probably discourage the prevalence of this offense.          Furthermore,
                                                                                            .J:

permits in order to enter the priced zone there would be few opportunties
for their successful resale.      However, if enforcement were to be largely
confined to stationary vehicles at their destination in the priced area, some
unscrupulous people might plan to .e,nter the priced area without a permit,
buy a premium permit, if checked en route, and if not checked, remove a

If theft does become prevalent for this or other reasons, the marking of
an owner's· vehicle registration number on the pe:r;mit-.!?ight go some way.
to ameliorate the problem.        Alternatively, on extra payment, a permit
user could be provided with a more elaborate holder having a locking
button that would be passed through a pre-'punched hole in the center of the
permit,    The button would have a circular head to hold the permit·hard
down on the holder.        The spring mechanism keeping the button in its locked
position would be designed to be released only by pressing the button further
down against the holder; and to do this the      pe~mit   would first have to be
removed by tearing it out and thereby defacing it.         The legitimate owner
would, of course, have to do this at the end of the day to make room for
the next day' 13 permit.


Premium permits, sold at a higher price than normal to willing. drivers
entering the priced area without valid permits (1) would be overprinted with

disk of 4 centimeters diameter from which would radiate. six tabs each
one spanning 60 deg!'..ees.        Five of the. tabs would be detachable from the
center disk along the disk's pre-scored circumference.            The tabs would
be clearly numbered 1, 2" 4, 8 and 16" respectively.           Since these five
numbers, either singly or when summed selectively, cover all 31 days in

be indicated.    The licence could not then be made valid for use on a sub-
sequent date by removal of further tabs.           The sixth tab, located at the
bottom of the permit, would not be detachable being designed to accommo-
date the user's vehicle registration number, jf the user or the road pricing
authority deem it necessary to stamp it, and also a clearly printed letter
"P",   if the permit is to be sold at a premium within the priced area.            A 11

·The permit would be affixed to a cfrcular plastic holder by pressfog the
 center disk of the. permit, prepunched with an elongated vertical slot, on
to a spike protruding from the center of the holder.          The spike would have
 cros~-sectional   dimensions, similar to the slot in the permit disk to ensure
that the permit would be held snugly in place in a vertical position.         The
 numbers on the tabs, always vertical, . would by implication distinguish
the top from the bottom of the. circular permit. The permit-holder would be

         months thereby reducing the· refunding and credit arrangements
       . because of the extended life of the permits validity. However,
         number-codes distinguishing both days and months on the same
         permit might tax excessively the alertness of even the best of
         the enforcement officers extended over a working day.

fixed to the vehicle windshield, with its position varying according to
vehicle class, as outlined for the date-specific permit-holder.


'By incorporating nylon or si_!llilar filaments in the cardboard material
used for the permit, it should be possible to insure that the removal of a
tab in any normal way would leave a jagged edge such that it would be'
difficult to re-affix a tab, once detached, without leaving moderately con-
spicuous tell-tale marks.     The gap separating each tab from its adjacent
pair, while facilitating removal of any tab from the permit (being attached
only to the center disk), would make it impossible to "bend back, for future
use, a partially detached ta.b behind its nE;!ighbor a fraudulent operation that
might be feasible if the tabs were attached to one another, in spite of the
brittle nature of the cardboard used.


As with date-specific permits, the incidence of theft of non-date-specific
permits could be reduced by stamping the use.r's vehicle registration number
on the face (of the fixed tab) oJ the permit; and int.he event of a legitimate
transfer of the permit both the recipient and the original owner would counter-
stamp their registration numbers on the rear of the permit.        If this
registration numbering proved ineffective iri the combat against theft, the
u~e   of the locking button in conjunction with a ·modified holder, previously
discussed for the d'.'lte-specific permit, could be employed by vehicle users
willing to pay for this device.   in this case, the locking button would replace
the spike in the center of the holder.


The scheme for a non-date.:.specific permit, suggested as being suitable to
the Caracas context meets well most of the criteria outlined in Section 4. 5. 6.
Its one major drawback involves an ele.ment of risk that the educational
level of the enforcement officers, if not much higher than that of the
existing transit police in the CMA, might not be. adequate for most officers
to notice instantly an infringement indicated .?Y a pattern of numbers on a
permit that did not conform with the unique pattern for any given day.       A
special training course for officers would probably go a long way to overcome
this difficulty, if the difficulty were found in test runs to exist.

4. 5. 9    Evaluation of Type of Permit for Caracas Context

Based on the comments contained in the two foregoing subsections, it would
                                                                       I               ·

seem that, while both the date-specific and the non-date-specific types of
permit have some specific advantages in the Caracas context, the latter
would appear, at this preliminary stage of the evaluation, to be the more
desirable to adopt largely on cost and convenience grounds.     For the
public authority the use of non-date-specific permits would reduce the return
of unused previously purchased permits and thus lower the cost of refunding
and crediting arrangements over that required for the date-specific scheme;
it would also tend to simplify the permit distribution requirements since
the public would be likely to buy permits in larger quantities having less
need to anticipate precisely the dates of trips into the priced area.   The
public at large would also find these factors advantageous, especially in
                 .      (1)
t erms o f convenience.


On the other hand, the date figures on the non-date-specific permit would be
smaller, and probably less visible, than the single number on the date-
            ----
specific permit; while, as mentioned above, the need in most cases to
combine figures to indicate a date might work against the effectiveness of
enforcement unless officers were particularly well trained.


Both types of permit appear equally attractive on grounds of maintenance of       ,(

physical facilities (namely the holders), litter production, protection against
forgery, fraudulent behavior and theft.


In selecting between the two types of permit, government would have to weigh
these considerations.     Field studies would be required to establish the
                                                                          ,
visibility shortcomings of the non-date-specific permit, and the degree to




(1)       These advantages would, of course, increase substantially if the
          non-date-specific permit could be made potentially valid over a
          period longer than one month; c. f. previous footnote where the
          addition of three tabs on the permit, suitably numbered, would
          make the permit valid up to eight months.

which enforcement officers can readily discern if this type of perml.t has
been reused or not.       Considerations of litter may, or may not, be a
matter of _importance in the decision.           Certainly the additional adminis-
trative re-quirements to facilitate refunds for unused date-specific permits,
and the lower likelihood of economies of scale in the distribution system
from bulk purchases ,of this type of permit, to say nothing of the additional
accountancy load and greater probability of accountancy errors by all
participants in the distribution activity, are factors that would have to be
weighed most carefully.


The non-date-specific permit using the calendar does have the additional
minor advantage that a change-over to a permit using sensitized paper (if,
·and when, it becomes available), being also of the non-date-specific type,
could be accomplished with minimum administrative rea:djustments.
However, it is quite possible that, by the time this form of permit is on
the market,._ automatic methods of road pricing will be under serious
consideration,. or be in force.


A final   ~actor   that would need to be weighed prior to making a decision on
the type of permit would, of course,        ~e   considerations related to the
distribution of the permit.        This factor is dealt with in the next section
of this chapter.


4. 6   METHOD OF PERMIT DISTRIBUTION
       AND REVENUE COLLECTION     .

The distribution of up to 100, 000 daily permits in Caracas arid the collection
of the associated revenue will pose logistic problems.           The process would
need to be carried out economically, and with the minimum of inconvenience
to customers.        This section of the report discusses the' rationale and
criteria used to identify    th~   more desirable types of sales outlet, the
methods for delivering the permits to vendors, and the methods for col-
lecting the proceeds from vendors.          The administrative and legal aspects
                                                                    .              (1)

I       Decisions on the most appropriate distribution and collection m.ethods for
        road pricing through supplementary licences will be influenced at the
        outset by a number of location-sensitive factors that can vary in importance
        from one geographic area to another.        These factors are set out in Table
        4. 5 together with a description of each as it is conditioned by the Venezuelan

I
        logically from an evalua.tion of each factor in the Venezuelan context,
        suggest distribution and collection methods for Caracas capable of utilizing

l       private sector distributfon facilities, spare employment capacity and, if
        possible, only a limited procedural participation of government.       The
        selected method would alsp call for simple administrative requirements,
        conformity, if possible, with present laws and regulations, and a relatively
        high degree of physical security built into the system. (l)

        general public likely to be affected by the road pricing scheme.


        Decisions ·on the distribution and collection methods w.ould also be inter-
        related with the decision on the type of supplementary licepce permit
        considered most appropriate; that is, the date-specific or non-date-specific.
        Date-specific permits would generate the need for an efficient refund or

permits.     Since government may want to keep its options open regarding
the selection of the_ type of permit, two alternative methods for the retail
distribut_ion pf permits a.re discussed, one suitable for the date-specific
type and the other for the non-date-specific type.      The implications of
each for wholesale distribution considerations, as well as for revenue
collection, are dealt with subsequently.      However, before discussing
retail distribution methods related to non-date-specific permits, which
offer greater flexibility and more readily meets the general criteria, a
description of the essential functions envisioned for vending agents is called
for, since these too .color the appropriate choice of a satisfactory permit
distribution method.


4. 6. 1   Functions of Retail Vending Agents

To obtain a good level of retail servite, vending agents should be required
to carry out the following duties.

              (i)     Ensure that inventories are maintained at, or
                      above, a minimal level based on market demand
                      fluctuatiollii.

              (ii)    Maintain a daily account of sales, refunds (if
                      applicable), and additions to, and state of,
                      inventories.

              (iii)   Submit account statements periodically to the
                      road pricing authority.

              (iv)    Check randomly for permit forgeries on
                      permits tendered for refund.

              (v)     Check that permits have not been used prior
                      to claims for refund.

              (vi)    Be responsible for the safekeeping of invent-
                      ories and cash on:..hand .

             .(vii)   Employ staff adequate in number and quality
                      to provid~ good levels of service.

              (viii) Maintain the vending premises in a clean
                     and orderly state.

             (ix)     Be prepared to cooperate in full w·ith road-
                      pricing authority inspectors in the course of
                      their duty.

4. 6. 2   Retail Distribution of Non-Date-Specific Permits

Since non-date-specific permits would be made potentially valid for at least
one month 1 and perhaps much longer, the public administrative function
 -
controlling the issue of permits to vendor.s would be simplified, manage-.
ment problems for vendors of keeping inventory accounts and of conducting
sales would be reduced, and refunding and crediting arrangements for
unused permits would be minimized.


Thus the use of non-date-specific permits would curtail the role of the
public sector and would increase the number of retail sales outlets able to
participate and cooperate, ranging from small kiosks to gasoline stations,
supermarkets and department stores.          Furthermore, freelance ·operators
such as street vendors, office messengers, shoe-shine boys, as well as
unemployed persons could participate fully ih the scheme as sales agents.
This pragmatic proposal conforms well with the general criteria outlined
                                                                                   _,
previously.     The market mechanism would ensure that agents would, in             i
terms of numbers and location, provide the public with a highly convenient
service.     However, some additional consideration is called for regarding
legal and physical security criteria, as well as the need to provide a built-in·
motivation for agents to participate in the scheme.


At present all agencies involved in the sale of fiscal documents or providing.
receipts for payment of a fiscal nature, e.g., stamps, (l) are required to



(1)       In Venezuela, payments rriade for stamps adhered to letters are
          not necessarily related to the cost of the postal service rendered
          (though in practice it is a factor that enters into the setting of
          tariffs); nor is the income derived earmarked for post-office
          use.    Venezuelan law recognizes as a principle of sound
          budgetary management the notion that specific government revenues
          may not be·· earmarked for related government expenditures
          (Appendix 6, Part I, Section D).. This is so in the area of
          present road user charges and highway expenditures (Appendix 7).
          In practice National Treasury (Ministerio de Hacienda) staff issue
          stamps at the post office and the income derived is lodged directly
          in the Treasury.    Ministry of Communications (Ministerio_ de
          Comunicadones) staff carry out all other post office functions.



                                    - 288-
possess a concession.      Although the supplementary permits'-would probably
be conceived of a special revenue stamps of a quasi- or para-fiscal nature
(destined for payment of a special tax), (l) with their deriv.ed revenue assigned
to the road pricing authority, Venezuelan law would still require vending
agencies to obtain concessions for selling them.     This requirement, in any
case, would seem advisable to ensure that agencies are responsible, have
adequate accounting and.management skills -- albeit at a simple level -- and
have sufficient resources to take reasonable precautions to safeguard their
permit inventories.


It is relevant to note that municipal and state lottery vending agencies are
also required to have concessions even though that part of the proceeds of
the lottery sales held by the public aµthorities do not flow to the National
Treasury4      These agencies often employ ambulant stre·et vendors and others
to increase market penetration.     These street vendors are not concessionaires
since they are considered to be an extension of the agencies holding the
concessions.     It is suggested that a similar means be used to incorporate
free-lancing street vendo'l:'s, office messengers and the like into the retail
sales scheme for permits in such a way that each would check in and out of
his parent agency at the beginning and end of each day.     This would reduce
the accountancy and security burdens of these people to a level consistent'
with their capabilities.


An economic profit margin on the sale. of permits, estimated at ten percent,
should provide sufficient motivation for retail outlets to participate in the
scheme and cover sales costs.      Agencies employing ambulant vendo'rs
would share some of their profits with the vendors.     Thus the revenue
received by the road pricing authority would be slightly below the aggregate
amount of sales.     The authority also might find it worthwhile to purchase
vending machines and locate these in the premises of some of the partici-
pating agencies.

concessionaires located within the priced area, including off-street parking-
facility management and enforcement officers, at a cost such that the
relat~v.e   profit leve.l at.the authorized premium sale price would be the
same- as that on the sale of riormal permits: · but in absolute terms would be
larger in proportion to the price of the premium permit relative to that of
the normal permit.                                                                 I   I

By definition, date-specific permits are relatively inflexible implying that
a considerable amount of effort on the parf of distributors at all levels would    I   I




have to be spent dealing with refunds and the exchange of permits when
unused permits are returned.        It is probable that a date-specific permit
scheme would require retail arrangements having a larger participatfon of
                                                                                   I

                                                                                       I
on the-part of retail outlets and government, which would have to handle
and safeguard a greater quantity of permits, and in general l:ie more limited      I   I

in its ability to adapt to ongoing private-sector retail distribution activites.     I
Private-sector outlets would, of course, need an economic profit margin            I   I

on permit sales to provide an incentive to participate in the distribution
scheme as fras been described for the ·sale of non-date-specific permits. ·


In conformance with the broad locationally and non- locationally sensitive
criteria mentioned above (Table 4. 5), certain categories of retail outlet
have been identified below as being capable of meeting the more arduous
requirements of agents dealing in date-specific permits.        Each category
would require to have concessions in order to operate.        The participations
of free-lance operators, such as street vendors, might have to be


                                                                                   1

eliminated because of their more limited ability to cope with sales as well
as refunds, and because of the physical i;-iconvenience of carrying around
a large number of permits to satisfy customers 1 daily needs in advance .
.Also such vendors might tend to overstock and thereby in.crease the admin-
istrative costs of the sche.me.     The practice of overst?cking could be
reduced if a small discount were applied to the credit on returne.d permits,
but motorists would have to be treated similarly which would lead to con-
siderable user dissatisfaction and resentment.       Ideally, efficiency would
call for such a discount on refunds to reflect the costs involved and to
discourage motorists from.excessive overstocking.             The sale of premium
permits would be similar to that already outlined for premium non-date-
specific permits.


The .categories of retail outlet, or combination of outlets, considered feasible
are discussed principally with three specific operational criteria in mind:
(1) ·convenience to the motorist;    (2) practicality of management;      and
(3) administrative costs.    The categories evaluated comprise (i) special
government agencies--} (ii) lottery offices;   (iii) banks;    (iv) pharmacies;
(v) automobile service stations; (vi) parking lots and garages; and (vii)
other outlets.

            (i)     Special government agencies.     Established and
                    staffed by government, these agencies could
                    meet most effiCiently the need to ·maintain
                    accurate accounts and safeguard inventorie·s and
                    cash in-hand.    In the absence of the market
                    mechanism, however, decisions on the optimal
                    number and locations of outlets would be difficult
                    to make; so also would the degree to which
                    vehicle-access facilities should be provided.
                    But their hours of operation could be tailored to
                    the needs of the public.
                     Initial costs and running costs would be much
                     higher than if the private sector were to assume
                     the permit distribution function.  The cost-
                     effeetiveness level would probably be uns·atis-
                     factory because bureaucratic friction would
                    ,inevitably complicate. procedures; also over-
                     staffing might well occur with few opportunities
                    for dismissing personnel that perform poorly
                     or who prove to be unnecessary.



                                     -291-
(ii)    Lottery offices. These offices, with municipal
        concessions for the sale of approved lottery
        tickets, are conveniently located throughout the
        busier sections of the city, but are not much in
        evidence in the residential sect ions.   They are
        practic_ed in keeping account of their sales and
        inv.entories and in employing ambulant vendors
        (though these would probably be incapable of
        dealing with refunding procedures and therefore .
        not be useful members of the distribution scheme).
        Their hours of opening would have to be modi-
        fied to ensure that some are functioning during
        late hours.    Vehicular access facilities are poor.
        In addition, some members of the public may
        transfer the connotation of "chance'' associated
        with lotteries to their image of road pricing.
        This would be undesirable.

(iii)   Banks. Banks conform well tci all criteria
        except user convenience which is a major draw-
        back. Their limited hours of working, difficulty
        of vehicular access; in some cases, and scarcity
        in residential areas militate against their effec-
        tive use as agents. n is also probable that the
        small profit gained from selling permits would
        not be adequate compensation to banking firms
        for ·the additional customers attracted to their
        premises possibly to the c]etriment of normal
        operations.

(iv)    Pharmacies. These are conveniently located
        throughout most parts of the city, more so in
        the affluent car-owning sections of it than in
        the poorer squatter settlements. At present
        sorp.e pharmacies are authorized to act as agents
        for the collection of telephone bill payments.
        The equipment used for this is an expensive in-
        voice cancelling machine and a cash box both of
        which are supplied free of charge by the telephone
        company.     The operation is conducted under
        formal contract which provides the agent with
        Bs. 0, 20 per transaction. Operating expenses
        are almost negligible so that the small commis-
        sion, together with additional pharmaceutical
        sales generated by the impulse purchases of
        t.elephone company clients, provide sufficient
        motivation to agents to participate in the scheme.

                                                               .·· I
                                                                  I
                       Pharmacies have the advantage that each neighbor-
                       hood in the city has a pharmacy providing all-
 i                     night service.on a rotation basis. The quality
                       of staff is fairly high and accounting procedures
                       are reasonably thorough.      Pharmacies are also
 i                     used to keeping some of their stocks under lock
                       and key. On the other hand, vehicular access
                       facilities are often inadequate to handle frequent

 i                     arrivals and departures. On the whole, though,
                       pharmacies are likely to be a promising and
                       trouble-free ·type of outlet.

 I             (v)     Vehicle gasoline and service stations. Such
                       stations, through the action of the market
                       mechanism, command some of the most accessible
 I                     locations to vehicular traffic in the city except
                       in the central area and in the other active em-,
                       ployment centers where highe~ uses have pre-
II                     empted almost all available space. Because of
                       the services they provide, their design is ad-
                       mirably suited to accommodating vehicles for
                       short dwell periods.    Those who have the re-·
 r                     sources could conveniently buy a week 1 s supply
                       of permits while purchasing gasoline, (1) thus
                       saving time.
 l                     Accountancy rnethods used in some service
                       stations- may not be all .that is desired, but those
                       stations· that failed to keep their books in good
 ~                     shape would tend to lose money and quickly dis-
                       associate themselves from the scheme, or else
                       tighten up their procedures. This weeding-out

 ~
                       process should occur fairly rapidly without
                       adversely affecting the public's confidence in
                       road pricing.

 l              (vi)   Parking lots and garages. These establishments
                       would be well suited as sales agenc:Les since
                       many of them are located in the suggested priced
 l                     area (the central business district) of the city
                       (where gasoline stations, as possible sales
                       agencies, are not plentiful); motorists could
                       save time by combining payment of parking
 i                     charges with the purchase of permits; parking

           making a round trip a day from eastern Caracas to the

           to have its tank filled once a week.

                     attendants, practiced in dealing with motorists,
                     have their dispensing equipment conveniently
                     located near access points; and, as will be seen
                     later, (1) parking attendants could well be re-
                     quired in any case to offer for sale premium
                     permits to motorists wishing to enter parking
                     establishments without. having valid permits on
                     display, and therefore would already have a role
                     as agents. ( 2)

             (vii)   Other outlets. A number of other outlets might
                     also be considered viable for the distribution of
                     date-specific permits. Supermarkets, department
                     stores and other similar large establishments     ·
                     would hav'e the space, parking facilities and
                     responsible management to provide a good service.
                     Vending machines could be used but would most
                     probably be incapable of dealing with refund
                     requirements.


 An alternative scheme that would provide a greater range of possibilities in
 the selection of retail outlets would limit the function of outlets to the sale
--..of permits, while cash refunds and the exchange of permits would be con-
 fined to a special desk at the road pricing authority office.    This arrange-
 ment would not create much hardship since only those leaving the city
 to take up residence elsewhere, or in some similar-type situation, would
 be affecied; and many of these people could always sell their outdated
. permits to friends, who would subsequently exchange them for valid ones,
 since the permits would be transferable.


 Though this alternative scheme would be more flexible and wide-ranging
 in the selection of enterprises eligible to participate in the distribution




 (1)    Section 4.7.

 ( 2)   Attendants would be discouraged by parking management from
        selling··motorists normal permits instead of premium permits,
        when the latter were called for, if the absolute profit margin
        on the premium permit were to be substantially larger than
        that on ·the normal permit as suggested for the non-date-specific
        permit in Section 4. 6. 2.




                                    -294-
scheme, even to the extent of street vendors, the granting of concessions
would have to be carefully conducted so ·as to give priority to those outlets
likely to   provid~   the best service.    These might be off-street parking
facilities, gas service. statio~s and pharmacies.         Also the number of
outlets might have to be controlled since inventory space-needs        woul~.   be
larger and costs generally higher for the sale of date~specific than ·ror.
non-date-specific permits; it would not be wise to dilute the scale of an
agency's turnover below that which is found to be economical (on the basis
of a ten percent profit margin) by appointing too many concessionaires in
the city.     Alternatively, reliance could be placed on competition to weed-
out the inefficient, though initially this process might cause the public
inconvenience and give road PI,'icing some ill repute.


4. 6. 4   Number of Retail Outlets Required

Only a rough E:Stimate can be developed to indicate, in order-of-magnitude
terms, the number of retail outlets that night be required to meet the daily
purchasing demand for permits.            On the assumption that 100, 000 permits
would be .used each day, that 25 percent of users would buy a week's supply,
that 50 percent of the remainder would buy on average two-and-a-half days'
supply, and the rest one each day, some 57, 500 sales transactions would be
made.       If bulk purchases were less frequent resulting in only 10 percent
of users buying a week's supply, 25 percent of the remainder buying on
average two-and-half days' supply, and the rest one ea,ch· day, some
77, 000 sales transactions would be made.          A quantity, then, in the order
of about 70, 000 transactions might be a reasonable estimate.
                                           "   .



If an outlet were already dealing in other goods, it is probable that an
average sales rate of 20 permit transactions per hour, or 160 p·er day
might be achieved.        This would imply 440 outlets.     If the outlets were
dedicated solely to the sale of permits, perhaps four times this rate could
be obtained implying ·only about 100 outlets.        More frequent outlets however
would be advantageous since they would be made more accessible to
vehicle users.




                                      -295-
In the Caracas Metropolitan Area, there are at present some 320 pharm-
                                           2
acies(!) and about 190 gasoline stations. ( ) To this total of 510 outlets
 can be added other possible sales agencies such as parking lots and garages,
lottery establishments, supermarkets and a variety of other stores making
a prob ab le numb.er of 1, 000 outlets likely and qualified to participafe in the
 scheme.       If only one half of these found it worthwhile to participate, there
should be more than enough outlets to meet consumer demand in the city
if only private sector establishments are used .


. 4. 6. 5   Wholesale Distribution of Permits
       r
About 10 wholesale outlets are estimated as being an adequate number to
 cover all the major sectors of the city: the central business district;
 Catia in the west; Antimano in the southwest; Las Acacias, Bello Monte
 and El Valle towards the south; Chacaito towards the east; Chuao and
 Las Mercedes in the southeast; and Petare in the extreme east.·         Each
 would supply about 40 to 50 retail outlets assuming 440 of the latter were
 operating.      Wholesalers would also be permitted to sell directly to the·
 public at wholesale prices if management decided that facilities were
 adequate to provide this service.


 One alternative would be to have these wholesaling establishments operated
 and staffed by the road pricing authority.      This would ensure that the
 establishments were adequately distributed to cover thew.hole of the
 metropolitan area, and would reduce the likelihood of wholesalers under-
 cutting retail sales agencies by selling directly to vehicle users.      This
 might occur if the wholesale establishments were in private .hands resulting
 in distortions in the market mechanism to the detriment of some retail

    concessionaires. These government wholesale establishments could be
    housed in rent2d premises, partly to reduce capital investment costs,
    partly to make it easier to obtain highly accessible locations and partly to
    retain flexibility and avoid costs involved in disposing of physical accom-
    modation if    ~lectronic   methods are fater substituted that do not require·
    such ·space.       More inventory and. counter space would be required if date-
    specific permits were used.          A small strongroom would be, advisable for
    the safekeeping of permits and cash: at least one-day's supply would be
    constantly on hand (10, 000 permits) w.orth about Bs. 60, 000 or more.


    Another alternative would be to let the private sector_ apply for wholesale
    concessions.        The road pricing authority could ·screen-out unsuitable
    candidates and could, to some extent, evaluate potential
                                                    .

    the basis of intended facility location, especially at the initiation stage of
    the scheme.        This initial selection would avoid excessive wastage of private
    effort and inconvenience to retail agencies during· the starting-up period
    when competition between wholesalers would finally weed-out the less
I   efficient either because of inadequate management or poor location choice,
I   or both.
                                    --
               The concessionaires would be responsible for providing on their
                   -                     '    '

    premises facilities for the safekeeping of their inventories and cash.            Bulk
    purchases of permits from the road pricing _authority would be strictly on
    a cash basis.       The road pricing authority might consider providing initial
    short-term cash advances to promising candidates provided that they can
    secure bonds· to guarantee repayment of the loans.


    In fact, the road pricing authority might have to employ a mixture of public
    and private wholesaling establishments.                Private establishments would
    certainly be attracted to the more densely populated areas where larger
    turnovers would provide greater economies and profits; while some less
    populated zones towards the periphe_ry of the city, and zones of low income
    and low car-ownership, might appear so unattractive that the private sector
    would not serve them.         In thgse are_as public sector wholesaling would have
    to fill the void.

The road pricing authority would find it more- efficient and secure to deliver
permits to wholesalers and receive the cash on the spot for them.      Two
or three armoured cars should be sufficient.      These could be hired from
.companies already operating these vehicles in Caracas~ or else be the
-authority's own property.     Retailers and wholesalers could make their
own provisions for transporting permits to the retail premises; much
would depend on the initiative of each.     Some might have their own delivery
or collection service, as the case may be, while others might rent the
service.    These flexible arrangements would be well suited to meeting the
. range of transportation requirements that would vary with the locatiqnal
interrelationship of wholesalers and retailers throughout the city.


4. 6. 6   Revenue Collection

Retail revenues, net of profit, would pass to wholesalers and thence, net
of profit (assuming private ·wholesalers), to the road pridng authority on
purchase of permits at each stage of the permit distribution system.     In
---..
addition, however, invalid unused permits would be exchanged at each
stage for potentially valid ones.    As mentioned above, armored cars would
collect the revenues from wholesalers on delivery of permits.


4. 7    ENFORCEMENT CONCEPT

A society establishes its norms.of behavior by custom or by act to protect
the values generally held by its members.      Assuming these norms do
reflect such current values, it foliows that behavior that deviates from ·
these norms is usually, on balance, harmful to society; and conversely,
that societal sanctions, particularly the formal enforcement by the im-
position of penalties of institutional norms such as laws and regulations,
imposed to compel conformity, can be beneficial.


In the event that the Venezuelan Congress enacts legislation to enable road
pricing to be imposed in Caracas, the. enforcement of the law and related
regulations, should, by public warrant, ·provide benefits by insuring com-
pliance with the law.   Specifically, the benefits would be of three kinds:




                                    -298-
            (i)     To compel a level of corripliance with the
                    law such that the road-pricing system functions;

            (ii)    To increase equity between road uses; and

            (iii)   To maintain revenue.


It is likely that marginal enforcement costs will tend to increase more
sharply as attempts are made to drive the violater evasion rate to lower
levels.   Thus, an efficiency goal for enforcement that attempts merely
to maximize financial returns may result in ·a rate of evasion that is too
high to assure that road pricing in Caracas can function properly and
command community respect.          Consequently, efficiency goals need to be
tempered in practice by other criteria related to equity, political and
social considerations, and user convenience.        Such criteria would consider:

            (i)       Reduction of violations to a politically and
                    · socially acceptable level;

            (ii)     Assurance that no class of individuals can
                     systematically evade payment with profit;
                           .               .

            (iii)    (Perhaps) assurance that every identified
                     offender is prosecuted (police satisfaction);
                     or at least at a. scale capable of making an
                     overt example of some offenders to the
                     rest of the road user community.

            (iv)     Avoidance of police corruption;

            (v)      Improvement in traffic-violation enforcement
                     parallel to, and in combination with, effective
                     enforcement of road-pricing regulations;

            (vi)     Avoidance, during enforcement implementation,
                     of delay and inconvenience to road users,
                     especially the conforming users, but also
                     violaters~ particularly the more inadvertant
                     ones.


Criminologists are increasing their knowledge about the effects of enforce-
ment on the incidence of-Crime,. but little is known about the effects qf
enforcement on the frequency of traffic violations.      ·Clearly, the relation-
ship is not a simple function; for instance, a relatively low enforcement




                                        -299-
level may keep the violation rate low in the case of some types of offense,
if the level is already low,· but may be ineffective in reducing the rate if it·
is already high.      Lack of data makes any econometric approach        ~nappropriate

 in practice. to estimate the enforcement effort necessary to meet efficiency
           .                    .
 and other criteria..    A more pragmatic approach is thus called for.        One
method consistent with this wou~d require the setting of an a :priori level of
undetected violation that is politically and socially acceptable.       A two percent
 level of undetected violation might be deemed acceptable for vehicle drivers
terminating their journeys in the priced area; while a higher level, perhaps
 ten percent, might be admitted for less frequent types of journey during
which viola.Hons may be more difficult to detect, such as those committed by
 motorists passing through, or originating in, the priced area.


 If a road pricing scheme is not properly understood by both road users and
                                                                i';I

 enforcement officials, violations from ignorance will be common, and
 innocent people may be wrongfully charged for infringements.           Furthermore,
                                                       '                 .
the courts-may hold that the laws and regulations a_re too complex to be
understood; and a consequent sympathetic attitude towards lack ·of compliance
may nullify the effect of enforcement measures.            This would, in turn, under-
 mine the morale of the enforcement officials, and might even place in
. jeopardy the success of the road pricing scheme.


 One of the major advantages of the supplementary licensing system is that it
 is conceptually easy to understand.


 4. 7. 1   Types of Penalty

 It is expected that the most frequent offense against the supplementary licenee
                                                           '·
·method of road pricing will be the failure of a vehicle driver t.o possess a
                                         1
 valid permit while in the priced area. ( ) Such an offense would be a



 (1)       It is envisioned that vehicles owned by persons resident in the
           priced area could .be issued with a special annual permit
           (possibly at the same time as the vehicle annual registration
           papers are issued) at no cost or else for a small fee to cover
           administrative· costs.   Buses would be eligible for this special
           permit also.

                                     -300-
    misdemeanor, not a crime.           Penalties, therefore, would have to be in
    keeping with other offenses in the misdemeanor class, yet severe enough
    that the vast majority of drivers entering the priced area would respect the

I   law, and find it unprofitable to attempt systematic means to evade it.


    However, present experience in Carac·as indicates that the common pratice
    of enforcement through the issue of citations       for traffic violations is a weak
    preventive measure.        Citations are issued for most types of violation by
    the Directorate of Ground Transportation Police, and for ,parking voilatic5ns
    by the Metropolitan Police.         In the former. case, the alleged violator (1) is
    req:uired to pay the fine at the Central Bank, or to its branch cashiers including
    those located in some of the traffic police stations (Inspector1as de T ransrto).
                               )



    In the latter case, the fine is paid to the Office of Municipal Rents (Oficina
    de Rentas Munidpales) in the jurisdiction where the alleged violation took
    place.    This. cumbersome method of payment, in which the mail service
    may not be used, is imposed by the organic law which clearly s.eparates the
                                                                2
    summary from the subsequent penalty stages of the process. ( ) The
    alleged violator can question the justification of a Directorate of Ground
    Trans porfation citation in the traffic courts; and the justification of a
    municipal citation before the Civil Prefect (Prefectura Civil).          If payment
    on the citation, or appeal against it, is not effected within the time stated on
    this citation, the alleged violator is de.emed guilty and is required to pay
    the fine without right to appeal.


    The Directorate of Ground Transportation enforces the collection of fines by
    refusing to issue a vehicle's annual registration papers (and plates) unless
    all outstanding fines are paid.        Most vehicle owners prefer to pay their
    fines at this time because the directorate:

             Venezuela is related to the vehicle, not to the driver.

    (2)      See Appendix 6,       Part III.

                 (i)     Does not levy a surcharge of interest charges
                         to cover the cost of delay in payment.

                 (ii)    ·Does not always register the citation (and
                         therefore does not always charge).

                 (iii)    Occasionally shows evidence of citations that
                         ·the vehicle owner claims were not issued
                          (and therefore over time compensates for (ii) ).


By contrast, the mechanism to enforce the collection of Municipal Police
traffic fines is virtually ineffective.       It merely consists of a threat to
arrest any vehicle lis.ted on the municipal records as having un unpaid fine.
Because there are now so many vehicles in this category, municipal patrQl
cars cannot cope with this assigned duty.


In short, the vehicle-owning public does not take the issue of traffic citations
very seriously.          They are perceived more as a nuisance than an effective
penalty   o     The mail service cannot be relied upon; and therefore no immed-
iate follow-up procedures are carried out.           Thus a common practice 'is to
throw the citation away.


Because of the low level of enforcement effectiveness obtained through the
issue of traffic violation citations, the enforcement concept envisioned for
road pricing leans much more heavily on pecuniary and property impound-
ment sanctions than on, though not to the exclusion of, the more generally
applied       ~dministrative   measure of issuing a citation. (l)   The text below
highlights the more important aspects of these thn:e categories of enforce-
ment.         In order of priority, these could take the form of premium permits,
vehicle impound age and fines.


Though in most circumstances the application of these measures for enforcing
road pricing would not call for changes to the law, it would in fact imprqve

     the public's   und~rstanding   of its limitations under road pricing if the road-
     pricing law stated clearly that the entry of a vehicle (with certain exceptions,
     e.g., buses) into a priced area without a valid permit would be considered
     an offense punishable by the removal of the vehicle (or a fine or botl?-) if it
     is judged to be obstructing the use of road space (including on-street
                                               -
      parking space) by other licensed vehicles.      Further, that parking lot and
     garages open for use by the general public are prohibited tQ accommodate
     vehicles lacking proper (supplementary) permits on penalty of forfeiting
     their licence (patente) issued by the Ministry of Development (Ministerio
      de Fomento); and that enforcement officers have the right to inspect these
      premises.     However, the law should also state that drivers of stopped or
      standing vehicles lacking a valid permit would have the right to purchase a
      permit at a premium price in those circumstances where the purchase can
      be done without obstructing other traffic, but only up to a limitec:] number of
     times per year.


      Premium Permits.      It will be in. the public interest to keep the costs of
      road-pricing enforcement as low as possible consistent with the target
     '--level of driver-compliance established by-the road-pricing authority.     Also,
      it is desirable that the enforcement officials and agents have. some individual
      incentive to perform their work as efficiently as possible.      Furthermore,
      public support for the road-pricing scheme will be strengthened if violators,
     when stopped, can be given the option of taking a course of action .that will
      immediately rectify their illegal status so as to avoid the inconvenience of
!
',    coping with a citation, and possibly the stigma of having their name on
I
      police records if the citation results in a fine, or spell in prison on refusal
     to pay the fine.


     These three considerations have led to the.notion of a pecuniary sanction in
     the form of a "premium" permit which would be sold only to stopped or
     standing, (1) but not parked, vehicles in the priced area by enforcement

issued or sold through outlets outside the priced area and at a correspondingly
higher profit.      The increment in price (premium) and profit would:

            (i)      Eliminate costly legal-procedures to process
                     citations, collect fine-s and, in some instances
                     deal with appeals tn the courts;

            (ii)     Provide an individual incentive to the enforce-
                     ment officer or agent who could be permitted
                     to keep the profit;

            (iii)    Give the violator an opportunity to place himself
                     on the right side of the law while suffering the
                     expense of paying the additional premium
                     charge that should discourage his repetition of
                     an illegal act.


As will be described below in Section 4. 7. 2 dealing with methods of surveil-
lance, parking-lot attendants in the priced area, acting as enforcement
agents, could be required by legislation to prohibit the entry of vehicles that
do not display    a valid permit.   These attendants would also be authorized
to give the driver of such vehicles a chance to avoid a fine, and the inconven-
ience of leaving the premises, by offering them premium permits.         In these
cases, attendants would be permitted to take all, or part, of the higher
premium profit; and this higher profit would be the incentive to sell a
premium permit rather than a normal one.         In cases where attendants
take only a part of the profit, the remainder would be kept by parking-
facility management as an added supervisory incentive.        However, manage-
ment would be subject to a fine if vehicles, without permits either of the
normal.or premium type, are found in the parking premises.


The amount of the premium would be estimated in function of the price of
the supplementary licence, on the one hand, and the level of enforcement
effectiveness, on the other, to make systematic viol_ation unprofitable.
For example, if a premium is set at three times the lic·ence price, the
probability of stopping an offender must be such that a viofator is




                                     -304-.
detected at least once in every' three infringements if systematic violatidn
is to be discouraged. (l).


Vehicle Impoundage.       If a violator decided not to buy a premium permit,
the :enforcement .offic~l could. then have the vehicle impounded'·by calling on
the assistance of an authorized tow-truck.        No change in legislation is
necessary to empower the official to take such action since the present
traffic laws in force· consider any willful obstruction to the circulation of
tr.affic as an offense.       Consequently, once the enforcement officer has
stopped a vehicle because it does not have a valid permit, and for the same
reason prevents· it from proceeding further, it can be- held that the stopped
vehicle is willfully obstructing other vehicl~s in the.traffic stream. ( )
                                                                        2


Parking attendants, who are refused their offers of premium permits to .
violators wishing to enter their parking lots, would not be empowered to
summon tow-vehicles unless there is a change in the law to enable parking-

road pricing authority.        However, since most parking lots in the central




        As explained in Section 4. 7. 2, the probability of stopping an
        offender can vary with the origin and destination of the trip.
        Through-traffic might have a lower probability than priced-
        area destined traffic if surveillance is partly carried out at
        parking facilities.
          '
( 2)     This enforcement concept ·is somewhat similar to the practice
         of publicly owned utility companies such as, for instance,
         CANTV (Compafi:i'.a An6nima Nacional TelMonos de Venezuela)
         which provides telephone services, and the INOS (Institute
         Nacional de Obra·s Sanitarias) which supplied potable water;
       · both of these companies cut off their services to account
         holde·rs who fail to pay on time: The two private electricity
         companies in.Caracas do likewise.
       The analogy would be more precise if the traffic enforcement
       .authority were able to seal off road space to certain users
       rather than impound the vehicle on it, since the highway is _
       more properly the service made available (c. f.. telephones
       and water), while the vehicle is the space consumer (c. f.
       telephones and showers).

              In.the case of those parking lots, or more frequently parking garages, with

              legislation since the type of obj_ect causing the obstruction would be incidental
              in the consideration as to whether an obstruction is caused.         (In other words,

              offenders may otherwise be legally parked, and thus not obstructing traffic,
              the road pricing law would have to include a clause to make such an event an
              offense unless the courts decide that a stationary vehicle without a supple-
              mentary licence anywhere on the street system in the priced area constitutes
              an obstruction to other (supplementary) licensed vehicles which might w~nt

would be rare during peak periods in the CED.


The implementation of a vehicle removal or impoundage scheme is believed
to be practical.      Public and private-sector tow trucks would be authorized
to tow away, on instructions from an enforcement officer, any vehicle found
without a valid permit on the public highway, and deposit the vehicle in an
official off-street compound.      The vehicle owner or user would then be
placed in the inconvenient and time-consuming position of having to search
for his vehicle and of having to pay a parking charge, the price of the premium
ticket, and possibly a fine.     Though the condition of the vehicle would be
recorded in the compound, the owner might find that his car had been damaged
in the removal process; the cause of damage would be difficult to prove,
with the result that the owner, or user of the car, if not fully insured, would
have to. pay for the repairs.     Recent crash-action enforcement programs
against illegal on-street parking in Caracas, using a similar procedure,
have proved most effective.


Though it is judged that no modification to the existing traffic laws wou1d be
necessary to use these means to help enforce conformity with the road pricing
regulations, except perhaps in the case of on-street     ~egally   parked vehicles,
the cost of this enforcement method may be high in terms of enforcement
manpower (assuming the continuiation of the present regulations that an
officer should accompany the towed vehicle) and of aggravated congestion
caused by the _maneuverings of tow-trucks.        Reductions in cost could be
effected by:

               (i)    Using vehicle impoundage sanctions only
                      periodically when the violator rate rises above.
                      the prescribed limits.

               (ii)   Requiring violators to hand over temporarily
                      their vehicle registration papers to motorcycle
                      enforcement officers who would accompany one
                      or more violators, driving their vehicles, to
                      the official compound where the registration
                      papers would be returned.    This would dispense
                      with the need of tow-trucks.

                     refuse to take their cars to the official com-
                     pound.   These government-'operated trucks would
                     not require an enforcement officer to accompany
                     towed vehicles.


A method, similar to the one suggested, was used successfully in a short-
duration vehicle-noise enforcement program in the Caracas area. (l)


Another possible means of reducing enforcement costs would require the
enforcement officer to impound only the supplementary licence permit
holder rather than the vehicle.     This presupposes not merely th.at a holder
would be required for the permit -- this is not necessarily so -- but that it
would be inscribed indelibly with the vehicle registration number, and would
be removable.       If the. holder were to be removable, it would be liable to
                    2
be stolen or lost; ( ) and it could be that only a fairly expensive product
would make its forgery infeasible.      Enforcement officers would thus have
the additional task of verifying the validity not only-of the permit but also of
the receptacle ; and the public would have the worry of safeguarding the




(1)    .The "Campaign Against Noise" (Campana· Contra Ruido) lasted
       about one week during July-August, 1972. The Metropolitan
       Police were the principal agents since the ordinances controlling
       noise levels are municipal; however,. the Directorate of Ground
       Transportation assisted. No objective criteria, or measuring
        devices, were applied to assess levels of noise emitted by
       vehicles. Some 800 automobiles and 300 motorcycle~ were
        impounded mostly driven to the official compound by their
       drivers under motorcycle police escort.      Drivers paid a fine
        of Bs. 50. 00, the compound parking cost of Bs. 4. 00 per day,
        and a minimum tow charge of Bs. 30. 00 to take their vehicles
       from the compound to a garage for fitting new, or improved
       mufflers.     The salutary effects of this campaign were quite.
        perceptible. See El Nacional, August 3, 197 2, p. D-12.

        confidence in road pricing as a viable scheme and negate the advantages
        thafwould be derived from the convenience of confiscating the receptacle
        instead of the vehicle.


        Fines.    In cases where it is not practical to impound a vehicle whose driver
        refuses, or is unable, to purchase a premium permit, enforcement officials
        could resort to the issue of a citation.    However, the violator would be
        advised to leave the priced area by the shortest route or run further risk
        of receiving a second citation.


        The amount of the fine considered appropriate should lie well above that of
        the premium cost co.mponent of a premium permit, but should fall below an
        absolute upper limit set in conformity with the tolerance level of public
        acceptance regarding tlie degree to which it believes ·"the punishment fits
                     2
        the crime". ( ) This. upper limit is, to some extent, conditioned by the
        public's perceived probability of being found unawares in.the priced area,
        of not having the cash on hand to buy a premium permit and of being fined
        eventually accordingly.     This possibility   is~   of cour-se, higher with the
        supplementary licence scheme than it would be with an area-admission
        charges scheme in force where toll booths, set up at access points along the
        perimeter of the priced area, would make such accidental events unlikely.

The collection of fines from those violators who live outside of the road
pricing authority's jurisdiction, which in all probability would coincide
roughly with the Caracas Metropolitan ·Area, poses problems since no
convenient information-retrieval system exists· to identify the addresses
of vehicle owners based only on tpe knowledge of vehicle registration plate
numbers.    It is quite probable that the Ministry of Communications (Ministerio
                            .                                   r                    .

de Comunicaciones) will eventually institute such an information-retrieval
system to assist their own and other traffic violation and criminal enforce-
ment agencies in the detection of offenders.       Unless the Ministry is prepared
to institute such a scheme in the near future, it does not seem likely that
such an expensive insta'ilation would be installed only to facilitate the identi-
fication of people living_ outside of Caracas whose vehicle has violated road-
pricing regulations in the capital city.


However, the Venezuelan Constitution does state that government agencies
should cooperate to the full in the public interest.     This being the case, it
would appear practi.cal that, in the event of violators accumulating substantiaL.
number of unpaid fines, the road pricing authority could obtain the cooperation
of the _nation-wide services of the Directorate of Ground Transportation in
o.rder to track down violators and issue them with court summons, as well
as make sure that directorate offices are informed of vehicle registration
numbers so that the vehicle owners will be prevented from register:ing their
vehicles without prior payment of accumulated fines ..


A simpler way to reduce drastically the evasion of fines would be to empower
the enforcement official to issue the citation and collect the fine on the spot
if the alleged violator is willing to cooperate.     But this procedure i.s contrary
to fundamental principles in Venezuelan law,- and, as such, encounters an
insurmountable obstacle.        The law conceives enforcement officers as having
powers pertaining tO the summary stage in the administrative penalty pro-
ceedings, e.g., the issue of a citation; the decision to impose 'the penalty
and subsequent procedural steps pertain only to persons having higher authority
in the hierarchy. (1)

4. 7. 2   Surveillance Methods and Personnel R.equirements .

The primary duty of officers enforcing road pricing regulations would be to
ensure that vehicles possess valid permits to enter the priced area of the
city and circulate   ~ithin   it.   Five methods of surveillance can be distin-
guished to achieve this objective:

                     Cordon surveillance (along the periphery
                     of the priced area)

                     Area surveillance of .moving vehicles ,

                     Area surveillance of standing vehicles

                     Surveillanc~    of qne-street parked vehicles

                     Surveillance of off-street parked vehicles

 in Table 4. 6, an evaluation of the effectiveness of each, separately and

 priced area could be carried out by enforcement officers posted at each .
 entry point along the area'.s periphery.      This activity   would.ne~d   to be con-
 fined much of the time to moving vehicles.        Vehicle permits would therefore
 have to be highly perceptible and clearly displayed, (l) being legible over a
. distance equivalent to at least two lanes of roadway (7. 0 mt) if this surveil-
 lance method were to be the predominant means of control used.                           ;

lanes enter the priced area (i.e., the Caracas CBD) at 26_ entry points com-
prising eight one-lane roads, 11 two-lane roads, and seven three-lane roads.
After road pricin.g, it is expected that traffic speeds in the peak hour in the
priced area would be roughly between 25 and 60 kilometers per hour.        These
speeds would depend on road type ranging from iocal streets on the one
hand to Avenida Bolivar on the other (which ~exhibits most of the free-flow
characteristics of a freeway).    Traffic volumes would be close to optimum
at around 500 vehicles per lane hour on local streets and 1, 000 on Avenida
Bolivar.   Assuming that one motorist in ten were to try to enter the priced
area without a supplementary licence, and that a target was set to stop one
in ten of these on the average, the Chief of Metropolitan Police estimates
that at least one motorized policeman per effective land would be required.
Thus, the total of 55 effective traffic lanes entering the priced area would
require some 55 motorized (motorcycle) enforcement officers and about
6 higher-ranking inspecto.rs.


Because of the expense of maintaining such a large force of motorized police,
and because the efficiency of personnel declines rapidly when inspecting
moving vehicles, (l) this form of surveillance might instead be--carried out by
four or five highly trained (and well paid) teams each comprising three
motorized officers.     Each team would be posted at an entry point selected
at random for a duration of not more than two hours; it would then move to
:lts next assigned point.   This sampling method of cordon surveillance, with
teams shifting from one location to another, would improve personnel
efficiency by reducing the tedium of the task, and would be much cheaper to
implement since only about 15 motorized officers and one higher-ranking

inspector would be needed.       Field experience may indicate that two shifts
are advisable to provide continuous surveillance over the 12-hour period,
with both access and egress points manned in accordance with the dominant
directional traffic flow.     With additional support provided by officers
checking vehicles in the priced area, this. ~ordon sampling -procedure
should be .a cost-effective deterrent (especially for commuters, less so for
through-vehicles) though covering only one-fifth of the 26 entry points to
the area at any one time.      In gross terms, 20 percent of all entering vehicles
would be subject to checking.       Allowing for officer fatigue this surveillance
rate might be reduced to 15 percent.


Area-Surveillance of Moving Vehicles.        Because of the extent of the street
system in the priced area, surveillance of moving vehicles would have· to be
effected by sampling.       On assumptions that, at a price level of Bs. 2. 50,
about 120, 000 vehicles enter the priced area on any day, that one-sixth of
these is in mQtion for any period of ten minutes on average during the 12-hour

                                                --
priced period, and that one in ten of these ve'hicles should be subject to
.
surveillance, it follows that 12, 000 vehicles would have to be inspected each
hour aside from considerations of overlap (repeat inspections).        Overlapping
would occur, however, thereby raisl.ng the number of vehicles inspeeted to,
say, 13, 000 to maintain the one-in-ten surveillance rate.       A reasonable
average rate of working for inspecting both slow-moving vehicles, without
stopping them, and stopping and inspecting faster-moving vehicles, might
be five vehicles per minute.       Pulling a violator out of the traffic stream and
dealing with him would take about five. minutes.       Thus, at a two percent
violation rate, 90 officers would be required to inspect 13, 000 vehicles per
hour and penalize 260 of them.       Clearly this is a large force to obtain a
ten percent surveillance rate.      Furthermore, the surveillance procedure
would tend to impair much of the alleviation of congestion attained by road

Area Surveillance of Standing Vehicles.       A varfation would .be to inspect
standing vehicles at traffic signals.     .This would cause less traffic congestion,
and might be quicker -- in 30 seconds of green, an officer might inspect




                                     -314-
ten vehicles.   Pulling a violator vehicle out of the traffic stream would again
take about five minutes.    At a two percent violation rate, 45 officers would
 be required to carry out the inspection of 13, 000 vehicles per hour   a~d

 penalize 260 of them.


Area Surveillance of On-Street Parked Vehicles.        According to a recent
 survey in the Caracas CBD, (1) 11, 000 vehicles, or 24 percent out of a total
 of 46, 200 park ·for some period during the day on the public street and 35, 000
 or 76 percent park off the street.   The maximum accumulation of parked
 vehicles recorded on the street in one hour was approximately 2, 200 and off
 the street 14, 500 or 13 percent and 87 percent respectively of the total
 16,700.


 Assuming cars are parked on- the street at 15 meter intervals (allowing for
 no curb-parking zones, gaps and street corners), an enforcement officer on
 average could inspect at least 200 vehicles per hour including the time
 needed to deal with violators.   If the present maximum of accumulated parked
 vehiCles in one hour ( 2, 200) is greater than the number of arrivals in the
 same hour, only six officers would be required to inspect one-half of these
 parked cars.   If it is smaller, implying that a number of vehicle~- are parked
 for less than one hour, perhaps eight to ten officers - - still a small force
 would be required to maintain the surveillance rate of 50 percent over the
 11, 000 on-street parked. vehicles during the day.


 Surveillance of Off-Street Parked Vehicles.       As mentioned above, 76 percent
 of CED-destined vehicles park in off-street facilities.  The daily turnover
                             2
 rate is approximately 2. 40( ) confirming field observations that most users
 park their cars during the morning and afterwards in t_he afternoon, having
 returned home at midday for lunch.        Thus it is assumed that there is

considerable stability and regularity in the utilization of off-street parking
facilities.    These characteristics should lessen the burden of enforcement
officers who would be assigned to inspect periodically all off-street facilities
to ensure the parking managers are conforming with the road pricing
regulations by p~ohibitlng the entry of vehicles into parking premises unless
they have a valid road pricing permit or are prepared to purchase a premium
permit.


There are about 184 off-street parking facilities in the CBD(l) ·of which four
are of the pigeon-hole or mechanical type.        The rest are either temporarily      I
                                                                                       I


occupying vacant lots or are multi- level structures with ramp access.
Except for the four mechanical garages, all the facilities lend themselves to          I
the ~ortvenient inspection of parked vehicles within.      On average each parking ·
                                                                                       I
facility accommodates about 190. vehicles.        At a rate of imipection of four
vehicles per minute, an. enforcement officer should be able to check most              f

vehicles in a parking facility in 50 minutes giving him ten minutes to reach
the next facility Oh his zone schedule.       Thus in an eight hour day he should
be able to inspect at least eight garages or lots.

                    2
As stressed below, ( ) off-street parking surveillance would probably turn
out to .be the most effective and economical means of road pricing enforce-
ment for CED-destined vehicles.         For thi_s reason it is believed that a force
of about 20 officers would be warranted to carry out this . task thoroughly and
fairly frequently (perhaps twice weekly) with two inspectors to supervise the
work.      Speci~l   provisions would have to be taken at the four (or any addi-
tional) mechanical garages since the inspection of parked vehicles would
be dangerous in these premises.         It is suggested therefore that in these
cases periodic checks be made when vehicles leave the premises (rather than
on entry when obviously the parking management would conform with the
regulations while the officers were present) .

 4. 7. 3   Evaluation of Methods and Method-Mix

Based on the foregoing text, Table 4. 7 summarizes the likely descrete prob-
 abilities of a vehicle being inspected by means of each surveillance method
 as it     enters into   the priced area and parks for one hour in either an
 on-street or an off-street facility.    It also indicates separately the accumu-
 lated probabilities of a vehicle being inspected as it progresses through
 each "·screening'' process in the priced area on its way to an on-street parking
 facility, on the one hand, or an off-street facility, on the other, where it
 remains for one hour.


 The discrete probability of a vehicle being inspected when parked on-street
 or off-street is much higher than for any other method of surveHlance.
 When the probabilities of surveillance prior to parking are included, a
 vehicle travelling to its on-street parking facility, where it stays for one
: hour, has a chance of being inspected 66 percent of the total time, while a
 vehicle in .similar circumstances but destined for an off-street parking
 facility, where it remains for one hour, would be inspected 81 percent of
 the time. (l)    The average accumulated prob:;lbility of being   inspect~d,   taking
                                                          .            '
 into account both forms orparking assuming that 24 percent of vehicles park
 daily on the street and 76 percent off the street, .would therefore be
 (0. 65 x 0. 24) + (0. 81x0.76) x 100   = 77   percent.


 Table 4. 8 indicates that the total staff needed to accomplish the screening by
 all methods would be 220 enforcement officers and 21 inspectors.           Much of
 this large force (135 officers and 12 inspectors) would be required to
 implement the on-street moving and standing vehicle methods of surveiilance.




 (1)       It should be remembered that, although the accumulated
           probability of inspecting a vehicle that is destined for, and
           that parks on, a str~et facility is 19 percent lower than that
           for a vehicle destin~d for, and ~hat parks in, an off-street
           facility, the penalty for the off-street driver is minor (the
           opportunity to buy a premium permit) while that for the on-
           street driver is more severe (the removal of his vehicle).

    (':":')    Five additional inspectors may be required for checking
               wholesale and retail outlets.
However, these two methods do not add substantially to the accumulated
probability of a vehicle being inspected if it is destined for the priced area
though they are useful in spotting violating through-traffic and vehicles
circulating within the priced area.       Furthermore,· this method could exa-
cerbate traffic congestion significantly.      Table   4. 7   indicates that if these
two methods were to be eliminated, the accumulated probabilities of
vehicles destined for the priced area being inspected, assuming one ho\[r of
parking would only be reduced by eight percent for on-street parked vehicles .
and four percent for off-street parked vehicles.         The average accumulated
probability of being inspected in these situations, taking into account both
forms of parking, would be (0. 58 x 0. 24) + ( 0. 77 x 0. 7 6) x 100 = 7 2 percent,
making for a reduction of only (77 - 7 2)    =5   percent.


At first sight, it would appear to be most cost-effective to dispense complete-
ly with the on...: street and off-street moving and standing vehicle methods of
surveillance thus saving the cost of about 150 officers and inspectors, as
well as ad_ditional traffic congestion.     However,    as    indicated in Table 4. 6,
if this were done there would be no means of inspecting vehicles circulating
within the confines of the priced area, and no additional support would be
given to the cordon surveillance teams especially in their quest to enforce
road pricing on through vehicles.


This being the case, a suggested cost-effective scheme would            compr~se   the
cordon surveillance teams as previously indicated but reinforced periodically
through "crash-action" programs to increase the cordon surveillance rate,
especially on through-traffic, from 15 percent(l)to perhaps 50 percent using
personnel on loan from other road pricing duties.             A reduced force of some
25 officers could also be assigned to area inspection of standing vehicles,
sufficient to develop a surveillance rate of about five percent in order to

       of being inspected each day at the cordon.

provide a second inspection screen for through-vehicles, act as a deter-
rent for traffic circulating within the. confines of the priced area, and help
reduce "fringing" movements, i.. e. short cuts through the fringes of the
priced area, if such movements became prevalent.            On-street and off-street
parking surveillance would remain the final and most effe'ctive emrveillance
method, _especially commuting vehicles, which would comprise the majority
of vehicle-movements in the priced area.


Finally, about five well-trained inspectors rn:ight be assigned to over-see
the wholesale and retail operations employed for the distribution of permits.
The duties of these inspectors would include the checking of permits to
see that non is a forgery or is stolen; in the case of date-specific permits
that used permits are not being exchanged for valid ones; and. that retail
premises are kept in a presentable state.

           ASPECTS OF ROAD PRICING SYSTEM

The administrative facility of current road user charges was discussed briefly
earlier in this report. (l)     In this chapter the institutionalization of road
pricing (in the form .of supplementary licensing) is iµtroduced within the
framework of a proposed law to consolidate the management of all traffic
on public rights-of-way in the CMA ihto a single Metropolitan Transport .
Administration (Administraci6n Metropolitana de Transporte: Caracas -

turn together with relevant legal implications. ( 3 ) Staff needs for road

 4. 8.1   Organizational Aspects

Since supplementary licensing could be established by an amendment to the
 same law that would establish the AMTC, and could be administered by the
 agency, the overall. organizational framework of the agency is discussed
 below so that the location for the road pricing administrative functions that
 is suggested herein can be appreciated and evaluated within an ampie but
 relevant context.


 Major Components of the AMTC.       ·In the bill to be sent to Congress, the
AMTC is expected to be an autonomous agency and thus, for most practical
 purposes, legally an.d fiscally independent from the ~ational government
 and treasury(!) (similar to the operation of say INOS, the Venez1'.1elan   wat~r
 supply authority).   Its revenues would derive from appropriations established
 in the national budget, the budget ordinances of the two municipalities, and
 from whatever assets arui taxes are assigned to it in the proposed law or
 future amendments.      Though the main thrust of the new agency would be
. towards public transit, this would not be to the exclusion of planning and
 coordinating activities embracing private modes of transportation.       As
 indicated in Figure 4.10 the agency is envisaged to be comprised of two
 major elements: the Metropolitan Transport co{incil (Consejo Metropolitana
 de Transporte - CMT) which would govern the AMTC and set its policies;
 and the Office of Metropolitan Transport (Oficina Metropolitana de Transporte -
 OMET) which woul.d have an administrative responsibility over all areas
 covered by the AMTC' s jurisdictional scope.


 Metropolitan Transport Council.     The chairman of the· CMT would be a
 Directpr General appointed by the President of the Republic.      Other members
 of the council would be made up of representatives of the Ministry of

 private and public, in the CMA.     Some of' the more important of these

 proposed an internal organization for the OMET.       Nevertheless, it has        I




 been suggested that the Director .General would benefit from a statistics
section and a computer center established as staff functions; and that line
functions directly under his control would be assigned to a number of
·divisions.   One of these could be the Road Pricing Division; while the
others might include, for example, a Transportation      Pl~nning   Division, a
Public Transit Operations Division and an Enforcement Coordination Division
which would be in charge of enforcement agents and inspectors including
those asslgned to road pricing enforcement duties. (1)


·Road Pricing Division.    In the event that it would form part of the OMET,
the Road Pricing

in administrative, if not policy decision-making subject to the Director
General's approval.     The division's activities in the administration of

        Ministry of Communications would continue to enforce traffic
        r.~gulations in the rest of the country,· it is envisaged that the
        AMTC would be responsible for enforcing traffic regulations
        in Caracas. It is probable that some of the agents employed
        by the Directorate of Transportation for CMA duties would be
        transferred to the AMTC.       (Information provided verbally by

        the Policy, Planning and Research Department, and the Accounting

        would, of course, be subject to revision as road pricing .administrative·

        Statistics Section.    The efficient operation of road pricing requires a
        continuous flow of data for revisions of prices and administrative techniques.
        Continuous data flows are also a necessary ingredient for other transportation
        planning and management activities likely to be carrted out by the OMET.
        However, as in most countries, human resources skilled in survey techniques
        and statistical analysis are scar_ce in Venezuela.    There would be some.
        advantages, therefore, in locating this activity where it can serve all
        div1sions in the OMET and thus obtain, not only economies of scale, but a
        variety of work, and rates of remuneration commensurate with challenging
        responsibilities, that should attract personnel highly competent in its field.


        The collection and routine analysis of data, in regard to supplementary
        licensing, would be carried out by this section.     The staff would have access
        to the facilities and resources of the present Ministerial Office of Tr.ansport
        and other .MOP agencie's which would have been incorporated into the AMTC.
        The statistical section would also. include in its staff field survey teams
        trained and experienced in the collection of traffic data.

assigned to the R.oad Pricing Division of the AMTC - - would remain as an
executive function of the tax-creating public entity, namely the national
government and the municipal councils.      These first-degree regulatory
acti~ities include definition of the tax base, its rate structure and application,
and corresponding penalties.     On . the other hand, the

required for the suc;cessful management of road pricing is made more
                                                                                     I
difficult by not allowing the AMTC full fiscal authority, but the degree of          I
difficulty encountered depends on the latitude in the law (and legal criteria)
allowed by the tax-creating public entity. (l)


The administration of road pricing, in all its financial, planning, regulatory
and executive activities, would be carried out by the R.oad Pricing Division
of the AMTC.     This division would be self-contained tothe extent of being
able to conduct its own research programs with assistance from the OMET
Statistical Section.   Tt should be emphasized that the incorporation of road
pricing into a semi-autonomous body, such as the AMTC, obviates the
sometimes cumbersome procedures of committee and overlapping adminis-
trative responsibility so evident in the present road transport s_ector.    .In
short, the sector can have the benefit of more modern management techniques
which are activity:-- related· rather than organization-related.


Nevertheless for ease of description the administrative and technical
functions of the R.oad Pricing Division are dealt with below as they relate          I       !

As mentioned previously in this section; the government envisages that the
AMTC would have its own enforcement agents and inspectors.          It is
logical, therefore, that the road pricing enforcement field staff would be_
drawn from this pool which could be located in the. OMET 's Enforcement
Coordination Division.     If this were the case, the field staff assigned to
rOad pricing enforcement duties would submit daily reports to the Road
Pricing Division's Enforcement Department which would monitor the effective-
ness of its programs and make program modifications as required.            It is
quite probable that some road pricing enforcement activities, such as
inspecting on-street parked vehicles for the display of valid permits, ._would
be combined with more comprehensive assignments, such as to enforce
on-street parking regulations in general.      Besides making for better
coordination between enforcement field staff within the AMTC, the central-
ization of this staff in a single OMET division would l_ead to considerable.
economies because of this possibility of combining assigned duties.


Policy, Planning and Research Department.         Many of the more vital activities
for the longer-term success of road pricing in the city would be carried out
by this department.   Policy formulation, which would be ultimately approved
by the CMT, would touch on the degrees of emphasis to be given to consider-
ations of effidency, equity, and revenue raising as related, for instance, to
the· establishment of permit prices according to vehicle class (and time of
day, if applicabie), the daily duration of their imposition, the geographical
extent of the priced area, and enforcement ·penalties.     Such policy formu-
lation would draw on the services of the OMET Statistical Section and
Computer Center as well as on the departments own research staff which
would be monitoring the performance and effectiveness of the road pricing
scheme.


The Statistical Section   ~nd   Computer Center would also support the depart-
ment's short- and lo~g-term planning activities.       The longer-term activities
would mostly be concerned with the planning and programming of envisaged
changes in road pricing methods, such as the introduction of automatic
_point pricing; while the shorter-term activities would be more related to



                                     -329-
adjustments to the extent of the priced area, and, more important, to the
amount of the supplementary licence price.


The department would have. to pay carefol attention to the development-of
criteria for modifying the price.     Broadly speaking, if demands(l) made
upon the supply of road space increase over the passage of time, and if the
extent of the priced area is not altered, then the optimal level of charge
increases also.   If, on the "other hand, capacity is expanded so that the
marginal cost curve becomes lower at any given volume and simultaneously
the demand curve moves away from the origin thereby producing a secular
horizontal movement of the intersection of the marginal cost curve and the
demand curve, the price per peak-hour p. c. u. trip remains constant.


The precise amounts of the appropriate variations in charge a:s conditions
change through the passage of time would need to be determined by investig-
ations based on the most up-to-date data and projections.     In reality, land
usage, diurnal demand patterns, and so on might tend to lower price levels,
while increases in time values might have the. opposite effe.ct.   The use of
transportation modelling techniques specifically geared to road pricing needs.
would be an important analytical tool.   Even so, such a tool would probably
                                    2
be approximative in its responses, < > and would call for thorough post facto
appraisal of its ability to simulate current travel decision-making in Caracas,
and consequent price levels, subsequent to the _impleme_ntation of pricing;
though after an initial adjustment period to enable behavioral patterns to
settle down.


The Policy, Planning and Hesearch Department would need to set up a simple
and inexpensive on-going survey of randomly selected vehicles making

       price relationship and not the volume which would be called

       study.

use of the priced area as part of the process to update continually the
amount of the charge levied.


Driver would be asked to furnish data on origins destinations and routes of
all trips during the previous working day.     The marginal social cost of
each journey would be calculated from informatfon on speed-flow equations,
time values, vehicle operating costs, occupancy factors, and traffic flows
by vehicle type.    On average, the charge levied and the marginal social
cos~s   of each trip should coincide.   It may be necessary to acknowledge the
diversionary impact of pricing in a discrete time and area space.        To omit
the survey aspect of the suggested updated procedure would imply that the
possibly significant implications of variations in trip length and route choice
could be overlooked.     The suggested procedure could be completely handled
with excess capacity by a devoted two-man team -- one competent statisti-
cian and one assistant - - plus field survey staff.      Most probably only small
adjustments to the charge would be necessary from year-to-year.          The
extent to which adjustments are vital to the returns from the scheme would be
a function of the sensitivity of demand to price.     Such sensitivity would be
indicated when road pricing is initially introdu(:_ed.


Accounting Department.       The primary duty of this department of the Road
Pricing Division would be to verify that there is a correspondence among
the various statements of the same transactions by different parties, and to
prepare balance sheets.      The ultimate output would be the consolidated
statement of accounts; this would in.elude the reconciliations of receipts and
advice notes concerned with the many transactions, verification of inter-
mediate totals and calculation of the vending agent's commissiOns.        Another
important function would be the accounting of the monies received from fines, (1)

Division would be part of the internal accounting of the   -~MTC,      a separate
paper-accounting at least should be maintained as a check on the efficiency
of road pricing.


The Accounting Department would also be -responsible for the printing, storing
and distribution of permits to wholesale establishments.           Permits would be
printed in government facilities, which would have acquired from manufacturing
concerns any legal rights for the use of special techniques for printing the
permits.      Since the permits would be practically as liquid as money,
similar precautions will be needed as in printing money or bank notes.           ·1.7 ery

careful internal accounting with external supervision will therefore be
needed; it is suggested that .destruction of out-of-date but unused licences
be uri'der AMTC supervision, and that licences in transit have

OMET Statistical Section.       Besides· providing statistical services to other
OMET divisions, the Statistical Section would be ass.igned tasks to assist
the   R~ad   Pricing Department in its routine monitoring activities.      These
tasks would be directed to:




(1)     If it were decided that the AMTC should receive some portion of
        the difference between the price of a premium permit and that
        of an ordinary permit, A description of the purpose of the
        premium permit is provided ih Section 4. 7. 1.

(2)     If date-specific permits are employed.

(3)     As envisaged in Section 5. 3, a professional company such as
        Servicio Pan Americana de Protecci6n, C. A., with armored
        vehicles and armed guards, might provide this service.

                      enable the parameters of the charging system to be
                      changed when circumstances (and measured data)
                      demand it;

                      draw attention to deficiencies in other aspects. of
                      the road and transport system and ·provide guidance
                      on future regulatory and construction decisions;

                      provide a general check that the revenue collected
                      agree with those anticipated;

                      assist the Policy, Planning and Research Department
I                     in its research programs.


    The amount and types of data collected would, to some extent, depend on
    their usefUlness to divisions .other than the Road Pricing Divisicm.   A
    minimum data requirement would be related to those parameters used
    directly in the present study of road pricing, -as follows:

                      occupancy factors (buses, cars, goods vehicles
                      and taxis);

                      income (general, commercial operations, taxi
                      drivers);

                      traffic flows (by vehicle type and hour of day on
l                     a sample of roads);
                      speeds (as for traffic flows);

                      vehicle costs (fixed and ope.rating);

                      user charges;

                      bus and taxi frequencies and routes;

                      commer~ial   parking charges.


    In addition to the· above "efficiency" parameters, a number of "administrat:lve"
    parameters would have to be observed:

                      frequency of pricing violations;

                      citations given;

                      sales and refund accounting records;

                      internal cost information ..


                                         -333-
 Broader economic and social data may also.have to be gathered periodically
 to assist the Road Pricing Division in policy formulation.


 OMET Computer Center.          Like the OMET Statistical Section, this unit
- would prov.ide computer services, as well as ancillary services such as
 programming and key-punching of cards, to all-OMET divisions.            As such,
 it would be instructed to assist the Road Pricing Division in its day-to-day
 work as well as in its special research programs.


 4. 8. 3   Staff Needs

 Rough estimates of staff needs in the Road Pricing Division are listed in
 Table 4. 9. · Also included in this table are likely staff in other OMET sections
 and divisions- that would    sp~nd   much of their time on road pricing tasks.   The
 Road Pricing Division would require some ·13 professionals and 29 other staff;
 while the OMET's other divisions and units would give suppOrt with about
 four· professionals and 86 other personnel including the enforcement inspectors
 and officers in the field.    .Thus a total of 132 AMTC. employees would be
 directly involved in road pricing activities.
                                                                                        ·-
 4. 9   POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY LICENCE
        SCHEME FOR TRAVEL .BERA VIOR AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE

 Other sections of this report placed emphasis on the economic effects of
 imposing priciµg on part, or all of, the road system in the Caracas Metro-
 politan Area (CMA), and examined the benefits to those who would gain from
 the improved use of the system and the losses to those who would be influenced
 to shift to less convenient travel modes.       This section concentrates on the
 probable effects that road pricing would have had on travel patterns on the             1
 CMA and Central Business District (CBD) road systems in 1971 had road
 pricing been imposed at that time over the CBD.         It also examines some of
 its longer-term impacts on the economic structure of both the CMA and the
 CBD.

 could exercise one, or simultaneously some, of a number of available                     l

                (i)     Pay the road price;

                (ii)    Divert to a lower-priced route;

    The scope of the study, as undertaken, allows for a quantitative evaluation

    only during certain periods of the day upon which-would depend the character-

           to factors (such as road pricing) that affect accessibility, was
           beyond the scope of this study that initially did not envisage   ·
           systems analysis by integrated transport models.

     As explained in Appendix ,1, a function of the transport model is to. simulate
     the action of travellers choosing one particular route and mode of travel

     based on a comparis9n of the relative attributes of a trip by alternative
     routes and modes.      Any change in the travel-co.st structure, e.g., an
     element added differentially to it, such as a supplem·entary licence, to use
     a specific section of the transport network, provokes a diversion to other
     routes and modes;      and such
                                '
                                     effects,
                                        ,
                                              as has b~en stated, can be predicted
     by the model.


     Table 4. 10 shows the number of auto-person ti:ips in the peak hour to the
     CBD in 1971 that would be expected to divert -to public transport modes,

     ·assuming increasing price levels to enter the CBD. ( ) It can be seen that
     a price of Bs.1. 25 per .p. c. u. trip diverts to other modes 18. 4 percent
     of auto-person trips with   de~tinations   in the priced area.     Doubling the
     charge to Bs.2.50 diverts 32.7 percent of these trips.           As price levels are
     increased it becomes somewhat more difficult to divert more of these people,
     but the trend continues so-that about 79. 4 percent ·of auto person trips
     d:estined for the CBD are di~erted at a price level of Bs. 7. 20. ( )

     These results indicate that those auto-person trips to the CED with a
     shorter-than-average trip length tend to be diverted to other modes first.
     This follows from the fact that the CED licence price represents a larger
     part of travel costs for trips of short duration than for trips of longer
i"   duration.      Table 4. 11 shows quantitative evidence to substantiate this
     observation by indicating that the average trip length by auto increases
     monotonically in the peak hour from 7. 13 kilometers under the no-road-
     pricing condition (1) to 7. 64 kilometers with a road price of Es. 7" 20.      As
     the short trips destined to the CED are diverted to other modes so the
     average trip length for all remaining auto travel in the CMA increases .

                                                         .
     One of the more notable and evident consequences of road pricing on the
      quality of transport is reflected by its effect on travel speeds.       Table 4.12
      illustrates the increase in travel speeds resulting from the imposition of
      road pricing 6ver. the CED area.      ·.Since the present traffic conditions within
     the CED area reflect operation on the steepest part of the speed-flow curves
     . (e.g., see Figure 2. 17), the removal of some traffic with the imposition of
     the lowest charge (Es·. 1. 25). results in a substantial increase in travel
      s~eds     from a very low base within the CED.         As more traffic is diverted
     from the street system within the CBb, filrther speed increases result but
      at a· substantially dampened rate.     By comparison the increase in travel
      speeds observed over the CMA is less dramatic since the impact _:_ ranging
      from high in the CED to insignificant levels in the outlying districts - - is
      averaged over the city as a whole, and because pricing has its prime diver-
      sionary impact upon short trips which do not extend very far out of the CED.


      4. 9. 2   D.iversion of T)1rough-Traffic Around the Priced Area

      In the time available for this study, it was not possible to develop specific
      data on the number of auto trips diverted around the priced area.          However,




      (1)       Some part of these increases would be due to trip makers who
                adhere to car travel incurring extra distances so as to avoid
                entering the priced area.

  (1)   Kilorp.eters ·per hour.
the effect on route diversion of imposing a charge to enter the CBD is
believed to be significant for through-traffic.          It is estimated that a
price of Bs. 2. 50, or above, diverts virtually all through-traffic around ·
the priced area in the peak hour.      Indirect evidence supporting this was
gleaned from an analysis of the volume of east-west traffic movements
using two available bypass   route~   lcicated to the north and south respectively
of the CBD.    The northerri route is one-way east-bound.            It mostly com-
prise·s Calle Este 7, a narrow twisting road with one, and occasfonally two,
effective lanes.   In contrast, the southern route, Autopista Francisco
Fajardo, is a recently built six-.lane divided freeway.


From an analysis of the traffic assignments made during the study, it is
estimated that morning peak hour travel along the r:iorthern route bypassing
the CBD would increase substantially in relative terms (65o/o), ·with the
imposition of a Bs. 2. 50 charge on the road system in the CBD, but
moderately in absolute terms (from 3, 260 to 5, 380 p. c. u. - kilometers).
Since the northern route is already     h~avHy    congested without road pricing,
the increa.sed traffic volu~e ~ould produce a drop in vehicle speed from a
present level of 11. 5 kph to· below 6. 0 kph.         It should be noted that this
speed reduction would account only for first-order effects.             In. other words,
the consequence of this speed reduction and.accompanying speed increases
in the CBD, on subsequent route and mode decisions of those initially diverted
to the bypass -could not be traced through.       For instance, -some of those
diverted would, on repeating the trip, re-evaluate their previous decision and
might pay to enter and pass through the priced area once they become aware
of the extreme congestion on the bypass route.            However, though overloaded,
   '                                          '    '           '                           '
the amount of traffic now using Calle Este 7 is small; about 1, 000 vehicles
during the morning· peak hour.      Thus, the error caused by considering only
first-order effects is believed to be small.


In· c_ontrast, the imposition of a Bs. 2. 50 charge would cause only a small
relative increase in travel (12%) in the morning peak hour along the
Autopista Francisco Fajardo, where it bypasses the southern fringe. of the
CBD,- but fairly substantial in absolute terms (from 45, 700 to 51, 000 p. c.u. -
kilometers). - Present peak-hour speeds on this route are expected to

     . decrease only slightly from 21. 7 kph to 20. 5 kph after CBD through-traffic
      has been diverted to it.


      At the Bs. 2 ..50 level, the combined increase in travel on both routes together
                                                                         I            .


If    would be in the orqer of 15 percent or 7, 420-.p. c.u. -kilometers.            These
      measures of travel qiversion from CBD through-routes to the two bypass
      routes are quite low since a significant amount of CED-destined traffic
                             ,
      using these routes at present would be removed by road pricing (about 33o/o
[     at the Bs. 2. 50 µrice level) and would cause a sizeable drop in traffic volume
      on the bypasses to counterbalance erstwhile CBD through-travel diverted
      to them.


      4. 9. 3      Effect on :Public 'Transport
I     Throughout the study, it was assumed that buses. would not be subject .to
      road pricing; however, a specific charge to enter the CBD was applied to
      por puestos and taxis (PPT) as a function of their p. c.'u. equivalent. (l)
      As    a result,      · PPT patronage is expected to decline with increasing road-
      pricing levels on the assumption that PPT operators would pass on the price
      of their supplementary licences to their passengers in the form of higher
             .   ( 2)                                                                       .
      rates.            . This effect is quantified in Table 4. 13 for a situation in which the
      Metro system is            operating~   For example, the increase in bus and Metro
      passenger-kilometers in the p·eak hour following a price change from
      Bs-. 0. 00 to Bs. 2. 50 is nine percent and seven percent respectively., whereas
      the por puesto passenger travel decreases five percent.                This overall
      decrease· in por puesto trayel occurs despite the fact that some persons ·
      could possibly be diverted from their car to the por puesto mode.




      (1)         Chapter 4. 4 shows the reasoning behind the PPT charge.

      (2)         It may need price-setting legislation to ensure that such

As indicated in Table 4. 12 increases in bus and PPT trayel speed within
the CMA resulting from a change in price level from Bs. 0, 00 to Bs. 2. 50
(8. 5% for bus and 9. 7% for PPT) are less than those for autos.          This is
mainly because public transport vehicles spend a significant portion of their
total travel time in picking up or discharging passengers.

                       .                                   .
Since the time during whieh a public transport vehiCle is stopped for such
purposes is unaffected by the level of congestion on the street system,
reducing the level of congestion has less potential for increasing the overall
speeds of. public transit vehicles than it has in the case of private autos.


The increase in travel speeds of the public transit vehicles gives only a
partial indication of the benefits that might accrue to them due to the
reduced congestion.        It is true that, when measured over the CMA, speeds
only   ~ncrease   by about six percent if an entry charge of Bs; 2. 50 is levied:
However, within the CBD, the increase          ~n   speed is expected to be more like
25 to 30 percent.      The large increase in speed that road pricing makes
possible for the public transit vehicles inside the CBD should generate very
significant benefits, especially for buses.          At present, with the high levels
of.. congestion in the CBD, the effed of traffic .streain breakdowns has such
a devastating effect on_ bus schedules and most bus operators admit that they
                                                           I

have discarded them as inopera~le.        Once the levels of congestion within the
CBD are reduced, it should.again become possible for the bus operators to
adhere to schedules and. provide a better servi.ce for the public.


4. 9. 4   Fundamental and Longer-Term Possible Economic
          Impacts - Por Puesto Service

At the more fundamental level, the imposition of supplementary licensing as
suggested within this report may set in motion tendencies towards a complete
restructuring of the sy~tem of public transport system in Caracas and could
                           .                         .

the ·more important routes were the '\lletro also to be introduced, and occasion
considerable depletion on such routes even in the absence of a MetI,"o.

 The por puesto service developed in the 195.0 1 s and early 1960 1 s as a :result
                                1
,of an inadequate bus service. ( ) It was in absolute decline in the late
1960' s (although still of major importance) following the introduction of a
·new set of publicly-owned bus services in 1966/1967 by EMTSA.          These
had the effect of capturing 14 percent of the previous por puesto patronage.
The por puesto service exists because it offers (i) high frequency of service,
(ii) a co.mfortable seat 'for each passenger, and, generally, a more convenient
and reliable level of service than that provided by the present buses. For
                                                 2
these attributes a premium price is demanded. ( ) · Since the end of the
1960's the bus services have tended to fall-off in quality and it seems that
                                                            3

Under a regime of road pricing (and especially one which exempts buses)
the relative advantages of the por puesto service would be whittled away:

             (i)    demand for bus travel would increase thus
                    occasioning new, comfortable buses to be
                    laid on so as to supply more frequent and
               -    more dense services which would also be
                    more reliable .than at present because of
                    the reduced traffic congestion;

             (ii)   demand transferred from the. por puesto
                    serv~ces would lead to an increase in the
                    mean age of the por puesto fleet and would
                    reduce headways.          ·
                                                                                     :I
                                                                                      I

       where a bus journey would cost Bs. 0. 25 and Bs. 0. 50.

( 3)   However, around the turn of the year 197 2/ 3 several events
       were occasioned which could combine to improve substantially
       the status of the Caracas bus services, e.g. EMTSA acquired
       a fleet of attractive new buses.




                                   -346-
Once an initial amount of demand has been transferred away, the reduction
in the relative appeal of the por puesto service would reduce patronage
fur~her   leading to an additional reduction in relation appeal and so on. (l)
Fares cannot be lowered to compensate       becaus~   of the. cost levels: por
puesto drivers already work overlong hours in many cases for meager
retu,rns; and any trend to reduction of fares would cause many of them to
seek other employment.      ·Were fares to be de-controlled it is more likely
that they wo.uld seek to. move upwards to compensate for decreased occupancies
a movement which would be thwarted unless travellers should choose           to   pay
more for an absolutely and relatively worse serviee.


The further away from the CBD the less would be the effect of the. pricing
of the CBD on the por puesto service.       However, the system is less viable
away from the· CED anyway since the more diffused demand patterns lead
. to relatively reduced frequencies and, hence, reduced convenience (although
to a lesser degree than so with buses).      Nevertheless, route,s do e:x;ist, and
could be complemented by more radiating from Metro stations where the
por puesto will continue to be viable and_ particularly so since a taxi service
could be provided using the same re~urces during, non-peak demand            .
periods.     Such routes might be expected to typify the type of service towards·
which the present por puesto system might become orientated.           It would
be likely to be associated with
                              -,.      . fares and lower occupancy ratios
                                  higher
than at present.


The probability of such tendencies is not represented within the transport
model nor the subsequent benefit calculations.        These and other such
excluded ramifications of the suggested supplementary .licensing scheme can
be expected to gradually make themselves felt over a period of time longer
than that to which the model was designed to apply.        The net effect of these
tendencies need not necessarily be beneficial.




(1)       Such reactions are completely unrepresented in the transport
          model used for the study.




                                   -347-
Diurnal Distribution of Traffic Flows.        One effect which could be expected
to build up gradually after the introduction of the scheme, but which would
have some immediate (and possibly adverse) impact, would be a re-phasing
of the diurnal distribution of travel demand.       In central Caraca_s at present,
the density of traffic exhibits no pronounced peaks during the daylight hours
(but eases off during the luncheon interval).       (See Figure 2. 18).   The
supplementary licence scheme would apply throughout the whole of the day-
light period.    It could happen that road space freed during the peak periods
would be soaked up by the transference to the peak periods of travel that is
currently dissuaded from occuring then because of the acute congestion.
Much of the latter demand would be made at inter-peak periods at the present
thus tending to create the adverse travel conditions which currently exist
throughout the day:


In this context, it was observed that in central London in 1962, (l) inter-peak
p. c. u. flows were 98. 6 percent of peak flows.      By 1966, subsequent to
the introduction of   restra~nt   procedures which do not affect peak-tlemands
to a significantly different degree than inter-peak demands, this proportion
had declined to 93.1 percent.       If any such tenden.cy should make itself felt
in Caracas it could be compensated by a rejection of the doctrine of a      fl~t­

rate system of pricing throughout the day.        Serious thought would have to
be given   as to whether the effects we.re in fact disadvantageous, however.
It would be probable that some relatively low priority shopping and personal
business trips would divert to the peak hours where they would inflict delay
on commuting trips, involving travellers outside of working hours rather
than on commercially important trips made during the inter-peak period.


Public Transport and Car Ownership.           The situation of bus companies and
bus travellers could be affected in ways which, in toto, are somewhat

 confusing.    On the main radial routes, the ove'rall level of demand would
 increase.     This· would provide the. incentive for more and newer buses to
 be laid on and a superior level of service to result.        The degr>ee of peaking
 could be accentuated, although the custom in Caracas to go home to lunch
 reduces the severity of this problem compared with otber cities as does the
 fact that serious directional flow inbalance does not occur.         Also, the _cost
 penalty of any given _degree of peaking minimized by the relatively low wage
 rates paid to the one.:..man operators 'of buses, and the higher occupancy
 factors which apply during peak hours. (1)         It is considered that the higher
 demand and. greater freedom from congesti,on, even at the cost of some ·
 extra peaking would improve the financial situation of bus· companies oper-
 ating on such routes.         (Any extra peaking could be combatted by the
 allowing of greater fare flexibility) .


. -Bus travel is   le~s   viable anyway for local community_ services.    The level
 of viability could be reduced still fuJ;"ther if a typiCal car which is currently
 used by the man of the house for commuting should be· available to the woman
 of the house fo,r shopping, social visits, etc., as it might under a regime
 of road pricing.         Such repercussions could be. more injurious to_ local por
 puestos and taxi sources than to buses however.


 On the other hand, it may be that if a car is not used every day for com-
 muting,- it may be dispensed with altogether.         This would be more likely to
 be so especially in the cases of households which presently _own more than
 one car.     Although the situation is not clear-:-cut, it would a·ppear that each
 car dispensed with would have beneficial

 transferred to local usage would imply maleficial overtones.


 Employment of Unskilled Labor.·           The employment of unskilled labor is
 desirable from the social and political standpoints.         It can be achieved

at low real cost if such labor would otherwise be put to no productive use.
It is to be. expected that the supplementary licence scheme would naturally
lead to some worsening of the employment situation and,' insomuch that this
is true, the scheme would naturally lead to some worsening of the employment
situation and, insomuch that this is true, the scheme should be carefully
reviewed in this context.    Relevant implications are:

            (i)     Some reduction in the demand for por puesto
                    drivers is indicated by the traffic model. A
                    much greater reduction could occur if a
                    general de.cline of the system should ensue as
                    outlined earlier in this section. Inadequate
                    compensation would be occasioned by any ·greater
                    demand for bus and Metro personnel, each of
                    which are less labor-intensive, at the margin.

            (ii)    Because of increased speeds, any given amount
                    of work for goods vehicle operators, bus
                    companies, por puesto lines, ·and ta'xi unions
                    could be supplied with less staff.  The greater
                    labor productivity which ensues may not lead to
                    any fully compensatory increase in the demand
                    for labor servtees. (1)

            (iii)   Presently, because of widespread traffic con-
                    gestion, marginal employment is provided in
                    the activities of selling flowers, newspapers,
                    kites, household brushes, confectionary, por
                    puesto destination boards, paper handkerchieves,
                    and other such diverse goods to persons in jammed
                    and slowly moving cars. Higher speeds would
                    be likely to kill this trade. Many of the sale.s
                    would be completely forgone whilst others _would
                    be made in a less labor intensive manner.

            (iv)      A reduction in the demand for vehicles implies
                      a reduction in the. need for veJ;iicle plant assembly
                      workers, mechanics, petrol salesmen, etc,,
                    . whom the benefit calculations assume will be use-
                      fUlly employed in the same or alternative capacity.




(1)    In the benefit calculation, convention was followed and an
       implicit assumption was made that such full compensation
       would .in fact prevail.




                                     -350-
             (v)    Many of the enforcement tasks would create a
                    new sector of demand for unskilled labor,

             (vi)· · u!1.skilled labor could also be utilized produCing
                     and distribpting licence permits.


On balance it appears that the demand for. unskilled labor could fall unless the
increased efficiency of the urban economy should attract         a sufficiently    large
amount of new activity.       However, such reasoning would completely discount
the latent power of the system revenues.           It is unknown what the Government
. would see fit to do with these revenues, but the more beneficial outlets
would seem to be those directed towards a soaking-up of some of the surplus .
pool of unskilled labor.


A further comment upon the impact of the scheme on employment concerns
 skilled and sem'i-skilled labor who may have attained a reasonable degree
 of educational qualification.      The direct effects of the scheme would seem
to imply a net increase in: the demand for such people, some c:ategories of
whom are in .restricted supply in Venezuela.           This could lead   to a   cutback
to 'some sectors   Or economic activify occasioning further unemployment of
unskilled labor.     It could also be inflationary.


 Inflationary Impact.· Those who pay the road pricing dues would generally
 not make up in efficiency an amount equivalent to the extra financial outlays ·
which they .have to bear.       Even if the converse were true, there could be a
psychological motivation for inflationary tendencies.          Car commuters under
·a road pricing regime would generally be high income earners who would·
have considerable leverage with their companies which might be persuaded·
to foot all of the road price bill that these commuters tot up.          Apart from ·
·diverting the impact of pricing and reducing its effect below that which was
simulated by the transport model, this could be passed on to customers in
an inflationary manp.er (especially if Venezuelan business employs cost-plus
pricing policies   a..;;a; or that there   is some imperfection in the compefitive
environment).




                                       -351-
     A similar effect could follow from the raising of goods carriage charges
     by transport companies.     It would be difficult to guard against such
                                                                   I
     tendencies by means of price controls.      . Any attempt to do so could be
     thwarted by a reduction in output of the. enterprises concerned so. that
     inefficient non-price competition or black markets could develop.         Any
     attempt to distribute revenues so that cost penalties are minimized would
     run the risk of reducing the deterrant effect of the licence price.


     On the other hand, some amount of potential purchasing power would
                                                                          .
     be soaked up by payment of the road pricing dues; and . it could be that the
     fiscal revenues derived from the transfer of funds would be spent in less
     inflationary-prone sectors of the economy than would otherwise be the case,

     Location of Activities.   The CBD would become more attractive as a place
     of work for low-income people who travel by bus and· for very high income
     people driving cars to whom the utility of the time gains through pricing
-.   exceeds the utility of the money paid out as licence. fees.

     would have some incentive to find employment elsewhere. (l)

                                                                          One can
     safely assm:ne that employers would be correspondingly influenced by such
     changes in attraction.


     There could therefore be some tendency for middle-income persons who
     might typically be employed in occupations such as insurance, marketing,
     government administration, and so on, to move away and leave the CBD to
     the two extremes typified by Congressmen and routine clerical personnel.
     Howe".:er, the most significant locational effects would be likely to arise
     from the pricing of goods vehicles, should these be priced according to
     the level of costs for which they are responsible.




     (1)    This assumes that the amount of the road price dues a~e
            correctly_ allocated, e.g.' that por puesto operators do not
            increase all fares because of the increased costs which they
            bear because of their CBD passengers.

  Activities which need intensive servicing' by goods vehicles,_ such as whole-
  sale trading and warehousing, examples of which can .be found within the
  CED, would be burdened with significantly higher costs compared with
  equivalent activities located elsewhere.         Service in the hours of darkness
  would not be any permanent salutation although it may be a temporary
  expediant prior to the   disp~acement   of activity to elsewhere.


  Effect on. R.oad Construction.   R.oad pricing would reduce the likelihood-that
- low priority trips would sufficiently impeded high priority trips so as to
  make an expansion of road space worthwhile.           It would be likely to confer
  savings to the road-program budget, although pricing flexibility does allow
                                             '                                 .

  is not clear-cut: the 'justification for some current road-building, is mysterious
  the disruption caused during construction and the attraction of marginal usage
  must tend to counter any potential beneficial consequences.         Savings on the
  program would certainly follow in any instance where high traffic densities
  are deemed to warrant the provision of extra road-space. (l)


  Conclusion on Economic Implications.           The conventional natures of the
  transport model and the subsequent economic evaluation embraced only the
  first-order impact of supplementary licensing, in the short run, - and for a
  morning peak hour only.      Clearly the scheme has many more economic
  implications' than those which were a.ble to be indentified therein.       To
  determine and to assess these fu:r:ther implications l.ri a quantitative manner
  would involve many man-hours and could never be a precise operation.

The environmental quality of Caracas, especially in terms of noise and air
pollution, to which vehicular traffic is a significant contributory factor'
might be considered by many Western Europeans or North Americans, to
be low.     However, up to now Carequefios have usually tolerated the
situation without obvious discomfort.        To some extent they have had little
choice to do otherwise.       High densities of physical development caused
by land sh0rtage exacerbate the situation; while rapid demographic and
economic growth in the face of scarce technical       an~   administrative resources
force priorities to be placed more on the physical accommodation of this
growth rather than on the considerations of orderly design aimed at producing
a high-quality environment.       In any case, it is possible that the Caraquefios'
Latin heritage conditions citizens to be more tolerant of environmental
erosion, particularly regarding noise, than is the case in Anglo-Saxon
societies. (l) It is doubted whether this attitude will continue to hold into
             2
the future. ( ) Although environmental awareness is a somewhat intangible
concept, it would seem that it increases with educational level, sacral
maturity, degree of environmental deprivation, and income.            Only in the
latter two aspects have a significant number of Caraquefios reached standards
on a par with those observed by more developed nations.           As such awareness

          from the fact that pressure from minority groups has re-

productivity per man-hour, higher incidences of mental and physical                  J
ailments, decreased social responsibility, and generally higher economic
cost to the nation.                                                                  I
On balance, the quality of the environment in Caracas would be improved by
,·

the road pricing scheme suggested.       However, it would be desirable to
                                                                                     I
attempt to improve such quality regardless of the existence of road pricing,
and some mention is made of the opportunities available by means of which
this could be accomplisheq.


To the extent that environmental quality is directly correlated with traffic
volumes, it can be justly argued that the value of such quality at the margin
should be represented in the road price which the user is called upon to pay
for the use of road space.     In principle, a situation as simplified by
Figure 4. 11 applies.   AC   shows ordinary average or private costs of
                           2
vehicle operation and A.C 1 shows such costs if road users were also called
upon to pay a monetary amount equal.to the average environmental costs




 (l)   The real price of cars can be expected to decline in the
       future. Smaller cars, quite economical in terms of resource
       consumption (e.g. Renault 4, VW 1200), are beginning to
       be produced and these would have a generally depressing
       effect on new and used car prices.    Many households are
       coming into an income range where car-ownership is
       possible and this in itself would lower prices through larger
       scale production.

It can be.. simply shown (but at the cost of complicating Figure 4.11) that
 society benefits from a reduction in traffic from Oqz i.e., that it would
 confer advantages upon society if travel prices were to be raised over and
 above those which are indicated by the· cost of the delays which road users
 inflict upon each other.     For instance at places where peak traffic flows
 are li~ely to result in dangerous levels of atmospheric pollution, a high
 peak charge could be demanded so that only a minimal Fkelihood of any such
 occurrence should pr~vail.       High accident probabilities could similarly be
 allpwed for, as could pqints of dense pedestrian activity. (l)      Other aspects
 of the mainten:;i.nce of environmental quality can be mo.re efficiently accom-
 modated by the application of desirable standards to vehicles.        This would
 supposedly involve the specification of legally accepted tolerance levels
 although there is no 'reason.why pricing could not be employed in this context
 also, and indeed-such   wo~ld   result in the most efficient outcome.


 The incorporation of environmental costs into a road pricing would cause
the road system to be operated at points corresponding to that denoted by
 "L" in Figure 4.11.     .Without their incorporation, .operation would be at
 points corresponding to "E" at which the level of    t~affic   would be too high
 for overall optimality recognizing general urban effects rather than solely
transport sector effects.


 The calculation of the amounts to be added to curve AC 2 to yield curve AC1
·would be at best a formidable task . . The. inq,rements would vary not just
with traffic flow but would also vary with the subdivision of traffic flow by
vehicle type, which would result under a regirrie of conventional road

In this study, opportunity was not made available to include environmental
costs within the process by means of which the prjce level is determined.
Thus, the calculated optimal situation would correspond to- a traffic volume
of Oqz ra:ther than Oqx in Figure 4. 11. ·   However, environmental benefits·
are implied(l) since a traffic volume corresponding to Oqz implies a
reduction in _environmental disturbance versus a situation with no road price
at all (i.e., Oq).   No atterp.pt has been made to evaluate these benefits,
however.

Hoad pricing w·ould lower mean traffic volumes and would change the
proportionate breakdown of traffic volumes by vehicle type:        Each of these
associated effects would have its feedback to the general urbari environment.
However, not all of the implications are indicative of an ame1ioration of
environmental quality - - for instance one bus may cause greater vibration
to be transmitted through to surrounding buildings than would the 20 cars
which may otherwise accommodate the same number of people.            fodeed, it
would need an exorbitantly exhaustive study acknowledging the specific
characteristics of Caracas to .determine whether or not the introduction of
road pricing in central Caracas would cause the overall level of environ-
mental quality, as appreciated by the average Caraquefio, to be raised at
all ..


The main factors which contribute to environmental quality and which can
be. expected to be influenced by road pricing (in the form of the suggested
supplemeritary lice1:1sing scheme for the CBD) are:

                    cleanliness and general long-term
                    consequences.


Each of these four categories is discussed in the following .sections.
The discussion concentrates upon the changes which the pricing of the
CBD would have upon the conditions in tl;te .immediate environs of the CBD
street system, for it is here that the more apparent effects of the envisaged.
pricing scheme will be felt.


4.10,2   Noise

In central Caracas at the present, traffic is dense apd generates a general·
background din, a quantitative value for which cannot reliably be re-ad from
standard tables because speeds are so low that specific measurements are
called for in order that adequate recognitiOn can be made of factors such
as distances between affected parties and the noise sources, vehicle
characteristics, intensity of surrounding development, and. so on.       Anyhow,
it is not the background din which presents the major obstacle to the .success-
ful accomplishment of productive tasks that require significant degree of
thought and concentration.     These taf?ks· are much more sensitive to the
shrieks from motorcycles, the. discord of mult-toned car horns, and the
roar of bus engines, each of, which are randomly distributed with high
fre·quency on the street system of the CBD."

car registers 80 dB, ( 2) each PPT registers 84 dB, each bus registers
90 dB(A) ·and each goods vehicle registers 86 dB, -then the mean vehicle
without pricing would register some '81. 2 dB.          Supplementaty licensing
would raise thi_s to 81. 6 dB per vehicle.        However, the reduction--in the
traffic flow should more than compensate for this.


Thus it would appear that some benefits on account of a reduce a intensity
of background traffic noise would result from the road pricing scheme.
The economic and general social amenity advantage which is to be derived
from this may not be significant, however.           Changes in traffic volume
confer most noticeable changes in noise level at low traffic densities and_
even under a regime of optimal supplementary licensing, the traffic densities
in central Caracas would not be sufficiently l~w. ( 2 ) In any case, the major
disturbanc~         on account of noise from traffic in Caracas results from the

frequent but discontinuous intermissions provided by the 'eruptions from
motorcycles~ etc.           Road pricing could well have the- effect of accentuating
such incisive blasts since a reduction in car traffic would be likely to be
accompanied by an increase in motorcyde traffic and in the numbers of buses
with non-sound-dampened engines (in spite of their technical illegality in
Venezuela).

          to general environmental. considerations rather than with
          respect to traffic effects only, then it is possible that traffic
          flows would be reduced to a much greater extent so that the
          overall level of traffic noise is significantly affected.

       Australia is o: 6 - 4. 8 mg/m3. In the U.S.A. itself the Depart- ~
       ment of Health, Education arid Welfare had determined that a
       maximum allowable concentration for eight-hour exposure is
       200 mg/m3.     In Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Cincinnati, a
       survey showed that less than one-half of one percent of individ-
       uals have a blood content of 50 mg/100 ml, or over, of lead
       whereas a danger of intoxication is considered to develop above
       a content of 80 mg I 100 ml.· Other particulate matter is generally
       considered non-toxic per se, though it may have a catalytic role
       in the production of sulphur trioxide and sulphuric acid; ·and
       also in the production of photochemical smog from hydrocarbons
       and nitrogen oxides.

(4)    However, in February 1973, the Venezuelan Natural Science
       Society reported that on the main Avenidas of Caracas lead con-
       centrations are 15-20mg/m3, which is far above the densities
       usually recorded in urban areas.

brake linings may soon compel reconsideration at this· point).       Road pricing
would have an effect on (ii) only   insom~ch   that it implies a reduction in fuel
consumption.    Its ameliatory effect on (i) and (iii) would be compounded
by an accompanying effect upon traffic composition.


The output .of exhaust gases from a vehicle ·is extremely sensitive both to
the type of engine with which it is installed and to the work which the engine
is doing.   It can be learned from Table 4. 15 that road pricing would have
a significant effect on the level of exhaust gases emitted_into the atmosphere.
This is oc;casioned mainly from a change in the workload to be performed
by vehicle engines, but also because of a decline in the overall traffic level
and the switch towards diesel-engined vehicles. (1)       Road pricing would    .
lead to a reduction in the proportion of time that an engine spends in idling,
accelerating and decelerating and would confer an increase in proportion.
of time spent in cruising.   Reading an example from Table 4.15, cruising
with a gasoline engine is associated with a carbon monoxide concentr;;i.tion
in emittee exhaust gases of 27, 000 parts per ·million (compared with almost
ze.ro for a diesel engine); when accelerating the concentration is some
7-1/2 percent more, when decelerating it is some 44-1I2 percent more,
and when idling it is some 155-l I 2 percent more.       The situation regarding
. nitrogen oxide may be slightly less favorable under a road-pricing regime.


The effects of hydrocarbons in vehicle exhaust are non-toxic but can be
slightly anaesthetizing in high concentrations.      Nitrogen oxides emitted




(1)    In Sydney, Australia (from nAir Pollution from Motor Vehicles
       in the Sydney Metropolitan Area" by Murphy and Ferran -
       Proceedings ofR.A.C.I. Vol. 36, No. 1, Jan. 1969), the
       peak concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide
       were-3. 25 times and 4. 25 times, respectively, the off-peak
       concentrations. This indicates that a given reduction in
       traffic volume has a more than proportionate effect upon
       pollutive concentrations if it is assumed .that traffic volumes
       would vary less than these multiples.

A ldehydes irritate the eyes ( 2 ) a11.d affect the respiratory system.        They can

toxic: it can impair mental ability and can even be fatal in a closed garage
with an engine running.      One suspects that in some of the road tunnels
threading through Caracas, dangerous conditions could occur if serious
traffic hold-ups develop as they are increasingly likely so to do under an
 average pricing regime which neglects environmental costs.

 4 . 10 . 4     Safety

 In .most transport analyses, quantitative estimates are made ·of the effects
 of the proposed changes upon highway accidents.                          These are often then
 transformed into monetary equivalents for inclusion in the benefit calcu-
 lations.           The latter operation should generally acknowledge that it is based
· upon the findings of inadequate research.                        It is maintained herein that a
 misleading picture would be painted even by an attempt at the former oper-
 atiop in thiS study in the absence of a special investigation to add to the store
 of research of relevance to central urban conditions which has hitherto been
 accumulated.              Consequently, rpatters of safety are discussed in a qualitative
., fashion indicative of the. directions in which future research which should be
   ai:med.


 Accident occurrence is usually assumed to be a direct proportionate function                            ;i




 of traffic flow in most transport analyses - - as flow is reduced then so is
 the number ~f accidents; (1) It is possible that if traffic speeds were raised
 because of reduced {raffic flows, then the number of certain categories of
 accitjents could even be increased in central Caracas.                         For instance, on
 Calle ·Oeste Se is, presently               l?--   pedestrian usually has. little trouble in

 considerably greater than those usually prevailing, crossing the road is a
 more dangerous activity.                    Traffic weaving between lanes is more safely
 accommodated when th,at traffic is slowly moving; indeed any such movement
 is less necessary when traffic is slowly moving.                         Drivers even do not
 bother to attempt to pull out from behind a por puesto which is picking-up ·or
 setting-down passengers if the lane to the left of them is almost stationary, ( 2 )

 ( 2)         The fact that accidents can be so categorized and that each
              categ~ry has a different relation to traffic flow implies that .
              the assumption of direct proportionality between total accidents
              and traffic flow is unlikely to be valid.

Such accidents that do occur in heavily-congested streets do not usually
involve serious damage to humans, and the damage to vehicles is limited
by the necessarily low velocity at impact.        Even should lower, volumes and
higher speeds result in fewer accidents, any economic benefit implied by
a presentation of comparative ·accident totals may be_ completely     misleadi~g.

Any economic gains could be counter-balanced and even outweighed by a
contrary movement in the economic penalty per accident.


An important consideration in the context of safety would be the possible
effect that congestion could have upon driver behavior at distances away from
the congested area itse 1f.   In non-moving and in slowly-moving traffic,
drivers tend to become tense, later for appointments, and possibly sleepy
.because of subjection to (the hydrocarbons in) exhaust fumes.       It would seem
reasonable to expect that this would have an effect fvrther downstream and
would tend to raise accident probabilities on reaching freeways where the
relatively higher speeds imply that each accident is relatively severe and.
may involve serious damage to humans as well as to machines.


The overall effect that road pricing can be expected to have upon safety is
perhaps unlikely to be adverse.     However, no precise prediction is possible
without an exhaustive investigation with a full recognition of the particular
context of Caracas.     Such was not called for during this study.    It should
be noted that Caraquefios seem to care less about quite obvious accident
risks than do the inhabitants of more developed lands in much the same as
at least superficially they seem to care   l~ss   about other environmental
factors.     Vehieles are not required by law to be certified as being roadworthy;
even such elementary safety devices as seat-belt anchorages in cars are
not mandatory; official pedestrian crossings and traffic signals are not
heeded by motorists, who are not expected to acknowledge them by pedest-
rians; nothing bad is thought of bus stops to which access can be gained
                                                                                      I

costs of hospital treatment, and the loss of productive potential are as real
in Venezuela as they are elsewhere.        Hpwever, it does imply that any
benefits from a reduction in these· costs would only receive slight recognition. (l)


4i 10. 5   Other Envtronmental Implications of R.oad Pricing

R.oad pricing would be likely to have other direct implications which may,
however, be less significant in the context of Caracas than they would be. in
more economically developed parts of the world because of the seemingly
great~r relative tolerance by Caraquefios of low environm~ntal quality.-( 2)

Vehicular traffic intrudes into the urban fabric in a way that may be usually
disturbing to some. · R.oad pricing wou.ld have its major effect under this
heading in a reduction in the volumes of vehicles parked in the CBD.         To
any Caraquefios who recognize such disturbances, there may be counteracting
influences, however, such as more vehicles parked during the day outside
    .                                         . .               --..
of the CBD and possibly visually displeasing buildings constructed on the
sites of redundant car parks.


R.oad surfaces are irregular on many CBD streets in Caracas.        The move-
ment pf vehicles over such irregularities can occasion the setting up of
vibrations which affect activities other than those of the road users.     As
far as is known, no measurements of street-side vibration have been

         is at fault.  This would have important· implications of a dif-

variations in traffic flow and speed of traffic flow are transmitted through·
                                                    ,
to variations in vibration.   It is not.known therefore whether road pricing
would ameliorate or worsen the situation..    Any effect would be of compar-
atively little consequence, however, since most of the more recent buildings
in the· CED are designed to withstand severe earth tremors and this would
absorb any lesser vibrations transmitted from traffic. (l)


Pedestrian mobility on CBD streetS might be adversely affected for much
of the day by road pricing.   As was mentioned earlier in the context of
safety, the crossing of a street is more readily accomplished when traffic
is a,lmost jammed than when it is moving more rapidly.       However, as com-
pensation, there would be roads upon which a reduction in flows following
road pricing occurs at quite high speed levels and on such roads some
improvement might be recorded due to greater gar.s between vehicles in
the traffic stream.   A detailed study would be needed if the matter were
deemed to be of importance; it would become more important under a· pricing
regime since less numerous car parks and more public transport passengers
imi:>ly more pedestrian travel than would otherwfse occur.


The supplementary licence permits represent an additional potential litter
problem.     However, the observed relatively low. level of environmental
awareness of the average Caraquefio would tend to reduce the importance of
the matter .relative to a comparable situation in a city in som.e other part of
the world.    Moreover, the removal of old permits and the affixing of new
ones would typically take place at the driver's home which might tend to
inhibit discarding the used permit on the street.


The s:uggested pricing scheme does provide opportunities for an improvement

be able to be closed and replaced b,y: gardens in which the: greater freedom
from traffic disturbance can be enjoyed.        More than one CBD s-ide street is
even now barred from vehicular movements and           th~   scope for addition to such
·facilities could be _increased by the reduced utility as parking sites of other
such side streets.


It would be desirable both from the standpoint of the efficiency of the trans-
port system and from that of the _urban environment that the introduction of
the supplementary licensing scheme were accompanied by a rigorous system
of parking.control, affecting those bound for CBD destinations, around the
perimeter of the priced a·rea.       Otherwise any improvement to the quality of
the environment within the CBD would be, to some extent .at least; traded
for a worsening of such quality outside of the CBD .... Insomuch that perimetal
areas have a greater residential cpntent than has the· CBD, the maintenance
of the quality of the environment in the former areas may be deemed worthy
of greater political priority.


 4.10. 6    Summary of Environmental Implications of Road Pricing

have beneficial effects upon the quality of urban life in Caracas over and

imptications of a well conceived, well-planned and well-managed scheme

 and in a consistent rlrnnner.     Enforcement would be difficult to achieve to

 the desired degree of effectiveness, however, both because of the comparative
 inefficiency of the enforcement agencies, as evidenced by the lack of enforce-
 ment of existing traffic nois.e regulations, and because of a suspected lack
 of recognition of the potential and actual costs' of environmental deterioration.
 This suggests that two additional activities be initiated to accompany the
 measurement program.


 Firstly, there should be an educational program so that the population is
 made aware of what' they could be letting themselves in for, both privately
 and socially, if environmental quaiity is allowed to continue to deteriorate.
 This could be conducted cheaply and effectively via the local radio station
 network for instance.       It must be, a somewhat "forced" program: many ·
 Caraquefios are unaware of·the problem which \is rapidly bu~lding up around
. them,   wh~reas   in some European cities, for instance, the more gradual
 development of environmental deterioration has possibly reduced tJ:ie lag-time
 between the status of the problem and the recognition of the problem.               Forced
 programs are c;iifficult to make successful and the problem is not made any
 easier by an occasional tendency for Venezuelans to act only when an incipient
· . danger becomes an imminent danger(l \ perhaps largely because of the rapid
 rates of change which are thrust upon the country.              The longer action is
 delayed, the more expensive is the corrective action required.


 Secondly, a survey should be conducted, split maybe between before and
 after the   ed~cational   program, so that the extent to which Caraquefios demand
 that something should be done to raise environmental quality can be discerned;




 (1)      For example, it was only recently that a policy of promoting
          "non-traditional" exports was set in motion. · The ·imminent
          danger in this instance was a combination of declining oil
          reserves and a rapidly expanding labor force.




                                         -374-
The sample should be stratified by income, and educational level, so that
it can be of use for prediction into the future as well as for an estimation .
of the current status of demand.      It could be a task suitable for a university
department under the direction of an experienced social statistician.
                    ..       .                                                           ,   I
                                                                                         i   !
Some aspects of environmental improvement could be incorporated within
a scheme of automatic point pricing.         With such a scheme the pri.ce could
                                                                                             I
be varied to take account of the level of pedestrian activity, the nature of
the surroundings of the roadway, etc.         Increments would have to be
measured as a function of traffic flow in different environments and then
transformed from physical units into monetary units so that they can be
included within the amount of the road price.


This transformation into monetary units would not be a simple task.             It has
been indicated above that environmental quality is given less attention in
Caracas than in wealthier countries.         This may be "genuine", or it may .be
through a degree of imperfect perception.         The transformation would have
to acknowledge these possibilities.      Whether genuine or not, any deviation
from the norm of more developed lands could be a function of income and
other characteristics and it would be desirable to acknowledge this so that
the measurements made can be of use through time if these characteristics.
should change.


4.11   STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND TIME SCHEDULE

As discussed in Section 4. 2, it is almost certain that satisfactory electronic
                              .                                             '
road-pricing components can be developed within the three-year period from
the time that the Venezuelan Government gives its assent to road-pricing
an? legislates accordingly.       However, an electronic road-pricing system
involves more than the assembly of working components.           Certain conditions
require to be satisfied:

            (1.)       t th e "har d ware"Ir" components of the system
                   Th a.
                   can be manufactured at a reasonable cost and
                   will carry out their separate functions. '




                                     -375-
             (ii) ' That when the hardware comp.onents are assembled
                    into a system, the system operates as designed
                    without producing interactions that generate un-
                    suspected consequences.
                                                                       .-
             (iii)     That when assembled, the elements of the total
                       system, including its hardware and software
                       components and its legal, administrative and
                       other support activities, are compatible thereby
                       ensuring that the system functions smoothly and
                       efficiently without unanticipated counter-
                       pr.oductive effects.

             (iv)      That the consequences of introducing the system
                       upon traffic behavior over the priced area are
                       those which are predicted by economic theory.


Condition (i) above is on the verge of being satisfied by enough of the
·manufacturers of electronic road-pricing equipment mentioned in Section
4. 3 to make it certain that one or two of the firms will succeed in producing
operational hardware within a short time period. (l)        System designs also
                   •     •            J                                     --....




are sufficiently far advanced for it to be likely - - though it has yet to be
derrionstr.a.ted - .,. that the assembled hardware components will function as
a system with no more than minor modifications, thus satisfying condition
(ii).   There is, 'as yet, no information available on conditiCms (iii) and (iv)
since these are related uniquely to the geographic area within which a pricing
system might be imposed ..


Even if there were assurances that all these conditions could be met, the
wise investor in such an electronic· system would move with caution for a
number of reasons, and plan for an incremental implementation program".
These reasons are:

             (i)       It must be demonstrated in the field that the
                       electronic components assembled into a system do,
                       in fact, give satisfactory total system-performance.




(1)     See Appendix 9 wherein costs are presented for a "Plessey"
        system of automatic road pricing.




                                          -376-
               (ii)    It must be demonstrated that, when sµch a
                       system ·is used as a means of collecting money
                       from motorists, the electronic, administrative
                       financi?l and legal elements of the total system
                        can reach a satisfactory level of performance.
                       This c·ans for a demonstration that a motorist,
                       whatever his private opinion of the cha:rge in
                       principle, is satipfied that the bill he gets has
                       qeen calculated correctly and in the manner
                       laid down; that a motorist can change his name
                       or address, sell his car, change his registration
                        number, and so on without causing undue compli-
                        cations in the system, or hardship to others in
                       the community; that the enforcement systeni
                       can be seen to be fair an,d equitable; that the
                       government is satisfied that the money paid by
                       motorists is accrued in appropriate government
                       accounts; and so on.     it may be possible to
                       obtain a ·satisfactory level of performance by
                       careful system analysis in advance of implemen-
                       tation, but experience has shown that the results
                       require experimental validation. Such a vali-
                       dation could also act to test further the complex
                       _electronic road-pricing equipment. (1) .     .

               (iii)    It must be demonstrated that _road-user charges,
                       .particularly road-pricing charges, do have an
                        appropriately acceptable and predictable effect
                        on traffic flows within the CMA. This can best
                        be done through demonstration projects that
                        permit the public to assess the beneficial
                        consequences. (2) .    ·           .

               (iv)    The initial installation of the total electronic
                       system, including training and other mobilization·
                       costs, is high. l 3T It may be necessary therefore



(1)     The implementation of such a practical valuation scheme would
        be difficult ,to occasion in a manner. which is socially and
        politically acceptable.· In Norwich, England, the· locality would ·
      . only agree to act as "guinea-pigs" if all dues collected were
        recirculated to exactly those individuals from whence they origin-
        ate. Obviously they wnuld then pay no attention to the scheme,
        which would reduce the demonstration to a complete waste of effort;.

                            to spread the initial capital investment over
                            some years and at.the same time test road-
                            user reaction to.minimize risk.     Because the
                            basic effect of road-pricing on the economi~
                            behavior of the public may not .be as predicted,
                            and b.ecause the public's acceptability of it may
                            never be high enough to allow enforcement to be
                            effective at a reasonable cost, the.re is a finite
    /
                            risk that the scheme may be to be abandoned.
                            This of course will entail large losses since the
                            salvage value of the electronic equipment is small.


        Taking into account these four factors, it is suggested that a more modest
        pilot scheme be used as a test bed.·      In addition to low cost, the fundamental
        requirements of this pilot scheme would be that it is:

                    (i)     . Designed .to involve a large enough number of
                              motorists so tpat the effects of road-pricing on ·
                              traffic flows- in the _CMA are significant, and
                              easily perceived by the public;

                    (ii)     Efficient and' equitable; through-traffic, as well
                            'as trajfic terminating or otherwise circulating .
                             in the priced area, ·Should .be subject to the price.

                    (iii)   Flexible so· that changes in price, area, and
                            time period can, if necessary, be made easily.

                    (iv)     Capable of a smooth changeover to an electronic
                             road-pricing scheme.


        The first point is an   especi~lly   important one,   During the introduction
        period, there may he considerable public scepticism and resistance against
        any form of road-pricing.       This may cause high initial enforcement and
        public .education costs.    It is only through the_ public's perception -of the
        advantages
                .  in terms bf reduced travel times, easier
                                                       .
                                                              journeys,' and public
        :revenue generation that the cooperation of road users-, so essential in
        this project, can be achieved.


        A supplementary licence scheme. most .. appropriately meetE? this and the
        other.three requirements.       As estimated in Chapter 4. 8, the scope of such
        a supplementary licence scheme applied to the central business district
        would be sufficient to bring about, on average, \a doU:bHng o( speeds in



                                              -378-


I
the priced area, and a 15 percent average increase in speeds over the
metropolitan area.        Furthermore, through-traffic would be smbject to the
price sinc.e all vehicles (except buses) would be required to" show a .permit.
to be in the priced area;.· the price of the permit, the a.rea over which pricing.
would be. impose.a, and the times of day during which the scheme would be in
force~   could ·all be easily modified.      And a. smooth changeover to electronic
pricing would be :tnade possible by instaliing electronic equipment at the
access and egress points to the priced are.a so that vehicle owners could
elect to equip their     v~hiCles   with responder's in order to take advantage of
the incipient electronic scheme, obviate the need to show a permit,· and be
bille_d periodically.


Since the supplementary licence scheme satisfies the above requirements,
the· appropriate strategy would be to use this scheme to get the public
accustomed to road pricing, to investigate and detect imperfections in the
administrative and legal organization_ of it, and to demonstrate that road-
.pricing has' an acceptabie and predictable effect on the economic behavior
of the   trav~lling   public.


A possible ·time s.chedule for the implementation of road pricing(l) according
to. this strategy is shown in Figure 4: 12.·      This schedule assumes that the
government is interested in pursuing the idea of road pricing, and that the
 '           .    .
necessary ground work can be completed by the end of 1975 . . Such ground
work implies the passing of enabling legislation, the allocation of funds,
. and the setting up of the administrative organization.       About six months .
to one year should then be allowed for activities such as marking and signing
the priced area, ordering and printing permits, training enforcement and
a'dministrative I?ersonnel, and enlightening the public about the objectives of



 (1)     It would be likely to maximize the public acceptability of the
         scheme if the road pricirig-irnple·mentation schedule (road
         pricing would directly disadvantage Caraqueflo traveller.s)
         could be merged with the initiation program for the Caracas
         Metro (the latter would benefit Caraquefios directly).

The major uncertainty in this time s.chedule is the period required to 'pass
the enabling legislation.     However, experience to-date indicates that, with
a reasonable level of support by policy makers and legislators for the scheme,
three years should be adequate for this task.     For example, the enabling
legislation for the Metro Betterment Tax (Anteproyecto de la Ley que
A utoriza la Creaci6n de una Contribuci6n Especial para el Financiamiento
del Metro) may shortly receive Congressional approval after two          year~   of
preparatory work.     This important piece of legislation experienced some
considerable re·sistance at most levels of government including the municipal.
However, in spite of this, the Minister of Public Works steered the bill
through.the various procedural stages, prior to Congressional debate, in a
relatively short time.      Of course, if government support is not forthcoming
for road pricing, enabling legislation will never be obtained. (l)


As indicated in Section 4. 7, the road-pricing organization would be incorpor-
ated within the Metropolitan Transport Administration (Administraci6n
Metropolitana de Transporte - AMTC).         It is assumed in this study that the
organization would be established and operating prior to 197 5.


After implementation of the supplementary licence scheme, one of the first
activities should be to verify that the scheme works as predicted by the
methodology.    Section 4. 8. 2 discusses procedures to be used and data to be
gathered by the Planning, Policy and Research Department of the Road Pridng
Division in the A_MTC to validate the soundness of the supplementary licensing
scheme, and to effect any corrections or recalibrations of the methodology
to derive the optimum licence price to be levied.      In essence, this procedure
                                                           11
could consist of a "coarse-tuning" phase followed by a          fine-tuning" phase.

                                                                                      .. . 1


                                                                                          I
(1)    The support of the majority party· in Congress is also necessary;
       this party presently is not in executive control.

 This        coarse-tuning" phase emphasizes the collection of traffic-flow data
 to obtain, for instance, modal-split relationships, vehicle-occupancy factors,
 and travel volumes and speeds.               This post-facto knowledge on traffic
 behavior, after road pricing has been put into operation, could then ,be used
 to recalibrate the traffic model, and to derive an updated priced-area,
 optimal price, and daily duration of imposition.                  However, as explained
_ in Section 5.       2,   .the traffic model would at best only approximate reality.
                                                            11
 Therefore, it would be advisable to follow the                  coarse-tuning 1' phase by a
               11
 phase of           fine-tuning 1_', by experimenting on the system itself.       As discussed
 in Section 5. 2, this could be done by taking samples and _by comparing the
 actual marginal social costs with the congestion tax charged.                   If these
 agreed, the congestion tax would be optimal.                If there were a difference,
 a revised congestion tax would be introduced to reduce the difference.


 In addition to verifying the technological and economic variables and proced-
 ures used in the derivation of the optimal price, the enforcement concept
 should also be validated.             This function would also ----
                                                                  be pe_rformed by the
 statistical organization.            Figure 4. 13 shows the general validification
 process.            The first step would compare the observed traffic flows with the
 predicted _flows.            If these did not agree, it is suggested that, first of all,
 the enforcement concept and system be checked for proper operation.                        If
 there appeared to be enforcement problems, revisions should be designed
 and costed.           If the costs were reasonable and did not largely negate the
 benefits to be expected from the road pricing scheme, the revised scheme
 could then be introduced.             On the other hand, if it were determined that the
 enforcement scheme was functioning as expected, and violations were less
 than the planned level, the cause of any unexpected traffic flows would have
 to be sought in inadequacies of the methodology.


 If this were the case, the road-pricing organization would have to restructure
 and recalibrate the -traffic model and its data inputs in an effort to make the
 methodology produce results that corresponded closer to reality as observed
 after the introduction of road pricing.             Using the updated model, a revised
 optimal price level would be derived,               After checking that the resulting

benefits associated with the new price level were indeed in excess of the
costs of the system, the new price could be set.


Once the traffic flows were-observed to be close to those predicted by the
methodology (no exact rules Gan be given as to how close this agreement
should be since this could largely be a matter of judgment by those
involved in using and designing the traffic model), the "fine-tuning" phase
would begin.    The procedure to be used here is outlined in Section 5. 2.
With the initiation of this phase, a major milestone ~ould be reached in
that, basically, the idea of_ road pricing would be validated.      Thus, planning
for the more optimal electronic road-pricing· scheme could then begin.


As   mentioned previously in this section, electronic road pricing might ~e
introduced incrementally to the extent that it could replace the need for a
vehicle to display a supplementary licence permit provided that the vehicle
instead indicated that it was tied into the electronic scheme.       Vehicles so
. equipped would be charged once each day for crossing the priced area
boundary and cables would be installed to the road bed at access and egress
points.   This level of implementation would enable a considerable amount
of testing of the electronic equipment, billing procedures and so forth, to
be effected.   At" this early stage, the roadside unit would be kept as simple
as possible by relying on punched tape rather than cable transmission
equipment (although TRRL have found that existing punched tape equipment
is very unreliable when installed at the roadside).       Those motorists who
might wish to do so, mainly for reasons of eliminating the need to buy
stickers, could have their vehicle equipped with a responder unit.        The idea
Of USing Selected Or VOlUnteer motorists as   II   guinea pigs" to test Similar-
type systems has been used with success elsewhere.           For instance, the
San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District has
been carrying out field tests on an electronic bridge toll-collecting system
for the past two and a half years with the cooperation of selected motorists

    and vehicle owners.·


I   Furthermore, the New York Port Authority's interest in considering this
    toll collecting system for use on its bridges could lead to additional field
    experhnents of this type.



I   However, a more elaborate procedure would have to be employed if an
    electronic road pricing scheme were to be authorized over much of the
    metropolitan area's road network involving most resident vehicle owner·s
I   and drivers (with visitors using the supplementary licence permit).
    Figure 4. 12 shows the major activities l.nvolved in a full-scale implement-
I   ation scheme for electronic road pricing.             These consist of the preparation
    of the road pricing plan, the development and manufacturing of the hardware,

               pool vehicle,. etc.); and, when crossing an antenna, are charged
               accordingly, rates for cars being inversely related to the
               vehi~le occupancy category.     The charge is automatically sub-.

               devices indicate if the account balance is low, or if the vehicle
               is not equipped wi~h the responder unit. Attendants inspect
               vehicles to see that the number of occupants is consistent
               with the pre-declared category of vehicle.·

Also, by the year of 1977, a traff:Lc model should be s~fficiently developed
 capable of being instrumental in the general design of the electronic road-
 pridng plan within a period of one year. ,


The time required to equip the vehicles is more difficult to estimate with
 some precision.       In Appendix 9 it is assumed that the car manufacturers
·will be given notice well before electronic road pricing is to be put into
effect to make provisions on new cars for the subsequent installation of the
vehicle unit.       This can be done at minimal cost while cars are on the
assembly line.        Even so, it is estimated that only one-half of the car pop-
ulation may have the necessary attachmeht points installed by the time
electronic r·oad pricing starts; . and, for these, the· installation of the vehicle
units is estimated to be a.bout twenty minutes (estimates are provided by
                '                                         .                 '
TRRL, Plessey .and GE).         For the other 125, 000 older cars on the road,
the installation time will be about 45 minutes.          In total, the installation
time arrounts to 125, 000 x 1/3 + 125, 000 x 3/4 = 135, 400 man-hours, plus
a relatively small amount on the assem.bly line.              As with the installation
of smog devices in Los Angeles, California, the veqicle units could be
iristalled by semi-skilled labor such as is found in small garages and petrol
stations providing that security problems can be satisfactorily overcome.
In total, there are-·about 400 of these establishments in the CMA, and this
is deem-ed more than sufficient to enable instaUation of the devices within
one year.


With regard to roadside units,· it is estimated that 500 pricing points would
have to be installed in the road. bed.       However, for initial use to collect a
daily CBD charge, only 55 access lanes. would be equipped initially. As
indicated in Appendix 9, the installation time would be about 12 hours per
would be about 12 hours per pricing point.         In total, therefore, 55 x 12 = 60
mar1:-hours would be needed for tl:ie initial cordon installation, while the
remainder of the ..installation program required for foll switchover to
electronic pricing, involving 445 x 12       = 5, 340   man-hours of work, would be
spread over a subsequent period.         Using three teams; the installation of
the, roadside units for the initial cordon scheme should not take more than




                                     -386-
two months, while the fully developed scheme could be accomplished within
one year.


In sum, with dedicated support in at least one level of government, supple-
mentary licensing could be introduced and the concept validated by 1978.
Following this, electronic road-pricing could be gradually substituted for
the supplementary licenc;:e-scheme beginning early in 1979, with the sub-
stitution complete by the end of the year.    This would permit a switchover
·to pricing according to time-of-day.     Thereafter a gradual increase in
the number of pricing points would enable the system to have full areal
coverage by the end uf 1980.

CHAPTER 5:       COSTS, REVENUES AND BENEFITS OF THE
                 ENVISAGED SlJPPLEMENTARY LICENSING SCHEME



The previous chapter formulated a blueprint for a feasible supplementary
licensing scheme for Caracas.       This present chapter summarizes an
attempt to quantify in monetary terms the returns which are anticipated
to accrue from such a scheme.       Benefits are also presented for compar-
able schemes exhibiting variations in terms of extent of area covered and
the amount of the charge levied.     The costs of a much more   ~mbitious,

fully automatic, electronic road pricing syE?tem for Caracas are detailed
in Appendix 9.


When calculating returns one is inevitably confronted with the problem of .
to :whom it is that the returns should be calculated -- is one concerned with
just the public agencies which would be responsible for administering the
scheme and to which the revenues could accrue, or is one concerned with
the community as a whole?      Generally the accountant would constrain
himself to a consideration of the former financial balance whilst the
economist would accept the latter and broader horizon.     Tt is considered
that the economic definition should be .invoked when feasible schemes are
being evaluated so as to isolate the one which is the most beneficial.    To
do otherwise would inevitably lead to a biased answer - - one considerat;ion
as to what is a worthwhile scheme from A's standpoint would, be how much
it robs from B to allocate to. A.   Clearly, only when all A's and all B's are
considered can a fair recommendation emerge.       An economic cost-benefit
analysis attempts such an all-embracing evaluation.     The one reported
herein, however, does admittedly exclude many considerations for which
quantitative data were not readily available and therefore have been
excluded.   Nevertheless, jhis partial, and therefore probably biased
(on the conservative side)   analysis is more comprehensive than that which
was initiq,lly envisaged when the study was originally conceived.

differently those items which are common to each.       For instance, a
discrepancy can arise with respect to the .costs of printing the licence
permits..   In Venezuela profit margins are often high, at least partially,
because competition is low.      The accountant would accept as a cost to
the road pricing authority the lowest tender for printing services matching
up to the specified requirements.     The economist would delve further - -
the cost to the community would be a function of considerations such as
the extent to which the printer profits more than he would (if pressed)
settle for, what he chooses to do with the payment he receives, does he
enlist the services of under-nourished illiterates who would otherwise
be a burden on the community, does his shiny rtew printing press mean
that a farmer in the Llanos must do without an imported tractor which
could be used to utilize otherwise wasted land, and does he thereby pay
any extra in taxation.     Conventionally, most of these less superficial
considerations have had to be merely mentioned rather than evaluated.
Market prices have generally been taken to reflect real community costs.
The case for so doing may be greater in Venezuela than in some other
countries - - the economy functions. competitively (although social ramifi-
cations are not often reflected in pricing structures), no minimum wage
laws nor occupational entry prohibitions formally apply, ( 1 ) and taxes
for revenue-raising are largely obviated by dominance of oil production
(taxes from which make up around two-thirds of the exchequer's income
and other taxes that are levied can be argued to have economic as well        I
as financial rationale).
                                                                              l   I




( 1)   Informal constraints do prevail, however.     For instance,
       unionized labor in capital intensive industries often assume
       monopolistic powers; also the means used to allocate
       industrial development permits and import licences
                                                                              1'
       can militate against perfect competition.

5.1         COSTS

Market prices have been taken to reflect real community costs in view of
the limited resources that could be devoted to this study.              On this .
     '
assumption, aq.mittedly -a second-best situation, costs quoted below were
used for both economic·· cost-benefit calculation purposes and for financl.al
net revenue balance         ~alculations. (l) Since no supplementary licensing
sheme has ever been implemented, and since even those few cost estimates
which have previously been attempted are either unavailable or highly aggreg-
ative, certain stan.dard cost estimation procedures could not be employed.
It       is inevitable perhaps that the confidence   limit~   which shouJd be constructed
around the deduced estimates are quite broad.             However, it is believed that
the estimates are wholly adequate to meet the purposes for which they are
essentially required, i.e. to. assess the b.road economic and financial viab-
ility of the suggested system of supplementary licensing for Caracas.
Throughout the costing exercise, conservative assumptions have been .made
so as to counterbalance the exclusion of some individually insignificant but
in aggregate, possibly, quite numerous items.                 For instance, inconvenience
costs forced upon participants,        s~ch   as time spent in ·purchasing permits,
of relevance to the economic cost-benefit calculations, have not been
assessed.           These would, to some extent, counterbalance excluded benefits
such as those implied by a reduction of atmospheric pollution and by re-
adjust:ipents to land use patterns.


5 .1. 1       Costs of Administration Functions

The structural organization of the offices concerned with road pricing
administration, discussed in the previous chapter, indicated that the
personnel listed in Table 5. 1 would be needed to accomplish the admin-




(1)            The maximum conceivaele degree of pubiic participation has
             . been assumed so as to make the two cost definitions more
               closely coincide. · In reality such a high degree of public par-
               ticipation would be unrealistic and, thus, the .costs to be borne
               by the road pricing auth9rity would be less than those calculated.

             In addition to this ·there will be non-labor costs.         Computer time would

             functions,. updating operations an:d field survey data sifting.        At _the most,
             100 hours annually would be needed which would co~t. at standard Caracas
             rates, some Bs.100, 000.


             Accommodation would have to be provided.               For Appendix 9 . which describes
             the esti~ation procedure for the costing of a "Plessey" system of automatic
             road pricing, it was deduced that        a ratio   of 15 square meters per office-
             based employee would be required and that a typical unit cost of Bs. 20. 00
                                      ' ( 2)
             per month would apply.


             Usirig these rates, the accommodation costs for the administrative function
     \       would be:
                                     Bs.          (53) (15) (20) (12)    ~
                                     =         Bs. 190, 800 per annum.

             To this   s~m   an allowance for·office supplies should be added.        Bs.100, 000
             per annum would easily cover such needs and this amount is forward.ed into
             the eventual total.    Thus total accommodation and ancillary costs are

             (2)     In Caracas, air-conditioned offices of recent construction in
                     prime locations fetch up to Bs. 25. 00 per square meter per month .
                   . Non air-conditioned monthly rentals are some 10-12 percent less.

scooters.     Three four-wheeled vehicles and two scooters have been
allowed.     The fully inclusive annual costs of one of the former would be
(probably less than); Bs. 7, 500 and of the latter would be around Bs-. l, 200.
Thus the total annual costs for transport equipment and operation might
come to:
                        Bs.   ~   (3)   (7, 500)    + (2) (1, 200)
                                              (1)
                        =     Bs. 24, 900 •.

The total operating costs of the necessary administrative function can now
be summarized by adding together the annual cost components above.
These costs ·are thus:

                        Bs.   (1, a·o5, 700 + lOQ, 000 + 290, 800 + 24, 900) per
                                                                             annum
                        -     Bs. 2, 221, 400 per annum.

Associated with· administration there would be initially borne costs of a
·once-and-for-all nature when the scheme is brought into being.            For
instance, staff would have to be identified, recruited, and trained, and
accommodation would have to be acquired and prepared.                There would
also have to be a sizable public relations campaign to edu.cate the public
of the rationale for and the mechanics of the pricing scheme.            These
costs are not suitable for much more than intelligent guesswork .


. In. Appendix 9, estimates of similar cost items were developed for an
automatic point pricing system for Caracas.             These estimates are consid-
ered app~opriate also for initiating a supplementary license scheme.               Thus
Bs. 1 million was allowed for public education, 25 percent .of annual labor
costs was assumed to cover staff training, and 30 percent of office
accommodation and associated costs was allowed for other preparatory
operations.      These assumptiO.hs woul? imply initial costs of:

                                                                               i
    Within the general distributional set-~p de~.cribed in Section 4. 6 a large
    number of feasible proportionate allocatio~s between the public and the
    private sector could be envisaged,                The costs

    the maximum possible amount of public participation prevails.

    already been mentioned, a completely                  mis~eading                        picture could be painted
    of the economic rationality of road pricing/ by alternative assumptions that
    allow higher degrees of private participat:i!on whilst only the public elements
    ar·e costed.        If complete public operation lis adopted, costs appropriate
    for calculations pertaining to the net revenue balance of the road pricing
    authority most· closely approach true econ,bmk costs,....__although a gap would
    still remain.


    A large degree of public control could be necessary anyway so as ·to limit
                                                                       i

    In Section 4. 6. 4 it is reasoned that a           ma~imum of 440~r~tail outlets would
    probably be heeded             t~   serve the participJnts in the scheme if the outlets

Wholesale distribution has been considered to require some 10 outlets.
These would not need to occupy prime locations and thus should be available
-at rents of something like Bs .. 12. 00 per square meter per month or Bs. 144. 00
per annum.          They would probably need to incorporate some parking and
loading/ unloading bays and each might utilize some 200 square meters which
would incur a cost of some Bs. 35, 000 annually if an allowance ·for specialized

annually and respectively Bs. 20, 000, Bs.12, 500, Bs.18, 000, BS: 24, 000

(1)         The method of calculation by means of which th:ls cost item is
            assessed varies from that suggested in Section 4. 6. 2. since
            there is little reason why the retail sales and margin of ten
            percent mentioned therein would necessarily conform to re-a.lity .

     In adc:]ition to these service points there would have to be a central bonded

     rental might amount to Es. 24, 000.        Two armed guards would cost, say
                                                                                                      i

     additional security arrangements.         An annual cost of Es. 69, 000 is thus
     allowed.


     Because of the value of the supplementary license permits as liquid assets

     outlets would entail the serv.ices of an armored car company, of which there
     several in Caracas.      One of these companies, the_Servicio Pan Americana
     de Protecci6n, C. A., has quoted an upper limit equivalent to approximately
     Es. 25. 00 per distribution point for each permit deliverance/ revenue
     collection operation.    This cost would include ancillary tasks such as
     paying monies collected into a bank.           It was calculated that if each whole-
     sale distributor were to acquire their own van plus two extra security
     guards they could serve each of their retail outlets every other day at an
     equivalent cost of approximately 10 bolivares so that the latter would be
     likely to be the preferred arrangement for retail servicing.                The latter
     would also be more flexible insomuch that readily available spare capacity
     would be injected into the system to satisfy unscheduled calls for service
     from the retail outlets and so   on~



     If the armored car service were hired to link each.wholesaler to the central
     depot once a week, then the annual cost would be:

        If .each wholesaler were to enlist the services of two additional se.curity
        driver/ guards it might cost it some Bs. 40; 000 annually.            Allowing for
        some ·non-schedule calls, vehicle operational co·sts would not be more
        than Bs. 15, 000 per annum, implying that the total annual cost to each

        Thus the fully inclusive costs of transporting items between the central
        office, the wholesale distributors, and         th~   retail outlets would be:

                        Bs.          (14, 300) + (10) (Q5, 000)          per annum

                        =        Bs. 569, 300 per annum.

        Thus the total costs under the heading of distribution amount to:

                        Bs.      (3, 520 1 000 + 1, 773, 500 + 69, 000 + 569, 300)
                        =        Bs. 5, 931, 800


        5. 1. 3   Costs of Supplementary License-Permit Production

        The exact form of the license-permit has been left undecided even after
        the investigations     of this   study: it may be date-specific or it may be non-
        date-.specific~       The latter alternative would probably enable a more simple
I
I   I   system to be built around it but some minor developments in the field of
        chemical technology might be re quired before a wholly satisfactory variant
        could be made available.


        As a reference, license-permits which have been devised by the Westminster
        City Council for residents to pay for parking can be used.             These permits




        (1)       This estimate could err on the low side since the unitary cost
                  indicated by the armored car service applied to higher volume
                  operation.

                                                                                     \

                           car and upon which adhesive tabs or stickers are placed over dates when
                           parking space is bought.        The calendars cost E.i ( 200 + 0. 185x) fo-r a
                           quantity of x.       The tabs_ cosLL 2, 530 for the first 100, 000 and L 283-for
                           each subsequent batch of 100, 000. (l)          The permits for Caracas outlined
                           in Sections 4. 5. 7 and 4. 5. 8 would probably hot be more expensive than the
                           Westminster City Council calendars; thus the latter can be used as a useful
                           cost guide.      The Caracas permits, _however, would not use stickers so
                           the cost consideration can be discarded.             On the other hand, the cost of
                           Caracas permit-holders must be accounted for.


                           Assuming the number of vehicles participating in the Caracas scheme is
                           unlikely to exceed 100, 000, of which 75, 000 might enter the priced area on
                                                                                 I

                           accordingly, would imply an annual cost of:

                                            Bs.    (100, 000) (3. 00) (0. 33)

             · lf these costs are inclusive of delivery and so on, the total annual costs
              (during the initial year of operation) of permit and permit-holder production
              and supply would be about Bs. 2, 500, 000,               This cost estimate could be low
              for the envisaged Caracas road. pricing application given other local
                  considerations that -would c_ertainly tend to raise Venezuelan costs above
              those which apply in the F. K.             In Venezuela, safeguards against fraud
              would possibly have to be more rigorous and the printing industry is judged
              to have a somewhat higher cost structure.                 It was considered that an annual
                  cost estimate of Bs. 500, 000 would cover this cost increment thus giving a
              total cost for the production and supply of the permits and holders of
                  Bs. 3, 000, 000.


                  5. 1. 4    Enforcement Costs

                  The administrative        ~nd   supervisory tasks which are associated with enforce-
                  ment operations have already been costed under the heading of administrative
                  costs.     There is also envisaged to be a division of the enforcement function
                  which would actually impose the regulatory aspects of the system.               This
                  policing division is judged to comprise two supervisors, one secretary, six
                  inspectors'---and 70 enforcement officers.          The annual n~spective unitary wage
                  costs inclusive of overheads might be Bs. 39, 000, Bs. 26, 000; Bs. 32, 500 and
                  Bs.15, 000.     The total annual costs of the required labor complement would
                  thus be:

                                  Bs.   ~   (2) (39, 000) + (26, 000) + (6) (32, 500) + (70) (15, 000)
                                  ::;   Bs. 1, 349, 000.


                  The policing division of the enforcement function would need accommodation
                  and equipment, principally vehicles.             Accommodation and office supplies of
                  the unitary rates quoted earlier for each of the supervisors and the secretary
                  and for 0. 1 of the remainder of the complement would involve an annual
                  expense. of approximately Bs. 40, 000.


                  Each_ of the inspectors and each of the enforcement officers would need to be
                  equipped with a medium-sized motorcycle,               Assuming that four spares
                  would also need to be available the total requirement would be 90 cycles.

                    A Honda 450 equipped with two-way radio communication would involve an
                    annual cost of Bs. 3, 500 allowing for running expenses. ·The total fleet of
                    90 would thus cost Bs. 315, 000 per: annum.


                    The total al-i-nual operational costs of the policing division would thus be
                    Bs. 1, 704, 000.   But, in. addition, there would also be initial and non-recurrent
                    costs associated with staff enlistment and training.     These costs would be
                    likely to be more significant for the policing division than for most other
                    sections of the whole road pricing activity.    If they were to amount to
                    one-quarter of the annual operating costs, some Bs. 426, 000 would be
                    involved ..


                    5. 1. 5   Summary of Costs

                     It is believed that the most significant of the costs of supplementary licensing
                     have been consid.ered in the foregoing paragraphs.      Some have been admit-
                     tedly omitted either because they are expected to be relatively insignificant,
                     such as thecosts associated with any necessary road signs and other street
                     furniture, or because their magnitude is extremely uncertain, such as
                     the costs of getting any amendments to the law to enable the implementation
                     of road pricing through. the relevant legislative channels. (l)   There are
                     compensating benefits which have been correspondingly left unquantified.

                     compoqent has been quite liberally estimated.      There need be no margin
                     to cover risk elements.     The magnitudes of the respective admitted omissions

         To an accountant or a city manager, or even the politician, benefit is

         often thought of in terms of revenue; and, together with a different
         definition of cost, leads to different priteria. Measurements of welfare-
         changes indicate the extent to which society is better (or worse) off;
         while measurements of revenue-chahges reflect how much better (or

adopted in tJ;iis study, confines itself to dealing with a fixed aggregate de-
mand for trips by all modes between origins. and destinations; and within
this context, calls for the simulation of changes in travel behavior, and
corresponding estimates of net benefits derived, that would       li~ely   result
from the imposition. of a range of increasing congestion charges levied on
highway travel, or portions of it, in the city.       Since the optimal economic
usage of the highway network would maximize related net benefits, the
charge imposed that appears to provoke the maximum net benefits would
be the charge, at least in theory, capable of engendering optimal economic
flows on the highway system as constrained by the maximum potential of
the pricing scheme.     In this study, the range of net benefits provoked by
the imposition of the increasing charges were derived from an. apprecia-
tion of changes in the utilization of the highway network over the whole of
the CMA ...and not just over the pr:j.ced area. (l)


. This section discusses the results and related analytical work undertaken
to calculate the net benefits used initially to identify the optimal charge
levels (with and without the Metro in 1971) noted elsewhere in this Tech-
                   2
nical Supplement. ( ) It also does likewise with regard to the net benefits
that would be implied were daily supplementary license charges levied on
road use throughout the CMA (also in 1971 but only with the Metro assumed
to be in service).   The CMA exercise, though extreme in its physical
scope, was conceived to provide a rough comparative measure of the
benefit consequences of imposing a charge over an area very much larger,
and on average much less congested, than the CED, and the comparison
of these two alternative (CED and CMA schemes, and the effect of the
presence or lack of presence of the Metro, in terms of benefit magnitudes,
is dealt with herein.   In the next section, Section 5. 3, benefits are re-
lated to costs to obtain a rough-order-of-magnitude indication of the eco-
nomic justification of the CED and CMA pricing schemes; while the sub-
sequent section, Section 5. 4, takes -ci.n overall look at the revenues
                                        -

  5. 2. 1   The Components of Benefits

  Any procedure that might be selected for developing benefit estimates in this
_ .study would inevitably encounter some limitations in the ability to quantify
- components.         Two of these limitatioQS are worth making explicit;

               (i)    The benefits which were able to be quantified
                      do not include all of those which should, in
                      an ideal world with unlimited study-resources
                      be quantified: those benefits which have not
                      been quantified have been described but they
                      cannot be directly compared with those which
                      have been quantified;

               (ii)    it need not be true that the weighting which the
                       economist would freely assign to various benefit
                       and cost components is the same as that of the
                       policy-maker who must decide eventually whether
                       the suggested scheme is worthwhile by his inter-
                       pretation of the Caracas context; it is no~ always
                       admitted by the economist that what is "optimal
                       resourcn rllocation 11 is something that society must
                       decide.


 ·In view of these limitations, the approach which was adopted to assess a
  scheme 1 s worth in terms of benefits relative to the status quo (of no scheme)
  was designed to accommodate the assumption that the sum of the non-quantified
  benefits implicit in each particular scheme is positive; and furthermore,
  in comparing alternative schemes shown to be worthwhile, that the absolute
  difference between omitted benefits and omitted costs is invariant between
  schemes: or, at least, that any variation in su·ch a difference can be
  discarded as being insignificant.       .Though such an approach is not fully
  satisfying, it was thought that its application was justifiably worthwhile.


  The transport model which was used in this study was quite simple and




  (1)       It would be ideal if society, in the guise of its political appointees,
            could dictate to the economist the preferred set of weightings. This
            situation was lacking in the case of this study, as it usually is from
            other studies.    Consequently the economist is left to develop his own
            interpretation of what the goals of society are.

                     conveniently disposed of any need to delve into the benefit implications of
                     travel generation and reorientation in either time or space.         Time and
                     resource constraints precluded the· inclusion of some considerations which
                     are effectively implied by the model used.       These latter consider.ations are
                     principally: (a).. the effect of pricing upon Caraquenos in capacities other
                     than those involving vehicular transportation, e.g. ariy reduction of the toxidity
                     of the air in urban streets is not counted; and (b) the general equilibrium
                     effects of the impact of pricing working its way through the Venezuelai:
                     econorr1y, e.g. no allowance is made for the     ~ifferential   utility value of any
                     fuel, subsequently not consumed by commuting cars, relative to its apparent
                     resource value as reflected in its money price.


                     The components which are included in the economic benefit estimates are:

                                (i)     the costs of travellers 1 time;

                                (ii)    the costs of operatives' time;

                                (iii)   the physical costs of marginal vehicle use,
                                        e.g. the value of tire-wear and fuel consumed
                                        by an extra kilometer travelled by a private car;

                                (iv)    (in one of the evaluation procedures only -- the
                                        consumer surplus procedure) a value which
                                        travellers individually attribute to subjective factors
                                        such as the status conferred by driving to work and
                                        the perceived dislike of the alternative which might
                                        be imagined to involve less comfortable seating or
                                        even standing, or even a distaste for having to share
                                        a crowded bus with persons not of ones own choosing.

                     Quite obviously these components alone cannot allow anytMng but a partial
                     assessment of benefits.      The specific values which were assigned to each
                     item in each category of benefits are fully listed elsewhere.

   surplus (CS) and cost differences (CD).      Though the CS   procedt~re   is the
   more accepted one, its application alone would .have brought about the
   incorporati6n into the benefit evaluation certain technical discrepancies
   consequent upon data deficiencies specific to this study: and furthermore
  would als'o have implied just one, and only one, set of weightings that
   society may care to apply to different benefit components.       While it is not
   claimed that either one of the two procedures implies a set of weightings
          '           .
   that is· actually preferred by society -- the preferred set may lie within
   the) bounds delineated by each of the two procedures -- it is claimed that,
  · aside from technical discrepancies, the range of benefits implied puts the
  ·present state of the practiced science of benefits evaluation into perspective. (l)


   Both CS and CD calculate in exactly the same way the benefits on account of
   those travellers who do not change 'mode (as a result of the imposition of
   the supplementary license charge). These benefits are simply the excess
   or' the resource costs of travel( 2 ) in the "null" situation without supplementary
___ ·licensing over.the resource costs of travel with the supplementary license
   charge set at that level for which benefits are being calculated - - the· "tef;lt"
   situation.     With CD, the benefits on account of travellers who do change
   mode are calculated in an identical manner, i.e., the excess of resource
   costs in the null situation over the resource costs in the test situation.         Thus,
   with CD, total benefits are equal to the difference between the total estimated
   resource costs of travel in the null situation and the same in the test situation.


   With CS, the benefits on account of.travellers who do change mode between
   the null situation and the test situation are calculated on a different principle.

              cedures and presents results in some detail for a typical 1971

              cedur.es can be found in standard reference works.

price ·per p. c, u. trip of approximately Bs. 2. 00 when the CBD alone is
priced .and Bs. 1. 25 .when the whole CM.A is prked (and por p~estos and
taxis are exempted). (l)      A disaggregation of these: estimated benefits
indicates that those who adhere to any one mode gain fro.m faster sp~eds
and higher' public transport frequencies as the price level is raised, but at
a decreasing rate.       However, the consumer surplus methodology considers·
that there are large losses created when consumers are induced to shift from
their initiallychosen mode only at very high price levels and these losses
eventually swamp the benefits to mode-adherers.
                                                                                        I
This situation can be visualized in a manner which may increase its level
.or plausibility.    As more and more (car) traffic is removed from the streets,
the potential for further journey- speed improvements is, to an increasing
extent, effectively bounded· by the exogenous constraints of speed limits,
                                         .                               I

to gain these smaller and smaller marginal improvements it becomes

necessary to divert from the car mode (arid the PPT ·mode in tbe cases of
CBD pricing), persons who have greater and greater marginal preferences
for such a means of conveyance.


Since it can be assumed that the costs of     imposi~g   supplemeq.tary licensing
upon any given area.l extent are quite insensitive to the actual level of price

which is charged (over any feasible range),: the price at which gross benefits
are maximized is also the price at which net benefits (i.e. after allowing
fol;'   costs) are maximized~    The operating costs of a scheme for the CBD
can be     assum~d   to be somewhat insensitive .also to the existence or other-
wise of the Metro.       Thus it would appear that the net benefits as well as
the gross benefits of pricing would be the lesser if the Metro were not to be

Persons travelling by Metro would stand to gain nothing from road pricing
through decreased travel times, but would, moreover, stand to lose since
comfort standards would be reduced by a tendency towards greater over-
crowding.       And, in addition, one would judge that the potential benefits
wo-uld be greater without a Metro on the grounds that the Metro, even in
the absence of road pricing, would accept some erstwhile roa.d-borne traffic
and (as simulated by the transport model used at any rate) wquld consequently
lead to an amelioration of road conditions.                 If road conditions are amelio-
rated, the less is the inefficiency of average cost pricing, and the less is
the need for marginal cost pricing . . These a priori reasons for an expect-
ation of greater benefits iri the situation without a Metro are seemingly
quite. robust and would only be countered in exceptional circumstances.


The reason for the opposition between the ex post findings and the a priori
logic is largely attributab.le to the necessarily somewhat approximative
nature of the speed-flow procedure upon which the benefit calculations depend.
Speeds throughout the CMA average 29. 12 kph without the Metro and ?9:. 60 kph
with the Metro, each at the zero price level according to the simulation·
procedure.        From the former condition, pricing at Bs. 1. 25 and Bs. 2. 50
respectively, is estimated to result in improvements of 1. 83 kph and 3. 07 kph .
Pricing has equivalent amelioratory effects of .2. 67 kph and 3, 90 kph in the




(1)      It must be stressed that the benefits-calculation procedure
         was designed to indicate the optimal policy assuming a fixed
         stc;tte regarding the exi9tence or otherwise of the Metro and  .
         not to permit cross-comp8:risons over different network extents.

( 2)     ThiS indication of higher benefits in the situation with the
         Metro does not apply to excessive and ultra-optimal price levels
         where the expectation of higher benefits in the situation without
         the 'Metro is borne out.

the Metro as a percentage of that without the Metro is apparently 137 percent
from the initial      Bs~   1. 25 of price and 1.20 percent Bs. 1. 25 from the first

conditlens but coµld simply indicate the non-precise properties of the speed-

would actually be greater without the Metro is unshaken by the production of

apparent         evidence" to the contrary.       It must be remembered that benefits
estimation is an inexact science which draws upon the input. of the results of
the inexact s.ciences of demographic and economic forecasting and allocation,
travel network representation, and travet behavior simulation..              Each succes-
sive stage of the study process. can lead to error compounding of a multi-
plicative nature.


Table 5. 3, as well as -implying that benefits without the.Metro could be less
than benefits with the Metro, also indicates that gross benefits Le. before
allowing_for system operating costs, could be greater in the peak hour (but
not however throughout tne day or year) were the whole CMA priced than
were the CBD alone isolated for treatment.               This indication, which is ba:cked
up by th.e results of the CD calculations is confused somewhat by the pricing
of por puestos and taxis-only when the CBD is priced, but, again might be
sttrprising at first glance.         Perhaps one would anticipate -that, since it is
apparent from the graphics and discussion of Section 2. 3. 3 on speed-flow

relationships and tabulations in Section 4. 4 that serious congestion does not
presently prevail outside of the priced area (and a finger-like extension
towards Chacaito), in most of the CMA the diversion of a trip from car to
public transport would involve a significant cost to the trip-maker himself
because of a relatively low level of public transport service and would not--
benefit anybody else very much since travel speeds are not too bad anyway.




(1)       As can be discerned from a glance at Section2. 3, the speed-
          flow e·quations as input to the simulation procedure allows
          large changes in traffic volumes at high volume levels without
          an:y effect at all on the estimated travel speed.

In this instance, the inference to be drawn from Table 5. 3 may be fully,
·consistent with actuality.   The present incidence of marginal vehicle
taxation averages something like one centimo per kilometer whereas
Table A 12. 5 of Appendix 12 shows that such ·a low level is less than that
necessary for._optimality tn almost any part of Caracas in the peak hour.
However, one can but be impressed by the somewhat large mean speed
increase from 29. 60 kph, to 34. 68 kph, as the first Bs. 1. 50 of price is
      . . ( 1)
levied.


Benefits per diem would be a relatively low multiple (versus the numbers of
hours involved) of benefits per morning peak hour.        Using the model
developed as described in Appendix 12, one can show that were optimal
prices to be levied continuously the benefits to be derived, per kilometer,
from a typical three-lane facility would be Bs.1, 593, Bs. 320, Bs·.128; :Ss. 27
and Bs. 0 per hour depenc;ling upon whether the initial speed in kph was 5, 10,
15, 20, or 25 plus, respectively.        If the prices were to be optimized for the
5 kph condition_ and allowed to remain fixed at the resultant _levels for higher
initial speeds then losses in efficiency wouid be generated at least at some
of these higher speed levels.
                                --   Clearly, then, the optimal prices for the
                                              .

peak hour would not generate the same flow of benefits at all other times of
                                                                            .



the d:;iy, and could indeed, for some perioc]s, lead to a situation being
created worse than that which occurs under the prevailing average cost
pricing regime.      The amounts of the charges suggested as being appropriate
throughout the day are slightly lower than those indicated as being approphate
from the pe;:i.k hour analyses to allow for the slightly less intense travel
demands in the CBD in other hours of the day.         This implies some sac:;rifice
of peak hour benefits to reap greater day-long benefits, but it remains true




(1)       If zero-price flows are such that the location oq the speed-
          flow line is at t):i.e junction between the horizontal section and
          the steeply negatively s-loped section, a small decrease in flow
          cari very significantly affect speeds.      However, any change
          from a higher flow level need have no estimated ·effect on speeds
          at all.  CMA pricing may be generally associated with the former
          situation, whereas CBD pricing may be assoGiated with the latter.

                      demands would be much less intense than at peak times.                             For several
                      reasons, these benefits can be considered to be minima.

     central London(l) reached a similar conclusion and indeed this study
     inferred that maximum benefits coincide with no car traffic at all even
     ignoring any broader environmental benefits.        There is a noticeable
     trend towards the partial or   f~ll   exclusion of car traffic from many city
     centers throughout the world:- such exclusion is fact in parts of Vienna,
     Florence·, Leeds and Gothenberg: and is planned for San Diego for instance.


     However, it is indicated that marginal benefits in Caracas per increment
     to the price level do decrease in a monotonic fashion.       For instance, when
     the price level is raised from zero to Bs. 1. 25, the benefits generated by
     each trip which is occasioned to change mode with CED pricing, and with
     the Metro extant, amounts to Bs. 3. 50, but this amount declines to Bs. 0. 50
     -for each trip so diverted wheri the price charged reaches a level of between
     Bs. 5. 00 and Bs. 7. 20.   Thus, benefits may be maximized at some non-
     infinite price level, although a complete ban on car traffic might be socially
     preferred to a situation which allowed only a privileged few into the CBD.

'
     However, one would suppose thgt exceptional categories, such as police
I                                                          2
     cars, could hardly be exciuded from .CBD road-space. ( ) Such exceptional
!
     categories are not weH-handled by the transport model - - they effectively
     have no alternative mode unless motorcycles are considered, and would
     carry a very high time value.         Their demands would be quite as insensitive
     to price as those of goods vehicles.




     (1)    Webster and Oldfield, Op. Cit. The London study concluded
            that using a methodology akrn to the cost differences procedure
            used in this present study, for an area of 32.4 square kms. in
            central London, annual benefits· of t., 26. 27 million would accrue
            if half of the present car travellers could be persuaded to travelby
            bus and that annual benefits of E, 37. 38 million would be garned
            if all of the present car travellers could be so diverted.   With
            methodology akin to the consumer surplus procedure used in
            this present study, diversion to bus would result in annual
            benefits of t., 35. 40 million whereas maximum benefits of
            E, 14. 15 million would accrue with an intermediate amount of
            restraint.

     ( 2)   The transport model does not recognize any such exceptional
            categories: all cars are implied to be used by commuters.



                                            -422-
With this methodology, as with the previous one, benefits when the CED
only is priced, at a level of Bs.1. 25 per p. c. u. trip, appear to be greater
with the Metro than without it.     However,, this inference has already been
reversed by the time that theprice level has reached Es. 2. 50, whereas
with the CS procedure this seemingly logical situation does not occur until
a higher price is charged.      It can be discerned from Appendix 2 that the
benefits on account of faster movement to those travellers who do not change
mode because of pricing, which benefits are calculated in the same way
with both consumer surplus arid cost differences procedures are greater with
the Metro at a price of Es. 1. 25 but have become greater without tJ;ie Metro
by the time that the price level has.reached Es. 2. 50.


Wit~in   the price range of up to at least Es. 3. 00 per p. c. u. per trip, the
gross benefits indicated from the pricing of the entire CMA exceed the bene-
fits from confining pricing to the CED alone (but only in peak conditions).
As with the CS procedure, it seems that such a condition does not hold at
higher levels of price at which a priori, and possibly presumptive, reasoning
would seem to be borne out.


Using the CD procedure, annual benefits at the price levels which are suggested
as being appropriate in Chapter 4 would be, approximately, Bs. 41. 5m
with no Metro, and Es. 43 m with a Metro, when the CED alone is priced.
If the whole CMA were priced, benefits would be Es. 35m.         or thereabouts
at similar price levels.·    In each case maximal quantified benefits are much
higher at higher price levels than these.


Thus, with the CD procedure, benefits continue to rise with the price charged
beyond the pOint at which they commence to fall as calculated using the CS
procedure.     The re_ason for this is that the perceived subjective preferences
of travellers are not acknowledged using this procedure, while they ,are
acknowledged in the CS procedure.        Clearly, the losses due to the failure
to satisfy these preferences represent ever increasing per capita costs as
prices rise and the more wealthy are forced out of their commodious auto-
mobiles.     In the CS procedure, these losses comprise the cost component




                                     -423-
·that is largely responsible for the dedine of benefits after the optimal
 price level is reached.


 5. 2. 5~ Comparison    of the   Benefits Ppedicted to Accrue in
Caracas versus Those Previously Calculated to Accrue from
Supplementary Licensing in Central London

Supplementary licensing has been previously appraised for application
to Central Londo'n. (l)    The methodology by means of which the traffic
 implications were simulated, and many other matters affecting direct
 comparability, varied between that study and the one described herein.
 For instance, in the London study repercussions away from the priced
 area, which was much larger than the Caracas CED, were hot quantified .


. In the London study, the statement of benefits per kilometer of roadway
 covered by the scheme was suggested as a means of comparison.              Using
 this comparative measure . benefits during the peak hour were maximized
 at a level of L 4.-63 per kilometer of (major and minor) road within the
 area isolated for licensing.       In 1966, the year to which these benefits
 apply; L 4. 63 per kilometer        Es. 55. 56 per kilometer.


 In Caracas, the peak hour benefits from CED supplementary licensing '
would be approximately Bs. 11, 000, by the CS methodology, assuming the
 existence of a Metro.     In the CED alone, there are approximately 68
                                                                                       I
 kilometers of roadway of all types and thus the benefits per kilometer
would be of the order of Es. 161. 7 5.         It might be expected that the Caracas
 figure should be the greater of the two on account of the inclusion in the            :
 Caracas estimate of any benefits which may accrue outside of the priced
 area itself, but then much greater time values were used in London which
would pull in the opposite direction.          A somewhat dampened differential
 is presented i.f benefitE? are expressed P.er kilometer of main roads only,
 i~   e. Es. 500 per kilometer in Caracas versus Es. 357. 46 per kilometer in

    London.     In Caracas, the benefits per kilometer. of roads in the CMA
    network for CMA pricing are maximized at Bs. 19.14.         This estimate may
    be considered to be more comparable with that implied by the London
    estimates because it does not associate with CED road space any benefits
    actually accruing· elsewhere and is quite consistent with the London equiva-
    lent of Bs. 55. 56 when acknowledgement is paid to the fact that the Caracas
    study time values are much lower than those used in London (the actual
    degree to which they are lower varies between modes), different levels of
    pre-existing congestion, different elasticities of demand to price, the
    lower vehicle operating costs in London, different speed-flow relationships,
    different categories of vehicles subjected to pricing, and so on.


    An alternative means of comparison, which has the. intrins'ic ability to
    somewhat nullify some confusing aberrations such as the effects of
    variations in the capaeity and degree of usage able to be squeezed from
    each kilometer of roadway, is to express benefits as ·a ratio of the pre-exist-
    ing, i.e. before pricing, traffic volume.     In Central London, the peak
    hour benefits of Bs. 20, 125 were generated from 213, 903 pre-existing
    vehicle m-iles, equal to approximately 513, 367 pre-existing p. c".. u. kilometers,
    in 1971, would have been 808, 594 p.'c. u. kilometers were a Metro to have
    been operative, in the peak hour, which would yield benefits of approximately
    Bs. 16, 000.     Thus, in London, each pre-existing p. c. u. kilometer yields
    Bs. 0. 0392 of benefit; in Caracas the equivalent ratio is Bs. 0. 0197.    The
    difference between the London ratio and that for Caracas is well within the
    range of variation introduced by the differences in time values used.


    5. 3   THE RELATIONSHIP OF BENEFITS TO COSTS

    The primary purpose in the calculation of benE:fits was the derivation of the
    optimal price which should be charged.      Neither benefits nor costs have
    been calculated in a manner exhaustive enough so as to allow a wholly
    meaningful:- ;:issessment to be made of the degree to which the supplementary
                -
    licensing variants tested are worthwhile.     This state of affairs is quite
    typical of quantified cost: benefit analyses, the objectives of which are
    sometimes explicitly denoted as being to attempt to prove that benefits



                                        -425-
at least outweigh costs, the exact quantification of the degree of excess
being of secondary importance.         Such an objective was adopted for the
cost:benefit analyses of this study.


5. 3. i--   Compariso.n of ·Quantified Benefits and   C~sts(l)
The previous section of this chapter presented the results of calculations
to estimate the benefits which would have accrued in 1971 were the CBD
                                                                               2
then to have been subjected to supplementary licensing.          The estimates( )
totalled Bs.17 million and Bs.15-1/2 million depending upon whether or
not the Metro is assumed to have been operational.          The corresponding
annual costs whic}J. were summarized earlier came to approximately
Bs.13 million, with an additional Bs. 2 million being allowed for non-.
recurrent costs associated with the installation of the pricing scheme.
With no Metro, annual benefits would exceed annual costs by Bs. 2. 5 million:
With the Metro extant, ~nnual net benefits wouldbe about "Bs~ . 4. 0 mfllion
It is not pretended these figures have great significance for there are.
admitted omissions from both the benefit and the cost sides of the balance
sheets.       Om~ssions   from the benefit side indud,e gains which persons,
transferred from cars to other modes by pricing, e_njoy because they save
on car operating costs _over and above the extent that they imagine that they
do because they underestimate the real costs of running their cars.         Though
these "imperceived benefits" have theoretical validity, they are rarely
             3
acknowledged( ) and were excluded from the principal results presented in
this study. However, when roughly quantified, ( ) it w~»uld seem that their
                                                4

inclusion would raise the total estimated benefits by approximately 25 percent.




(1)         The distinction between benefits components and costs compo-
            nents is somewhat hazy in this study: a cost is a negative benefit.

  ---------------------------------                                         ------- -----~-




An increase in estimated benefits would also be occasioned by adoption of
the CD calculation procedure, and hence, it is presumed, by CS calculations
acknowledging varying marginal income utilities· and/or the superimposition·
of society-decided priorities upon the more superficial of individual desires.
At the suggested price levels an excess of benefits over cqsts for the CBD
scheme would be Bs. 29. 5 million (with no Metro) or Bs. 31. 0 million
(with a Metro).


5. 3. 2   Allowance for Unquantified Benefit and Cost Items

Many other considerations of relevance to the benefits stream could not be
quantified, even :;i.pproximately.    These exclusions are:

            (i)      environmental impp.ct of pricing on noise levels,
                     atmospheric pollution, etc.;                 (+.)

            (ii)     effect on road safety;                        ( ?)

            (iii)    effect on land-use patterns;                  (+)

            (iv)     effect on diurnal distribution of trips;      (+)

            (v)      effect on transport structure, e.g.
                     por puesto system;                            (?)

           . (vi).   effect on marginal employment;                (-)

            (vii)    inflationary impact;                          (+)

            (viii)   net revenue accrual to public agencies;       (+)

            (ix)     effect on car-ownership;                      (+)

            (x)      impact of release of cars for usage
                     by non-CBD commuters;-                        (?)

            (xi)     effect on road construction program;          (+)

            (xii)    conservation of oil resources;                (+)

            (xiii)   effect on job accessibility;                  (+)

It would not be dHficult to extend this listing, but as it stands it is sufficient
to cause the quantified benefits to be·set back into an adequate perspective.
The bracketed signs after each listed item denote the direction in which the




                                     -427-
inclusion of the item could move estimated benefits.       1   That the ov.er.all
movement would be in the upward direction seems certain, items (i),
                                                                                         '   \
 (viii) and (xi) being likely to be especially iµfluential.     An implication of
the quantification of these items would be a probable raising of the estimated
 price level.


However, it is believed that significant costs items have remained unquanti-
fied too.    These are further believed to tend to counter rather than. to
·bolster the expansion of benefits beyond those quantified..         The most signifi-
 cant exclusions from the costs side are (i) the costs of the legislative
machinery to clear the way for the implementation of road pricing,            ~nd

 (ii) the inconvenience and time costs imposed on parti~ipant motorists.
There are other costs considerations of importance, however, such as the
 consequences of utilizing unskilled labor for permit distribution operations,
 and the cost of gathering any extra amounts of litter generated by the_ discard
 of spent permits.


 Efficient retail outlets for the distribution of license-permits have been
 assumed and costed for the inconvenience of'each purchase to be much less·
 significant than the inconvenience· of paying a gas or electricity bill, for
 i"nstance. (l)   However, the frequency at which the latter tasks are necessary
 is .very much lower.     But it would be true that   participant~   in the pricing
 scheme
  ,
  ..
        would be free to buy permits at times when it was relatively
 convenient for them to do so, and persons with generally high time values
 could delegate the purchasing operations to those having a lower time value,
 such as office   messengers~    It would be surprising if some of the unskilled
 labor currently trading with the captive occupants of cars in slow-moving
traffic, or peddling lottery tickets, newspapers, and shoe-shine services
wou.ld not choose to divert to selling-permits, maybe while still adhering to
. their current means of livelihood.     Such would very much reduce the




 (1)     Four hundred and forty outlets have been allowed to provide
         re:tail service versus 36 pharmacies required to accommodate

The costs associated with any legislative amendments could be variously
calculated to ·be quite high, if one accounted for the wages of the counci_l
members concerned, or quite low, if         th~.   road pricing legislation were to
displace marginal or ultra-marginal alternative activities.           There would
also be other costs associated with the public debate before the scheme
    (

became legally and administratively feasible'.           Much press, radio and T. V.
coverage could be anticipated.      However, it could be contrarily argued
that suc;h debate would raise the degree of awareness of the Caraquefi.os in
matters of local policy so that benefits would be generated to compensate
fo:r ahy such costs.


Thup, in summary, although there are ad_mittedly items of importance on
both the benefit ,:;i.nd the cost sides of the balance sheet which have gone
unquantified, it is much more likely that the net effect of all excluded items
would be to contr:~bute to~ rather than to detract from, the viability of
supplementary licensing.       An exhaustiv.e investigation into the relevant
magnitµdes would be likely to be rewarding although

of the balance between benefits and costs would enable the maximum advant-
age to be squeezed out of a principle which it is believ·ect to possess some

5. 3. 3   Ari Extension of the Pricing Scheme Beyond the CBD

· Cqrisidering quantified benefit's in the peak hour, pricing of the whole CMA
would appear to be more prodl].ctive than pricing of the CBp alone.            With
CMA pricing, benefits, calculated using the CS procedure, total Bs. ln, 000
per peak hour and   as ·much   as Bs. 22, 000 if irhperceived benefits are
admitted,    Using the CD calculation procedure,. the         est~mated   benefits come
to Bs. 35, 000,   It has been assumed that such a wide spfead of pricing
activities would yield no improvement above the status quo during inter-
peak periods since it would occasion changes in travel ·behavior in outlying



                                    -429-
areas which are not warranted at the levels of traffic intensity prevailing
in those areas outside of peak hours.      Such an assumption would be
excessively conservative, and it would certainly decline in validity if the
area encompassed by pricing were to be reduced so as to exclude·those
areas where congestion has little significance   und~r   present conditions.
It would also lose validity if the pricing system were to allow lower charges
during the inter-peak periods compared with the peaks.


Any extension of the scheme beyond the CBD would generate complications,
however, especially those associated with the provision of exceptional
arrangements for residents' parking and, in all probability, the ·need to
acco_mmodate any complaints from economic activities, such as the retail
trade, that unfair discrimination is implied.     Nevertheless, one of the
attractions of the supplementary licensing scheme, although more particularly
associated with automatic ·off-vehicle recording variants of road pricing,
is the prospect of ec·onomies of scale.     Some of the costs components:; and

                                                      --
especially those associated with .administration and distribution, would· be
   .

quite' insensitive to the extension of the priced area beyond the   confine~   of
the CBD.   Permit production also exhibits substantial scale economies
leaving only enforcement as beirig very much affected.       Since enforcement
accounts for only some 13 percent of the total costs of the CBD scheme,
some ' extension could be worthwhile
                                 .   before the tendency
                                                .        of enforcement costs
to vary with the area encompassed becomes dominant.      Figur·e 5. 3 illustrates
schematically a hypothesis concernirig the net benefits which might accrue
from various areas of pricing encompassment.


5. 4   SYSTEM REVENUES

A consideration of the benefits generated by the imposition of a supplementary
licen~e charge, while being an important determinant in the decision-making
process to implement a pricing scheme, would not exclude from the process
a consideration of the magnitude of the revenues that would be obtaip.ed.
It can be argued that the higher the revenue intake, the higher would be the
comprehensive economic benefits of supplementary licensing since public

             control over national expenditure would be thereby increased which, in
             turn, would heighten the probability that spending patterns would be allocated
             in a manner more in keeping with the objective of national well-being. (l)
             This consideration is oftef!_ overlooked but is of importance.   The theory
             of road pricing implies that in urban areas at optimal pricing patterns,
             and with optimal investment programming, a surplus revenue would be
             generated.


             Actually, ceteris paribus, the pricing scheme could be pushed to produce
             more of a surplus of revenue than would be wanted on strict partial analysis
i
             terms, simply because the surplus revenues could be used to reduce other
!
             tc;i.xes having a greater baneful effect on the economy.   These revenues
             would be quite progressive in their incidence, on the whole.     They would
             have a low marginal cost of collection, and a much smaller impact on the
             economy.     In the U. K. a reduction of fuel taxes would, of course, be the
             ideal use for the surplus revenues if the pricing were widespread enough
                                         ---           .
             so that the marginal cost of traffic in the unpriced areas were to be generally
             below the levels of the present fuel taxes.   In Venezuela the lo~er level
             of fuel taxes is less conducive _to this ideal use of excess revenues, but
             even so there would seem to be some excuse for using the road pricing
             revenues raised in the Capital city as part of the general national revenue
             to help redress the tendency of the Caracas economy to exploit the rest
             of the country.


             But aside from these economic implications of the road pricing revenues,
             the financial implications themselves are important to public accounting
             authorities and to politicians.




             (1)   '"Revenue-benefits" could. alternativ·ely be represented in the
                     guise of a reduced taxation intake from other sectors of the
                     economy if it were considered that the nationwide net revenues
                     should be unaltered by the intro,duction of road pricing.

5. 4. 1       Revenue Intake from Por Puestos and Taxis·

Because of limitations in the available statistical data, the revenue intakes,
both per diem and per annum, had to be calculated from the optimal toll
per passenger during the morning peak hour rather than from the suggested
licence fee oLBs. 20. 00 per PPT per daily pricing period.             Nevertheless,
an approximate order of magnitude can be estimated.               The price per
passenger in the optimal equilibrium situation was calculated to be BsO .. 2357(l)
for the peak hour.          Without the Metro, 31, 548 passengers would be
affected per peak hour resulting in an intake of Bs. 7, 450.           From data
obtained during the OMT 1966 travel survey in Caracas, it was calculated
that a m'3:rk-up factor from peak-hour trips to daylight hour trips was
          -                 (2)                              .
approximately 8. 00.              . Thus, the daily revenue intake from por puestos
and taxis would be Bs. 59, 600, equivalent to Bs.14. 9 million per annum i f
pricing is applied to 250 days with continual s.imilar travel conditions to the
                             3
typical morning peak hour. ( ) With the Metro, the revenue intake from por
puesto-taxis would be Bs. 2, 700, Bs. 26, 600 and Bs. 5. 4 million per peak
hour, per diem,. and per annum respectively.


5. 4. 2.        Revenue Intake from Cars

A similar calculation procedure (capable of. yielding adequate order of
magnitude estimates) was resorted to in the case of car travel assuming
a per driver tdp price of Bs. 1. 75, which has been argued in Section 4. 4
to be compatible with a daily price of Bs. 6. 00.          Without the Metro, the

( 2)          The data available was q.ot adequate for a precise estimate of
              the required mark-up factor.    The factor of 8 was deduced
              from tabulations on CMA trips by mode and purpose, for peak
              hour and 24-hour durations.

( 3)          Such arr assumption was argued to be not unreasonable in
              Section-4. 4.




                                          -433-
    revenue intake would be Bs.33, 600, Bs.336,400, and Bs.84.lm per
h   peak hour, per diem, and per annum respectively.          Equivalent sums
i
    with the Metro would be little different .at Bs. 32, 600, Bs. 3 26, ,300 and
    Bs. 81. 6m respectively.


     5. 4. 3   Revenue Intake from Goods Vehicles

    A per trip price of Bs. 2. 625 would be appropriate for goods vehicles
    . during the peak hour and, it is reasoned, at other periods throughout the
    };lours of daylight.    However, the nature of the land use and transport
     model adopted for the study implies an almost complete insensitivity of
    goods vehicle trip making behavior to what is the level of price charged.
    This implication is likely to be quite reasonable during the short run and
    further implies that, as far as the somewhat constrained definition· of
     economic efficiency traditionally considered in urban transport planning
     is concerned, (l) it does hardly matter what price is. asked of goods vehicle
     operators.      In S.ection 4. 3, a daily price of Bs.15. 00 was considered to
     be appropriate for goods vehicles, although. an inadequate data base makes
     a precise estimate impossible to make. However, on the basis of
     Bs. 2. 625 per trip, < > the reven~e intake either with or without the Metro
                           2

     from goods vehicles ".V'oul,d be Bs. 3, 900, Bs. 64, 300 and Bs.16. lm per
     peakhour, per diem, and per annum, respectively.


     5. 4. 4 ' Aggregate Revenues. and Conclusions

     The revenue income· is summarized. in Table 5. 5.       With the Metro, revenues



     (1)       The meaning of economic efficiency is·traditionally bounded by the

               in the transport sector reverberates throughout the remainder'
               of the economy.

     ( 2)      It could be ar.gued that the levying of such a charge would encourage
               operators to split their fleets between CPD usage and non-CBD
               usage.     This would reduce the revenue intake initially but could be
               compensated by a raising of the charge if the extra distortions to
               fleet utilizatfon are not significant.

of these studies where an area approximately three times the size of the
Caracas CBD was considered for pricing. (l)     In London, the annual revenue
intake was reckoned to be some L 5 million, equivalent to some Bs. 55
million~ if pricing were levied throughout the working day.     Cars would
have been charged at about half as much as has been suggested for Caracas
and considerable confusion regarding differences between the categories
of included vehicles and in the variation of trips subjected to pricing at
various hours of the day.

                 --CATION OF THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF
                  SUPPLEMENTARY LICENSING



From the outset of this road user charges study, aspects related to the·
possibility of pricing road users in the Caracas Metropolitan Area (CMA)
on a marginal social cost basis have been limited to short-run consider-
ations since such a pricing regime is primarily designed to obtain the
maximum efficient utilization of existing ·facilities.   While achieving this
end,' however, road pricing would, in the longer run, tend to modify
accessibility patterns with consequent changes in longer-term transportat-
ion requirements.    A thorough evaluation of these longer-term effects
would require an analysis of a variety of interrelationships involving travel
demand, transport improvement programs, transport policy and road
pricing policy as the more important variables.       It was recognized that
insights obtained from the analysis of the short-term effects of road
pricing could be useful in determining indicators of some of the long-term
effects of road pricing.    One prominent contributor to the long-term effects
                            ----                                      .
of road pricing is its set of feasible impacts upon future investment in
highway construction programs.      The 1980 analysis was therefore structured
to determine rough order-of-magnitude estimates of the relationship between
road pricing and future investment in highway construction.


6.1   1980.TRAVEL FORECASTS

This section provides a summary of the methodology, assumptions, procedures
and results of travel forecast and travel demand characteristics for 1980
which served as input to the economic analyses discussed in the subsequent
sections of this chapter.    The reader is referred to Appendix 3 for a more
detailed description of the methodology and procedures utilized in. the fore-
cast of 1980 travel demand.

6. 1. 1   Procedure for Estimating 1980 Travel Summaries

The first step in developing an estimate of 1980 travel summaries was to
forecast the growth in the demand for travel from 1971 to 1980..       Expres-
sions were developed for each of 15 superdistricts reflecting 1971 trip
.generation characteristics as functions of population and total employment. -
Thereafter, from these expressions with 1980 popl,llation and employment
information,. individual growth factors were calculated and then utilized
to factor the 1971 travel summaries so as to estimate 1980 travel summaries
in terms of passenger car unit (p. c. u.) kilometers of travel. (l)


6.1. 2    Procedure for Determining 1971-1980 Highway
Require'.inents in Function of Road-Prieing Charges

A series of highway network alternatives representing a range of investment
alternatives were defined by determining the number of additional lane-
kilometers required to service the growth in travel demand between 1971
and 1980 while maintaining the existing (1971) level of congestion (average
travel speed) at particular price levels.      A total of nine levels of highway
investment were defined and are identified in Table 6. 1.


Thereafter, relating the forecasted distribution of 1980 travel demand to
each of the nine network investment levels at each of the five price, levels
(Bs. 0. 0, Bs.1_. 25, Bs. 2. 50, Bs. 5. 00, and Bs. 7. 20), travel characteristics
in terms of p. c .. u. kilometers and hours of travel as well as average high-
                                           J                               •

way travel speed were determined.       This and other information served as
the basis for the economic analyses discussed in the subsequent section .
of the chapter.


The same modal choice observed in the 1971 analysis was adopted as a           -
base for 1980.     For the alternatives where the Metro was assumed to be

6, 2   THE LONG-TERM INTERACTION BETWEEN.
CHARGES, BENEFITS .AND INVESTMENT

The traffic projections which are the subject of the first section of this·
chapter make possible_ a coarse investigation into how. road pricing is
likely to affeet the long-term transport strategy which should be adopted in
Caracas.      The data base is somewhat imprecise so that no hard and fast
conclusions can be drawn, however, and indeed the relative suppleness of
the input information was explicitly taken to be an adequate      rea~on   for not
conducting any detailed assessment upon such information.           Nevertheless
it is believed that this section will be of interest both generally and in the
specific context of Caracas.


6. 2. 1   The General Interrelationship Between Pricing and Investment.

Road pricing has      ~ometimes   been considered as a short-term concept of
relevance only when the supply of road space is fixed.         It should nc:it so be
considered because short-term policies inevitably affect longer-term plans
and the   latt~r   in turn feed back into short-term   d~cision-making.    A wholly
efficient transport planning strategy must embrace both the short-term
variable of pricing strudure and the longer-term variable of the amount of
the available physical capacity.




                                     -440-
                                                         ------------ -           - - - -- - --- - - - - -




     If demands for travel accumulate upon a fixed supply of road (and rail)
     space, then congestion eventually develops.       For a while, the most
     efficient course of action is to require that road (and rail) users are held
     financially responsible for their own travel decisions, e.g. road pricing
     is introduced.    But the effectiveness of this policy is a product of two
     conflicting vectors - - speeds are raised, which confers benefits, but.
     trips ?-re .suppressed and otherwise distorted, which implies losses (relat-
     ive to a congestion-free situation).    There comes a point at which these
     losses become so g:reat that it is better to invest more resources in
     capacity expansion so that the benefits persist but the distortions to the
     ·(idealized) travel -patterns are cancelled;   or more pragmatically, to a
     point where some distortion is tolerated but most of it is soaked up by the
     extra capacity.    When more capacity is supplied, congestion costs, per
     trip, are reduced and the efficient standard road-price levy is reduced
     also.   The marginal theory upon which these consequences are based is
     complicated by the non-continuous nature of capacity expansion (e.g. a
     three- lane road is usually allowed but a 2. 42- lane ,road may not be feasible),
     but nevertheless it does have general relevance.

,·
     In urban areas, the costs of extra capacity are usually quite high and
     always trend marginally upwards.       Thus some congestion would always
     be economic.      In rural areas, the costs of extra capacity are sometimes
     low enough so that the optimal policy would entail capacity expansion and n'o
     significant congestion.


     It might be reasoned that if the relevant authorities choose not to admit to
     price manipulation as a planning variable then more roads would be con-
     structed, since the congestion problem may be insoluable in any other way
     once any traffic management potentialities have been exhausted.       This
     could be true, and is implied by the current generation of transport models
     to a considerable extent.    On the other hand, extra road construction may
     significantly disadvantage alternative modes capable of operating at low

              and Investment -Program for Caracas

r             Let it be assumed that a basic strategy exists for transport in'. Caracas.
              This strategy rejects marginal cost pricing and allows only minimal invest-
              ment in new facilities.       This basic strategy would only by chance be optimal.
              An improvement could be imparted by imposing a set level of supplementary
              licence charges (which, it is implied 'below, does not vary with changing
              conditions once it has been set).         An improvement could also follow from
              more investment in roads.          The best strategy could imply both pricing and
              more netw:ork investment.         (It could also, of course, require that better bus
              services are laid on, that gasoline prices be raised, that no more office
              construction be allowed, that car-ownership should be frozen, etc.          These
              possibilities were explicitly not considered in the analyses which are
              described
               .                - reasons of the inadequate

              study objectives would be only vaguely pursued were such possibilities to
              be investigated).


              Each alternative strategy would have associated with- it certain costs which
              could be listed as:

                           (i)       Operating Costs.    These include the costs of all

                                     all hours of, say, the period 1971-2001, and all

          Table 6. 2 shows estimates of such costs for each combination of network,
          as defined in Section 1 of this chapter and price level (for each a. m. peak
          hour p. c. u. trip).      Both demand grows and new investment occurs between
          1971 and 1980, when a limit to groyrth is reached. · A demand plateau and
    !..   no new investment prevails from 1980 to 2001, during which era              maintenan~e

          costs are incurred.            In 2001 any residual values remaining at that time,
          when discounted to the present, would have such a small discounted value
          that they can be d!sregarded for purposes of immediate decision-making.
          A purely illustrative 10 percent discount rate is used so t}1at all costs are
          expressed as 1971 equivalent values.               The table sbows estimated benefit:
          cost ratios on new investment in each situation combing Metro existance
          and pricing scheme.            .These ratios are imprecise and admittedly biased,
          e.g. by the somewhat erratic output of the. speed-flow procedure of the
          1980 traffic projections, by the implication of these projections that overall
          travel demands are completely insensitive to cost.s, etc.


          Consider the basic strategy if no Metro is constructed.              This combines the
          relatively low investment of network IV (Bs.1, 11.4m) and no CBD supple-
          ~ntary     licensing.      The total costs of this basic strategy are Bs. (3 2, 506
          · + 332 + 1, 114) m      = Bs. 33,   952m. · If a move were made to network III,
          which needs an extra investment of Bs.' 320m, an overall economy of
           Bs. 3, 664m would be generated.           If network I were chosen, a further
          Bs. 4, 707m would be saved.


          Alternatively, the basic strategy could be replaced by one involving no extra
           investment but, instead, the superimposition of CBD supplementary licensing
           (upon cars, goods      vehicle~,    taxis, and por puestos between 0630 and 1830
           on weekdays).    If the price level chosen reflected a morning peak hour levy
           of Bs.1. 25 per p.    c. u.    per trip, then the ·total cost would be Bs. 30, 447m,
          a   saving of Bs. 3, 505m.


          Table 6. 2 is based upon a definition of operating costs whi.ch complies with
          that upon which the cost-difference benefits of Chapter 5, Section 5 are
                                                                                     11

        illustrated in Figure 6. 2.    The implications of the methodology do appear

        6. 2. 3   Optimal Licence Charge as a Function of Network Capacity

        The traffic projections for 1980 opened up an opportunity to delve i11,to
        the matter of how should the price level vary with network capacity
I   I   and the demands made upon that network capacity, or, effectively, how
        should the price level vary through the passage of time.     .The analysis
        was confined to the 1980 CBD pricing, no Metro scen'ario.      It became
        obvious that the coarseness of the speed-flow calculations of the traffic
        projections introduces a margin of imprecision into the results.     In view
        o( this, some small liberties were taken to simplify the analysis procedure:
        for instance, time values were held constant at their estimated 1971 levels.
        These are quite low anyway; one should conclude that higher time values
        would raise the optimum price levels above those indicated.


        As time passes, assuming that demand pressures build up, the benefits_
        from supplementary licensing would increase and the optimal price level
        would be raised.      This statement, however, need be valid only if network
        capacity does not increase, or, at least, its expansion does not keep pace
        with the development of demand pressures.       With given demand levels, it
        might be anticipated that both benefits and the optimal price level would be
        inversely related to network capacity.


        Benefits . were calculated
                          .
                                   at each of four price levels for network I, III and IV
        (relative to the respective zero-price situation) for both the cost-difference
        (CD) and, by conversion from the cost difference benefits, consumer surplus
        (CS) definitions of Chapter 5, Section 5. (l)   The results are shown on Table

fixed but the network size is increased from IV to III to I, benefits are
            -
 reduc_ed and, as indicated by the CS curves, are maxim,ized at progressively
 lower price levels.


 With Network I, ,CD benefits, CS benefits and the optimal pr,ice level are
 not significantly different from those estimated for 1971.            This is not
 surprising upon reflection since identical cost parameters were used and
 the network was formulated to give unchanged travel conditions at a zero-
 price level.        With Network III, involving an intermediate amotint of .invest-
 ment, the optimal price level indicated by unadjusted model output, :r:ises
 to Bs. 3. 50 (per peak hour p. c. u. trip) from Bs. 2. 00 with Network I:
 benefits are multiplied by more than twentyfold.              With the smallest network,
 IV, the corresponding price level ·is Bs. 5. 50; benefits are multiplied by
 some _giirty-five fold from the Network I level.


 6. 3       FUTURE·REVENUES

 Revenues are of secondary importance to benefits to an economist but
 perhaps the two terms 'might coincide to the authorities who would be respons-
 ible for the administration of the road pricing        schem~.      If road pricing
 were to imply a fiscal drain from the coffers of the Metropolitan Area it
would be less attractive a scheme to those responsible for the budget balances
 of the public sector than would otherwise be the case.             Revenues do
, obviously     a~fect   benefits (over and above these benefits ·quantified in Section
, 6. 2,, and elsewhere in this report) and, to the extent that this is so, they
                                                                                            .)
 are of economic relevance.


 However, revenues are of relevance in the political forum also.              Too much
 of a net loss would hiQder the chances of a road pricing scheme being imple-,
 mented.         It is probable that this would not be an obstacle to the i'~position
                                                                                            ,J

 of supplementary licensing on travel in the Caracas central business district
 (CED).         On the other hand, too much of a net gain might be looked upon

                   as a disadvantage, especially by road users called upon to pay for something
                   previously conceived of as "free".      This latter consideration has lain
                   problems in the way of the implementation of road pricing in the U. K.


                   For these reasons an attempt was made to obtain rough estimates of future
                   revenues that would be derived from the imposition of supplementary licens-
                   ing on CBD travel.     These revenues, projected in a relatively robust way
                   for each year between 1971 and 1980, assume that the Metro does not exist
                   during this nine-year period.      Inferences ,can be drawn from this projection
                   concerning the corresponding flow of money in a situation in which the Metro
                   is assumed to exist.       The projections for the transport networks without
                   the Metro are detailed in Table 6. 5.     Columns up tb and including column 11
                   show, in a disaggregated manner, the revenue intake which would be
                   expected from pricing at the same unitary amounts as in 1971, on the
                   assumption that such a system of pricing would be sufficient to maintain
                   relative modal splits at 1971 levels.     T.his projection has been taken in
                   column 12 to apply to Network I, which, as can be learned from Figure 6. 3,
                   would have an optimum set of prices charged no different in 1980 to 1971
                   (to any degree of significance).     Thus, on Network I the growth in revenue
                   intake is purely a function of the growth in the demand for travel. to and from
                   the CBD.


                   On Network III the optimum price per peak hour p. c. u. trip would have risen
                   by 1980 to Bs. 3. 50, as indicated by the modal split curves calibrated to
                   1966 conditions used in the model.       In the real world, this might be equiva-
                   lent to something slightly over Bs. 3. 00 (from 1971 levels of Bs. 2. 00 and ·
                   Bs. 1. 75 respectively).     This would tend to raise the revenue accrual per
                   trip made.    However, the number of trips would fall because of the increase
                   in price.    These two effects have been incorporated into the calculation
                   procedure for column 13 1      .The higher unitary revenue intake dominates
                   the lower number of units so that in 1980 the total annual revenue intake from
                   Network III_would have become some 17 percent greater than if travel supply
                   could have kept pace with travel demand, as represented by Network L

        With Network IV, the optimal 1980 price would have become Bs. 5. 40
        (as indicated by the model) or Bs-. 4. 75 (as may apply in practice).
        Column 14 shows that the annual revenue from Network IV in 1980, were
        optimal charges levied, would be some 45 percent above that which would
I
        then be accruing were travel supply to keep pace with travel de-mand

I'      between 1971 and 1980.     A natural response to such a situation from the
        relevant transport authorities could be to save money on investment in
    I
    .   order to reap money from a supplementary lic~nsing scheme

        be optimal under conditions of such limited network capacity.     Clearly
        there are constraints upon the extent to which such behavior would be
        consistent with economic optimality.


        If a Metro were to be assumed a pattern similar to that summarized for
        the no-Metro situation in Table 6. 5 would emerge.     Approximate cal-
