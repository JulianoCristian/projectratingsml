reflected in a series of successive\n            Government programs. This development vision is concretized\n            in the program supported by the DPL series in three pillars:\n            (i) improving the investment climate to sustain growth, (ii)\n            creating fiscal space for growth through strengthened public\n            finances and public sector reforms; and (iii) improving\n            service delivery and social inclusion. DPL-II builds on the\n            achievements o f DPL-I. The first loan in the series\n            supported important measures to liberalize trade, reduce tax\n            distortions, create a telecommunications regulator, and\n            reorganize and streamline public sector finances under the\n            leadership of the Ministry of Finance among others. DPL-I\n            envisaged an ambitious agenda of further reforms laid out\n            over a 2-3 year period. DPL-II supports the completion of\n            around two thirds of the envisaged measures as well as the\n            achievement (in several areas over-achievement) of the\n            associated medium-term outcome indicators."}, "docdt": "2007-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
