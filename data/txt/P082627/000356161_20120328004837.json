Payment System\n            and Bank Modernization Project for Vietnam were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: an important lesson learned is flexibility\n            in designing the overall system architecture and\n            implementation sequencing for Information Technology\n            (IT)-based/IT-driven projects in the banking and probably\n            other sectors of an emerging market economy that is\n            experiencing fast changing the industry and technology. A\n            flexible overall design alone cannot guarantee the success.\n            Detailed technical analysis is needed to develop an\n            implementable project implementation plan. Reengineering of\n            main operational systems in an institution often leads to\n            major institutional changes. Technical competency of\n            implementing agencies and of Bank task team is critical.\n            This is a recurrent lesson almost in all the Bank-financed\n            projects. The strong ownership of Second Payment System and\n            Bank Modernization Project (PSBM2) by the government and the\n            implementing agencies could not be maintained without the\n            positive experience."}, "docdt": "2011-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
