REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI FOR A MALI-SUD
AGRICULTURAL PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mali in an amount equivalent to
US$15.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance an agricultural
development project. The IDA credit will be on-lent by Government to the
Compagnie Malienne pour le Developpement des Textiles (CMDT) for 20 years
at an interest rate of 9%. The French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC)
would make a grant equivalent to US$1.8 million; the African Development
Fund (ADF), the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and
the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) would provide loans
of US$6.0 million, US$5.0 milion and US$3.1 million respectively.

PART I: THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        A report on "Recent Economic Developments in Mali" (233a-MLI)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on September 27, 1973. An
Economic Memorandum will be distributed to the Executive Directors shortly.
3.        With a per capita GNP of $95 Mali is one of the poorest countries
of Africa and amongst the 29 least developed countries identified by the
United Nations. It is handicapped by serious obstacles to, development.
The extreme variability of rainfall causes sharp fluctuations in crop and
livestock production. Access to foreign markets is made difficult by its
landlocked position and the long distances - more than 1000 km - to the
nearest seaports, Abidjan and Dakar. Development is also constrained by
the shortage of skilled manpower and the narrow domestic market for indus-
trial products.
4.        About 90% of the population depends for livelihood on crop farm-
ing, animal husbandry, forestry and fishing. Exports consist almost entirely
of agricultural commodities and livestock. In 1972, the primary sector
accounted for 43% of GDP. The relative contribution of the primary sector
declined in 1973 and 1974 owing to widespread drought; and even after the
recovery of agricultural production in 1975 it remained somewhat lower than
in 1972.
5.        Over the last fifteen years economic growth has barely kept ahead
of the growth of population. During the 1960s GDP, in real terms, increased
at an average annual rate of 2.8% as compared to the average population growth
rate of 2.1%. During the drought of the early seventies, GDP declined, but
it is estimated to have risen by more than 12% in 1975 with the return of
adequate rainfall and the recovery of agricultural production.
6.        The economic problems of Mali were aggravated in recent years not
only by the drought but also by international inflation, excessive credit
expansion and growing budget and balance of payments deficits. The Govern-
ment of Mali (GOM) has initiated action to redress major financial imbalances
through credit restraint, substantial reduction of the subsidy element in the
prices of essential consumer goods, fertilizers and agricultural equipment
and improved tax collection. Good crop seasons in 1975 and 1976 should
facilitate the implementation of these measures.
Recent Developments
7.        All economic sectors have in varying degrees been affected by the
recent drought, and their recovery is following different patterns. From an
estimated 5.5 million heads in 1971 the cattle population was reduced to only
3.5 million head in 1974. The reconstitution of the livestock herd has
begun, but this is inevitably a long-term process. With the return to normal



- 3 -
rainfall primary production as a whole increased in 1975 by more than 20%.
The output of cereals rose by nearly a third ensuring adequate supplies of
staple food. There was an equally sharp increase in the production of cotton
and groundnuts. Industrial output which largely depends on local raw mate-
rials has also recovered following the return of normal rainfall.
8.        During the drought years the rate of investment was maintained at
about 16% of GDP with the aid of an increasing inflow of external resources.
The resource gap is estimated to have widened to nearly a third of GDP in
1974. It did narrow in 1975, but still remains extremely large at about
20% of GDP. Public dissaving continued to increase as growth of revenues
lagged behind fast rising expenditures, particularly expenditure on person-
nel. The wage bill increased rapidly because of cost of living adjustments
and the policy of government to serve as residual employer of nationals who
complete secondary or higher education. Current revenues did increase as a
result of efforts to improve tax collection, but not enough to keep pace
with rapidly growing expenditures. The current budget deficit widened from
3.6 billion MF (US$7.2 million) in 1972 to 7.6 billion MF (US$17.8 million)
in 1975, or about 27% of total current revenues.
9.        Money supply expanded unusually fast after 1972 mainly as a result
of the rapid increase in bank credit to state enterprises, most of which
incurred heavy losses, partly because of the Government's policy of sub-
sidising prices of important consumption goods and other essential commodi-
ties. Monetary expansion slowed down in 1975, but prices during the year
recorded the steepest increase in many years, partly as a result of the
Government's new policy to reduce consumer subsidies.
10.       Drought combined with the sharp rise in import and energy prices
led to a serious aggravation of the external deficit. Cereal imports shot
up from 64,000 tons in 1972 to 235,000 tons in 1974, while the average import
price trebled; the value of petroleum imports nearly doubled. Imports of
cereals and most other foodstuffs declined substantially in 1975, but owing
to higher imports of materials and investment goods payments for goods and
services fell by only about 12%. Exports could not benefit fully from the
highly favourable market conditions in 1973 and 1974 because the drought
had reduced supplies available for export. Still, owing to high prices,
particularly for cotton, export earnings increased from 22.7 billion MF ($45
million) in 1972 to 30.8 billion MF ($64 million) in 1974. Though cotton and
groundnut supplies improved markedly in 1975, world prices of these commodi-
ties declined and the total value of exports is estimated to have fallen
marginally during the year.
Foreign capital and Debt
11.       Public investment is mainly financed by foreign aid.   During most
of the sixt4ies the USSR and the People's Republic of China were the most
important aid donors. At the end of 1973, they held about one-third each



-4-
of Mali's external public debt disbursed and outstanding. New disbursements
(grants and loans) from DAC sources increased from US$23 million in 1969
to US$70 million in 1973. Roughly half came from bilateral sources (mainly
France, United States, Germany, and Canada).
12.       Official grants have become the most important financing item
in Mali's balance of payments. Their total amount more than trebled (to
37.2 billion MF or about US$87 million) between 1972 and 1975. Net official
borrowings on the other hand increased by only 2.4 billion MF to about 8.5
billion MF during the same period. Despite the substantial inflow of grants
and growing net official borrowing the overall payments deficit increased
sharply from 2.6 billion MF (US$5.2 million) in 1972 to 14.5 billion MF
(US$30.2 million) in 1974. Such overall deficits are financed mainly through
drawings on the French Treasury under the Operations Account arrangement.
Mali's outstanding indebtedness to the Operations Account (including accumu-
lated interest) went up from 31.5 billion MF (US$62.4 million) at the end of
1972 to 86.8 billion MF (US$176.6 million) in September 1976. At the end of
June 1976, net foreign assets were negative by nearly 90 billion MF (US$190
million).
13.       Mali's external public debt outstanding at the end of 1973 (exclud-
ing drawings on the Operations Account with the French Treasury) was US$368
million, including an undisbursed amount of US$85 million. IDA's share
in the total amount disbursed and outstanding was 17.4%. Repayments of
principal and interest due in 1973 would have claimed about 19% of foreign
exchange earnings (15% in 1972), but actual debt service payments were small
(1.5% in 1972, 1.7% in 1973) owing to the rescheduling since 1970 of Chinese,
Russian and some other debts under short to medium-term arrangements. Mali
received five stand-by credits from the IMF between 1964 and 1971, of which
SDR 2.00 million are outstanding. In March 1974 the IMF agreed to reschedule
SDR 2.50 million of payments due in 1974 and 1975. A further postponement
of payment commitments totaling SDR 2 million was approved in January 1975.
Apart from the stand-by credits Mali drew SDR 5.00 million under the 1974 oil
facility and obtained another credit of SDR 3.99 million under the 1975 oil
facility.
Development Prospects
14.       The short run outlook for the economy has improved after two years
of good rainfall and a high level of agricultural production. Industrial
growth has been helped by better availability of agricultural raw materials
for processing. Power generation has continued to expand at a fairly high
rate. With good management, adequate rainfall and well focussed external
assistance the country should be able to overcome the extremely difficult
economic situation in which it finds itself at present.



15.       Agriculture has considerable potential for expansion both in the
South where rainfed agriculture meets favorable conditions and in the vast
inland delta of the Niger river. The river also offers much potential for
power development to support industrial and mineral development. Planned
investment in new capacity for cotton seed oil extraction, cotton textiles
for export and sugar production, together with growing crop and livestock
production, will eventually strengthen the balance of payments. Mineral
resources (iron ore, phosphates) remain at present unexploited but offer
interesting longer term development possibilities.
16.       The Five-Year Social and Economic Development Plan (1974-78) gives
high priority to agriculture, water and power development, industries process-
ing agricultural materials and road transport. The pattern of investment is
well conceived, and allocation conforms broadly to the resource endowment of
the economy, but the investment target of MF 270 billion (about $356 million)
in 1972 prices is no doubt over-ambitious, which means that difficult choices
will have to be made. Implementation of the plan has encountered serious
internal and external resource constraints. In the short run, priority has
to be given to stabilization measures, ans the growth of public and private
consumption will need to be restrained. With regard to new investments
priority should be given to projects and policies that will help correct over
time the structural weakness of the balance of payments. This will require
greater emphasis on export crops, animal husbandry, minor irrigation works
and the more efficient manufacturing activities.
17.       The prospects for the Malian economy have improved following the
marked increase in output over the last two years and the stabilization
measures taken by the Government. Nevertheless, sustained and viable growth
in the longer run depends crucially on investments that will strengthen the
economy's export base and reduce its dependence on imports. Mali's capacity
to finance new investment, however, is severely constrained by the difficult
balance of payments position and a limited savings potential resulting from
the extremely low per capita income level. Moreover, borrowing on conven-
tional terms would add considerably to the burden of servicing an already
sizeable external debt. External aid, accordingly, should be on soft terms
and finance, besides foreign exchange outlays, a significant proportion of
local currency costs.

PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
18.       The proposed credit would be IDA's twelfth operation in Mali, which
would bring total commitments of IDA funds to US$108.7 million. Actual com-
mitments so far amount to US$93.2 million, most of which during the past three
years. Of this amount, US$48.5 million has been disbursed as of October 31,
1976. A summary statement of these credits as well as notes on the execution
of ongoing projects are set out in Annex II.
19.       Experience with ongoing projects has generally been satisfactory
although a telecommunications project had experienced some difficulties
which have not been remedied as reflected in an amendment which was approved
by the Board on July 21, 1976. Some problems also remain in the execution
of the Second Highway Project for which the Board of Directors approved in
June 1975 a supplementary Credit of US$8.3 million to cover the Association's
share of a cost overrun. Unfortunately, works have been delayed by more than
one year, and there is a dispute between the contractor and the Government.
Extensive discussions have been held between the two parties, which should
soon lead to an agreement. Other items of the project are either completed
or well under way.
20.       The proposed Mali-Sud Agricultural project covers the south of
Mali and is designed to provide benefits to about 91,000 farm families.
Its primary aim is to intensify and expand cotton and kenaf production and
to improve cereal production through the introduction of better cultivation
techniques and practices. A Third Railway project and a Second Education
project are currently under preparation. Besides, there are a number of
potential projects in agriculture, transport and other sectors for which
the Government will be seeking Bank Group financing. Due to the shortage
of IDA funds, the Association is also actively promoting co-financing with
other donors for those projects.



-7-
PART III: THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
21.       About 90% of Mali's population depends for livelihood on agriculture
and allied pursuits which accounted for 43% of GDP in 1972. Raw or processed
agricultural commodities and livestock form the largest part of exports.
Cotton, the single most important exchange earner, accounts for more than 30%
of the value of exports, which is nearly as much as the total export proceeds
from groundnuts and livestock, the other major export commodities.
22.        There are some two million hectares under permanent cultivation,
90% of which are rainfed and the rest irrigated. Rainfed cultivation , used on
small family farms cultivated traditionally, has 90% of its area under cereal
crops (millet and sorghum) and the rest under cotton and groundnuts, the main
cash and export crops. Of the area under irrigated cultivation, some 60% is
cultivated traditionally by individual farmers, with the rest under the
"Operations de Developpement Rural" where improved methods are applied.
Almost all irrigated lands are under rice and no cotton is presently grown
under irrigation.
23.       Development efforts until recently were directed mostly at export
crops while cereals suffered from comparative neglect. Cash crop production
developed more rapidly and was less affected by the recent drought than cereal
farming. Total production of cereals declined from 1.1 million tons in 1967/68
to an average 0.8 million tons during the drought years 1972-74; but seed
cotton outputs increased from 42,000 to 65,000 tons, while the groundnut crop
fell only from 118,000 tons to 104,000 tons.
24.       Agricultural production increased substantially over the last two
years as a result of good rainfall and higher producer prices. Production
of cereals, including paddy, is estimated to have recovered to 1.15 million
tons in 1974/75 and 1.2 million tons in 1975/76. Cotton and groundnut crops
in 1975/76 reached the unprecedented levels, of 103,000 and 200,000 tons re-
spectively.
Pricing, Marketing and Subsidies
25.       The agricultural sector is subjected to fairly extensive price
regulation. Price controls over cereals, cash crops and agricultural com-
modities are intended to restrain the rise in prices of essential consumer
goods and to provide farmers with incentives to use improved inputs. Pro-
ducer prices for the crop year are specified, along with taxes and levies,
marketing and handling charges, in comodity price schedules known as
"baremes." The system of administered prices functions essentially through
the Societe Malienne d'Importation et d'Exportation (SOMIEX), Office des
Produits Agricoles du Mali (OPAM) and the Societe de Credit Agricole et
d'Equipement Rural (SCAER), the state trading enterprises handling domestic
and foreign trade in agricultural commodities.



- 8 -
26.       SOMIEX is the monopoly importer and sole distributor of essential
commodities other than foodgrains, and the monopoly exporter of various agri-
cultural commodities, particularly groundnuts and cotton. It is the largest
state-owned enterprise with a size and diversity of operations enabling it
to subsidize, in adherence with Government's price policy, consumer goods of
prime necessity.
27.       For the first time since 1972/73 SOMIEX is faced with the problem
of dealing with large surpluses of cotton. As retail prices of imported
consumer goods rose sporadically and price schedules for cotton and groundnuts
were only partially adjusted in response to sharply rising world prices, SOMIEX
made substantial profits from export operations. In 1975/76 the world market
demand for cotton and groundnuts softened and the international prices dropped
sharply. This fall coincided with increased production, reducing the effec-
tiveness of SOMIEX's operations.
28.       OPAM has been vested with the monopoly of domestic and foreign
trade in cereals at prices fixed by Government. However, OPAM has not been
able to enforce its monopoly in the domestic market due to rigid and often
unrealistic pricing of cereals and its own inability to handle large grain
surpluses. An IDA-financed study of cereal marketing in Mali has just been
completed under Credit 491-MLI and recommends that OPAM intervention in the
cereal market be more flexible in order to dampen fluctuations in prices and
availability. Conclusions of the study and implementation of its recommenda-
tions will be discussed with the Government.
29.       SCAER is the sole purchaser of agricultural equipment and other
inputs which in turn reach the farmers of the projects under the "Operations
de Developpement Rural". The difference between the purchase and sales price
is supposed to be covered by a levy collected through the "bareme" for cotton
and groundnuts. Because of the cessation of external finance for agricultural
credit, SCAER is experiencing cash shortfalls. This in turn has led to the
inability of SCAER to purchase all inputs and equipment requested by farmers
for 1975/76. Government is aware of the inadequacy of the present arrange-
ments and is currently considering a major reform of SCAER and of agricul-
tural input procurement. Among the alternatives being considered are the
conversion of SCAER into a procurement department within the Ministry of
Rural Development and the decentralization of the procurement function to
make each "Operation" responsible for its own procurement. The government
has agreed that if, after one year of project implementation, provision of
agricultural equipment and inputs to farmers is unsatisfactory, Government
and IDA would agree on measures satisfactory to IDA to remedy the situation.
30.       Subsidies on agricultural inputs have been progressively reduced
and now only fertilizers and insecticides are subsidized to the extent of
32% and 55% of their respective costs delivered to farmers. These sub-
sidies, which are in any case low compared to other countries in the region,



- 9 -
are more than offset by levies and taxes on cotton and groundnuts. Neverthe-
less, because of budgetary difficulties Government proposes to further reduce
and eventually eliminate all subsidies: this will not affect farmers' use of
inputs as the benefits of these inputs have been demonstrated and producer
prices for cash crops have been increased sufficiently (by 50% for cotton and
33% for groundnuts) to allow farmers to bear the full cost of inputs.
Agricultural Strategy
31.       The development strategy adopted by Government accords high priority
to agriculture. Major objectives of the Five-Year Economic and Social Devel-
opment Plan launched in 1974 are:
(a) to achieve self-sufficiency in food;
(b) to generate adequate supplies of agricultural raw
materials for processing; and
(c) to ensure increasing surpluses of primary products
for export.
Government intends to meet objective (a) through heavy investments in irriga-
tion projects for paddy production. However, this objective was conceived
during the drought years and does not take sufficient account of the high
cost of irrigation, the traditional consumption pattern which prefers the
cheaper coarse grains (millet and sorghum) to rice, or Mali's potential for
rainfed agriculture: indeed Mali has already reattained self-sufficiency
in cereals and this could be maintained in the long-run by the development
of millet and sorghum under rainfed conditions coupled with grain storage
facilities. Objectives (b) and (.c) would be met by the development of
livestock, groundnuts and cotton for export.



- 10 -
PART IV: THE PROJECT
32.       The project was identified and prepared by the Malian Institut
d'Economie Rurale (IER) and appraised in November 1975. Negotiations were
held from October 11 to 15, 1976, with a Malian delegation led by H. E. Sory
Coulibaly (Minister of Rural Development). The staff project report (No.
1171-MLI) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Annex
III provides a credit and project summary.
Project Concept
33.       Project Area.   The project would cover the so-called Mali-Sud area,
which extends over three administrative regions, and where remarkable results
have already been achieved in the development of cotton and kenaf production
under rainfed cultivation. Both crops benefited from substantial investments
made by the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) for cotton, and Fonds
Europeen de Developpement (FED) for kenaf.
34.       Objectives and components.   The project integrates and coordinates
the efforts of the various foreign aid donors interested in the future devel-
opment of Mali-Sud, and seeks to build up CMDT from both a financial and or-
ganizational standpoint to carry out the proposed project and to ensure that
the project benefits are maintained after the project disbursement period.
The project covers the period May 31, 1976 - December 31, 1980. Investments
in the period after the establishment of CMDT between January 1975, and May
31, 1976 were agreed between CMDT, FAC, and IDA, but were financed exclusively
by FAC. The principal objectives of the project would be:
(a) Increasing cotton and kenaf production through the
intensification of improved methods used by farmers
and expansion of the area under cotton from about
87,000 ha to 135,000 ha and under kenaf from 2,000 ha
to 4,600 ha; increasing maize and rice production
mainly through the intensification of improved cul-
tivation methods: the improved maize area would
increase from 6,500 ha (10% of the total maize area)
to 15,000 ha (27%), and the improved rice area from
about 4,000 ha to 12,000 ha.
(b) Providing project farmers with technical advice, seed
multiplication facilities, and applied research. The
project would introduce research on maize through the
financing of five man-years of expatriate technical
assistance in agronomic research. The project would
also provide credit for the purchase of new agricul-
tural equipment and inputs.



- 11 -
(c) Improving animal husbandry of cotton farmers, including
use of draft oxen, stall fattening, improved cattle
feeding through rational use of natural pastures, con-
trolled burning, cultivation of fodder crops and use of
crop byproducts.
(d) Expanding physical infrastructure with the rehabilita-
tion of one 10,000 ton ginnery and construction of one
new 20,000 ton ginnery, improvement of kenaf retting
ponds, construction of a 3 ton/hour rice mill, provi-
sion of storage for inputs, procurement of 151 vehicles
for CMDT, and improvement of some 500 km annually of
farm-to-market agricultural tracks.
(e) Undertaking studies for the future development of the
areas freed from onchocerciasis, including the prep-
aration of an inventory of resources to constitute a
data bank, a broad development plan for the next ten
years and the preparation of a number of projects
within the framework of the development plan.
(f) Improving the rural health services in the area by
equipping and training their staff and financing an
initial stock of drugs.
(g) Training of CMDT staff, and of the rural population
through young farmers' and blacksmiths' training and
a functional literacy program.
Special Features
35.       One of the project's objectives would be the build-up of CMDT
finances to make it possible for CMDT (i) to carry out the project including
the added activities of procurement of inputs for cotton farmers should this
prove necessary, (ii) to keep operating at a satisfactory level after the
project disbursement period, and (iii) to cover adequately the cost of the
subsidy on inputs to cotton farmers until such time as the subsidy has been
eliminated. The 1977/78 commodity price schedule or "bareme" applying to
cotton lint would be modified substantially to reflect this objective. As
cost allocations under the "bareme" for cotton lint have usually been kept
too low and resulted in losses for CMDT, a condition of effectiveness would
be that the government has demonstrated that the "baremes" applicable to
CMDT's products are being calculated on the basis of actual costs incurred by
CMDT during the preceding campaign as adjusted for subsequent economic
changes. (Section 6.01 (e) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). This
condition of effectiveness would be fulfilled if Government demonstrates that
the baremes for 1976/77, which have already been approved were based on the
actual costs incurred in 1975/76, and that it will be possible to make neces-
sary adjustments to changing conditions.

36.       In addition to the losses incurred in the application of the
"bareme" for cotton lint, CMDT's difficult financial position has resulted
from inadequate equity capitalization and late payments by its customers
(SOMIEX and the local textile manufacturers).   During negotiations, it was
agreed that a condition of the credit becoming effective would be that
Government would have taken measures necessary so that overdue debts owed by
SOMIEX, ITEMA and COMATEX to CMDT will be paid within six months of credit
signing, overdue debts being defined as those beyond the delays specified in
the agreements between CMDT and its customers, in which the latter indicate
their planning of'monthly purchases of lint and payments to CMDT. (See
Section 6.01 (d) of the draft Development Credit Agreement.) During negotia-
tions assurances were also obtained that the terms of the agreements between
CMDT and SOMIEX, ITEMA and COMATEX would be acceptable to IDA and adhered to,
and that CMDT equity would be increased to 10% of the overdraft facilities
required by CMDT from the Central Bank by 1979/80. this being the minimum
set by the banking regulations. The increase in equity would be through an
increase in the commission that CMDT earns on cotton lint and by addition of
non-distributed retained earnings to equity.
Project Cost and Financing
37.       Total project costs excluding duties and other clearly-identifiable
taxes are estimated at US$44.6 million. The foreign exchange cost is US$31.3
million or 70%. The financing plan is sumarized below:
US$ million
Amount          % of total
IDA                                       15.5               35
Farmers                                    7.0               16
Government                                 6.2               14
ADF                                        6.0                13
BADEA                                      5.0               11
CCCE                                       3.1                 7
FAC                                        1.8                4
44.6              100%
It would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit that assurances
satisfactory to IDA had been received with respect to the FAC, BADEA, ADF
and CCCE financing. (Section 6.01 (c) of the draft Development Credit Agree-
ment). FAC financing would be on a joint basis with IDA. BADEA, ADF, and
CCCE financing would be on a parallel basis. Government would finance local
staff salaries and part of the credit requirement for inputs. Farmers would
contribute down payments for the purchase of agricultural equipment.    BADEA
would finance mainly the kenaf, livestock and health subprojects; ADF, the
rice component, and CCCE the new cotton ginnery. IDA and FAC would finance



- 13 -
the cotton development program and the research program (see Annex III, page
2 for breakdown). Credit repayments would go into a revolving fund earmarked
for the purchase of new agricultural equipment. (Section 3.05 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement).
38.       A subsidiary agreement would be concluded between Government and
CMDT regarding the on-lending of IDA funds. (Section 3.01 (c) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement). The conclusions of this agreement would be
a condition of effectiveness. (Section 6.02 (b) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
39.       Initial Funding of the Project.   Expenditures to be financed by
IDA and FAC in the first year of the project would total some MF 2.5 bil-
lion (US$5.1 million). The interim financing requirement, assuming a lag
of three months between the time the expenditure is incurred and the time
it is reimbursed, would be a minimum of MF 0.6 billion (US$1.2 million).
Since CMDT or Government would be unable to provide such advance financing,
it is proposed that IDA provide MF 0.6 billion in advance a part of its
contribution to project financing. Other donors would be encouraged to
prefinance their shares of project expenditures. Retroactive financing by
IDA of up to US$0.3 million would be granted to cover project expenditures
incurred after May 31, 1976, on agricultural research and technical assis-
tance to CMDT.
40.       The increases in yields and areas under improved cultivation
would result in annual production increments amounting of 64,300 tons of
seed cotton, 1,800 tons of kenaf, 7,300 tons of maize and 6,600 tons of
rice paddy by 1980/81.
Implementation
41.       All agricultural projects in Mali are carried out by specific
"Operations de Developpement Rural", which are administrative units under
the general supervision of the Ministry of Rural Development. They enjoy
considerable managerial autonomy and use an integrated approach in their
provision of support services to farmers. While each operation concen-
trates on a particular product like groundnuts, rice or cotton, all of
them are responsible for the general agricultural development, including
improvement of coarse grains, in their respective areas. There are 16
"Operations". They are generally well managed and have been fairly suc-
cessful in implementing the development programs assigned to them.
42.       Compagnie Malienne des Textiles (CMDT) is such as "operation".
It was created in 1974 to take over the activities of the Compagnie francaise
pour le Developpement des Fibres Textile (CFDT), which has successfully
developed cotton cultivation in the south of Mali since 1947. CMDT inherited
much of the staff, organization and momentum of cotton development left by
CFDT. CMDT would carry out the main objectives of increasing cotton, kenaf,
rice and maize production, and providing technical advice to project farmers.
Other government agencies responsible for carrying out part of the project



- 14 -
would be the Ministry of Public Works for assistance in the agricultural track
component, the Ministry of Health for the health component and the Institut
d7Economie Rurale for the research and studies financed under the project.
43.       Technical Assistance.   The agreed objective among CMDT shareholders
(Government and CFDT) and the project financiers is to gradually phase out all
expatriates employed by CMDT. Such replacement is progressing satisfactorily
since the number of expatriates was reduced from 33 in 1973 prior to the crea-
tion of CMDT to 16 at present. Today there are 8 expatriates either in
executive positions or performing necessary training duties. This relatively
large number of higher level expatriates is justified given the size of the
area covered by CMDT, the complexity of its operation and the limited number
of trained Malian executives. Technical assistance to CMDT would be provided
by CFDT. The project would finance 30 man-years of technical assistance to
CMDT over the project period at a total cost of US$1.7 million, or US$57,000
per man-year on the average. Base salaries account for 46% of this amount
and the rest are social security charges and allowances associated with over-
seas assignments. The eight lower level expatriates presently employed by
CMDT in purely technical jobs would be phased out progressively. Mali is
equally short of experienced agricultural researchers, and the project in-
cludes 16 man-years of expatriate technical assistance for applied research
at an average cost of US$59,000/man-year.
44.       Training.  The quality of CMDT staff, especially the extension
staff, can be considered above average, and the training programs for CMDT
staff would be relatively limited. Besides management in-service training,
a number of scholarships for studies outside the country, either in Africa
or Europe, would be made available to CMDT staff under the project. In
addition the project would finance the on-going training programs already
carried out by CMDT and aimed essentially at the lower CMDT staff echelons
and the rural population.
45.       Procurement.  For the project items financed jointly by IDA and
FAC the following would apply: orders or contracts for equipment, vehicles,
compound fertilizer and construction with a value of more than US$50,000
would be through international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines. Such procurement is estimated to amount to US$5.0 million.
Whenever feasible, contracts and orders would be bulked. Contracts of less
than $50,000 would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding adver-
tised locally and in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to IDA.
Contracts procured under local competitive bidding should not exceed US$2
million. Efficient local building contractors exist and are carrying out
most of the civil works built under the ongoing Integrated Rural Development
Project (Credit 491-MLI). Malian contractors would be given a preference of
7.5% in the evaluation of tenders for civil works. Expatriate technical
assistance (US$1.7 million) would be provided by CFDT for CMDT operations,
by Institut de Recherche du Coton et des Textiles Exotiques (IRCT) for
cotton and kenaf research (US$0.7 million), and by the International
Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) for maize research (US$0.2 mil-
lion). The planning studies for the development of the areas freed from
onchocerciasis would be carried out by consultants recruited internationally
according to IDA guidelines (US$0.5 million).



- 15 -
46.       Procurement of items financed by BADEA, ADE and CCCE would be
carried out under their respective arrangements. It is not expected that
procurement of goods financed by donors other than IDA would result in higher
costs than if all procurement were made under IDA procedures.
Disbursements
47.       The IDA credit of US$15.5 million would be disbursed against 87%
of the cost of management and training, cotton development (excluding local
staff and the new ginneries), agricultural research, auditing and scholarships;
39% of the cost of the incremental requirements of compound fertilizers; and
100% of the foreign exchange cost of the studies for the development of the
areas freed from onchocerciasis.
Benefits and Risks
48.       The project's direct benefits would be the increased production it
would generate, resulting in higher incomes for some 108,000 farm families,
92,000 of which would be involved in cotton growing; 8,000 in kenaf develop-
ment and 8,000 in swamp rice development. The incremental net foreign
exchange earnings would total some US$25 million annually by 1980. The
economic rate of return is estimated to be 25% for the livestock component,
the cost of which is MF 0.4 billion (US$0.8 million), and 44% for the crop
development component, the cost of which is MF 15.4 billion (US$31 million).
The aggregate economic rate of return on these components, which account for
96% of project cost, is 44%. This aggregate return excludes the studies and
health components for which no meaningful rate of return could be estimated
because of the predominance of non-quantifiable effects. The sensitivity
analysis indicates that the rates of return for both livestock and crop
development are sensitive to variations in benefits or costs. Each variation
of benefits or costs of 1% would result in an absolute change of about 0.6
and 1.1 percentage points in their respective rates of return. Shadow pricing
the foreign exchange component of the economic calculations with a 1.20 factor
would increase the rate of return of the project to 53%.
49.       Yields and Production.   Because rainfall was especially well-
distributed in 1975/76 and in 1976/77 with concentration in June at the
time of planting and in September just before harvesting, yields in these
two years were exceptionally high, at about 1,200 kg/ha. The likelihood
of an occurrence of another two years of very well-distributed rainfall
is remote, and lower yields have been used as a base point for calculating
expected production increases. The 905 kg/ha for seed cotton used for
1975/76 is the estimate of what the yield would have been if rainfall had
been average in quantity and distributed normally. The small (17%) increase
in seed cotton yields over the period 1975-1980 is slightly higher than the
rate of increase over the period 1962-1974 and results from the wider adop-
tion of improved agricultural methods. The yields for kenaf and food crops
would not increase in the areas already under improved cultivation, but
the surface of the areas under improved cultivation would expand with the
extension of services to new farmers.



- 16 -
50.       The project would have a number of secondary benefits which are
not reflected directly in the economic rate of return calculations. Important
among these are (a) the impact of the functional literacy and health training
programs; (b) the demonstration effect of a concerted and integrated approach
to rural development; (c) the planning of the development of the areas freed
from onchocerciasis; (d) the expansion of non-farm rural employment, for about
500 persons, in blacksmithing and in CMDT's cotton ginneries and rice mill,
and in the SOMASAC kenaf processing plant; and (e) the improvement of nutri-
tion.
51.       The technical risks attached to the project are not large, because
the improved agricultural techniques that would be promoted have already been
tested extensively by CMDT in the project area. The risk that farmers would
not be provided with adequate supply of inputs on time is recognized by Govern-
ment which is taking appropriate steps. Furthermore if supply of such inputs
prove unsatisfactory after the first year of project implementation, Government
and IDA have agreed to consult with each other' on how to best remedy the situa-
tion. The financial risks associated with the weak state of CMDT finances
will be remedied with an increase in the share capital of CMDT and in the in-
crease in the marketing margin that CMDT will get on cotton lint sales. The
commecial risks for CMDT is limited to his customers not paying on time for
their purchases. Assurances have been obtained at negotiations that its major
customers will pay CMDT within the period stipulated in the protocole agree-
ments between CMDT and its major customers, ITEMA and COMATEX (60 days), and
SOMIEX (90 days).
Conclusion, Recommendations and Credit Conditions
52.       The proposed project is economically and technically sound and
seeks to improve the standard of living of large numbers of rural people who
are poor by any standards. Its major objectives are to increase cotton pro-
duction, Mali's major source of foreign exchange and to build up CMDT from
both financial and organizational stand point. In line with these objectives,
the Government has agreed to modify the price schedule applied to cotton lint
in order to: (1) increase the marketing margin and therefore the profits of
CMDT so as to improve its financial situation, (2) to adequately cover the
cost of the subsidy to inputs. Government has also agreed that debts owed
to CMDT by SOMIEX, ITEMA and COMATEX, would be settled within 6 months of
credit signing.
53.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Annex IV, Section III.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Mali and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association
and Compagnie Malienne pour le Developpement des Textiles (CMDT), the Recom-
mendation of the Committee provided in Article V, Section I (d) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text of a draft resolution
approving the proposed Development credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
55.       The following will be special conditions of effectiveness:    that
assurances satisfactory to the Association have been received in respect of
the financing to be provided by the co-donors (FAC, BADEA, ADF and CCCE);
that a subsidiary agreement has been concluded between Government and CMDT
regarding the on-lending of IDA funds; that the Baremes applicable to CMDT's
products are to be calculated on the basis of actual costs incurred during
the previous campaign as adjusted for subsequent economic changes; that the
Borrower has taken the steps necessary to permit SOMIEX, ITEMA and COMATEX to
pay within six months of Credit signing overdue debts owed to CMDT, and that
the supplies of cotton lint and cotton seed sold by CMDT and produced during
the 1975/76 campaign have been paid for.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C. Projects in Execution
Credit 277-MLI      Mopti Rice Development Project.   US$9.5 million Credit of
January 6, 1972 (as amended on April 11, 1975); Effective
Date June 26, 1972; closing Date May 31, 1978.
Started in mid 1972, the project is progressing satisfactorily,
with 93% of civil works completed. To meet $ devaluation, additional works
and price inflation, a supplementary credit of $2.6 million was made in mid
1975. Project is expected to be completed as scheduled. Cropped area is
likely to be slightly lower than the estimated at appraisal because of topo-
graphy.   This may be partly offset by higher yields.
Credit 321-MLI      Telecommunications Project.  US$3.6 million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective Date April 4, 1973; Closing
Date July 1, 1976
Large cost overruns raised the cost of this project from US$4.3
million at appraisal to US$9.3 million recently estimated. Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE) agreed to join in the financing of the project
to a maximum of US$2.2 million equivalent. However, since the Government was
unable to contribute the US$2.5 million required to close the gap in the
financing plan, the Government and the beneficiary, Office des Postes et
Telecomunications du Mali (OPTM), agreed that the project would be executed
in two phases. The first phase of work would consist of the original project
reduced by the Segou/Mopti section of the Bamako/Mopti microwave route and
by the two principal automatic exchanges of Mopti and Kayes; the excluded
works would be included in a second phase which could form part of a future
second telecommunications project. As approved by the Executive Directors on
July 21, 1976, the revised project will be financed from the original credit
of US$3.6 million, the CCCE loan of US$2.2 million and US$1.0 million from
OPTM's own resources. OPTM has changed the management of the telecommunica-
tions service. The Government is prepared to support the introduction of
measures for strengthening the organization and improving the efficiency of
telecommunications operations. The closing date will be postponed to June 30,
1979.
Credit 383-MLI      Second Highway Project.  US$17.8 million Credit of May 23,
1973 (as amended on June 12, 1975); Effective Date
September 12, 1973; Closing Date July 19, 1977
The IDA-financed portion of the project consists of: (i) rehabili-
tation of the Faladie-Segou road; (ii) consultant's services for supervision
of road construction and additional technical assistance to the Public works



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 5
Department; (iii) preinvestment studies of the Bamako-Kolokani road; (iv)
a study of the trucking industry; and (v) procurement of highway equipment.
Two other items of the project, rehabilitation of the Bamako-Bougouni road
and purchase of more highway equipment, were to be financed with USAID assis-
tance. However, bids for reconstruction of the Bamako-Boughouni road (155
km) were so high that it was decided to' drop that item, but the government
is still seeking to finance purchase of maintenance equipment (estimated at
US$3.4 million). Bids for reconstruction of the Faladie-Segou road (222
km) were also higher than expected, but despite this, the works were awarded
to the lowest bidder. The Board of Directors approved in June 1975 a Supple-
mentary Credit of US$8.3 million to cover the Association's share of the
overrun. Unfortunately, works have been delayed by more than one year, and
there is a dispute between the contractor and the Government. Extensive
discussions have been held between the two parties, which hopefully should
soon lead to an agreement. Other items of the project are either completed
or well under way.
Credit 384-MLI      Second Railway Project US$6.7 million Credit of May 23,
1973; Effective Date September 12, 1973; Closing Date
June 30, 1978
The project was expected to cost a total of about US$9.33 million,
with IDA participation of US$6.7 million and FAC-financing of US$1.8 equiva-
lent, the rest being provided under Railway's own financing. Bidding results
disclosed a cost overrun of about US$3.5 million in the foreign exchange
component of the project. The cost overrun was caused by (a) low original
estimates; (b) sharp increases in world market prices; and (c) the fact that
only single bids were received for some items. Additional bilateral financing
obtained for part of the freight cars proposed under the project (Germany
and France) and of the technical assistance (Canada) partly offset the cost
overrun. However, several items included in the project which had to be
deleted or significantly reduced will partially be financed under a third
railway project which was appraised in July 1976. Presently all funds
are committed and the execution of the project is satisfactory.
Credit 420-MLI      First Education Project US$5.0 million Credit of July 11,
1973; Effective Date November 15, 1973; Closing Date
December 31, 1979
The project seeks to improve the quality of lower secondary school
programs and strengthen the country's key middle level training institutions.
The project also supports government efforts to develop a more efficient
program of basic education. Construction of the lower secondary school
science and technology centers and of the Central School for Industry and
Commerce is expected to be completed by late 1977, and equipment procurement
is underway. Construction costs are higher than anticipated at appraisal
by some 60%, but savings on equipment and the postponement of five lower sec-
ondary centers until other financing is found should permit the project to
remain within the overall budget envisaged. Curriculum development work has
been largely completed, and the training of teachers in the new programs will



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 5
begin in summer 1977. The Basic Education Study is proceeding satisfactorily,
and initial surveys and field research have been completed.
Credit 443-MLI     Drought Relief Project.   US$2.5 million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Effective Date June 30, 1976; Closing
Date December 30, 1977
The project consists of a number of sub-projects intended to assist
the country to reestablish the productive base of the areas that have been
affected by the recent drought: (a) construction of small irrigation schemes;
(b) preparation of hydrogeological and irrigation studies; (c) purchase of
veterinary supplies and a livestock survey; and (d) construction of wells.
Started in early 1974, the project has been progressing satisfactorily.
Implementation is on schedule; 84% of the US$2.5 million credit has been
disbursed. The various sub-projects have had a beneficial impact on their
respective sectors. All sub-projects initially approved by IDA have been
carried out; however, some had to be reduced in size because of price escala-
tion and US dollar devaluation.
Credit 491-MLI      Integrated Rural Development Project.  US$8.0 million
Credit of July 1, 1974; Effective Date December 9, 1974;
Closing Date September 30, 1978
The Credit will help improve principal farming activities especially
the production of groundnuts and staple cereals in the west central part
of Mali. It includes provision for extension and credit services; rural
track improvement; agricultural research; functional literacy; medical and
veterinary facilities; and evaluating unit; and a study on millet sorghum
price structure and marketing arrangements. Although some project components
have been delayed, specifically the livestock and the health program, the
project is progressing satisfactorily with the tonnage of marketed groundnuts
virtually on target and OACV taking steps to improve groundnut marketing;
Government is being encouraged to foster greater cooperation between OACV and
the two other state agencies involved in the groundnut sector, SEPOM and
SOMIEX.
Credit 538-MLI     Livestock Project.   US$13.3 million Credit of April 11,
1975; Effective Data July 24, 1975; Closing Date
December 31, 1979
The Project aims at the rational use of land and water in the
Fifth Region and will help rebuilding and improving herds of about 100,000
pastoral families in the Fifth Region to better protect them against future
droughts. It includes provision for livestock extension services and grazing
control; animal health services; construction of 70 wells and 50 ponds; con-
struction of an abattoir and hide-drying facilities; construction for five
livestock markets; functional literacy and the preparation of a second phase
livestock project. This Credit became effective on July 24, 1975, and prog-
ress is satisfactory, although slightly behind schedule. ODEM, the agency
implementing the project is now almost fully staffed, and some procurement

contracts have been approved. The veterinary component proceeds according to
schedule, range management studies are underway, preparations for well pond
and abattoir construction, and for development of a pasture trial station are
underway. A project monitoring plan has been received.
Credit 599-MLI     Third Highway Project.   US$10.0 million Credit of January
Effective Date March 10, 1976; Closing Date June 30, 1979.
The Project consists of (a) construction of 1,200 km feeder roads
by force account; (b) elmination of backlog maintenance of about 944 km of,
paved roads by force account; (c) procurement of various teaching and main-
tenance equipment; and (d) technical assistance for maintenance and training
programs and preparing a country-wide transport plan. The Credit became
effective on March 10, 1976, and the Government has started implementing
several items of the project according to the expected schedule.

Procurement
Arrangements:        For the project items financed jointly by IDA and
FAC, the following would apply: orders or contracts
for equipment, vehicles, compound fertilizer and con-
struction with a value of more than US$50,000 would
be through international competitive bidding (ICB)
in accordance with IDA guidelines. Such procurement
is estimated to amount to US$5.0 million. Whenever
feasible, contracts and orders would be bulked. Con-
tracts of less than $50,000 would be procured on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and
in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to
IDA. Contracts procured under local competitive bidding
would not exceed US$2 million. Efficient local building
contractors exist and are carrying out most of the civil
works built under the ongoing Integrated Rural Develop-
ment Project (Credit 491-MLI). Malian contractors would
be given a preference of 7.5% in the evaluation of
tenders for civil works. Expatriate technical assis-
tance (US$1.7 million) would be provided by CFDT for
CMDT operations, by Institut de Recherche du Coton et
des Textiles Exotiques (IRCT) for cotton and kenaf
research (US$0.7 million), and by International



ANNEX III
Page 4 of 4
Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) for maize
research (US$0.2 million). The planning studies for
the development of the areas freed from onchocerciasis
would be carried out by consultants recruited inter-
nationally according to IDA guidelines (US$0.5 million).
Procurement of items financed by BADEA, ADF, and CCCE
would be carried out under their respective arrange-
ments. It is not expected that procurement of goods
financed by donors other than IDA would result in higher
costs than if all procurement were made under IDA pro-
cedures.
Consultants:          Total consultant's services would amount to about
46 man-years:
(a)-30 man-years of technical assistance to CMDT to
help in the general implementation of the project,
and
(b)-16 man-years of technical assistance for a research
program (cotton, kenaf, maize).
Rate of Return:        Excluding studies and the health component which account
for 4% of the project and for which no meaningful rate
or return could be estimated, the overall rate of return
