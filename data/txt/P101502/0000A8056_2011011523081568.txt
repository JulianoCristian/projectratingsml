                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives is to slow down the spread of HIV and build up the national capacity to respond to the epidemic by i) behavior change
                         among vulnerable groups at high risk, and ii) improving knowledge of HIV prevention and reducing stigma related to HIV and AIDS in the general population.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Afghanistan HIV/AIDS Prevention Project is a US $10 million Grant to the Government of Afghanistan. The project is implemented by the Ministry of Public Health's National AIDS
                         Control Program, primarily through contracting NGOs to deliver harm reduction services to most at risk population.

                         The project is making satisfactory progress towards achieving its objectives. The data from the first round of Integrated Behavioral and Biologic Surveillance (IBBS) financed by the

                         population. Project implementation faces the following major problems: i) shortage of key staff in NACP including the manager. The MOPH is in the process of recruiting these staff; i)
                         reconsideration by Ministry of Counternorcotics and Drug Regulation Committee on allowing importation of Methadone to be used for opiod replacement therapy (an issue which
                         needs support of both Ministries) and; iii) bottlenecks in terms of provision of Harm Reduction Services in prisons (needle syringe exchange and condom distribution) , which requires
                         close collaboration of Ministry of Public Health with Ministry of Justice and Prison authorities.
                         Due to the delayed start, overall project implementation was behind schedule. As the project was rapidly prepared under Emergency Procedures could not have had an initial life-
                         span beyond 3 years. Based on the recommendations of the mid-term review of the project in February 2010, to enable the project to achieve its full impact, the closing date of the
                         Grant was extended to June 30, 2012.
