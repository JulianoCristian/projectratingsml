                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives is to slow down the spread of HIV and build up the national capacity to respond to the epidemic by i) behavior change
                         among vulnerable groups at high risk, and ii) improving knowledge of HIV prevention and reducing stigma related to HIV and AIDS in the general population.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Afghanistan HIV/AIDS Prevention Project is a US $10 million Grant to the Government of Afghanistan. The project is implemented by the Ministry of Public Health's National AIDS
                         Control Program, primarily through contracting NGOs to deliver harm reduction services to most at risk population.

                         The project is making satisfactory progress towards achieving its objectives. With exception of the surveillance contract, the extension of NGO contracts is on track. The data from

                         the first round of Integrated Behavioral and Biologic Surveillance (IBBS - 2009) financed by the project, indicates an HIV prevalence of 7.11% among IDUs (the highest being in Herat
                         at 18%) and an HIV prevalence of 0% among female sex workers and truckers. It also indicates an HIV prevalence of 0.6% and 1.6% among prisoners in Kabul and in Herat prisons

                         respectively. Based on modeling, the HIV prevalence is below 0.1% among general population. Project implementation faces the following challenges i) shortage of key staff in
                         National AIDS Control Program. The manager is now on board and the process of recruiting remaining vacant positions is ongoing; ii) the process for amendment of surveillance
                         contract is going on since October 2010 and remains a top priority for the National HIV/AIDS Program to finalize and; iii) bottlenecks in terms of provision of Harm Reduction Services
                         in prisons (needle syringe exchange and condom distribution), which requires close collaboration of Ministry of Public Health with Ministry of Justice and the Prison authorities.
                         As the project was rapidly prepared under Emergency Procedures could not have had an initial life-span beyond 3 years. Based on the recommendations of the mid-term review of
                         the project in February 2010, to enable the project to achieve its full impact, the closing date of the Grant was extended to June 30, 2012.
