                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives is to slow down the spread of HIV and build up the national capacity to respond to the epidemic by i) behavior change among
                         vulnerable groups at high risk, and ii) improving knowledge of HIV prevention and reducing stigma related to HIV and AIDS in the general population.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Afghanistan HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (AHAPP) is a US$12 million Grant to the Government of Afghanistan. The project is implemented by the Ministry of Public Health's National
                         AIDS Control Program, primarily through contracting NGOs to deliver harm reduction services to HIV most at risk population.

                         The project is making satisfactory progress towards achieving its objectives. Based on modeling, the HIV prevalence is well below 0.1% among the general population. However, the

                         data from the first round of Integrated Behavioral and Biologic Surveillance (IBBS - 2009) financed by the project, indicates a high HIV prevalence of 7.11% among IDUs (the highest
                         being in Herat at 18% without previously available data for comparison; in Kabul city the prevalence has remained 3% which was shown by previous surveys). According to this
                         surveillance, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers and truckers is 0%. It also indicates an HIV prevalence of 0.6% and 1.6% among prisoners in Kabul and in Herat prisons
                         respectively. The results of the round of IBBS will be available by end of November 2012, which will provide information on whether; i) HIV epidemic is slowing down; ii) high risk

                         behavior among high risk groups is decreasing and ; iii) stigma against people living with the HIV/AIDS has decreased or not. HIV harm reduction services are being provided to HIV
                         high risk groups via contractual arrangements with NGOs. The Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) pilot has shown good results in terms of stabilizing the Injecting Drug Users
                         through daily dispensing of methadone. The OST clients will soon be enrolled in to Vocational Training Program under National Skill Development Project of Ministry of Labor, Social
                         Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAD). This will be a crucial step towards successful social re-integration of the drug users. Cooperation with the Ministry of Counter Narcotics
                         (MOCN) regarding methadone importation has not been as successful. The current AHAPP grant will close on June 30, 2012. Since the data of the next round of the IBBS will not be
                         available before November 30, 2012, the team has agreed to extend the closing date of the project for another 5 months so to have sufficient data for evaluation of the project
                         achievements. The Ministry of Public Health and National AIDS Control Program is working on transitioning of the priority activities of the AHAPP grant to be continued under
                         Strengthening Health Activities for Rural Poor Project (health project being financed by the Bank). This means that a number of remaining activities under AHAPP related to harm
                         reduction and HIV prevention can be implemented until September 30, 2013 when SHARP is expected to close.
