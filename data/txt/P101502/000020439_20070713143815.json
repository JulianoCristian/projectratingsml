  contribute to Afghanistan's national development goals\n            of maintaining HIV prevalence below 0.5 percent in the\n            general population and below 5 percent among vulnerable\n            groups at high risk of infection. The project's\n            development objectives are to slow down the spread of HIV\n            and build up the national capacity to respond to the\n            epidemic. This will be accomplished by: (a) behavior change\n            among vulnerable groups at high risk; and (b) improving\n            knowledge of HIV prevention and reducing stigma related to\n            HIV and AIDS in the general population. The project has four\n            components: communications and advocacy activities will aim\n            to increase knowledge of HIV prevention among opinion\n            leaders and the general population, and reduce stigma and\n            discrimination against vulnerable groups at high risk of HIV\n            and AIDS; strengthening HIV surveillance through biological\n            and behavioral surveys and knowledge attitudes and practice\n            studies; targeted interventions for people engaged in high\n            risk behaviors, including injecting drug use and unsafe sex;\n            and program management, capacity building, monitoring and\n            evaluation, and an Innovation Initiative to promote multi\n            sector activities in support of project objectives."}, "docdt": "2007-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
