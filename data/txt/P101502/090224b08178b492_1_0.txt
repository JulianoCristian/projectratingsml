                         The project development objectives is to slow down the spread of HIV and build up the national capacity to respond to the epidemic by i) behavior change among
                         vulnerable groups at high risk, and ii) improving knowledge of HIV prevention and reducing stigma related to HIV and AIDS in the general population.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been implemented by the Ministry of Public Health's National AIDS Control Program, primarily through contracting NGOs to deliver harm reduction services to HIV
                         most at risk population. To date, 98% of the Grant has been disbursed. In order to consolidate Bank financed health projects and avoid multiple projects in the health sector, to
                         ensure continuity of HIV preventive services in the country, the financing of the HIV harm reduction activities have been transferred to one umbrella health project which is
                         Strengthening Health Activities for Rural Poor (SHARP). The NACP has signed new contracts with existing implementing NGOs on single sources basis to finalize the work. The new

                         Based the first round of Integrated Behavioral and Biologic Surveillance (IBBS - 2009), the HIV prevalence is well below 0.1% among the general population. However, the study has
                         found HIV prevalence of 7.11% among IDUs (the highest being in Herat at 18%; in Kabul city the prevalence has remained 3% which was also validated by previous surveys).

                         According to the same surveillance data, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers and truckers was 0%. It also indicated an HIV prevalence of 0.6% and 1.6% among
                         prisoners in Kabul and in Herat prisons respectively. The results of the second round of IBBS will be available by end of November 2012, which will provide information on whether: i)
                         HIV epidemic is slowing down; ii) high risk behavior among high risk groups is decreasing, and iii) stigma against people living with the HIV/AIDS has decreased or not. While this
                         data is not yet available, the Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) pilot has shown good results in terms of stabilizing the Injecting Drug Users through daily dispensing of methadone.
                         The OST clients will soon be enrolled in Vocational Training Program under National Skill Development Project of Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAD).
                         This will be a crucial step towards successful social re-integration of drug users. Cooperation with the Ministry of Counter Narcotics regarding methadone importation has not been as
                         successful.

                         Since its approval in July 2007, the project has contributed to strengthening the capacity of the National Aids Control Program (NACP) through (i) recruitment of seven national
                         advisers and one international adviser; (ii) participation of NACP staff in national/international training activities; and (iii) exposure of NACP staff to well performing HIV/ AIDS
                         programs abroad. The increased capacity of NACP has resulted in the adoption of the Afghanistan HIV Code of Ethics, an important milestone for the support and protection of
                         people living with HIV/ AIDS in the country. The program has also finalized the policy on Opioid Substitution Therapy. The program has successfully managed the HIV harm
                         reduction contracts with national and international NGOs.
