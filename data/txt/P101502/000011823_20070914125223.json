This environmental management plan\n            evaluated potential adverse environmental impacts due to the\n            treatment and disposal of infectious bio-medical waste, such\n            as sharps (infected needles and syringes, IV sets, infected\n            blood, HIV test kits used in VCT centers) related to the to\n            the testing, transportation, treatment and prevention of HIV\n            / AIDS, STI. As a result of this assessment the EA document\n            list the following recommendations : human tissues, organs\n            will be incinerated and buried deep into the ground;\n            microbiology and biotechnology waste from laboratories will\n            be incinerated, local autoclaving and microwave; waste\n            sharps that may cause puncture and cuts (needles, scalpels,\n            blades, glass, syringes, etc.) will be disinfected by using\n            chemical treatment, autoclaving, microwaving and shredding;\n            outdated, contaminated and discarded medicines and Cytotoxic\n            drugs will disposed to secure landfills or incinerated; ash\n            from incineration of any bio-medical waste will be disposed\n            to the local municipal landfill; waste containers should\n            contain freshly prepared disinfectant solution and be kept\n            closed all the time; infected linen in hospitals should be\n            carefully packed in plastic bags and disinfected before\n            being sent for washing, all equipment used for bio-medical\n            waste treatment should be periodically subject to\n            maintenance checks to ensure its correct functioning;\n            barrier protection (gowns, masks, caps, gloves, shoes\n            covers, etc., should be used by workers to prevent contact\n            with contaminated blood and body fluids; conduct a baseline\n            assessment of training needs for health-care workers (HCW)\n            participating in the implementation of the AIDS Control\n            Program; and finally, a log of quantity of waste generated\n            by type, name of waste handler, time of emptying waste\n            container, time of cleaning waste container and pouring\n            disinfectant should be maintained."}, "docdt": "2007-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
