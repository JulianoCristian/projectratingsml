increase the pace of low income\n            shelter construction, and improve health and environmental\n            conditions, primarily in Addis Ababa. It will upgrade\n            existing settlements containing about 8,800 households by\n            providing basic services and house improvement loans, and\n            will also develop about 4,500 new plots for self-help\n            housing construction and community facilities, 1,500 plots\n            for mixed residential and commercial/industrial uses, and\n            250 business plots is small industrial zones. Technical\n            assistance and credit for establishing small enterprises in\n            the industrial sites and business plots are expected to be\n            provided under a proposed fourth development finance company\n            and small scale enterprises project which was appraised in\n            February 1979. About 23,000 households will benefit from the\n            proposed project, of which about 75 percent are estimated to\n            have incomes below Ethiopia's urban poverty threshold."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
