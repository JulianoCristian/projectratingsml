                         The Second Sustainable Employment Development Policy Operation (SEDPO) addresses some of the key constraints to sustainable employment. Specifically, the
                         objectives of SEDPP are to:
                         (i) maintain a stable macroeconomic framework through strengthened budget and fiscal management, and increased transparency and accountability of public
                         expenditures; and
                         (ii) lay institutional and legislative foundations for sustainable employment and growth.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         SEDPO-2 was declared effective on May 15, 2012.
                         The Government of Kosovo submitted a withdrawal application for the grant amount of US$46,132,300.18 (equivalent) on May 23, 2012.
                         The grant closed on May 31, 2012.
                         Given the project closed recently, there are few results that can be shown yet. However, Government continues to implement the medium-term reform agenda supported by
                         SEDPO-2 and progress on the results appears to be heading towards achievement of the intended objectives. The Implementation Completion Report is expected to assess the
                         results achieved.
