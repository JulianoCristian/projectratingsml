F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives

The original Program Development Objectives (PDO) as set out in the Program Document (PD)
were: (i) to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework through strengthened budgetary and
fiscal management, increased transparency and accountability of public expenditures, and (ii) to
lay institutional and legislative foundations for sustainable employment and growth.

The Sustainable Employment Development Policy Program (SEDPP) was designed to support the
Government’s reform agenda under two pillars and six sub-pillars. These were derived directly
from the Government’s reform agenda outlined in the Public Financial Management Reform
Action Plan (PFM RAP) from November 2009 and the Employment Strategy adopted by the
Government in December 2009.


                                                 v
Pillar I: Improvements in Public Financial Management

    Sub-pillar 1: Public Investment Management, Budget Preparation and Execution
    Sub-pillar 2: Wage Bill Management

Pillar II: Laying the Foundation for Sustainable Employment

    Sub-pillar 3: Investment Climate
    Sub-pillar 4: Labor Market Policies, Institutions and Regulations
    Sub-pillar 5: Education, Skills and Training
    Sub-pillar 6: Social Protection

Revised Program Development Objectives (as agreed to by original approving authority)

The program development objectives did not change over the course of SEDPP. However, due to
macroeconomic concerns and unplanned parliamentary elections, the disbursement of the first
operation (SEDPO-1) was delayed until December 2011. Substantial progress in implementing
the structural reforms justified merging the originally planned second and third operation into one
final operation (SEDPO-2). This resulted in certain adjustments to the pillars.

The final pillars of SEDPO-2 were:

  I.    Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial Management
 II.    Investment Climate
III.    Labor Market
IV.     Education, Skills and Training
 V.     Social Protection

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Sustainable Employment Development Policy Program (SEDPP) was a programmatic series of two
Development Policy Operations. The first operation was approved on September 30, 2010 and became
effective on December 15, 2011; the second operation was approved on May 3, 2012 and became
effective on May 15, 2012. The program supported a range of initiatives to promote sustainable
employment and growth.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

SEDPP was developed in the second half of 2008, as Kosovo embarked on a period of political and
economic transition plagued by significant social challenges. Following its unilateral declaration of
independence in February 2008, Kosovo developed democratic institutions and in September 2012 was
released by the International Steering Group from an interim period of “supervised independence.” The
European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) continues to play an important role in Kosovo’s justice,
police and customs systems. Kosovo joined the World Bank and the IMF in 2009. While a viable
candidate for European Union (EU) membership—with a clear integration perspective contained in the
October 2012 Feasibility Study—international recognition of Kosovo remains insufficient to ensure full
UN membership in the foreseeable future (as of October 2012, Kosovo was recognized by 91 out of 193
UN member states). During the project preparation phase, the creation of sustainable employment
opportunities, efforts to build the core functions of a public administration and measures to strengthen
governance were of the highest priority to both Kosovar authorities and the international donor
community.

At the time of SEDPO-1 appraisal, Kosovo’s economic fundamentals appeared solid and the country
registered fairly robust growth rates (above 6 percent annual growth between 2007 and 2008). Even at
the time of the global financial crisis and the subsequent economic slowdown, Kosovo’s economy was
growing above 4 percent annually (except for 2009, when the growth rate was around 3 percent).
However, Kosovo’s growth profile was heavily tilted toward domestic demand, in particular public
investment—financed by the state budget—and non-debt-creating capital inflows from donors and
private consumption fueled by transfers from the Kosovar diaspora in Europe. Two central risks to the
sustainability of such a growth model were identified in the Program Document. First, remittances from
workers abroad were potentially volatile, especially in the context of the economic slowdown in Europe.
And second, fiscal policy—which in Kosovo is the sole tool for macroeconomic management because
the Euro is legal tender—was often hampered by lack of clarity on policy priorities and by ad hoc
adjustments to the budget, all of which posed a threat to sustainable growth.

As noted above, during the project preparation phase Kosovo faced considerable social challenges.
Rapid economic growth had yet to yield significant improvements in living standards. With a GNI per
capita of US$3,290 (Atlas method), a poverty rate close to 34 percent and a high unemployment rate
coupled with low employment rates, Kosovo remained one of the poorest countries in Europe.

In the early stages of SEDPP preparation, Kosovo was emerging from a post-conflict stabilization phase
and moving toward a period of development that allowed for progress toward laying the foundation for
long-term economic growth and poverty reduction. As such, the World Bank’s proposed partnership
with Kosovo—outlined in the Interim Strategy Note from 2008–10—placed greater emphasis on longer-
term development concerns rather than on post-conflict reconstruction, while the Government sought to
replace fragmented donor-driven investment with coordinated budget support and associated technical
assistance. In response to significant improvements in Kosovo’s public expenditures and budgeting

                                                   1
processes, the World Bank and the broader donor community decided during the Kosovo Donor
Conference in July 2008 to offer Kosovar authorities a Development Policy Program. SEDPP, so far the
largest coordinated donor effort in Kosovo, became the flagship vehicle for donor support. Devised to
assist the Government with institutional development, the Program was financed with an IBRD trust
fund in the amount of US$42.9 million in conjunction with 10 bilateral and multilateral donor
contributions of around US$30 million.1 In addition, a US$6.6 million IDA credit was made available to
Kosovo through the Crisis Response Window.

Through SEDPP, which was based on Government-prepared strategies and action plans, the international
community sought to assist Kosovo in its efforts to address key constraints on sustainable growth and
employment generation.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The original Program Development Objectives (PDO) as set out in the Program Document (PD) were: (i)
to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework through strengthened budgetary and fiscal management,
increased transparency and accountability of public expenditures, and (ii) to lay institutional and
legislative foundations for sustainable employment and growth.

SEDPP supported the Government’s reform agenda under two pillars and six sub-pillars. These were
derived directly from the Government’s reform agenda outlined in the November 2009 Public Financial
Management Reform Action Plan (PFM RAP) and the Employment Strategy adopted by the
Government in December 2009.

The Government’s Strategy and the SEDPP pillars and sub-pillars correspond to the so-called MILES
framework, which identifies the following five elements as key to job creation: (i) macroeconomic
stability, (ii) investment climate, (iii) labor market policies, institutions and regulations, (iv) education,
skills and training and (v) social protection policies that provide a safety net but encourage rather than
impede a return to the labor market.

Pillar I: Improvements in Public Financial Management

    Sub-pillar 1: Public Investment Management, Budget Preparation and Execution
    Sub-pillar 2: Wage Bill Management

Pillar II: Laying the Foundation for Sustainable Employment

    Sub-pillar 3: Investment Climate
    Sub-pillar 4: Labor Market Policies, Institutions and Regulations
    Sub-pillar 5: Education, Skills and Training
    Sub-pillar 6: Social Protection

The Key Indicators set out in the first Program Document were the following:

    1. Improved performance in the following Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
       (PEFA) indicators (compared to 2007 and 2009 assessments): PI-1 (aggregate expenditure
       outturn), maintenance of A score for PI-2 (composition of expenditure outturn), PI-12 (multi-
       year perspective in fiscal planning and budgeting) and PI-19 (procurement).
    2. Capital budget execution is more than 90 percent of the approved allocation at the end of the
       program.
    3. Unified and rule-based employee payroll management, measured by linking Human Resources
       Management Information System (HRMIS) and payroll to the Treasury system, and
       improvement in PEFA indicator PI-18 by 2012.

Pillar II: Laying the Foundation for Sustainable Employment

    4. Reduction in the percentage of firms indicating a problem in access to finance, from 55 percent
        to 45 percent.
    5. Reduction in the percentage of firms indicating problems with business licensing and regulation,
        from 47 percent to 37 percent.
    6. Increase in apartments registered with Kosovo Cadastre Agency to 1,000.
    7. Employment Strategy and Action Plan are reflected in the Medium Term Expenditure
        Framework (MTEF).
    8. Elements of the Employment Strategy and Action Plan requiring budgetary allocations are
        reflected in annual budgets.
    9. Employment Strategy and Action Plan are implemented on the expected timetable.
    10. National Qualifications Authority (NQA) initiates accreditation of vocational training
        institutions.
    11. Kosovo Accreditation Agency (KAA) develops guidelines for internal Quality Assurance for all
        public and private higher education institutions.
    12. Social assistance benefits keep up with inflation.
    13. At least 2,000 beneficiaries in welfare-to-work programs.

1.3 Revised PDOs/Key Indicators and Reasons/Justification

Throughout SEDPP, the program development objectives (PDOs) remained unchanged. However,
macroeconomic concerns and unplanned parliamentary elections delayed the disbursement of the first
operation (SEDPO-1) until December 2011. At the December 2011 Concept Note Review meeting for
the subsequent operation it was decided that substantial progress in implementing the structural reforms
justified merging the originally planned second and third operation into one final operation (SEDPO-2).
This resulted in certain adjustments to both the pillars and the key indicators.

Pillar I, Improvements in Public Financial Management in SEDPO-1, was changed to Macroeconomic
Stability and Public Financial Management in SEDPO-2 to place more emphasis on the adequacy of the
macroeconomic framework as a key pre-requisite to any structural reform program.

Pillar II, Laying the Foundation for Sustainable Employment in SEDPO-1, was split into four pillars in
SEDPO-2. These four new pillars—Investment Climate; Labor Market; Education, Skills and Training;
and Social Protection—were sub-pillars in SEDPO-1. The rationale behind this change was to improve
the transparency of the program document and policy matrix, as more prior actions than initially planned
had to be accommodated in the second operation (for a detailed description of changes to the operation
design, triggers and prior actions see section 2.1).




                                                   3
The final pillars for SEDPO-2 were:

  I.    Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial Management
 II.    Investment Climate
III.    Labor Market
IV.     Education, Skills and Training
 V.     Social Protection

To illustrate changes in the structure and timing of SEDPP, the team revised the original Key Indicators.
The number of Key Indicators was reduced from 13 in SEDPO-1 to 11 in SEDPO-2 to reflect
consolidation in the Labor Market pillar, where multiple outcome indicators on separate measures from
the Employment Strategy were replaced with a single indicator referring to the implementation of the
overall Employment Strategy. Most of the changes in the Key Indicators were made to: (i) compensate
for unavailable data (indicators related to PEFA assessments and BEEPS, which were not expected to be
completed by the time of the ICR preparation); (ii) operationalize general outcome indicators to ensure
that they were measurable and could be monitored and verified; and (iii) accommodate changes in the
program design (see Table 1 for details).

The final Key Indicators for SEDPP were the following:

  I.   Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial Management
    1. Deviation of actual from budgeted capital and recurrent expenditure less than 10 percent in more
       than one year between 2009 and 2012 and the variance in capital and recurrent expenditure
       composition overall deviation less than 5 percent in any year between 2009 and 2012.
    2. The 2013 budget includes consolidated procurement to be launched in at least two procurement
       categories in 2013.
    3. Job classification completed for core civil servants working at the central level.

 II.   Investment Climate
    4. Number of days to register a business reduced to 40 days in 2012 from 58 days in 2009.
    5. Banks’ leasing portfolio increased from zero in 2009 to at least €15 million at end-2012.
    6. Governance standards (single shareholder and borrower exposures, resident                   board
       representation) of banks are strengthened.

III.    Labor Market
    7. At least 75 percent of planned measures in the Employment Strategy’s Action Plan for 2011 are
       completed.
    8. At least 33 percent of public works participants are Category II Social Assistance benefit
       recipients in 2011 and in 2012 up from less than 10 percent in 2010, with data on beneficiaries
       disaggregated by gender.

 IV.    Education, Skills and Training
    9. NQA initiates accreditation of at least six vocational training institutions in 2012.
    10. All accredited public and private higher education institutions have established internal quality

 The Key Indicator for the Social Protection pillar in SEDPO-2 PAD was incorrectly worded (Monthly pension and benefits for
children in social assistance beneficiary families have increased by at least EUR 5 and EUR 5 per child per month, respectively,
compared to the level in 2009). The mistake referred to (i) family benefits which are paid on “per family basis” rather than “per
child”, and (ii) wrong reference year—2009 instead of 2008. The SEDPP team clarified that this was purely an editorial
mistake.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The policy areas supported by SEDPP were:

    (i)        Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial Management
               Public finance reforms were intended to improve the quality and efficiency of public
               finances in Kosovo. During SEDPO-1 preparation, the Government was on the verge of
               completing the PEFA self-assessment to identify key bottlenecks to efficient public finance
               management in Kosovo.        Poor budget preparation and execution, unclear public
               procurement processes and weak payroll management in the public sector were among the
               main weaknesses. The Government recognized that effective use of budgetary funds was
               essential to Kosovo’s economic development and greater credibility among international
               donors and investors. The Government sought to achieve this through improved budgetary
               planning and execution, in particular in the area of capital spending, more effective
               expenditure management including payroll expenditures, and more transparent public
               procurement processes. SEDPP facilitated meeting these objectives by supporting actions
               embedded in the PFM Reform Action Plan to improve the legal and regulatory frameworks
               for public financial management, budget and wage bill management as well as public
               procurement.


                                                                     6
   (ii)    Investment Climate
           Structural reforms in the area of private sector development were pursued to improve the
           general investment climate and thereby increase domestic and foreign investment, which
           would in turn increase employment opportunities and incomes. Relative to other European
           countries, Kosovo is ranked low in Doing Business indicators, especially in the areas related
           to starting a business, operational licensing and permits, construction permits and contract
           enforcement. The 2009 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
           (BEEPS) presented similar findings, emphasizing the need for further business environment
           deregulation. In this policy area, SEDPP focused on reforms aimed at improving access to
           finance (SEDPO-1, SEDPO-2) and facilitating new business registration (SEDPO-2).

   (iii)   Labor Markets
           Kosovo faced a two-fold labor market challenge—namely, the quantity and quality of jobs.
           With one of the lowest employment and highest unemployment rates in Europe, sustainable
           employment creation was a key factor influencing Kosovo’s development prospects. At the
           same time, it was important to ensure that the quality of existing jobs struck the right
           balance between worker protection and labor market flexibility. The Government had been
           promoting job creation directly through the Public Works Program for social assistance
           beneficiaries, through actions aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Public
           Employment Services and also indirectly through an adequate labor market legislative
           framework. SEDPP backed these objectives by supporting Government reforms aimed at
           developing new labor legislation governing employer-employee relations and implementing
           the Public Works Program in 2011 and 2012.

   (iv)    Education
           Business sector surveys have indicated that inadequate levels of education and skills are
           among the top impediments for businesses to hire new workers. The Government’s efforts
           in these areas are concentrated on improving the quality and relevance of vocational training,
           adult learning and tertiary education. In this policy area, SEDPP focused on strengthening
           quality assurance mechanisms through the introduction of the National Qualifications
           Framework (NQF) as well as accreditation reviews for higher education institutions and
           vocational training providers.

   (v)     Social Protection
           Prior to 2009, family benefits in Kosovo were kept at a constant level for six years, i.e. since
           2003, and the level of pensions had not been adjusted since 2005. Social protection reforms
           were intended to improve the adequacy of safety net benefits for beneficiaries and provided
           incentives for beneficiaries to transition out of welfare into the workforce. In this context,
           SEDPP supported increases in social assistance benefit levels and coverage as well as
           measures aimed at facilitating welfare-to-work transitions.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

The policy areas were not revised. In SEDPO-1, these five policy areas were arranged under two pillars:
Improvements in Public Financial Management and Laying the Foundation for Sustainable Employment.
In SEDPO-2, the pillars were revised to reflect each of the five policy areas listed above.

1.6 Other Significant Changes

Changes to the Schedule


                                                   7
Originally, SEDPP was envisioned as a series of three operations. The operations were tentatively
scheduled for 2009, 2010 and 2011. Macroeconomic concerns and unplanned parliamentary elections
delayed disbursement for SEDPO-1. In particular, expansionary fiscal policy and lack of expenditure
prioritization undermined the credibility of the Government’s macro-fiscal framework. In addition, the
unplanned parliamentary elections and a slow process of government formation further delayed SEDPO-
1. In such a context, the World Bank decided to withhold the budget support operation. Funding for
SEDPO-1 was eventually disbursed in December 2011 following a correction in fiscal policy stance and
a positive assessment by the World Bank and IMF teams.

The SEDPO-1 disbursement delays did not compromise the momentum behind the Government’s
structural reform agenda. The substantial progress made in meeting indicative triggers for SEDPO-2 and
SEDPO-3 justified merging them into a single operation. This decision was also supported by practical
considerations—any funds not disbursed by June 2012 would have required the World Bank and all 10
donors to extend the grant agreements, which would have been a lengthy and uncertain process given
other competing claims on donors’ budgets.

Changes to the Design
As a result of the delayed disbursement schedule and significant progress on structural reforms, coupled
with trust fund timing considerations, a management decision was taken to combine the second and third
operations into one final operation. Adjustments were made in the program design to merge the key
aspects of the planned SEDPO-2 and SEDPO-3, to reflect faster/slower progress in certain policy actions
and, in some cases, to accommodate the changes in the Government’s priorities. For example, for PFM,
investment climate and labor market reforms progressed according to schedule—or in some cases ahead
of schedule—whereas there were delays in civil service reforms, pledge registry and active labor market
programs. The focus shifted slightly in education, skills and learning as well as in social protection (for
a detailed discussion on the changes to the program design see section 2.1 and Annex 7).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

SEDPP was designed as a programmatic series of three operations to be delivered annually, starting in
2009. However, as explained above, macroeconomic slippages and unplanned parliamentary elections
stalled the declaration of effectiveness of SEDPO-1, delaying disbursement until the end of 2011.
Because the structural reform agenda remained broadly on track, and due to practical and procedural
considerations (see section 1.6), it was decided to merge the remaining two operations into one final
operation.

Merging the originally envisioned second and third operations resulted in certain changes to the program
design (as described in section 1.6) and adjustments to the indicative triggers proposed in SEDPO-1
documentation for the later operations and the actual prior actions for the final operation. The
programmatic nature of the DPO series allowed for adjustments in the indicative triggers to: (i)
accommodate the pace of the Government’s reform process, (ii) accommodate changes in the
Government’s reform priorities and (iii) ensure better clarity and transparency of the overall program.
The Government continued to advance structural reforms as outlined in the SEDPO-1 PD.

The SEDPO-1 documents outlined 22 indicative triggers for the proposed second and third operations.
By the time SEDPO-2 was appraised, 14 of these indicative triggers had been completed and 9 of the
most critical of them became prior actions for SEDPO-2.

                                                    8
       Pillar I (Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial Management): four indicative triggers to
        strengthen transparency and accountability were slightly re-worded and became prior actions;
       Pillar II (Investment Climate): two indicative triggers to reduce barriers to firm entry were
        converted into prior actions;
       Pillar III (Labor Market): two indicative triggers on passage of the Law on Labor and
        implementation of the public works program were converted into prior actions; and
       Pillar V (Social Protection): the indicative trigger on developing a database of social assistance
        beneficiaries was converted into a prior action.

In addition, five new prior actions were identified to reflect the reform momentum and re-orientation in
the Government’s policy priorities. These prior actions, although not envisaged during SEDPO-1
preparation, were important, timely and complementary to achieving SEDPP objectives.

       One prior action was added to Pillar I (Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial
        Management) in the area of civil service reform. Progress in this area lagged due to weak
        technical capacity. As a consequence, none of the indicative triggers were completed by the
        time SEDPO-2 was appraised. To compensate for that, an intermediate step regarding adoption
        of the regulation on civil service job classification was introduced. While this prior action was
        met by the time the operation went to the Board, the accompanying key indicator regarding the
        implementation of the Regulation is not met at the time of the ICR (October 2012).

       Two prior actions were added to Pillar II (Investment Climate) to improve credit reporting and
        strengthen the resilience of the financial sector. In this pillar the reform momentum was strong
        and only one indicative trigger (regarding pledge registry) was not completed by the time of
        SEDPO-2 appraisal. However, the Government remains committed to modernizing the pledge
        registry by the end of 2012. The World Bank–financed Real Estate Cadastre and Registration
        Project is supporting the Government’s efforts in this area.

       Two new prior actions were introduced to Pillar IV (Education, Skills and Training) to increase
        the accuracy of qualifications signaling to employers and quality of vocational training. The
        reforms included in this pillar were re-focused from those indicative triggers outlined in
        SEDPO-1 documentation. The initial plan was to support the development of adult training
        programs. However, the Government’s initiative to include additional stakeholders in the
        consultation process stretched the timeframe of adult training programs beyond SEDPO-2. Two
        new prior actions, highly complementary to the PDOs of SEDPP, were included under this pillar
        in SEDPO-2.

Overall program performance was smooth, with the Government committed to the reform program
despite macro slippages and political concerns that disrupted the intended timeline for SEDPP. All prior
actions for SEDPO-1 and SEDPO-2 were met on time.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Most of the factors affecting implementation of SEDPP were positive and conducive to the program’s
success. The most important of these factors were: the relevance of the program’s content; solid
analytical underpinnings; comprehensive TA activities; donor coordination; and strong Government
ownership. On the other hand, an unstable macroeconomic environment and political changes resulted
in delays and necessitated changes in the program schedule and design.

These factors are described in further detail below:

                                                               11
Relevance of Program’s Content
SEDPP focused on areas of strategic importance for the authorities and donor community, including the
World Bank. Promoting macroeconomic stability and sustainable employment are the areas where the
World Bank had a track record of strong technical capacity and ample cross-country experience. SEDPP
was built around the Government’s program, which drew on the MILES framework. This MILES
framework guided the selection of prior actions, which were concentrated on core aspects of PFM,
investment climate, labor market, education and skills and social protection.

Comprehensive Program of Supporting TA
Given Kosovo’s capacity constraints and relatively new institutions, it was crucial to support the reform
initiatives with a corresponding TA program. SEDPP benefited from significant TA, provided by the
World Bank and other donors that supported SEDPP implementation (see Table 7 for a non-exhaustive
list of relevant TA).

Solid Analytical Underpinnings of the Program
SEDPP was grounded in a strong analytical framework. The World Bank and other donors carried out
extensive analytical work in the areas covered by SEDPP. In particular, Poverty Assessments from 2007
and 2011, as well as Public Expenditure Reviews from 2007 and 2010, were central to determining the
focus of the policy program. SEDPP contents were further informed by HD policy notes covering
education, health, labor markets and social protection policies as well as Kosovo’s Youth Employment
Study. In the area of investment climate, the program built on the Country Economic Memorandum of
2010, which discussed the importance of the investment climate to stimulate sustainable economic
growth. Reforms supported in the PFM pillar benefited from PEFA self-assessment from 2009. The
analytical work was crucial for the selection of the reform areas to be supported by SEDPP and for the
design of specific policy reforms (see Table 4).

Coordination with Development Partners
SEDPP has been the largest donor-coordinated effort in Kosovo to date. The program provided the
opportunity to consolidate and coordinate external partners around a common, Government-owned
program. SEDPP was co-financed by pledges from 10 bilateral and multilateral donors, and raised
US$27 million in grant financing.3 The leveraging of resources also provided a stronger incentive for
the Government to deliver on the agreed triggers, in addition to reducing transaction costs for the
Government. At the same time, close donor collaboration went beyond SEDPP and allowed for better
coordination in other areas as well, such as health policy.

Strong Government Ownership
The program was built around the Government’s own reform agenda—as prior actions and indicative
triggers came directly from its strategic documents—ensuring the Government’s commitment to SEDPP.
To this end, the Program was supported by high-level politicians in Kosovo and coordinated through the
Inter-Ministerial Committee for Sustainable Employment, headed by the Deputy Prime Minister, and
comprising: the Ministries of Trade and Industry; Finance; Labor and Social Welfare; Education;
Science and Technology; and Public Administration. In addition, reforms in the area of Investment
Climate were coordinated by the special Doing Business Task Force and the PFM agenda by the
Government PFM Working Group.

Unstable Macroeconomic and Political Environment
SEDPP experienced successive delays due to macroeconomic concerns and unplanned parliamentary
elections in 2010. After Kosovo’s declaration of independence in 2008, the Government introduced
spending initiatives that put the macroeconomic framework at risk. A Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was
negotiated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2010 and the First Sustainable Employment
Development Policy Operation (SEDPO-1) was submitted to the World Bank Board in September 2010.
However, before the legal agreements could be signed, the governing coalition lost its majority and early

Government of Finland (US$6 million), Government of Italy (US$3.8 million), Government of Norway (US$1.6 million),
Government of Sweden (US$1.1 million), and Government of Switzerland (US$4.2 million).

elections were called. New spending initiatives in the pre-electoral period were not in compliance with
the commitments the Government had made under the SBA. The Government and the IMF agreed on a
six-month Staff Monitored Program (SMP) in July 2011, which was successfully implemented during
the second half of 2011. Upon successful implementation of the SMP, which included agreement on the
2012 budget, SEDPO-1 was disbursed in December 2011. However, despite these delays, structural
reforms supported by SEDPP continued throughout the entire Program period.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The ICR team assesses the Monitoring and Evaluation framework supporting SEDPP implementation to
be broadly adequate. The specific comments to the design, implementation and utilization of M&E
arrangements are laid out below.

Monitoring Design
The program document for SEDPO-1 indicated expected results of the program in two places: the
Operation Policy Matrix and in the text of Table 9 outlining Objectives and Indicators. However, the
two sets of results differ. On the one hand, the Operation Policy Matrix includes indicators related to
Macroeconomic Stability, which are not featured in the Table with Objectives and Indicators; similarly,
the Operation Policy Matrix includes an indicator on the planned increase in apartments registered with
the Kosovo Cadastre Agency, which is not included in Table 9. On the other hand, Table 9 mentions an
indicator related to the establishment of Centers of Competence, which is not included in the Operation
Policy Matrix. Hence, there is no clarity as to which indicators were to be used in the final evaluation of
results. The program document for SEDPO-2 improved the quality of Key Indicators and the Results
Matrix; in particular it (i) established, through the Operation Policy Matrix, a single list of binding Key
Indicators to be used for SEDPP monitoring, (ii) operationalized general outcomes indicators (made
them measurable) to facilitate monitoring and evaluation and (iii) provided baseline values for key
indicators. The design of some of the Key Indicators failed to take into account the timeline for the ICR
preparation—target values of many indicators are set for the end of 2012 (civil service reform,
consolidated procurement, public works program), complicating the assessment of outcomes in this ICR
(for details about Key Indicators see section 1.3).

Monitoring Implementation
SEDPP was monitored through continuous dialogue with Government counterparts to assess progress
and address potential bottlenecks. With many team members in the field, monitoring was done on an on-
going basis and supported by complementary investment projects, TA (see Table 7) and analytical and
advisory activities (AAA) (see Table 4) that aided the design and implementation of the reforms.
SEDPP benefited from eight bilateral and two multilateral trust funds, which helped to underpin the
policy dialogue on the reform program.

Despite the lack of a strong formal M&E system, the Government was proactive in monitoring the areas
critical to prior actions. For example, the SEDPP team was regularly updated on the Employment
Strategy implementation progress. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare would prepare
employment strategy progress reports and share them with the World Bank team. Similarly, the World
Bank was also informed on the progress in the Public Works Program and progress in the
implementation of the PFM RAP.

Monitoring Utilization
Regular monitoring facilitated discussions with the Government and helped to address potential
problems with project implementation in a timely manner. The utilization of M&E arrangements was
adequate.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

At the time of writing of this ICR (October 2012), there is no plan for the World Bank to prepare another
development policy operation for Kosovo to support growth and sustainable employment.

Taking into account the limited IDA resources available for Kosovo, the World Bank’s Strategy
FY12–15 foresees a highly selective new lending program. A main focus of the new lending envelope is
the energy sector with the aim of addressing Kosovo’s energy crisis in a comprehensive way, taking full
account of environmental considerations and mitigating adverse impacts.

As a follow up to SEDPP, the World Bank will provide technical assistance under the programmatic
AAA to the Government to continue reforms in support of a stable macroeconomic framework and to
create sustainable employment.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: High Overall Relevance

The ICR team assesses the overall relevance of objectives, design and implementation as high. The
objectives of the program were highly relevant when the operation was appraised, and they remain
relevant today.

The objectives of the program were relevant at the time of SEDPP preparation. Maintaining a
stable macroeconomic environment and promoting sustainable employment and growth were key
objectives of the Government. In particular, supporting new and fragile institutions in their efforts to
strengthen budgetary and fiscal management, improve accountability of public expenditures and create
pro-growth institutional and legislative foundations were of utmost importance. These strategic
directions were reflected in key Government strategies and documents, including the Employment
Strategy and the PFM RAP. SEDPP supported key pieces of legislation developed based on those
documents and focused on their implementation.

SEDPP was supported by strong ownership within the government and among donors. The
Government was fully committed to the program’s development objectives, which were closely aligned
with Government programs and strategies. The international donor community, including the World
Bank, endorsed Kosovo’s development priorities. The directions of Kosovo’s economic and social
development were discussed and endorsed at the Donor Conference in Brussels in July 2008, when the
decision was made to assist the Government with a budget support operation to strengthen institutional
development and address key constraints on sustainable growth and employment generation. There was
a broad consensus among external stakeholders (including the IMF, EC, USAID and other donors) that
policy interventions focused on strengthening PFM and pursuing structural reforms in the areas of
investment climate, labor market, education and social assistance were crucial for Kosovo’s growth
prospects and EU aspirations. This direction was also in line with the World Bank’s strategic
involvement in Kosovo as reflected in the pillars of the 2008–10 Interim Strategy Notes (Accelerating
Broad-Based and Sustainable Growth and Strengthening Governance, Public Institutions and Social
Cohesion). Although the program was not explicitly foreseen in the ISN, it nevertheless was fully
consistent with World Bank interventions along the envisaged strategic pillars of engagement.



                                                   15
The objectives of SEDPP remain relevant today. The Government of Kosovo reconfirmed its strategy
in the Economic Development Vision Action Plan 2011–14 (EDVAP) from mid-2011. The EDVAP
specified medium-term reform priorities for the following: maintain macroeconomic and fiscal
sustainability, improve the investment climate, develop public infrastructure, revitalize agriculture and
develop human capital. The objectives of SEDPP remain central to the World Bank’s engagement in
Kosovo, as emphasized in the FY 2012–15 CPS, which was presented to the Board in May 2012. The
objectives of the program are relevant for the achievement of the World Bank’s strategic objectives
under Pillar I of the new CPS, Accelerating Inclusive Growth and Employment Generation.

The SEDPP design reflected proper diagnostics undertaken prior to the program preparation and
reflected in the abundant AAA and TA (Table 4, Table 7). While SEDPP was concentrated on areas
of strategic relevance for sustainable job creation, the operations’ design would have benefited from
more selectivity. The extensive array of pillars and measures (e.g. a very broad PFM pillar) was
sometimes difficult to manage both for the counterparts and the World Bank, especially at the
implementation stage.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Achievement of Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

SEDPO-1: Moderately Satisfactory                SEDPO-2: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, according to the ICR team assessment, SEDPP Development Objectives were achieved
albeit with some shortcomings. While SEDPP contributed to strengthening budget and fiscal
management, increasing transparency and accountability of public expenditures, it did not succeed in
maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework throughout the program. On the other hand, by
supporting important legislative changes across many sectors, SEDPP helped to lay institutional and
legislative foundations for sustainable employment and growth. The assessment of the macroeconomic
framework and the progress achieved on the eleven Key Indicators linked to SEDPP pillars are the basis
for evaluation of the Program’s performance.

Macroeconomic Framework

SEDPO-1: Moderately Unsatisfactory              SEDPO-2: Satisfactory

Kosovo’s economy weathered the external shock triggered by the global financial crisis and the
subsequent economic slowdown in the Euro Area. Over the period of SEDPP, economic growth
averaged around 4 percent (2008–2012). The country’s solid growth performance owed much to robust
domestic demand, which was buttressed by higher government spending as well as remittances and non-
debt creating capital inflows from the diaspora. At the same time, Kosovo’s small export base limited
the impact of weak demand in trading partner countries. Provided the external situation does not
deteriorate further, the outlook for Kosovo’s growth is positive—the GDP growth forecast in 2013–2015
is around 4 percent.

Kosovo’s limited integration into cross-border financial markets helped to shield the financial
sector. Despite being dominated by foreign banks (around 90 percent of total assets are under foreign-
owned bank management), Kosovo’s financial sector remained stable during the 2008 financial crisis
and in the post-crisis period. The key factors supporting the resilience of the Kosovar banking sector
were: (i) a prudent funding structure, which predominantly relied on domestic deposits, (ii) limited

                                                   16
exposure to cross-border financial transactions and (iii) Central Bank measures to prevent the transfer of
funds from local to parent banks. As a consequence, in 2012 Kosovo’s banking sector is liquid, well-
capitalized and profitable. Average capital adequacy stood at 18 percent at end-April, compared to the
regulatory minimum of 12 percent, while the share of nonperforming loans was at the moderate level of
6 percent. Banks had conservative credit-to-deposit ratios of about 80 percent and substantial excess
liquidity.

Kosovo’s fiscal position was strong at the beginning of SEDPP—later it deteriorated, but it has
gradually improved since mid-2011.4 Kosovo started off with almost no public debt, sustainable social
security systems, primary surpluses and sizeable cash buffers. From 2008, however, the government
adopted an expansionary fiscal stance, reflecting inter alia an ambitious highway construction program
and higher social spending. Kosovo’s macroeconomic framework went off-track. An SBA with the
IMF in 2010 restored the confidence in the Government macro and fiscal plans, but soon thereafter
political instability and an early election once again put the macroeconomic and fiscal framework at risk.
Spending initiatives of the new government were not in compliance with the commitments under the
SBA, which was consequently dropped. As a result, the fiscal deficit reached 2.6 percent of GDP in
2010, from a 7 percent surplus in 2007. In July 2011, the Government and the IMF agreed on a six-
month Staff Monitored Program (SMP), once again allowing for a satisfactory rating of the
macroeconomic framework. The fiscal deficit was reduced to around 1.9 percent of GDP and the
authorities took further measures to strengthen budgetary planning and execution. Under the April 2012
SBA, the Government is committed to restoring a sustainable fiscal stance by 2014.

Overall, the adequacy of Kosovo’s macroeconomic framework was not maintained throughout the
SEDPP timeframe, although it was on track at the time of SEDPO-1 and SEDPO-2 appraisal. The
IMF program went off-track twice under SEDPO-1, when expansionary fiscal policy triggered by
political considerations put public finances on an unsustainable path. The credibility of fiscal policy was
restored under SEDPO-2. In October 2012, the IMF reached a staff-level agreement on the Second
Review under the SBA and concluded that macroeconomic and financial policies were broadly on track
and that all quantitative performance criteria under the IMF’s program had been met.

Progress on Key Indicators

Out of 11 Key Indicators, eight indicators are met, one is partially met, and two are not met.

       Eight indicators related to the Labor Market, Education, Skills and Training and Social
        Protection pillars are all met.
       Two out of three indicators related to Investment Climate are met. The indicator related to the
        Doing Business Report—the number of days needed to set up a business—is partially met.
       One out of three indicators related to Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial
        Management is met. The indicator related to civil service reform is not met at the time of
        writing of this ICR (October 2012) and it is difficult to predict if the deadline for the completion
        of the job classification exercise (December 2012) will be met. The process is ongoing and the
        authorities from the Ministry of Public Administration, supported by DFID and the World Bank
        are working on its completion. The indicator related to consolidated public procurement
        remains unmet at the time of this ICR and appears to be at risk of not being met by the end of
        2012.

 In June 2011, Kosovo reached an agreement with the IMF on the Staff Monitored Program (SMP); in June 2012 the IMF
Board approved a 20-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).

Pillar I: Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial Management

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall SEDPP performance in Macroeconomic Stability and Public Financial Management was
moderately unsatisfactory, with one area performing strongly while progress in the other two areas was
slower. Within this pillar, SEDPP focused on public financial management (satisfactory), public
procurement (moderately unsatisfactory) and civil service reform (moderately unsatisfactory).

SEDPP supported Government activities aimed at eliminating key weaknesses to effective public
expenditure management in Kosovo. The PFM system hitherto had been characterized by: (i) low
budget credibility due to major capital projects and salary expenditure commitments outside the MTEF;
(ii) budget under-execution, especially for capital expenditures; (iii) insufficient linkage between
strategic planning and budget preparation, including at the line ministry level; (iv) weak procurement
capacity and low value-for-money results; and (v) poor payroll management owing to unbudgeted pay
increases and the lack of a civil service pay grade structure that hindered effective wage bill planning
and controls. Those weaknesses resulted in large deviations of current and capital spending outturns as
compared to legislated budget amounts, and were among the factors that led to uncontrolled fiscal
expansion in 2009.

Over the course of SEDPP, the Government made strides in improving PFM quality and positive
results were achieved. Following the PEFA self-assessment in 2009, the Kosovar Government drafted
and endorsed the Public Finance Management Reform Action Plan (PFM RAP). With this Plan the
Government took ownership of the financial management reforms. The plan covered a wide spectrum of
PFM reforms organized around five platforms: (i) a credible and sustainable PFM policy-setting process;
(ii) a credible budget development process, which delivers reliable and predictable resources; (iii)
improved budget execution and controls, including internal controls and accountability; (iv) improved
linkages between policy and priority setting, managing for program results and budget planning and
implementation; and (v) integration of accountability, review and policy-setting processes with regard to
both financial and program performance management. The approval of the Plan became a SEDPO-1
prior action and the subsequent implementation of its other key reform measures was chosen for
SEDPO-2 actions.

The measures from the PFM RAP have resulted in a significant improvement in the preparation
and execution of the budget. Under the SEDPP timeframe, the budget planning processes benefited
from: (i) the establishment of the Strategic Planning Office in 2010 under the Prime Minister’s Office to
support links between the Government priorities and the MTEF; (ii) incorporation of forward estimates
for the outlying years in MTEF ceilings and the budget circulars to strengthen the medium-term fiscal
perspective; and (iii) completion of the strategic public expenditure review in 2011, which improved
expenditure prioritization. Capital budgeting was strengthened by the new requirement to fully integrate

                                                               19
the Public Investment Program (PIP) processes with the MTEF and by the introduction of regular
reporting on the progress of capital expenditures execution (both financial and physical). As part of this
effort, all capital projects undergo rigorous and comprehensive analysis before they are submitted for the
Cabinet’s consideration. An important outcome of SEDPP support was therefore more effective
planning and execution of the budget, as reflected in a reduction in deviation and variance between the
legislated budget and the actual execution (Figure 1). As a result, the credibility and predictability of
fiscal policy increased, which are significant achievements in a post-conflict country with very new
institutions.

The Government has also made progress in increasing the performance orientation of the budget.
SEDPO-2 supported the introduction of performance information into the budget documentation. In the
course of the preparation of the 2011 budget, all budget holders were requested to prepare their
expenditures in programmatic structure (i.e. develop a new program-based budget classification), and in
2012 they were required to present program performance indicators along with their budget submissions.
While this information is still far from adequate for reporting on policy outcomes, it nevertheless
represents an important step in improving PFM performance in Kosovo.

Changes to the legal basis for procurement processes are now largely complete, but there are
problems with implementation. The revised Public Procurement Law (PPL) from October 2011
significantly increased the compatibility of Kosovar procurement procedures with EU regulations.
According to the World Bank’s assessment5, the current PPL adequately reflects the main principles of a
sound public procurement system and is consistent with international good practices in public
procurement. One of its key achievements was to transform the Public Procurement Agency (PPA) from
an independent agency reporting to the Assembly (Kosovar Parliament), with mixed roles and
responsibilities, to a centralized purchasing agency—the Central Procurement Agency (CPA)—within
the MoF responsible for conducting centralized procurement. Centralized procurement was expected to
result in substantial fiscal savings owing to economies of scale, and elimination of the current price
distortions noted in contracts signed by different contracting authorities. Adoption of secondary
legislation to the PPL and the Rules of Procedure for the Central Procurement Agency, both actions
supported under SEDPP, represent vital steps toward conducting the first centralized purchase. However,
the Government is moving very slowly to address capacity constraints at the CPA and move forward

with centralized procurement. It is therefore unclear if the Government will carry out consolidated
procurement in 2013.

Implementation of the civil service reform has been slow, but some progress was made toward the
end of SEDPP. The original goal was two-fold: (i) to establish legislative foundations for the creation
of a professional civil service and (ii) to strengthen public sector wage bill management through grading
reform and enhancements to the payroll processes. While SEDPP achieved the first objective, progress
on the second has been slower. Nevertheless from the point of view of the operation design, the idea of
supporting not only legislative changes, but also actual implementation, even if the latter was not fully
successful, is still commendable. In the first stage, two Laws on Civil Servants and on Salaries of Civil
Servants were drafted and passed by the Assembly in June 2010. Those laws provided the basic
conditions for a stable, unified and professional civil service by defining the civil service, the rights and
obligations of civil servants and establishing a uniform pay and grading structure. In the second stage,
the Government sought to focus on the implementation of those laws. However, insufficient capacity in
the Ministry of Public Administration (implementing agency) and lengthy elections processes led to
implementation delays. In addition, concerns about fiscal sustainability and the substantial budgetary
costs of the civil service reform put progress in this area on hold. Toward the end of SEDPP, the
momentum increased with the approval of several articles of secondary legislation. The Regulation of
Jobs in Civil Service, supported by SEDPO-2, established new pay and grading structures. Job
classification for core civil servants is ongoing—currently the special commission, comprised of
representatives from the Ministry of Public Administration and the Ministry of Finance, is collecting and
reviewing proposals for jobs classification. The commission is expected to finalize its work by the end
of December 2012, so that the new salary scales could apply from January 2013 onward. DFID is
working with central ministries to assist with this task and the World Bank will continue to monitor and
support progress in this area through the Public Sector Modernization Project. The ICR timeline makes
it impossible to assess if the exercise will be completed by December 2012.

The scope for further improvements to the PFM system in Kosovo is large. Looking ahead, the
Government is planning a PEFA assessment for 2013 to assess progress to date and provide guidance for
further reforms of the PFM systems.

Pillar II: Investment Climate


Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In the Investment Climate pillar, the ICR’s assessment is that SEDPP performance was moderately
satisfactory in achieving its outcomes and objectives of improving the business environment and turning
Kosovo into a more attractive place for private sector–led investment. The specific interventions
supported by SEDPP included removal of regulatory barriers to enterprise start-up and operations
(moderately satisfactory), increasing options for access to finance (satisfactory), and safeguarding
stability of the financial sector (satisfactory).

Improving the business climate has been among the Government’s top priorities. Supporting
investment climate reforms is one of the cornerstones of the Government’s December 2009 Employment
Strategy and one of the key elements that is identified in the international experience to promote growth.
In addition, the Action Plan for the Government’s strategic document—Economic Vision of Kosovo
2011–2014—includes direct references to Kosovo’s ambition of becoming one of the top 40 Doing
Business destinations by 2014. This agenda has been supported by the highest level politicians in
Kosovo, including the Prime Minister, and such political leadership has already translated into positive
impact on the ground. In mid-2011, a special intergovernmental Task Force on Doing Business was
established to coordinate reform efforts in this area. It consists of several sub-groups dedicated to
selected aspects of the reform agenda (so-called indicator working groups), e.g., working group on
Starting a Business or working group on Dealing with Construction Permits. While the Task Force
provides political support for reforms and promotes Doing Business reforms within the Government, the
Parliament and the public, the indicator working groups are responsible for technical work.

Regulatory reforms have streamlined business procedures and improved the legal framework for
investment. So far, the Government’s Doing Business Task Force has prepared a package of 12 laws to
reduce the costs of setting up a business, unifying business registries and simplifying the licensing

                                                              22
system. Eleven laws have been passed (including on business organization, cadastre, reporting and
auditing, establishment of immovable property right registers, external trade, management and control of
state borders, construction and the customs code). The remaining law on execution procedure, which
strengthens contract enforcement, is expected to be enacted before the end of 2012. The Law on
Business Organizations and the Law on Internal Trade, both supported by SEDPO-2, simplified and
accelerated business registration in Kosovo. In particular: (i) the centralized business registration office
in Pristina was complemented with Municipal Business Centers serving as one-stop shops for businesses
(by October 2012 there were 25 one-stop shops in Kosovo); (ii) work permits for entrepreneurs were
eliminated; and (iii) registration fees and charter capital requirements for limited liability companies
(LLCs) were reduced.

The successes of the business regulatory reforms are reflected in the number of new businesses
being registered, which in the first nine months of 2012 are 75 percent higher than in 2008 and
2009. While the Doing Business indicator—which is used in this ICR to evaluate the progress of
regulatory reform—has shown less improvement than anticipated, the significant advancements in this
area are apparent. Since the changes in the legal framework were introduced, registering businesses in
Kosovo is cheaper, easier and quicker. This has already contributed to an increase in the number of new
businesses in Kosovo. Business registration has increased steadily since 2010. In 2010, 936 new
businesses were registered in Kosovo; in 2011, the number of newly registered entities increased by
around 15 percent to around 1,070; and in the first 9 months of 2012, close to 1,400 new businesses were
registered (an increase of 24 percent as compared to 2011), the majority of them being LLCs (Figure 2).

A market for leasing machinery and equipment has been established in Kosovo as a result of
SEDPP. The Leasing Law of June 2009, supported by SEDPO-1, provided an attractive alternative for
credit-constrained enterprises to obtain new machinery and equipment and continue business expansion
without traditional bank borrowing. Currently, there are two financial institutions in Kosovo that
provide individuals and businesses with leasing services. By the end of July 2012, the active leasing
portfolio exceeded €20 million, from zero in mid-2009 and preceding years (Figure 3).

Improvements to the functioning of Kosovo’s Cadastre Agency decreased uncertainty about
property and land use rights. Weak property rights were identified as one of the key constraints to
Doing Business in Kosovo. Uncertainty about land use rights particularly affected foreign investors who
suffered informational disadvantages as compared to domestic investors. This was a direct consequence
of war, when many land tenure documents were destroyed or removed to Serbia. As a result, only a

                                                                23
      fraction of the land was registered in the Immovable Property Rights Registry (IPRR), often making the
      determination of ownership of a given property difficult. SEDPO-1 endorsed a strategy and business
      plan for Kosovo’s Cadastre Agency, which included advancements in the IPRR to improve the cadastre
      legal and institutional framework and provide better services for its clients. By launching the use of
      specialized IT solutions, Kosovo’s Cadastre Agency increased its effectiveness and streamlined the
      process of property registration, including registering apartments, which were not covered by official
      registration. This led to increases in the number of registered transactions from around 55,000 in 2009 to
      more than 74,000 in August 2012 (see Figure 4) and accelerated development of the property market in
      Kosovo. It also positively affected access to financing, as registered property could be used as collateral
      for obtaining credit. The value of mortgages registered in the new system increased from €540 million
      in 2010 to around €870 million in 2011. Further advances in this area are supported by the World Bank
      through the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project.

      Amid the worries about insufficient financial sector supervision in the Euro Area countries in the
      run-up to the sovereign debt crisis, Kosovo’s Government made strides in safeguarding financial
      sector stability. 6 Although Kosovo’s financial sector has remained well-capitalized, liquid, and
      profitable throughout the escalation of the financial crisis, the legal framework for supervision and
      regulation had to be upgraded to further bolster the stability of the banking sector, which is the
      cornerstone of the overall macroeconomic stability. Several legal initiatives—Credit Reporting
      Regulation, Banking and Microfinance Law, both supported by SEDPO-2 and the Deposit Insurance
      Law—have strengthened stability and governance standards of financial institutions and enhanced the
      resilience of the financial sector. In particular, the Banking and Microfinance Law of April 2012
      strengthened provisions for corporate governance within banks, introduced banks’ exposure limits to
      large borrowers and provided a comprehensive framework for efficient resolution of troubled financial
      institutions. The Deposit Insurance Law of June 2012 further streamlined procedures to deal with
      troubled banks, including permitting the use of resources from the deposit insurance fund for purchase
      and assumption transactions. Finally, the February 2012 Credit Reporting Regulation improved
      borrowers’ rights and access to individual credit history.

        A stronger legal framework for financial regulation and supervision and equipping the central bank with the necessary funds
      for emergency liquidity assistance are among the key objectives of the I MF’s April 2012 SBA for Kosovo.

                                                                               24
Within the SEDPP timeline, Kosovo’s overall business climate has improved, as indicated by the
Doing Business rankings. In Doing Business (DB) 2012 Kosovo ranked 126 out of 183 countries.
Since then its overall rank rose 28 places and according to the DB13 Kosovo was ranked 98. Kosovo
made double-digit jumps in the categories of Protecting Investors, Starting a Business and Dealing with
Construction Permits. In particular, the Doing Business Report recognized Kosovo’s progress in
Starting a Business, where its position improved by 44 ranks due to eliminating the minimum capital
requirement and business registration fee and streamlining the business registration processes. While
there were basically no major negative shifts in the indicators, little or no improvement was made in
Registering Property, Enforcing Contracts and Resolving Insolvency.

Pillar III: Labor Market

Rating: Satisfactory

In the Labor Market pillar, SEDPP actions were aimed at creating a legal and administrative framework
conducive to effective functioning of labor market institutions as well as short-term measures aimed at
creating employment opportunities. The Program performance was satisfactory in terms of achieving
its outcomes and objectives. This reflects satisfactory performance in implementing Employment
Strategy and satisfactory performance of the Public Works Program.

Significant progress was made in terms of an improved policy framework. The Government set up
an inter-ministerial committee on sustainable employment to develop an Employment Strategy and
coordinate cross-sectoral reform efforts related to employment policies.9 The committee, supported by a
technical working group, elaborated the Employment Strategy and the Monitoring Action Plan
(supported by SEDPO-1), which became a central framework document guiding reforms in the
employment sector. The strategy outlined the key labor market constraints to be addressed by 2012,
particularly in the area of (i) investment climate, (ii) education, skills and training system, and (iii) labor
market institutions, regulations and policies. Judging from the Government’s progress reports and close
supervision performed on a continuous basis by World Bank staff, implementation of the strategic
measures is largely on track (for detailed actions see Table 6). First, in the area of investment climate,
the Government made significant progress on reforming the legal and regulatory framework for

  Social assistance is provided to vulnerable groups under two categories: Category I households are those households with no
adult family members who are capable of working, and Category II households are those with at least one member of the
household capable of working who is registered as unemployed with the Public Employment Services (PES), and with at least
one child under the age of 5 or an orphan under the age of 15.

  The Committee included the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Education, Science and
Technology, the Minister of Labor and Social Welfare and the Minister of Trade and Industry.

businesses, supporting business infrastructure investment and access to finance. The Government made
efforts to improve business infrastructure for the Business Park in Drenas and launched procedures for
setting up a business incubator in the Gjakova municipality. Progress has been slower in the area of
market information and skill base for small businesses (see also Section 3.2, Investment Climate).
Second, in the area of education, skills and training, the Government has successfully implemented
important measures aimed at increasing the quality of higher and vocational education and making the
transition from school to the labor market easier. In particular, it established two Centers of Competence
(CoC) to train students in the areas of construction and public administration. Currently, each of those
CoCs has about 200 students. Two new CoCs focusing on nursery and trade are currently under
construction (see Section 3.2, Education, Skills and Training). Third, significant measures were
implemented in the area of labor market institutions, regulations and policies. Steps were taken to
strengthen the legal framework (approval of the new Labor Code), create jobs through a targeted Public
Works Program (PWP) and improve the functioning of the Public Employment Services (PES). In
particular, the creation of the Registry of Unemployed represents an important step toward better labor
market information and more effective services in the Employment Offices. The transition from paper-
based records of unemployed to a fully digitized database helped to distinguish active job seekers from
passive ones (the initial results show that around 95,000 registered unemployed are actively looking for a
job, from 336,000 paper-based records). In the next few months, the software upgrade of the database
will allow linking of job-seekers from the Registry of Unemployed with the vacancies from the
employers’ database.

The adoption of the Labor Code strengthened the legal framework. The Law (supported by
SEDPO-2) was approved in November 2010. It represents a significant achievement of a new
government to protect workers from exploitation while maintaining labor market flexibility in terms of
hiring and firing. The approved version of the Labor Law was largely successful in balancing worker
protection considerations, which were aggressively demanded by trade unions, and ensuring that the
environment is conducive to job creation. On maternity benefits, though, the Labor Code is more
generous than ILO recommendations, which may lead to lower female employment rates. The
implementation of the Labor Law will require close monitoring and continuous capacity-building efforts
by the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare and Labor Inspectorate beyond the timeframe of SEDPP.
To create immediate employment opportunities and encourage a transition from welfare or
unemployment to work, the Government launched the Public Works Program. As part of the
Employment Strategy, the Government established a targeted program to provide labor-intensive work
opportunities for the poor. The PWP was launched in the second half of 2011. The project attracted
considerable attention from local municipalities. Out of 96 project applications, 44 were selected for
financing from 29 Kosovo municipalities. During the project preparation and execution phase, one
project was cancelled due to delays with the tendering processes. Since certain savings were generated
(the actual contract amounts were lower than expected), six additional projects were appraised. By
December 2011, the MLSW allocated close to €3 million for this program. It generated temporary
employment opportunities for about 1,800 people (including 1,200 recruited through Employment
Offices, 34 percent of them being social assistance active and passive beneficiaries). Building on the
success of the 2011 program, the Government continued the PWP in 2012. A similar budget envelope to
2011 (€ 3.0 million) enabled providing employment for 3169 people – around 46 percent of them being
social assistance category II beneficiaries.

Pillar IV: Education, Skills and Training


Rating: Satisfactory

With respect to the Education, Skills and Training pillar, SEDPP’s overall performance has been
satisfactory. While the most important cause of unemployment in Kosovo is low labor demand, the
lack of relevant skills limits the ability of many people to obtain employment and to perform the tasks
required by employers. The specific policy actions supported by SEDPP were geared toward creating a
framework to ensure the high quality of education services.

Under SEDPP, the Government has made significant progress in increasing and controlling the
quality of education services. Building on the actions included in the Government’s Employment
Strategy and Kosovo’s Education Strategic Plan (KESP), SEDPP supported the accreditation process of
all of Kosovo’s higher education institutions (SEDPO-1, SEDPO-2) and contributed to the development
of the quality assurance mechanisms for vocational training institutions (SEDPO-2). In the area of
higher education, the Kosovo Accreditation Agency (KAA) successfully conducted the accreditation
process of 13 providers of higher education and launched regular monitoring of the accredited units. In
addition, all accredited institutions established internal quality assurance mechanisms in line with
guidance received from KAA.

Building on the success of the accreditation process of higher education institutions, SEDPO-2 put
emphasis on strengthening the quality of vocational training institutions and supporting the
school-to-work transition. The main idea was to create a framework for integrating qualifications
provided for both young people and adults by different institutions within and outside formal education.
As part of the process, the Government developed a National Qualifications Framework consistent with
the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and jointly with the National Qualifications Authority
(NQA) set occupational standards and accreditation criteria for vocational training units. The
accreditation process was rolled out and, by the end of May 2012, training providers were identified in
the areas of agriculture, construction and business administration. Of 14 training providers, 11 were
accredited (one private and 10 public), one provider was denied accreditation and the remaining two
were asked to implement NQA recommendations and will be granted accreditation next year. The
process is expected to lead to greater training opportunities for those whose skills do not match the
current needs of the labor market and transparency of qualifications. In addition to providing signaling

to employers on qualifications of potential hires, the alignment with the EQF is expected to increase
labor mobility in the long run.

SEDPP’s focus on quality of education services was supplemented by a broad spectrum of
education actions supported by the ongoing Institutional Development for Education Project . This
World Bank–financed TA project is aimed at strengthening the organization and financing of the
education system in Kosovo, building institutions and management capacities to promote quality
improvements, creating conditions to introduce efficient design and reduce multiple shifts in Kosovo’s
schools and strengthening management capacity at the institutional level for higher education.


Pillar V: Social Protection


Rating: Satisfactory

In the Social Protection pillar, SEDPP supported the Government in increasing pensions and social
assistance benefit levels to provide a better safety net for the poor, especially in the context of the global
financial crisis. The Program outcome was achieved and allows for assessing this pillar as satisfactory.

Low levels of pensions and social assistance benefits, as well as lack of adjustment mechanisms,
have gradually eroded the adequacy of those basic benefits. Prior to the 2009 increase, family
benefits in Kosovo were kept at a constant level for six years, i.e. since 2003, and the level of pensions
had not been adjusted since 2005. While the inflation rate was moderate in recent years, the sharp
increase in the food prices eroded real incomes, in particular those of pensioners and social assistance
beneficiary families, as food constitutes a large share of their expenditures. In addition, the crisis-related
slowdown in economic growth put more families in need of social assistance support. The generally low
level of benefits (€35 per month for a single-person household with a maximum of €75 for a household
with 7 or more members, and €40 per pensioner) and lack of adjustment mechanisms widened the gap
for many beneficiaries between the poverty line and their consumption.

In spite of the tight fiscal envelope, the Government decided to strengthen the social protection
system by increasing the benefit levels. A €5 increase in the amount of family benefits helped to
increase the average benefit from €61 in 2008 to €66 in 2012. At the same time, pension benefits
increased from €40 in 2008 to €45. The Government’s decision to increase the benefit levels (measure
supported by SEDPO-1) provided an additional safety net and helped to mitigate the adverse impact of
the crisis-related slowdown. As a result of this decision, around 35,000 families, who were family

  As noted in the ICR, the Key Indicator for the Social Protection pillar in SEDPO-2 PAD was incorrectly worded (Monthly
pension and benefits for children in social assistance beneficiary families have increased by at least EUR 5 and EUR 5 per
child per month, respectively, compared to the level in 2009 ). The mistake referred to (i) family benefits which are paid on “per
family basis” rather than “per child”, and (ii) wrong reference year—2009 instead of 2008. The SEDPP team clarified that this
was purely an editorial mistake.

                                                               33
benefit recipients, have benefited from increased transfers. The increase in pension benefits resulted in
higher benefits for around 107,000 old-age pensioners and close to 20,000 disability pensioners.

SEDPO-2 supported the Government’s efforts aimed at digitizing social assistance registries. The
Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare put in place a new information system with data on social
assistance beneficiaries. The database was linked with corresponding databases of tax and employment
offices, which will help to better monitor the social assistance recipients. This digitized registry is a key
reform in a country with limited data availability because it allows information on able-bodied social
assistance recipients to be compared with the database of employment offices to support the welfare-to-
work transition. In addition, the new data exchanges with tax offices will help to diminish the leakage of
SA benefits to non-eligible people. The system has already identified around 1,400 families whose
members were social assistance recipients, despite having a regular job with income.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

SEDPO-1: Moderately Satisfactory                SEDPO-2: Moderately Satisfactory

According to the ICR team, the rating of the achievement of development outcomes of SEDPP is
moderately satisfactory, albeit with considerable variation across subcomponents. The overall
assessment is on balance positive, both because the program was significant and largely implemented as
planned and because none of the measures supported by SEDPP have been reversed. By the end of the
program, while the outstanding reform agenda remains significant, the institutional and policy
foundations for future reforms are stronger in each of the pillars. The “moderate” label is therefore
attached because the program’s achievements have at times been accompanied by macroeconomic
concerns and implementation delays in two particularly challenging areas of civil service and
procurement.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

SEDPP was clearly intended to benefit the poor directly by creating employment opportunities for
those currently out of work. In addition, the Program indirectly supported poverty alleviation through
the implementation of the medium-term structural reforms to improve the business environment,
strengthen the quality of vocational education and improve labor market institutions.

The Program Documents for SEDPO-1 and SEDPO-2 rightly anticipated that the horizon of
SEDPP is too short to have a quantifiable impact on poverty, gender and social development by
the time of the ICR. While the gains are difficult to measure, the nature of the interventions supported
by SEDPP anticipated small but positive impacts, particularly through the direct impact of changes to the
social assistance system and the launching of a Public Works Program.

       Reforms to the social protection system: SEDPP directly supported increases in the level of
        pensions and social assistance benefits. In the case of social assistance, the 2009 increase was
        the first one since 2003. The average benefit level increased from around €61 in 2008 to close to
        €66 in 2012. Around 35,000 families, comprising 150,000 individuals, have benefited from
        increased transfers. The PSIA projected that this would reduce poverty by 0.1 percentage points.
        The increase in pension benefits (by €5 per beneficiary) was estimated to have reduced poverty
        by 0.5 percentage points. Around 107,000 old-age pensioners and close to 20,000 disability
        pensioners benefited from the increase.
       Public Works Program: A positive poverty impact occurred from increased labor activation
        for able-bodied Category II Social Assistance recipients. Increased activation through stricter
        work requirements, supported by expanded public works, provided immediate employment
        benefits for 625 poor individuals in 2011 and close to 400 by October 2012, at a pay rate higher
        than Category II Social Assistance benefits. Employment through public works also allowed
        these existing Category II Social Assistance recipients to expand their work experience and
        improve future employment prospects, while still allowing them to return to social assistance if
        unable to find longer-term employment.

Reforms aimed at improving the business environment, strengthening links between education and
the labor market and establishing labor market institutions have indirectly supported poverty
alleviation and their impact is likely to materialize over the medium term.

                                                   35
       Reforms to improve the business climate—such as the creation of one-stop shops for business
        registration, easing requirements for business start-ups and harmonizing business numbers
        across the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), customs and tax administration—are expected
        to increase domestic and foreign business investment, which will in turn increase employment
        opportunities and raise incomes. Actions that emphasize easing business registration outside of
        Pristina should enhance their poverty-reducing impact. Given that female-owned firms have a
        more negative perception about the business climate in Kosovo (BEEPS, 2009), this reform
        should have a particularly positive impact on firms run by women entrepreneurs.
       Reforms to vocational education training are likely to improve training opportunities and
        employment outcomes as workers build skills to meet labor force demands.
       Reforms to labor market institutions, in particular the approval of the new Labor Code, provide
        reasonable protection for workers (e.g., prohibiting discrimination based on gender and
        disability, forced or compulsory labor, child labor, etc.) and at the same time do not increase the
        employers’ hiring and firing costs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The World Bank’s assistance to Kosovo under SEDPP supported numerous reforms aimed at
institutional strengthening across SEDPP pillars. In fact, laying institutional and legislative
foundations for sustainable employment and growth was a central element of the PDO with a strong
emphasis on implementation.

SEDPP was an effective vehicle to support inter-government coordination—a goal that is sought
under many projects, but not very often achieved. The cross-sectoral nature of the Sustainable
Employment operation provided the incentive for government agencies to coordinate efforts aimed at
meeting the identified triggers. A number of inter-ministerial working groups were formed to coordinate
reform momentum, e.g., the Sustainable Employment Committee, the Doing Business Task Force and
the PFM Working Group. Building on the success of enhanced inter-ministerial collaboration achieved
through SEDPP, the Council for Economic Development at the Prime Minister’s Office was formed as
an advisory body responsible for economic issues.

The development policy operations allowed the Government to establish its own priorities and
supported Kosovo’s growing independence from the donor community. The Government’s ability
to articulate its priorities, communicating them to both donors and civil society, and in turn gaining their
support, were important steps in institution-building in this new and fragile state.

Technical Assistance activities under the umbrella of SEDPP have had a more direct impact on
institutional development than the budget support. The World Bank and other donors supported the
authorities with technical assistance activities, which were designed to help implement legislative
changes embedded in SEDPP (Table 7).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Substantial

SEDPO-1: Substantial            SEDPO-2: Substantial

According to the ICR team assessment, the risk of either policy reversals or not maintaining the
outcomes in the areas supported by SEDPP is substantial (although these risks have not materialized
yet).

The risks identified for SEDPO-1 primarily concerned macroeconomic and political stability as
well as risks related to limited capacity in program implementation. This assessment turned out to
be correct, as the risks largely materialized. The July 2010 IMF Stand-by Agreement was not enough of
a counterweight to offset the political volatility induced by unexpected new elections, which undermined
macro policy expectations and thus caused a protracted delay in implementing SEDPP. In addition,
Kosovo’s limited capacity in program implementation could not be mitigated for larger, more complex
program activities, such as the Civil Service reform. However, the flexibility of the Program approach
permitted more institutional gains to be achieved, given the slower, more deliberate pace of reforms. A
public information campaign was instrumental in explaining why some actions were taken and others
postponed, especially in mitigating political demands for more benefits to be financed by labor taxes,
which made it difficult for the Government to balance the need to maintain an environment conducive to
employment generation against the need to satisfy political demands.

Similar to SEDPO-1, the risks identified for SEDPO-2 centered around macroeconomic conditions.
Kosovo’s uneven track record in fiscal management raised questions about medium-term
macroeconomic stability, together with a contagion risk from the European growth slowdown. At that
time those macroeconomic risks were mitigated by an April 2012 IMF SBA, which strengthened
Kosovo’s fiscal sustainability and financial sector stability safeguards. Weak labor market institutions
and MLSW capacity constraints were mitigated by cleaning and updating the unemployment registries,
and by technical assistance for design and delivery of labor market programs that addressed the needs
and constraints of active job-seekers.

Another identified risk was that of governance and political structures being destabilized if faced
with significant shocks. Consequently, actions to improve public financial management, specifically
those supported by SEDPO-2 and the ongoing Public Sector Modernization Project, did improve
transparency in information systems and helped attenuate some of the risks.

As expected, some reforms to improve governance and transparency encountered capacity
constraints and political resistance. For example, implementation of consolidated procurement was
delayed by the Government despite enacting the Public Procurement Law, adopting secondary
legislation to implement the law and adopting the Rules of Procedure for the Central Procurement
Agency. While capacity at the Central Procurement Authority remains weak, the pace at which the
Government has gone about addressing the capacity constraint is notably slow.

Going forward, despite the moderately satisfactory performance of SEDPP, the risks to
development outcomes must be regarded as significant.                  The biggest risk concerns the
macroeconomic framework as fiscal discipline may be especially difficult to maintain in the run-up to
parliamentary and presidential elections expected for the second half of 2013. The SBA with the IMF is
expected to mitigate this macroeconomic risk. Other risks are expected to be mitigated by the SEDPP
follow-up programmatic technical assistance.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

SEDPO-1: Satisfactory                  SEDPO-2: Satisfactory

Overall, while the ICR team notes that there were certain shortcomings in SEDPP design, the quality at
entry is rated as satisfactory based on SEDPP’s strong alignment with the Government program, the
World Bank’s strong donor coordination and SEDPP’s grounding in sound analytical work and other
forms of policy dialogue and technical support.

The World Bank worked closely with the Government to identify reforms to be supported by
SEDPP. Close alignment of the operation with the Government’s own reform agenda helped to ensure
Government ownership and buy-in. The Program Development Objectives were well identified and
remain valid.

However, given Kosovo’s low institutional capacity and lack of experience in dealing with complex
cross-sectoral issues, the Program would have benefited from more selectivity. The extensive array
of pillars and measures, some of which were requested by donors to help strengthen institutions for
future engagement on sustainable employment tasks, were sometimes difficult to manage both for the
counterparts and the World Bank. In particular, efforts to address Kosovo’s perception on governance
indicators led to a broad set of PFM reforms, including those related to civil service reform and
procurement, which made it harder to provide support throughout the implementation process.

Flexibility in the programmatic development policy operation instruments was crucial. As
described earlier, SEDPP was designed as a programmatic series of three operations to be delivered
annually starting in 2009. However, macroeconomic slippages and political factors (unplanned
parliamentary elections) led to delays in declaring SEDPO-1 effective, delaying disbursement until the
end of 2011. Because the structural reform agenda remained broadly on track, and because of the
flexibility afforded by the programmatic development policy operation instruments, it was decided to
merge the remaining two operations into one final operation.

SEDPP was prepared in close collaboration with SEDPP donors. It was a joint effort of the World
Bank and 10 bilateral and multilateral donors initiated at the Donors’ Conference in July 2008 in
Brussels, where it was agreed to support Kosovo’s reforms through a budget support operation. Close
partnership was ensured through the regular follow-up meetings during SEDPP preparation. This
provided a harmonized approach and significantly reduced the Government’s transaction costs.

In addition, quality at entry was ensured through a high level of consistency between the operation
and areas of World Bank engagement, also underlined in the Interim Strategy Notes and later in the
CPS. The program focused on areas of strategic relevance where the World Bank had an established
track record of strong technical capacity and experience.

Quality at entry benefited from strong diagnostic and analytical foundations, including extensive
technical assistance, economic and sector work and other forms of policy dialogue.



                                                 39
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

SEDPO-1: Satisfactory                  SEDPO-2: Satisfactory

All prior actions were completed before the operations went to the Board, and the supervision of
SEDPO-1 was embedded in the preparation of SEDPO-2. Supervision for SEDPO-2 was bundled
with the preparation of this ICR. As a result, continuous dialogue with the Government and follow-up
on triggers was possible for each operation.

During implementation of the two operations, the World Bank prepared four Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs). These reports were very informative—they focused on the monitoring and
supervision of the reform progress on the ground and, in the case of SEDPO-1, policy actions for the
subsequent operation. The aide-memoires from SEDPP identification, appraisal and supervision
missions served as effective tools for outlining and monitoring next steps for the Government.

The work was well-coordinated within the World Bank’s cross-sectoral team. The team members
included World Bank staff working across sectors and offices. The collaboration was smooth and
efficient. Over the course of SEDPP, a smooth transition to a new task team leader took place. The
operation remained under the supervision of the Human Development group at the World Bank and the
core SEDPP team remained in place. This transition did not affect the program’s performance.

With many team members in the field, monitoring of progress toward key indicators was done on
a relatively continuous basis. The process was supported by strong cooperation with line ministries
(see section 5.2 b). Budgetary, legislative and economic data were provided by authorities and (when
possible) verified in official disclosures.

In addition, the dialogue with the Government was supported by ongoing technical assistance
activities directly or indirectly supported by SEDPP (in particular through Business Environment
Technical Assistance, Public Sector Modernization Project and Education Project). Close collaboration
with the IMF and regular meetings with other donors supported the supervision process.

The Government was committed to the reforms supported by SEDPP. It took ownership of the
reform agenda and mobilized donors’ support for its program. Two strategic Government documents—
the Employment Strategy and the PFM Reform Action Plan—clearly set out the Government’s reform
plans and road map for their implementation. In addition, stakeholders and civil society were consulted
extensively in the formulation of the strategic documents. As such, they became the main reference
points for supporting Kosovo’s development.

Kosovo’s prolonged political transition process and temporary macroeconomic instabilities
delayed SEDPO-1. As discussed in section 2.2, following the declaration of independence in 2008, the
Government introduced spending initiatives that put the macroeconomic framework at risk. A Stand-By
Arrangement was negotiated with the IMF in 2010 and SEDPO-1 was submitted to the World Bank
Board in September 2010. However, before the legal agreements could be signed, the governing
coalition lost its majority and early elections were called. New spending initiatives in the pre-electoral
period were not in compliance with the commitments the Government had made under the SBA. The
Government and the IMF agreed on a six-month Staff Monitored Program in July 2011, which was
successfully implemented during the second half of 2011. Upon successful implementation of the SMP,
which included agreement on the 2012 budget, SEDPO-1 was disbursed in December 2011. Despite
those delays, the Government pursued the structural reform agenda and the key reforms supported by
SEDPP were implemented as foreseen.

During the SEDPP process, the Government formed an Inter-Ministerial Committee for
Sustainable Employment to supervise the implementation of the reform program. The main
counterparts at the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Finance facilitated communication
with the other parties involved (Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, Ministry
of Public Administration, Centralized Procurement Agency) and provided the necessary leadership to
pursue the reforms. Overall, the inter-ministerial coordination process was smooth across all agencies.
At the end of SEDPP, the Government prepared a completion report and shared it with the World Bank
(included as an attachment to this ICR).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

SEDPO-1: Satisfactory                    SEDPO-2: Satisfactory

The performance of the coordinating ministries—the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of
Finance—is rated as satisfactory. Throughout SEDPP they provided the leadership required for: (i)
meeting the agreed triggers/prior actions in a timely manner, (ii) monitoring effective implementation of
the reform agenda and (iii) collecting data for evaluating results.

Over the life-cycle of SEDPP, the World Bank and the implementing agencies worked closely
together. The World Bank missions met on a regular basis with their counterparts. Typically, the World
Bank team met with the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Sustainable Development at the beginning and
end of each mission. The World Bank team also received regular progress reports from the Inter-
Ministerial Committee on the implementation of the Employment Strategy. While these reports were
prepared by a consultant financed by the donors to assist the Deputy Prime Minister through the entire
SEDPP process, they were fully owned by the Government.

The performance of other implementing agencies was also satisfactory. The bilateral meetings with
the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, Ministry of Public Administration and the Ministry of

                                                   41
Education were held on a regular basis during SEDPP missions and accompanying technical assistance
project meetings. Unlike in many cross-sectoral DPOs where line ministries see little advantage in being
part of budget support operations, the Kosovar line ministries were interested in becoming part of the
program, which they saw as a chance to support their reform initiatives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

SEDPO-1: Satisfactory                   SEDPO-2: Satisfactory

Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. The rating reflects a satisfactory performance of both the
Government and implementing agencies throughout the preparation and implementation of SEDPP.


6. Lessons Learned

    1. Government ownership and commitment is necessary for the success of budget support
       operations. The SEDPP series was able to support specific, important, clearly defined prior
       reforms that were identified through substantial consultation with the development community,
       and the Government owned it completely, which explains its commitment to the Program. The
       Government’s ownership and commitment was shown by its ability to obtain parliamentary
       approval of the required legislation, despite short timeframes, especially for SEDPO-2, and its
       ability to maintain structural reform momentum even when the macroeconomic framework had
       gone off-track.
    2. In countries with little or no experience with budget support operations, the underlying
       policy program should be selective and supervision and TA resources need to be dedicated
       to support implementation of the reforms, especially in the areas where capacity is low.
       While SEDPP concentrated on areas of strategic relevance for sustainable job creation in
       Kosovo, the extensive array of pillars and measures was sometimes difficult to manage both for
       the counterparts and the World Bank. SEDPP supported an ambitious and relevant program and
       rightly tried to follow-up through its implementation. Although very successful in meeting
       legislative prior actions, SEDPP did not achieve all of the more challenging implementation
       objectives, mainly because of the lack of capacity to implement some of the more complex
       program objectives. Particularly in the PFM area, the broad scope of reforms supported by
       SEDPP (components related to procurement and civil service reform) did not allow for sufficient
       support throughout the implementation process.
    3. In post-conflict countries, where capacity is weak, development policy operations can be
       effective instruments when accompanied by a critical mass of technical assistance. SEDPP
       was able to support significant reforms that are expected to lay institutional and legislative
       foundations for sustainable employment and growth. It is important, however, to ensure that the
       commitment and willingness to reform is supported by the capacity to reform. This was the case
       in SEDPP, where there was substantial technical assistance provided by other World Bank
       operations and by other donors. Continued technical assistance will be essential to ensure
       further implementation of key SEDPP-supported measures such as civil service reform, and to
       develop the capacity for consolidated procurement. As in the case of SEDPP, the effectiveness
       of policy and institutional reform operations was enhanced by its complementarities with other
       World Bank–financed technical assistance operations and the efforts of other active donors in
       the reform areas, including USAID, the EU and the IMF.

                                                  42
4. Identifying good indicators to evaluate progress in a short-term DPO can be difficult,
   especially in countries with scarce data and limited capacity. The operation’s short
   timeframe made it difficult to find measurable and available indicators that could be clearly
   linked to the program-supported policy actions and used for the ICR. As a result, the progress
   on some of the ICR results, which refer to outcomes for 2012, was difficult to assess.
5. Coordinating a multi-donor trust fund is time-consuming and costly but can sustain a
   consolidated and impactful operation. SEDPP benefited from the financial participation of 10
   different donors. Each of the contributing parties had its own unique processes and procedures
   that had to be closely followed. While this coordinated approach undoubtedly reduced
   transaction costs for the Kosovar authorities, it took considerable time and effort for the World
   Bank team to facilitate donors’ participation throughout all stages of SEDPP, from signing
   administrative agreements with the World Bank to reaching agreement on the contents of the
   policy matrix, regular reporting and finally obtaining their financial support for disbursement.
   The cost of donor participation (both in terms of staff time and budget) should be taken into
   account when planning a multi-donor budget support operation. While costly, donor
   coordination allowed for a consolidated and impactful approach. The counterfactual could have
   been a series of fragmented, smaller interventions.
