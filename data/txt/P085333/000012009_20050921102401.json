The project comprises two main components:\n            1) The Cuijiaying navigation and power complex component\n            entails the construction of a dam, ship-lock, power station,\n            including access roads and bridges. In addition, these works\n            further require dredging along diversion channels, and works\n            to strengthen reservoir banks. 2) The institutional\n            development component includes provision of capacity\n            building to implementing agencies - Hubei Provincial\n            Communications Department (HPCD) - and the Cuijiaying\n            Complex Management Office (CCMO) through specific training,\n            and study tours. Additionally, the component will finance\n            studies focused on capacity building in inland waterway\n            planning and administration, implement logistics planning,\n            and power pricing in Hubei Province."}, "docdt": "2005-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
