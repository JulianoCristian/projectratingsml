Proposed measures to reduce risks\n            include the following: Prevent floods by maintaining normal\n            levels for dams and reservoirs. Adopt measures to prevent\n            riverbank erosion and dam breaches. Promote repair and\n            maintenance of the flood release gates and channels, and\n            provide incentives to promote water and electricity\n            conservation. Collect wastewater in sedimentation tanks,\n            acquire underground sewage treatment equipment and use\n            septic tanks for temporary residences. Spray water regularly\n            to damp down dust, and promptly clean up dirt scattered by\n            construction machinery. Choose low-volume construction\n            machinery, schedule work for daytime, and impose time limits\n            in sensitive areas. Adopt water and soil erosion prevention\n            measures such as building retaining walls, protecting\n            slopes, and drainage systems. Promptly refill earth and tamp\n            id needed if there is (tree) cutting. Recover vegetation\n            promptly from borrow pits and disposal areas for excavated\n            materials. Regularly monitor the environment. Protect\n            cultural relics. Avoid discharging industrial wastewater\n            into reservoir area and other water bodies unless\n            pre-treated to reduce pollution. Ships and vessels are\n            banned from discharging waste oil, manure, and garbage into\n            water bodies, and they must be equipped with oil-water\n            separators. Ships and vessels must also be controlled for\n            noise. Apply regulations to prevent accidental spills of\n            hazardous waste; leaks and spills must promptly be reported.\n            Establish a fishery protection system."}, "docdt": "2005-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
