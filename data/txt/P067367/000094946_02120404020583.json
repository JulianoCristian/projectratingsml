Project will\n            improve the environmentally sustainable management of the\n            State and private forests, in an effort to increase benefits\n            to the national, and rural economies, derived from the\n            country's forest resources. To this end, project\n            components will: 1) Establish new systems to ensure\n            sustainable management of private forest lands, by\n            strengthening the Department of Forests, specifically, the\n            Forest Inspectorate and Support Service within the Ministry\n            of Agriculture, Food and Forests (MAFF). Supervisory,\n            regulatory, and monitoring activities in forest management,\n            will be supported, as will the provision of extension, and\n            advisory services. Furthermore, support will be provided for\n            the development of national, and local associations of\n            private forest owners, which includes assistance for\n            business development plans, service delivery, and capacity\n            building in financial, and procurement management. In\n            addition, a national forest management information, and\n            monitoring system will be established to integrate cadastre,\n            forest inventory, and biodiversity data. 2) Mitigate the\n            State's forests management restitution, and its\n            consequences, by supporting reform, and strategic\n            development of the National Forest Administration, and,\n            through the rehabilitation, and extension of the forest road\n            network. 3) Support the increased productivity, and\n            competitiveness of forest industries, through the\n            establishment of the Forest Sector Business Information\n            Center, to coordinate, and assist timber, and related forest\n            industries. 4) Build public support for sustainable forest\n            management, through public awareness campaigns. 5) Support\n            project management, and financial activities, and oversee\n            monitoring and evaluation aspects."}, "docdt": "2002-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
