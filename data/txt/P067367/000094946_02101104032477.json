 institutional capacity for forest management in Romania, and\n            key issues of the National Forest Policy, and Strategy. It\n            assessed the project environmental impacts and proposed\n            mitigation measures. Although the project will have\n            positive, beneficial impacts, there are aspects which could\n            have negative environmental, and social consequences if\n            mitigation is not implemented. Adverse environmental\n            impacts, and mitigating measures are as follows.\n            Institutional recommendations suggest capacity building -\n            formal, and on-the-job training, public awareness, etc. - to\n            ensure compliance with environmental policies, including the\n            involvement of public-private partnerships, to support an\n            enabling environment. The main concern is the Forest Roads\n            component, which involves road construction and\n            rehabilitation in the area: baseline conditions, site\n            selection, and engineering design will be reviewed to\n            minimize adversity. Also, poorly managed forestry harvests\n            may be endangered by increased timber industry demand, if\n            institutional capacity measures, and public-private\n            partnerships do not exercise regulations, a risk greatest in\n            the case of newly restituted forest lands. The update\n            volumes clarify issues and incorporate recommendations\n            raised by NGOs, detail information disclosure, further\n            examine illegal harvesting, and expands on the reasons for\n            rejecting alternative projects."}, "docdt": "2002-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
