Development\n            Project for Romania were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: agreeing on the structure and development of new\n            information management systems for the forest sector,\n            programming the software, and instituting the proper use of\n            those new systems can take considerable time. At appraisal,\n            very few cost-effective systems existed. For future Forest\n            Management Information and Monitoring System (FMIMS)\n            developments, off-the-shelf systems are now available at\n            reasonable costs. In recent years, the Bank has been\n            hesitant to invest in forestry, and in particular, road\n            activities because of heightened non-government organization\n            (NGO) attention. Because of the generally good outcomes of\n            this project, especially with access roads, and the strong\n            environmental and social linkages, this positive experience\n            could offer an important lesson for the Bank both in terms\n            of how to engage NGOs in seeking a way forward, but also in\n            addressing critical safeguards issues. A lesson emerging\n            from the project is that small-scale forest owners may\n            require initial incentives to form associations and grow,\n            such as training and technical support, accessing financing\n            through a revolving fund partially funded through member\n            contributions, tapping new forest carbon funds, etc. It is\n            important that at effectiveness, projects have made good\n            progress to establish a robust monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system with a baseline, plus a program and format\n            for regular collection of data on input/outputs, processes,\n            institutional development, impacts and outcomes."}, "docdt": "2009-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
