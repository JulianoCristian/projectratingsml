strengthen road administration; and improve the\n            competitiveness of trade supporting infrastructure and\n            services. There are four project components. The first\n            rehabilitates and upgrades portions of the\n            Tallinn-Tartu-Luhamaa road and widens the Tartu Ring road\n            and interchange. The second component includes the\n            construction of civil works to eliminate accident black\n            spots and to install road markings for new asphalt\n            pavements, road side delineators, traffic signs, and\n            automatic speed control cameras; creates campaign materials\n            for a road safety campaign; and provides technical\n            assistance, training sessions, and software. The third\n            component provides continued assistance to the national road\n            administration to strengthen its operational capacity and\n            funds training, office, and laboratory equipment. The fourth\n            component 1) facilitates trade by developing an environment\n            with laws and regulations to ensure the development of trade\n            supporting services and infrastructure on an equal and fair\n            basis, taking into account European Union accession; 2)\n            supports creation of an efficient public and private\n            partnership based on combined resources; 3) encourages\n            access to capital on equal terms and conditions; 4) provides\n            quality education, training, and research on trade\n            supporting services; and 5) provides easy Estonian access to\n            global markets and foreign access to the Estonian market."}, "docdt": "2000-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
