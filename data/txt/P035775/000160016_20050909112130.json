Two lessons from this\n            project are cited. The first concerns project management and\n            administration. This project was successful because it\n            resulted from the actions of competent, dedicated people who\n            were able to take advantage of financial resources and new\n            technical and managerial approaches to improving how the\n            work is undertaken in a client country. Generally, road\n            administration and road rehabilitation projects are more\n            successful when contractors are supervised in a\n            conscientious and thorough manner to ensure that the quality\n            of the work meets required specifications, and environmental\n            assessments are undertaken in a timely manner to avoid\n            unanticipated disruptions in work. Second, the European\n            Union accession process has played a catalytic role in\n            accelerating institutional and policy reform in Central and\n            Eastern European countries, and this was the case in this\n            project. EU standards for upgrading pavement and traffic\n            safety, which were taken into account in this project,\n            provide a framework and goal to aim for."}, "docdt": "2005-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
