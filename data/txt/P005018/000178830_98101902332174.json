The project will be the first stage\n            (600 MW) of a 900-MW thermal power station selected by EEA\n            as the next step of generation expansion, and to be located\n            on the Nile, at Shoubrah El Kheima, just north of Cairo.\n            Specifically the project will comprise: (i) two 300-MW\n            oil/gas-fired units; (ii) about 4 km of new transmission\n            lines and reinforcement of about 5 km of existing ones;\n            (iii) related civil works; and (iv) technical assistance for\n            load research and load management studies and feasibility\n            studies for generation and transmission expansion."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
