                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the project is to improve transport conditions along a strategic road corridor that links the Province of Santa Fe with regional and inte
                         rnational markets. Adding capacity to National Road 19, a key component of a maj                                      or bi-oceanic corridor that links the PSF and the
                         Center Region with Chile and B                                razil will reduce logistics costs, facilitate access to major regional consumpti
                         on and export markets and foster the effective economic integration of the Cente                                    r Region provinces
