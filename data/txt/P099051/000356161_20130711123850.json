Province of Santa Fe\n            Road Infrastructure Project for Argentina were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: the Bank is well equipped to provide added value\n            to projects of this nature, ensuring that road safety and\n            environmental management protocols are adequately integrated\n            into project design and implementation. The establishment of\n            unified environmental standards for all contractors involved\n            in project execution is a practice worth replicating in\n            similar projects. The establishment of formal channels for\n            continued feedback from users and civil society provided a\n            vital instrument for guaranteeing successful project\n            implementation, enabling inclusion of citizens'\n            perspectives and knowledge in the actual design of projects,\n            strengthening ownership by local communities, and\n            democratizing the overall process. Operations should provide\n            for appropriate due diligence in urban projects, minimizing\n            the risk of encountering unforeseen contingencies,\n            particularly in the provision of utilities (electricity,\n            water), which can increase costs and delay implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
