                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the project is to improve transport conditions along a strategic road corridor that links the Province of Santa Fe with regional and international
                         markets. Adding capacity to National Road 19, a key component of a major bi-oceanic corridor that links the PSF and the Center Region with Chile and Brazil will reduce
                         logistics costs, facilitate access to major regional consumption and export markets and foster the effective economic integration of the Center Region provinces
