                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the project is to improve transport conditions along a strategic road corridor that links the Province of Santa Fe with regional and
                         international markets. Adding capacity to National Road 19, a key component of a major bi-oceanic corridor that links the PSF and the Center Region with Chile
                         and Brazil will reduce logistics costs, facilitate access to major regional consumption and export markets and foster the effective economic integration of the
                         Center Region provinces
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Important progress achieved in the upgrading of National Road 19. Two segments (out of 5. 45 km out of 135km) of the upgraded Road 19 will be inaugurated in May, 2011. The
                         remaining 3 segments are expected to be completed in July, 2011. Institutional components show significant degrees of compliance with objectives set in the Loan Agreement: Road
                         safety interventions along provincial road 21 were completed, a Strategic Environmental Assessment focused on the road sector was launched and a comprehensive logistics
                         assessment of the Province of Santa Fe began in 2011.
