                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the project is to improve transport conditions along a strategic road corridor that links the Province of Santa Fe with regional and
                         international markets. Adding capacity to National Road 19, a key component of a major bi-oceanic corridor that links the PSF and the Center Region with Chile
                         and Brazil will reduce logistics costs, facilitate access to major regional consumption and export markets and foster the effective economic integration of the
                         Center Region provinces
