The reallocation is necessary to be\n            able to use the funds currently in the\n            'unallocated' category set forth in the loan\n            agreement. This reallocation will not change the percentage\n            of financing. The main component of this project, the\n            upgrading of National Road 19, will receive the full amount\n            of the unallocated funds. The construction works along\n            National Road 19 are progressing according to the work plan\n            set forth at the time of the bidding and no cost overruns\n            have been observed. The total costs of the upgrading works\n            will reach US$175 million and consequently the reallocation\n            will allow to approximate the percentage of financing (the\n            Province of Santa Fe will provide additional resources if\n            necessary as counterpart funds). The upgraded Road 19, with\n            the exception of 2km in the City of Santo Tome will be\n            completed in June 2011, with the remaining works expected to\n            be completed by February, 2012. Closing date of this Project\n            is June 30, 2012."}, "docdt": "2011-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
