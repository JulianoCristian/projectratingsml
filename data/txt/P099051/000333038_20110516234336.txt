2.      A US$126.7 million loan for the Santa Fe Road Infrastructue Project was approved
on February 13, 2007. The Loan Agreement was signed on June 12, 2007, and declared
effective on August 17, 2007. The project includes the following components: (a)
Upgrade 135 km of National Road 19, constructing two new lanes; (b) improve road
safety by implementing a pilot intervention along Provincial Road 21 capable of providing
valuable qualitative and quantitative information to the comprehensive road safety action
plan elaborated by the Province of Santa Fe in 2005; (b) measure logistics costs in the
Province of Santa Fe; (c) reinforce the Province’s planning capacity to foster economic
growth; and (d) strengthen the provincial capacity to assess and manage environmental
and social impacts of large civil works. Currently 84% of the loan proceeds have been
disbursed (US$105.25 million), most of which are related to the upgrading of National
Road 19 and road safety components. The remaining loan proceeds are already committed
to the upgrading of National Road 19.

3.      The Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Implementation Performance (IP)
have been rated as Satisfactory over the past 12 months taking into account the progress
under the different components, leading towards the achievement of the main project
objective (improve transport conditions along a strategic road corridor, National Road 19,
that links the Province of Santa Fe with regional and international markets. Adding
                                                      3
capacity to National Road 19, a key component of a major bi-oceanic corridor that links
the Province of Santa Fe and the Center Region with Chile and Brazil will reduce logistics
costs, facilitate access to major regional consumption and export markets and foster the
effective economic integration of the Center Region provinces ).

4.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to be able to use the funds currently in the
“Unallocated” category set forth in the Loan Agreement. This reallocation will not
change the percentage of financing.

5.      The main component of this Project, the upgrading of National Road 19, would
receive the full amount of the unallocated funds. The construction works along National
Road 19 are progressing according to the work plan set forth at the time of the bidding
and no cost overruns have been observed. The total costs of the upgrading works will
reach US$175 million and consequently the reallocation will allow to approximate the
percentage of financing (the Province of Santa Fe will provide additional resources if
necessary as counterpart funds). The upgraded Road 19, with the exception of 2km in the
City of Santo Tome will be completed in June 2011, with the remaining works expected
to be completed by February, 2012. Closing date of this Project is June 30, 2012.
