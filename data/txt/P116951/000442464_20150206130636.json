The World\n            Bank lending program for 2009-1010 envisages support for the\n            country\u0092s budgets under stress by the drop of revenues\n            caused by the global economic slow-down, through a\n            development policy loan (DPL) program approved on April 8,\n            2010 by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors. The DPL\n            program will complement the recently approved International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF) stand-by arrangement.
