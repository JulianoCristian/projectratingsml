                      Republika Srpska

Operation Type        First Development Policy Loan (DPL1)

Main Policy Areas         Effective, efficient and equitable social protection policies.
                          Public sector wage and employment policies in support of growth and fiscal
                          sustainability.
                          Social contribution and indirect tax policies that enhance competitiveness.
Key Outcome               The percent of cash transfers that reaches the bottom quintile (targeting accuracy)
Indicators                increases from the current 17 percent to a range of 30 to 40 percent by 2012.
                          Poverty reduced by 1.2 percentage points through (a) better targeting of social
                          benefits and (b) the contribution of fiscal consolidation to the creation of fiscal
                          space for growth.
                          Annual fiscal savings realized from the proposed reforms are equivalent to 2.0
                          percentage points:
                               o 1.6 percentage points as a result of reforms to untargeted rights-based
                                    benefits,
                               o 0.4 percentage points as a result of wage bill reforms.
                          Substantial elimination of duplication/overlap of social benefits. Duplications and
                          errors in benefits reduced and documented.
                          The wage bill is at least 0.4 percentage points of GDP lower than in 2009. The
                          difference in the public wage bill to GDP ratios between BH and the EU is
                          lowered.
                          Allowances are substantially reduced as a share of the public payroll; the variance
                          in pay between similar skill positions decreases; the compression ratio between
                          high and low skilled positions decreases.
                          The health insurance contribution rate in the Federation is at least 3 percentage
                          points lower than the current level (17 percent of gross wage).
                          The VAT, excise, and customs duty regimes are efficient and broadly harmonized
                          with those of the EU and the region.
                          Excise taxes are increased and are more in line with those in the region, and BH
                          customs tariffs are more harmonized with those of the EU.

Program Development   The operation has three main Program Development Objectives (DPO): (i) to increase
Objective(s) and      social assistance to the poor, while reducing the fiscal deficit and creating fiscal space
Contribution to CAS   for poverty-reducing growth; (ii) to improve the structure and efficiency of public
                      expenditures; and (iii) to reduce social contribution rates and pressures on private
                      sector wages from faster wage growth in the public sector, thereby enhancing private



                                                      v
                 sector competitiveness.

                 These DPOs are consistent with the CPS goals of a) reducing the burden of
                 Government on the economy and strengthening fiscal coordination and b) improving
                 the targeting of social benefits, both of which have taken on greater importance in the
                 context of the unfolding global economic crisis. They also support the objectives of
                 CPS Pillar I ­ improving the environment for private sector led growth and
                 convergence to Europe.

                 The DPL does this through support for the following specific objectives:
                  Substantial shift from rights-based, to needs-based, targeted social safety net
                      system improving overall distribution of social transfers.
                  Improved benefits incidence (targeting accuracy).
                  More effective and efficient administration of social benefits equipped to
                      substantially reduce transfers that are the result of abuse and fraud.
                  Lower aggregate personnel costs to levels more in line with EU averages.
                  Increased pay system transparency, internal equity, and performance incentives
                  Improved social contribution fairness, firm competitiveness and formal sector
                      employment.
                      A fairer health financing system.
Risks and Risk   Political and governance risks are evident from the experience of policy reversals
Mitigation       following the approval of previous DPLs (SOSAC II, EMSAC). This is particularly
                 the case with respect to the reduction and elimination of social transfers necessary to
                 introduce targeting and means testing. These risks are heightened by polarization and
                 tensions between the two political Entities that constitute BH. Poorly-defined political
                 competencies between different levels of Government and the complex and
                 fragmented governance structure of BH create conditions favorable to the emergence
                 of special interest groups undermining Government transparency and accountability.

                 These risks are mitigated in part by the increasing understanding among citizens,
                 arising from the crisis, that reforms are necessary and this is changing the relative
                 power of political interest groups. The flaws of the existing social benefit system are
                 more evident and the private sector and the population at large are coming to
                 appreciate that current social policies mean high payroll tax rates that limit
                 competitiveness. A communications strategy is in place to solidify the consensus that
                 the current social transfer system is unaffordable, unfair and work incentive
                 destroying. It includes identification of key reform champions, wide dissemination of
                 key policy analysis, a two-day consensus-building workshop and selective media
                 interventions.

                 Economic risks are associated with external economic developments. As a small open
                 economy, BH is exposed to growth shocks, primarily in the EU and regional markets,
                 as these markets are the origin of its significant diaspora remittances, foreign
                 investments, and a destination for most of its exports.

                 These risks are mitigated by the recently agreed IMF SBA which has been developed
                 in tandem with the proposed DPL. The IMF program relies on the Bank's operations to
                 facilitate structural reforms to ensure the sustainability of public expenditures in the
                 medium and long run. While the Bank program sets roughly annual structural reform
                 benchmarks, the IMF program has regular quarterly benchmarks. Thus, both in design
                 and oversight the two programs are interdependent and reinforcing. Moreover, the
                 potential of significant resources coming through an EC macro financial support
                 operation, dependent on continued adherence to the Bank and Fund programs' targets,
                 improves success likelihood.

                     IBRD IDA PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
        FIRST PROGRAMMATIC PUBLIC EXPENDITURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY
                             LOAN/CREDIT (DPL1)
                        TO BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA


                                         I.    INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed operation is the first of a programmatic series of three Development Policy
Loans (DPL) spanning about three years. The program supports the authorities' public expenditure
reform efforts, with blended loans/credits. The first loan/credit will be for an amount equivalent to
US$111 million, of which US$66 million is International Development Association (IDA) credit and
US$45 million is International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan. The IDA credit
and IBRD loan will be on-lent by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH)
to each Entity by way of subsidiary loan agreements (for the IBRD loan) and subsidiary financing
agreements (for the IDA credit) and the signing of which will constitute additional effectiveness
conditions. The subsidiary agreements will provide for distribution of proceeds on a 60/40 basis for the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska respectively.

2.      The proposed DPL program has three broad objectives: (i) to increase social assistance to the
poor, while reducing the fiscal deficit and creating fiscal space for poverty-reducing growth; (ii) to
improve the structure and efficiency of public expenditure; and (iii) to reduce social contribution rates and
pressures on private sector wages from faster wage growth in the public sector, thereby enhancing private
sector competitiveness. The DPL aims to tackle reforms in those areas of public sector expenditure that
have been the main driver of pro-cyclical and unsustainable fiscal policies, notably very high and poorly
targeted expenditure on social transfers and a high public sector wage bill. In addition, the program aims
over the medium term to improve the external competitiveness of the private sector by lowering health
(and possibly unemployment) insurance contributions levied on formal sector employment.

3.       The DPL supports the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) including the goals of a) reducing
the burden of Government on the economy and strengthening fiscal coordination, and b) improving the
targeting of social benefits, both of which have taken on greater importance in the context of the
unfolding global economic crisis. It also supports the objectives of CPS Pillar I ­ improving the
environment for private sector led growth and convergence to Europe. The DPL has been prepared in
response to BH Government's response to help mitigate the impact of the global financial and economic
crisis on BH economy.


                                   II.        COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                     A.        POLITICAL CONTEXT

4.       The Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the war in 1995, gave Bosnia and Herzegovina
(BH) important distinctive features. BH was constituted as a country with a State Government holding
relatively limited powers, and two largely autonomous sub-national Entities (and subsequently the small
autonomous Brcko District). The larger of the two Entities, with two thirds of the BH population, is called
the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federation or FBH). The smaller is called Republika
Srpska (RS).




                                                     7
5.       The BH population is largely made up of three constituent peoples: Bosniaks, Serbs, and
        1
Croats. Prior to the war the three groups were more evenly distributed throughout the territory of BH,
but now the Federation is predominantly populated by Bosniaks and Croats, and the RS by Serbs. Since
the war, there has been further polarization along ethnic lines within the Federation, and the emergence of
political parties affiliated with Bosniak and Croat communities, complicating consensus building over
important issues in that Entity. These tendencies are less marked within the more ethnically homogeneous
RS.

6.       The Government structures and budgetary arrangements of the two Entities are starkly
asymmetric. The Federation is subdivided into 10 cantons, each with its own executive, legislative, and
judicial branches of Government. Each canton is subdivided into municipalities.2 In addition to a high
degree of decentralization, the division of competencies between the cantons and the Federation is often
unclear, rendering this Entity more difficult to govern. The RS is more centralized and is subdivided only
into municipalities, and is thus easier to govern. Public budgetary arrangements reflect these features.
The BH State Indirect Tax Authority collects all indirect taxes. The first priority for the allocations of
these proceeds is the reserve for VAT rebate, transfers for BH State budget and then according to the pre-
agreed revenue allocation formula among the two Entities and Brcko District. In the Federation much of
the spending is done at the cantonal level. These arrangements make it difficult to achieve consensus on
the overall budget and tend to leave the State level with a residual share of resources. (For simplicity, in
this document references to revenue and expenditure are on a consolidated general government basis,
encompassing all levels, except where noted otherwise.)

7.      Against this backdrop, the authorities have recently established the long-awaited Fiscal
Council with the aim of improving fiscal coordination. The Council set fiscal targets for 2009 and
State and Entity budgets were adopted in line with these targets. However, the Fiscal Council has no
enforcement mechanisms and depends on the good will of the Entities and the State level for its work.

8.       As a result of the weaker State level, coalitions among the parties, and overlapping
competencies between the Federation and cantons, various interest groups in the Federation were
able to engineer sharp increases in cash (non-insurance) transfers in recent years. The Federation
has deeper public expenditure reform challenges than the RS. This is partly because of political tensions
and its more complex governance and administrative structures which render its system inherently
costlier. But it also reflects differences in expenditure policies pursued in recent years. During the pre-
election campaign in 2006, several laws were adopted introducing new and unusually generous
entitlements (rights-based benefits). Consequently, non-insurance transfers in the Federation increased
from 4.8 percent of Federation GDP in 2006 to 7.5 percent in 2008, while those in the RS remained in the
range of 3-3.5 percent of RS GDP. The developments in the Federation rendered the fiscal situation
unsustainable and Federation budgetary arrears mounted to 1.4 percent of BH GDP by end-2008.

  The last census took place in 1991, prior to the outbreak of the war in 1992. At that time there were 43.5 percent
Bosniaks, 31.2 percent Serbs, and 17.4 percent Croats. In 1991, BH had 4.3 million inhabitants. While there was no
census since 1991, the World Bank estimates that BH has 3.8 million inhabitants in 2009.
2
  The high degree of decentralization in the Federation is the result of an agreement reached during the 1992-1995
war between the representatives of Bosniak and Croat ethnic groups to avoid dominance of the Bosniak majority
over the Croat minority.

9.       Among the various interest groups, the veterans have a particularly strong voice. There are
some quarter million people receiving benefits under various rights-based veterans' programs. They have
a strong sense of entitlement to these benefits. The latter amounted to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2008 not
including a variety of ad hoc benefits largely administered at the lower level of Government. The fiscal
crisis of 2008 in the Federation largely be attributed to the expansion of programs directed towards this
group, but rights-based benefits to civilians have increased as well. In addition to the unsustainable fiscal
burden this imposes, the programs have serious negative incentive effects, a factor contributing to one of
the lowest labor force participation rates in the region.

                              B.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

10.     During recent years, BH enjoyed relatively strong economic growth. Between 2004 and
2008, the BH economy grew at an average annual rate of 6 percent in real terms. Growth peaked in 2007
at around 7 percent. Although economic activity started to weaken with the onset of the financial crisis,
GDP growth was still relatively strong in 2008, at 5.4 percent. Both private investment and consumption
saw strong growth, and export growth averaged 25 percent per annum over 2004-2008.

11.      Significant progress on structural reform has helped BH's growth performance. The
completion of some important privatizations in the metal and wood-processing industries played an
important role in the growth of exports. The signing of the Stabilization and Association Agreement
further liberalized trade with the EU, paved the way for more EU funds and provided a clear road map for
reform. Corporate and personal income taxes were lowered and harmonized across the Entities. Entity
Governments took concrete steps to settle domestic claims to improve fiscal sustainability.

12.     Commercial bank
credit to both households Figure 3: Nominal Growth of Commercial Bank Credit and Private
and firms supported growth Consumption
throughout this period. The
privatization of commercial
banks in BH led to a transfer
of ownership to foreign banks
with ready access to cheap
financing from their parents
abroad. During the 5-year
period prior to the onset of the
global     economic       crisis,
commercial bank credit to the
private sector increased from
37 percent of GDP to 58
percent. Credit to households
                                  Source: BH authorities, IMF, and World Bank staff calculations
increased from 23 to 27
percent of GDP between 2005 and 2008. The quality of banking assets remained strong and non-
performing loans amounted to less than 2 percent prior to the onset of the economic crisis.

13.     Relatively strong investment and a low level of national savings resulted in significant
current account deficits (CAD) throughout the period. For years after the war, low savings, economic
recovery and the associated inflows of foreign capital resulted in CADs exceeding 20 percent of GDP.
The situation improved following the post-reconstruction period, with the CAD falling to a record low of
8.4 percent in 2006, but it widened subsequently to 14.9 percent of GDP in 2008 due to private
investment growth of 3.5 percentage points and a reduction in public savings of 7 percentage points of
GDP between 2006 and 2008. The food and fuel price increases of 2007 and 2008 also had a significant
negative effect on the current account. These two commodities represented nearly 42 percent of imports
in 20083.

14.    A blend of foreign direct investment (FDI), grants and foreign credit financed the CAD. FDI
averaged 7 percent of GDP per year, covering an average of about 44 percent of the CAD between 2004
and 2008, and rising capital account transfers covered another 24 percent during the same period. These

 Due to relatively inelastic demand for these products, imports in 2008 increased 15.8 percent in nominal terms,
while they dropped around 2 percent in real terms. Note: Nominal trade statistics are published by the BH Statistics
Agency, while the rate of real growth is a World Bank estimate.

debt-creating inflows were largely channeled through international banks incorporated in BH.4 During
this time the authorities built up foreign exchange reserves which peaked in 2008 at 6.8 billion KM or 5.5
months of imports of GNFS.

15.      After a period of improvement between 2004 and 2006, public fiscal management
deteriorated sharply in 2007-2008 and growing public expenditure contributed to the CAD
widening. The share of public spending
in GDP, which had historically hovered Figure 4: Contribution to CAD Widening by Component
around 50 percent, fell to around 43
percent between 2004 and 2006 and
years of fiscal deficits were turned into
surpluses. External public debt fell from
25.5 to 17.1 percent of GDP, although
external private debt increased from
22.0 to 27.4 percent of GDP. However,
fiscal performance deteriorated in 2007
and 2008 as public expenditure
increased substantially, magnifying the
impact of the rapid private demand Source: BH authorities, IMF, and World Bank staff calculations
growth on the CAD. Although
investment spending increased as well, the fiscal expansion was mostly driven by increases in current
spending on social transfers and public sector wages. In the Federation, transfers to households almost
doubled in nominal terms, as the implementation of benefit measures introduced in 2006 progressed and
the number of beneficiaries expanded. In the RS, the wage bill of the RS Entity Government increased 40
percent. Overall, public expenditure increased by 1.9 and 4.9 percentage points of GDP in 2007 and
2008 respectively, while public savings dropped and the CAD widened.5

16.     Despite large CADs, BH's external debt to GDP ratio has decreased since 2005. External
debt peaked in 2005 at 47.9 percent of GDP, but was brought down to 44.5 percent of GDP in 2008,
mainly through a reduction in public sector debt. The reduction in external public debt is the result of
positive net lending between 2004 and 2006, when fiscal management improved, and a combination of
domestic financing, including privatization proceeds and GSM (the mobile operator) license fees in 2007
and 2008, when public savings decreased.

17.     During the period running up to the crisis, monetary stability was ensured through the
currency board arrangement. In view of its constitutional and political complexity, BH opted for a
currency board at independence. It fixed its nominal exchange rate at 1.95 KM to Euro. Because of
strong productivity growth and low inflation, the real exchange rate throughout this period was relatively
stable.

18.     GDP growth and macroeconomic stability was accompanied by significant reduction in
unemployment and eventually, poverty. Employment growth accelerated to around 6 percent in 2007
and 2008. Formal unemployment figures are unreliable due to the substantial size of the gray economy,
but Labor Force Survey data published in 2007 and 2008 show a drop in unemployment rate from 29 to
23 percent. This parallels data from the Household Budget Surveys (HBS) which indicate that headcount

  They translated into rapid growth of credit to private sector and households, but also to the Governments sector in
2008, when its balances deteriorated.
5
  In 2008, the consolidated BH general Governments fiscal deficit amounted to 4.5 percent of GDP, despite an
increase in revenues. The negative impact of fiscal deficits on long-run growth has been empirically documented in
several studies, such as Fisched (1993), Easterly and Rebelo (1993), Bleaney, Gemmell, and Kneller (2001).
                                                        11
poverty fell from 18 percent in 2004 to 14 percent in 2007, among the lowest in ECA.6 Rural poverty
remained almost twice as high as urban poverty, despite having fallen more rapidly.

The effects of the global crisis

19.      Threatening to reverse substantial gains from recent years, the global economic crisis was
quickly transmitted to BH through both financial and trade channels. The first signs of the crisis
appeared in October 2008 when commercial banks experienced a withdrawal of about 700 million KM or
5 percent of total deposits. However, the Central Bank reacted promptly, lowering the reserve
requirement, which stabilized the situation. Net inflows of external capital to commercial banks all but
stopped after October 2008 and credit growth stalled. While access to external capital for commercial
banks has improved since (albeit at higher interest rates), domestic credit remained flat year-on­year
between August 2008 and 2009, compared to a 28 percent increase over the same time the previous year,
reflecting the effects of both supply and demand factors. The crisis also came through the trade channel,
as both the price and demand for BH's main export products dropped and export growth fell to -4 percent
by December 2008 (yoy).

20.      As a result, the economy entered a recession at the end of 2008 and signs of recovery are not
visible yet. Sub-annual statistics on private consumption and investment are not published, but industrial
production dropped 3.9 percent during the first three quarters of 2009 (yoy). Also, during the first nine
months of 2009 imports and exports dropped 26 and 21 percent respectively. Estimates of the depth of
the recession are difficult to make in the absence of any national accounts statistics for 2009, but given
the size of the decline across specific indicators of economic activity, staff estimates indicate that GDP
contracted around 3.4 percent in real terms.

21.      The CAD has been adjusting quickly and is expected to have fallen at least 7 percentage
points of GDP to about 8 percent in 2009. The trade deficit fell by 27 percent while remittances
remained relatively stable dropping only 3 percent during the first half year (yoy). However, financing
the CAD has become more challenging. Balance of payments data show a drop of 28 percent and 106
percent for FDI and other investments respectively during the first half year.7 Consequently, foreign
exchange reserves held by the Central Bank dropped from a peak of 6.8 billion KM in 2008 to about 5.8
billion in early 2009 (from 5.5 to 4.7 months of imports). They subsequently recovered reaching 6.2
billion KM by November, reflecting the inflow of IMF SBA funds.

22.      Declines in GDP and the associated drop in revenues exacerbated fiscal outcomes and led to
a full-blown fiscal crisis in the Federation, BH's larger entity. Because of expansionary fiscal policies
in 2007 and 2008, the deficit reached 4 percent of entity GDP in 2008 despite strong revenue growth. RS
had a lower deficit than the Federation and was able to finance it from privatization revenues. The
Federation, on the other hand, had to turn to commercial banks in February 2009 for an emergency line of
credit to cover the financing gap in the 2008 budget. The drop in indirect taxes, the main source of public
revenues, started in the last quarter of 2008 and continued into 2009 (averaging -14.5 percent during the
first 6 months).8

6
  The BH Agency for Statistics, using a relative poverty line (as a percent of the median consumption), estimates a
poverty headcount of 18.3 percent in 2004 and 18.2 percent in 2007. However, these estimates were calculated
using different poverty lines and cannot be used to establish a reliable trend. Alternatively, one could use the
international poverty line currently set at US$2.50/person/day and an internationally comparable consumption
aggregate (ECAPOV), which is constructed by the World Bank for ECA countries that participated in the most
recent International Comparison Program (2005). Under this measure, which is much lower than the national
poverty line and thus captures trends in chronic poverty, the poverty rate fell from 2.2 to 1.5 percent, which is
statistically insignificant.
7
  FDI is expected to amount to around 2 percent of GDP in 2009.
8
  Indirect taxes accounted for about 53 percent of total tax revenue in 2008.
                                                        12
23.     Confronted with this situation, the BH authorities recognized, that even with a strong
adjustment in fiscal policy, continued extraordinary financing would be needed to meet the
remaining fiscal gap and boost foreign exchange reserves, and they approached the IMF, the WB
and the European Union for assistance on external financing. They have since taken emergency
measures to reduce public expenditures (see below) and concluded an SBA with the IMF amounting to
US$1.52 billion, which was approved by the IMF board in July, 2009. The EC is currently preparing
budget support amounting to euro 100 million for 2010.

24.      The authorities originally committed to reducing the projected fiscal deficit for 2009 from
7.8 to 4.7 percent of GDP. Both entities adopted rebalanced budgets, with the aim of reducing public
spending in 2009 by 2.5 percent of GDP, through short-term cuts in current spending (including cuts to
wages and transfers) and the initiation of structural reforms. The cuts were to be more drastic in the
Federation where fiscal challenges were more acute due to drastic growth in expenditure on rights-based
transfers in 2007 and 2008 (see Paragraphs 8, 9, and 41). In addition, a new excise law was adopted,
introducing a fuel surcharge tax, which should lead to an increase in Government revenues equivalent to
0.3 percent of GDP in 2009.

25.     By the time of the first review of the country's SBA in early November 2009, it had become
clear that the original fiscal deficit target was out of reach, due to worse-than-expected shortfalls in
revenues. The authorities developed a program with a new deficit target of 5.1 percent of GDP for
2009 (rather than originally envisaged 4.7) and 4.5 percent for 2010, to be supported by additional
measures to contain the fiscal deficit.9 Some of these measures were identified as prior actions for the
release of the second tranche of budget support finance of euro 94 million (under the SBA). These
conditions will have been met and the second review approved by the IMF Board scheduled for March
24, 2010.10




9
   Expenditures are below the targets at the State level and in the Federation. The Federation, however, cut capital
expenditures more than planned and current less than planned. Expenditures are substantially above the target in the
RS. The RS is using more privatization revenues than planned to finance the deficit. The IMF has also changed the
projection for real GDP growth from -3.0 to -3.4 percent.
10
    The new prior actions are the following: (1) Approve by State and Entity Parliaments 2010 budgets consistent
with the program, including supporting legislation; (2) Enact by Entity Parliaments framework legislation in
preparation for the transition to a means-tested system of rights-based benefits (Federation, RS); (3) Enact law to
eliminate special unemployment benefits granted to demobilized soldiers effective May 1, 2010 (Federation).

                     C.      MACROECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY


26.     The medium term macroeconomic framework is based on the assumption of a slow start of
the economic recovery in the region and in the EU in 2010, and acceleration thereafter. These rates
of growth assume a relatively modest recovery of the main export sectors based largely on the prospects
for import demand growth in the EU and the region. On average, merchandise export growth is projected
at 9.8 percent between 2010 and 2012, lower than in the past. The planned privatization program in the
Federation is also expected to contribute to export growth.

27.      Structural reforms of public expenditures, supported through the DPL, are the key pillar of
this macro framework. Planned fiscal reforms should lead to an improvement in public balances and an
increase in public savings. The Government's program envisages continued fiscal consolidation and
deficit reduction. The consolidation will be accomplished through a reduction in Government transfers
and consumption, which are the causes of fiscal deterioration in 2007 and 2008. Public consumption is to
be reduced by savings on the public sector wage bill of about 0.4 percentage points over the next 4-5
years (in total). Public sector wages in the Federation have been reduced in 2009 by an average of 10
percent through short-term saving measures, and the RS envisages
                                                              14
wage cuts in the 2010 budget. The             Figure 5: Export Growth (% per annum)
Federation plans to adopt a new law
regulating public sector wages as well as
personnel reductions. Furthermore, both
entities are undertaking reforms of the
social and veterans' benefit systems,
which should lead to a further reduction
in public expenditures of around 2
percentage points of GDP over the
medium term. Public investment, on the
other hand, would be allowed to recover
to a relatively strong 5 to 6 percent of
GDP.

28.      The authorities are acting on
the conviction that reforms of the
system of rights-based transfers and Source: BH Central Bank, World Bank staff estimates
public sector wage bill management
are necessary, not because of the crises, but to ensure fiscal sustainability and stronger growth in
the medium term. The program of fiscal consolidation includes reforms of (a) social benefits and other
transfers to individuals; (b) public sector pay and employment; and (c) social and health insurance
contributions, as well as indirect taxes to support competitiveness. On the revenue side the Government
has recently introduced a fuel surcharge tax which is expected to yield an additional 0.3 percent of GDP
in 201011 and further excise taxes increases will be made to harmonize rates with those of the EU over the
medium term. The growth in excise taxes is expected to contribute an additional 0.5 percentage points to
total tax revenue by 2010.

29.      Although the stability of the financial sector has not been seriously undermined by the
crisis, the authorities are taking additional measures to preserve it and facilitate the flow of credit
to the private sector. They have recently conducted stress tests, which revealed that the banking sector is
vulnerable to (i) a large increase in nonperforming loans; (ii) a large shock in funding costs; (iii) the
indirect effect of a large depreciation; and (iv) a deposit run. To monitor and mitigate these risks, they
decided to form a Standing Committee on Financial Stability and to sign an MoU between the two Entity
Banking Agencies on financial stability, crisis preparedness, and crisis management. The two Entity
Banking Agencies will introduce a universal requirement for banks to participate in deposit insurance. In
addition, foreign banks (which control 95 percent of total banking assets) have committed through the so-
called Vienna Initiative to maintain at least the current level of exposure to BH as well as to increase
capital of their banks incorporated in BH. These measures are expected to secure the stability of the
banking sector in the coming years, as well as to restore the flow of credit to the private sector. Credit to
the private sector is expected to resume growing in 2010, albeit at a slower pace than before the crisis
(around 4 percent per year).

30.     On the external side, measures embedded in the Government program will lead to a CAD
reduction by 2012 and ensure stable Central Bank reserves, but the proposed framework requires
substantial external financing. The CAD is expected to average around 8 percent until 2012 and to start
dropping in 2012 (see Table 1). This level of CAD assumes continuous fiscal consolidation to increase
public savings, a resumption of credit growth at a significantly slower pace (see above), measures to

  The tax went into force in June 2009. It is expected to increase revenues by 0.7 percent of GDP in total, 0.3
percent in 2009 and 0.4 percent in 2010.
                                                      15
maintain wage competitiveness (such as the planned reduction in the rate of healthcare contributions in
the Federation), and other reforms aimed at improving private sector competitiveness (e.g. privatizations
and business environment reforms). Although sustainable over the medium term, this level of CAD will
require additional external financing sources in excess of the expected private and public financing
sources. On average, the financing gap is projected to amount to 2.7 percent of GDP between 2009 and
2012 and it would be fully covered through the planned IMF, WB, and EC programs.

31.     Notwithstanding the need for additional external financing, the macroeconomic framework
embedded in the Government's program ensures a sustainable debt level over the medium term,
although some vulnerability to shocks remains. Largely as a result of the increase in public sector
borrowing (during the crisis), external debt is expected to grow from 44.4 percent in 2008 to 57.0 percent
in 2011, but to fall thereafter. Public sector debt would grow from 17.2 percent in 2008 to 28.4 percent in
2011. The debt appears sustainable under the base-case scenario of the World Bank, as well as more
recent IMF debt sustainability analysis. The scenario assumes sustained fiscal consolidation through the
implementation of the planned reforms. That scenario would be vulnerable to (unlikely) currency
depreciation, a non-interest CAD shock, an unexpected slowdown in GDP growth, and of course,
inadequate fiscal consolidation. In particular a depreciation of 30 percent would imply an increase in the
debt level to around 70 percent of GDP.12 However, the strength of the political consensus, relatively high
FX reserves and the IMF program render the scenario of depreciation highly unlikely.

32.     On the other hand, there are significant political and social risks that may adversely affect
the plans to achieve fiscal consolidation, but the authorities have engaged in public awareness
campaign to minimize them (see Consultations section). The measures the authorities have taken to
reduce public sector wages and social benefits have been resisted by the relevant interest groups,
especially in the Federation. This also signals that the affected interest groups may resist the efforts to
implement fully the measures embedded in this program to reform the rights-based benefits and public
sector wages. These risks are aggravated by the impending general elections in 2010, and there are past
examples of Governments in BH backtracking on agreed reforms. Accordingly, the authorities have
engaged in public awareness campaigns to build support for the planned reforms. The polls conducted
recently by the largest daily in the Federation indicate that the public overwhelmingly supports the
reforms to enhance the targeting to need of cash transfers. The public is generally aware that the recent
expansion of rights-based benefits is unsustainable and that reforms are necessary.

33.     The main risk is that of failure to adhere to the ongoing reform program. The impact of a
lower growth shock would be significant. The debt-sustainability analysis conducted in the context of the
IMF SBA shows that a shock that cuts average growth over 2009-2014 from the projected 3 percent to 2
percent would require additional adjustments to reduce the accumulation of foreign debt. Though growth
prospects are uncertain, if the reforms envisaged under the IMF SBA, and this DPL are implemented, the
Government's position will be sustainable. However, if the fiscal consolidation reforms are not
implemented, BH authorities would not be able to finance current public expenditures even if they were
to severely cut capital spending13. Under this scenario, arrears on public salaries and cash transfers would
most likely be accumulated, which would probably be politically less palatable to the ruling coalition than
the planned reforms.

34.      The macroeconomic framework prepared by BH authorities and reforms that underpin it
are sound and warrant the proposed operation. If implemented, the reforms planned by the authorities
will result in sustainable levels of debt, stronger economic growth and faster poverty reduction. As noted
above, there are significant risks associated with the Government's plan. However, these risks are not
unduly high and the risks of inaction are even greater.

                             III.       THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

35.      The Government's program is designed to redress past fiscal excesses, to achieve greater
efficiency and fairness in social spending, reduce growth-inhibiting deficits and create fiscal space
for more productive spending programs, as well as to remove burdens on firm competitiveness.
The Government is introducing reforms that will shift from a rights-based to a needs-based system of
social protection. It will take measures to contain the public sector wage bill and relate pay more directly
to skills. It will take steps that will reduce the level of social contributions, harmonize tax and
contribution systems between the entities and adjust other indirect taxes to improve competitiveness.
Public support for these reforms has been build through a consultative process described in Section IV.F.

                                         A.          SOCIAL PROTECTION

36.     At 4 percent of its GDP, BH has one of the highest levels of non-contributory social
protection cash transfers in Europe and Central Asia (ECA). In the region, the average is 1.6 percent
of GDP, and in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) the average is 2.5
percent. This level of spending is fiscally unsustainable, economically inefficient, and socially
inequitable.

37.      Overall, the distribution of non-contributory benefits is regressive. Targeting accuracy is
poor, with a higher share of benefits going to those in the richer quintiles than the poorer ones. Those in
the poorest quintile (representing 20 percent of the population) receive 16.9 percent of total non-
contributory benefits, and the pattern is similar for contributory and total social protection benefits. The
situation is particularly acute in the FBH where just 14.1 percent of the non-contributory benefits go to
those in the poorest quintile. The distribution of overall social assistance benefits is slightly progressive in
RS, where those in the poorest quintile receive about 25.7 percent of non-contributory social benefits.
However, even this slightly progressive outcome is relatively weak compared to outcomes in many
countries in the ECA region.

the most regressive, with 26.7 percent of veteran-related benefits reaching those in the richest quintile of
the population, and less than 15 percent going to the poorest quintile. The civilian child protection
allowance (which is means-tested) and other benefits including Social Assistance (SA), Non-war
Disability (NWD) and Civilian Victims of War (CVW) are somewhat better targeted, with 25 to 30
percent going to the poorest quintile, although these outcomes compare unfavorably with other countries.

39.     The composition of civilian benefits in FBH has evolved in favor of rights-based disability
benefits. With the introduction of benefits for people with non-war related disabilities and civilian
victims of war, the composition of civilian benefits has changed significantly over the past five years. In
2005 means-tested social assistance and child protection benefits dominated. But by 2009 these accounted
for only 15 percent and 17 percent of spending on civilian transfers respectively. Disability benefits for
non-war disability increased substantially, accounting for over half of spending on civilian-related non-
contributory transfers by 2009.

40.     This shift in the composition of benefits in FBH has also been accompanied by an expansion
in the overall envelope for both veteran-related and civilian benefits. Broad trends indicate that over
the years expenditure on non-contributory cash transfers grew faster in FBH than in RS (details in Annex
VII.E).

41.      Rights-based benefits have driven the overall increases in social spending on non-
contributory benefits, especially in FBH. Since 2006 FBH's overall spending on non-contributory cash
transfers has been driven largely by demobilized soldiers and non-war disability benefits (NWD). Both
have grown rapidly causing spending on civilian benefits to increase almost threefold during 2006­08,
and spending on veteran-related benefits to nearly double in the same period. So far, RS has largely
resisted pressure to introduce similar benefits. In 2007 a token annual benefit was introduced for
demobilized soldiers, but with a cost of just KM12 million per year (first budgeted in 2008) it is
manageable. Meanwhile, the amounts devoted to veteran-related disability benefits, although they remain
very high, have been flat in both FBH and RS. Over time, the proliferation of rights-based benefits has led
to increased beneficiary numbers at the expense of means-tested programs, especially in FBH. Since the
introduction of the NWD benefit in 2006, the number of beneficiaries has tripled.

42.     Confronted with a fiscal crisis and growing social pressure to rationalize the safety net in
response to it, the Government is developing updated tools to improve the targeting of non-
contributory benefits. An improved targeting mechanism would help address the issues raised above and
support a shift from the politically expedient rights-based approach to a more neutral needs-based
approach that enhances benefits for those who are socially and economically vulnerable.
                                                      19
43.      In 2009, the Government of FBH took important steps towards rationalizing its existing
non-contributory social protection cash transfer programs. In January 2009 it announced the "Social
Pact" which represents a commitment by key stakeholders (including trade union representatives and
employers) to rationalize the safety net in FBH including improved targeting, fiscal restraint, improved
benefit registries, oversight and control, and improvements to the Medical Examinations Institute which is
responsible for overseeing certification for disability benefits.

44.     The shift from the predominantly rights-based approach to a needs-focused approach is
being reinforced in the Law on Targeting of Cash Benefits to Individuals of the Government of
FBH that strengthens fiscal responsibility in social protection and veterans benefits inter alia by
mandating needs-based targeting of benefit programs, rigorous costing of financing commitments,
indexation of benefits to inflation rather than wage growth and improved governance and accountability
through integrated beneficiary registries. The principles of the Law on Targeting of Cash Benefits to
Individuals are being fleshed out in four specific pieces of social protection legislation:

            The Law on Basic Social Welfare and Minimum Social Protection legally defines the
            concepts of `last-resort social assistance' and `social services', define the financing
            responsibilities for social protection at all levels of Government, and establish the legal
            framework for means-testing of social benefits.
            The Law on the Basic Rights of People with Disabilities (civilian) stipulates the introduction
            of means testing of disability benefits.
            The Law on Protection of Civilian Victims of War stipulates the introduction of means
            testing of disability benefits.
            The Law on Protection of Families with Children is pursuing social protection and child
            welfare related objectives while at the same time introducing an income test to define
            eligibility for child allowance.

In addition, legislation regulating war veterans' benefits is being amended to incorporate means testing
for benefits to disabled veterans with a low level of disability and families of deceased soldiers.

45.     The Government has also requested assistance in improving the monitoring of beneficiaries
and spending on non-contributory social benefits to improve the cost-efficiency of benefit
administration and increase transparency and accountability. Improved benefit administration could be
achieved through an in-depth functional review of the current registry processes, information flows and
data management, institutional roles and responsibilities at all levels of Government with the ultimate
objective of establishing a unified registry. Benefit administration will benefit from eligibility audits
which would be especially critical for the governance and cost containment of programs which have
recently experienced such rapid growth of beneficiary numbers. These efforts will be supported by
capacity building through the Social Safety Net and Employment Support project described in section
IV.C below.

                   B.      PUBLIC SECTOR PAY AND WAGE BILL MANAGEMENT

46.      The public wage bill has been the second most important driver of the fiscal crisis. During
the period 2003-2005 the ratio of the aggregate wage bill to GDP ran considerably higher than the EU
average, driven by particularly high wage rates for certain employment categories. The country needs
effective public administration in order to build the institutions for a strong European state. However, the
cost of the public administration should not jeopardize long-term macroeconomic stability. After 2005 the
wage bill had gradually declined as a share of GDP, creating fiscal space for other public priorities
including public investment. Since 2007, however, entity and state Governments gave public servants
large pay adjustments and the wage bill to GDP has begun to creep up again by 0.1 percent each year. As
                                                    20
recently as 2009, Governments in BH were increasing wage rates in a way that generated new and
unsustainable spending obligations.

47.      The quality of the pay system also matters, and BH approaches have diverged in several
ways from common European practices. The Bank's 2006 PER highlighted several weaknesses in the
public sector compensation system that likely impeded recruitment and motivation of skilled workers.
For example, there was a heavy reliance upon allowances, which reduced the transparency of the system
and contributed to unequal pay for similar skill positions. Secondly, the salary structure was highly
compressed, meaning that there were relatively small differences in pay between positions requiring low
and high skill levels. Third, the overall salary system tended to be more competitive with the private
sector for lower-skill than for higher-skill positions.

48.      Some progress has been made since 2008 in improving the structure of the pay system, but
this has been unevenly applied across BH. The RS passed a new salary law and accompanying
legislation that eliminated virtually all allowances (except for seniority) and revalued the base salary as
the primary component of compensation. In addition, they decompressed the salary range so that the
weight of responsibility in higher level professional technical categories was better reflected in the pay
differentials. They have also begun to reduce potential barriers to career advancement by reducing the
number of years of experience required before reaching higher level posts.

49.      The more complex governance structure within the FBH, and differences in tax treatment
for non-wage compensation, have made progress more elusive for the FBH and the State. At the
State level, a new salary law has been implemented that offers some progress ­ as it decompresses the
salary ranges for professional/technical positions and creates career advancement opportunities that do not
require promotion into a vacant post. Nevertheless, allowances are still a large part of the compensation
structure and it is conceivable that problems of internal equity persist. In FBH a new salary law was
drafted by interested stakeholders, but in its current form it may do little to change the overall structure
and has never received Government's approval. The exemption of allowances from taxation in FBH may
be a strong incentive for trade unions to favor the current system.

50.     Governments in BH have also been concerned about the relative pay differences across the
different levels of Government, and the vicious circle of inter-Government competition it creates for
skilled staff (within a finite skills and resource pool). In FBH this is reflected in competition with
some of the better-financed cantons and municipalities on the one hand, and with the RS and State on the
other. Similar concerns about relative competitiveness exist within the RS and State. This creates
incentives to keep raising wage rates to keep pace with other Governments. On the other hand, there are
also concerns that some cantons and municipalities may be abusing the constitutional flexibility they have
and setting pay for some senior posts at extraordinarily high levels. Since revenues of the State must be
shared across Governments, it is desirable to have a common set of rules on personnel expenditures as
well.

            C.      SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION AND INDIRECT TAX MEASURES IN SUPPORT OF
                                      COMPETITIVENESS


51.     To sustain international competitiveness within the CBA, the authorities face the challenge
of reducing the relatively high social contributions rates, but have difficulty finding the fiscal space
to do so given past surges in the cost of wages and transfers. Overall social contributions rates are
particularly high in the Federation. For all social contributions combined the rate in the Federation
amounts to 42.5 percent of gross salary. This is much higher than in RS (28 percent) or the OECD
average (29.5 percent) or EU-8 average (38.1 percent).14 The authorities have been trying to reduce social
contribution rates in recent years, and managed to reduce the rate of that for unemployment from 2.5 to
1.5 percent. However, in the face of increasing current expenditures on transfers and the wage bill, there
has been no fiscal space for a more serious reduction.

52.      The obsolete health financing system is one of the main reasons for high social contributions
rates. The foundations of the BH system of social contributions were developed during socialist times,
when the economy was operating near full employment and the gray economy was negligible. Currently,
administrative data show an unemployment rate of 41 percent. The ratio of those who work in the formal
sector and pay social contributions to those who are entitled to healthcare is around 1:5. A system of
health insurance, that is entirely financed by social contributions, in current circumstances with large grey
economy, is not only unfair, it also undermines firm competitiveness and creates disincentives to
formality.

53.      Progress has been uneven across the two Entities. The RS has moved away from a health
insurance system financed entirely by contributions to one that is partially financed by general revenues.
This system is more efficient than the one in the Federation, which is almost entirely (96 percent)
dependent on social contributions. The Federation Government, on the other hand, has had an ongoing
dialogue with the World Bank on reducing the social contribution rate for health insurance, with the idea
of shifting some of the financing burden to general revenues. The need to enhance the competitiveness of
the private sector against the backdrop of currency devaluations in the region and the determination to
preserve the currency board arrangement in BH, has given greater impetus to plans to lower social
contribution rates.

54.      The authorities recognize the desirability of the Federation moving away from a system
which is almost entirely funded by health contributions towards a funding structure based on a mix
of social contributions and general revenues. The Federation Ministers of Health and Finance voiced
their strong support for such reform measures, recognizing that reductions in the health contribution rate
would help significantly to reducing labor costs, enhancing firm competitiveness, and encouraging
formalization of the grey sector. With technical assistance from the World Bank, their two ministries are
developing a plan for the phased reduction of the health contribution rate from 16.5 percent to a target of
13 percent of gross salary.

55.      Rate reductions would be made possible by a combination of (i) tax base broadening, and
(ii) additional amounts from general revenue, such that overall financing for health care is not
reduced as a share of GDP. Fiscal space created by the other reforms in the social transfer system may
facilitate this process while staying within the macro fiscal parameters of the IMF SBA program.

56.     First, while recognizing that for demographic and other reasons it may not be possible to
fully harmonize the contribution rates, the authorities will seek harmonization of the base for social

contributions and the personal income tax across the two Entities. At present, social contribution
bases and rates differ across the two Entities. In RS the base includes non-wage benefits, while in the
Federation non-wage benefits are not included in the base. The rates for pension, health, and
unemployment contributions also differ between the two Entities. These differences not only cause
revenue losses, but they also create an impediment to labor mobility and impose administrative costs for
companies which employ workers in both Entities.

57.     Second, the authorities have also been contemplating increases indirect taxes which are less
distortive (than payroll taxation). The BH Parliament has already adopted a new Law on Excise Tax,
which will secure additional revenues from fuel excises to be used in the construction of strategic
highway projects. The Government has also been considering further increases in excise tax rates beyond
the recent measure, as well as possible increases in the rate of VAT. With low income taxation, indirect
taxes (VAT, excise, and customs) are already the most significant source of budget revenue at all levels of
Government, amounting to around 70 percent of total revenue, but untapped revenue potential remains.
BH has a flat VAT rate of 17 percent, which is relatively low compared to EU and countries in the
region.15 BH also has an excise regime on petroleum, tobacco and coffee products, alcoholic and non-
alcoholic beverages. Excise taxes have recently been raised, but are lower than those in the EU countries
and some countries in the region.


              IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                       A.       LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

58.      The advent of the global economic crisis has heightened the relevance of some program
goals of the CPS. The DPL will support the CPS goals of a) reducing the burden of Government on the
economy and strengthening fiscal coordination and b) improving the targeting of social benefits. As the
crisis has unfolded an intense policy dialogue has emerged on these issues within the Government and
between the Government and relevant stakeholders, and has increased the level of Government
commitment to undertake these politically challenging reforms. This has been given further impetus by
the sharp fall of public revenues and the need for external budget support.

59.       In addition, the program will provide support for the objectives of CPS Pillar I ­ improving
the environment for private sector led growth and convergence to Europe. Implementation of social
benefit and public sector wage bill reforms will create fiscal space to increase the level of public
investments in essential infrastructure, from the currently relatively low levels of around 5 percent of
GDP. It will also contribute to the reduction of fiscal deficits, which inhibit economic growth as a number
of studies have shown.16 The policy actions under Pillar III of the program on reducing the rate of social
contributions for healthcare in the Federation and the harmonization of BH customs tariff with that of the
EU would significantly enhance the competitiveness of BH companies. The BH also has higher customs
tariff rates on a number of imported production inputs than those applicable in the EU, which hinders the
competitiveness traded-good industries. Harmonizing the customs tariff with that of the EU, would not
only enhance private sector competitiveness, it will also facilitate the convergence to Europe. Finally, the
program objective to harmonize the base for social contributions will improve labor mobility and cut the
administrative costs for companies operating in both BH's Entities, thus improving the business
environment.

                  B.      COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

IMF

60.      The DPL has been prepared in tandem with the IMF Standby Agreement (SBA), approved
on July 8, 2009, and the policies it supports are central to the latter's success. There has been
extensive collaboration between the two institutions during the preparation of their respective programs to
ensure consistency and complementarity. The SBA is primarily focused on measures to safeguard the
currency board and cushion the effects of the deteriorating external environment, while adopting policies
to redress fiscal imbalances and strengthen the financial sector. The SBA has several key prior actions
including adoption of rebalanced budgets by Entity Governments, amendments to the wage bill
legislation by the Council of Ministers, adoption of a Law on Savings in the Federation and adoption of a
new Excise Tax Law, and a Global Framework by the Fiscal Council. These are primarily designed to
prevent the deficit from swelling unsustainably in 2009 and rely on across-the-board cuts in wages, social
benefits and other short term measures. These cuts are politically challenging and the IMF recognizes the
need for more refined structural reforms in these areas over the medium term. Both the Fund and the
Government have asked that the Bank assist in this process through the DPL and this is reflected in the
Government's Letter of Intent for the SBA which states.

        "The Federation Government will undertake a comprehensive reform of its rights-based benefits
        system, in consultation with the World Bank."
        "Over the medium term, we will seek the assistance of the World Bank to undertake a
        comprehensive income and property census and introduce means-testing for all civilian and war-
        related benefits."
        "Our Governments recognize the importance of further reforming public administration. To this
        end, we will launch a comprehensive review of the various functions and responsibilities, with the
        objective of strengthening the quality and efficiency of public administration."
        "Along with the objective to provide a more efficient public administration, the Federation
        Government will adopt a comprehensive wage law, which, among others, will aim at
        consolidating all allowances and bonuses into the main wage."


European Commission

61.      The EC will align its Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) program with the objectives of the
DPL program. The EC is planning to provide euro 100 million of assistance under its MFA in 2010. The
Bank and the IMF have held a series of three-part discussions with the EC (DG ECFIN and DG
Enlargement). These have been held with the objective of ensuring consistency and synergy between the
three programs. The alignment of program objectives means the resources of the EC will give greater
weight to the DPL program, especially in the latter part of the DPL series when Bank resources will be
relatively less. The Bank is also working with the EBRD the EIB as well as the IMF to ensure continued
flows of private external resources to BH. The Bank also participated in the Vienna meetings with foreign
banks and the IMF in which understanding was reached on the rollover of credit lines.

62.     The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) has encouraged the authorities to actively pursue
the objectives of the DPL program. The PIC (the intergovernmental body that monitors the
implementation of the Dayton peace agreement) stated in its June 2009 communiqué that it "encouraged
the authorities to work with the World Bank in designing and implementing reforms to render the systems
of social benefits and public sector pay more sustainable, more efficient, and more equitable ....". The
June statement was further reinforced in the PIC February 2010 communiqué: "In light of the challenging
economic situation, the PIC Steering Board urged all BiH authorities to adhere to their commitments

                                                    24
under the IMF Standby Arrangement, which include reforming public spending, in particular the system
of cash transfers to individuals and families, by making it financially sustainable, socially equitable, and
economically efficient. In this regard, the PIC Steering Board noted with satisfaction that progress in
meeting the relevant conditions has been made at the state and entity levels, and encouraged the
authorities to build upon this progress in the forthcoming period."



                       C.       RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

Social Safety Nets and Employment Support Project

63.       The DPL program is closely linked to the Social Safety Nets and Employment Support
Project, passed by the World Bank Board of Directors on February 25, 2010. The Project
Development Objectives for this project are (i) to support non-insurance cash transfers in reaching the
eligible poor and disabled; (ii) to improve the efficiency and transparency of benefits administration; and
(iii) to support job brokerage services for those active job seekers who become ineligible to receive cash
transfers or who are vulnerable. These objectives would be achieved by supporting policy, technical and
systems reforms, and investments in the areas of (a) targeting; (b) registry and benefits administration
improvements; (c) capacity building; (d) income support and job creation; and (e) monitoring and
evaluation. Ultimately, these investments would contribute to protecting and improving the living
standards of the poor and vulnerable in times of crisis and beyond. Support would focus on the overall
safety net, as well as specific segments of the safety net, such as disability benefits, child protection
allowances, war veterans' benefits, income and employment support programs, unified beneficiary
registry and program monitoring and evaluation.

64.      The Social Safety Nets and Employment Support Project will invest in the Government's
targeting mechanisms for social safety nets and therefore directly supports the DPL's objectives.
These two partner operations are mutually reinforcing, with the DPL underpinning the policy framework
for reform, and the SIL supporting technical and implementation capacity under this policy framework.
Once these tools are established, the determination of specific threshold levels for eligibility "cut-offs"
would be the Government's prerogative and would depend less on technical considerations and more on
fiscal space and political will. The technical tools (unified registry, targeting tools) will be developed for
the full range of social benefits (civilian and war veterans' benefits). There is recognition among the
policy makers of the importance of developing this comprehensive framework for all benefits, but then
rolling it out gradually in a step-wise manner with continued investments in building consensus across
stakeholders.

                                       D.       LESSONS LEARNED

65.      The design of the proposed operation reflects experience gained from previous World Bank
structural adjustment operations. The Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC) which was closed in
2001 was rated Satisfactory. The ICR for SOSAC indicated that the main lessons learned were that: "The
Bank was effective in understanding the political economy of change," that "a substantial shift in
officials' attitudes was key to successful reform." The subsequent SOSAC II was cancelled and the
Economic Management Structural Adjustment Credit (EMSAC) which supported an agenda similar to the
one proposed for the new DPLs was rated moderately unsatisfactory after it was allowed to close without
disbursement of the second tranche. The Note on Cancelled Operation (NCO) for SOSAC II, among
other things, cited the lack of political ownership and the complex operation design as major reasons for
failure. Poor political economy analysis and understanding, attempts to undertake politically unpopular
reforms of strengthening central institutions, and issues related to sequencing of reforms were seen as
some of the key issues that affected the performance of EMSAC.

                                                     25
66.     The lessons of the previous successful and failed development policy operations have informed
the present operation. These are:

              Strong demand and reform ownership by the client are crucial for success. The
              failure of the SOSAC II operation can in part be explained by the fact that it imposed
              rather strict expenditure constraints on a politically very sensitive category of public
              expenditures at the time when public revenues were performing relatively well. The need
              for additional World Bank financing was not very strong at the time. Now, as public
              revenues in BH have been severely hit as a result of the global crisis, the BH authorities
              have approached the Bank to provide budget support. There is also a broad understanding
              among the political leaders (and increasingly among general public) that poor management
              of social transfers and public sector wage bill are the key causes of unsustainable fiscal
              deficits (particularly in the Federation) and that the economic crisis only exacerbates the
              problem. There is a broadening consensus among the majority of ministers and MPs that
              hard decisions are necessary and the Ministers of Finance, and Labor, and the Prime
              Ministers in both Entities have been advocating the social sector reforms. Finally, a major
              lesson from SOSAC is that strong demand and ownership by both Entities is necessary
              and challenges in this regard have proved greater for the Federation than for the RS.

              The design of reforms needs to take into account political constraints and
              sensitivities. Experience with SOSAC II and EMSAC indicates that there sensitivities
              regarding veterans' benefits and the role of central institutions. The design of the new
              DPL series reflects the need for understanding the relative strength of political
              constituencies for and against certain reforms, and includes steps to secure public support
              for them (see Section IV.F. Risks and Risk Mitigation). With respect to veterans' benefits
              the design reflects that: a) there are numerous and influential lobbies in both Entities; b)
              cutting benefits across the board is likely to be strongly resisted by veterans; c) the
              political scene in the Federation is more complex and this issue is more sensitive. Efforts
              have been made a) to listen to political leaders on what is feasible, b) to undertake joint
              actions with the authorities to secure the support of the general public, but also segments
              of the veterans' population for reforms on the grounds of fairness, equity, efficiency, and
              fiscal sustainability. With respect to the issue of strengthening the role of central
              institutions, the Bank will avoid undue risk by supporting improved coordination rather
              than outright unification of institutions at the central level.

              Appropriate sequencing is critical. As in other countries, politically difficult reforms in
              BH are more challenging in an election year. In October 2010 BH will hold general
              elections and it will be a difficult time for taking politically challenging decisions. The
              Government has therefore opted for front loading the policy actions with the bulk of
              difficult political decisions coming in 2009 or early 2010 thereby avoiding a clash with the
              elections. The focus will be on the technical implementation (that does not require new
              political decisions) in late 2010 and 2011.

              The design of reforms also needs to be tailored to the client's implementation
              capacity. One of the lessons of the SOSAC II operation is that complex operations can
              overburden countries with limited political and technical capacity and that less ambitious
              and more flexible programs may be better for achieving significant results. The proposed
              operation therefore has a relatively narrow focus, with reforms that are sequenced over
              three years in line with developing implementation capacities supported by the SIL.

67.     In recent years, the Bank has undertaken extensive economic and sector work that has
helped develop the policy content of the proposed operation. In addition to the work outlined in the
table below analytical activities also include a set of policy notes and discussions with the Fiscal Council
on a broad spectrum of policy issues.

                                            F.       CONSULTATIONS

68.      The authorities in both BH Entities have carried out consultations with key stakeholders
which have shaped the evolution of the policy matrix. The consultations have largely focused on the
politically most challenging aspects of the policy reforms, those of war veterans' benefits. In both the
Federation and the RS, the ministries in charge of veterans' affairs have held consultative meetings with
veterans' associations to discuss the reform of the system, with the aim of eliminating fraud, securing
sustainability and predictability of benefits, and improving equity. Veterans' associations have voiced
their strong support for conducting eligibility audits to eliminate what is deemed to be a significant level
of fraud in the system of disabled war veterans' protection. In the Federation, the Minister for Veterans'
Affairs solicited the consent of the veterans' associations for introducing means testing for disabled war

                                                          27
veterans below 60 percent disability, as well as for the families of deceased soldiers. In the RS, the
Ministry has also informed the Bank that the veterans' associations in that Entity would consent to
equivalent reforms, as long as they are implemented in both Entities, which would ensure equal treatment
for the veterans of both Entities. Efforts to inform the citizens about the proposed reforms have led to
their increasing support to the reforms of the veterans' and social benefits systems. In a recent poll by the
largest daily in BH, 75 percent of respondents supported the introduction of means testing for veterans'
and civilian benefits.

69.      The Bank has carried out extensive consultations with BH authorities at the technical and
political level both to prepare the policy matrix as well as to communicate its contents to those who
were not involved in the preparation process. Policies contained in the DPL policy matrix, especially
those related to the reform of cash transfers, are a product of analysis and consultations with relevant
authorities that have been carried out over the past several years. The consultations process with the
authorities and other stakeholders pertaining to these reforms benefited from the dissemination of the
Bank Report No. AAA333-BA, "Social Assistance Transfers in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Moving toward
a More Sustainable and Better-Targeted Safety Net, April 30, 2009" which provides the analytical
underpinning of the social sector reforms which the DPL addresses. During the DPL team missions to
BH in June and September 2009, consultations were held with the key members of the Federation
Parliament (both position and opposition), as well as the leaders of the governing political parties in both
Entities and the BH State. Following the advice of the Federation Prime Minister, we have also held
consultations with the Federation President and Vice Presidents and gained their support on the contents
of the policy matrix.

70.     The policy matrix has been revised as a result of the consultations held by the authorities
with the veterans' associations to reflect their agreement on specific policy issues. The original
policy matrix included provisions for the abolition of the benefits for War Medal Holders and those for
demobilized soldiers as of January 1, 2010. Given the sensitive nature of these policies, agreement was
made on alternative measures that would allow for means testing of the veterans benefits and for
termination of the benefits of demobilized soldiers as of May 1, 2010, but with the legislation for this to
be passed as a prior action. This adjustment has facilitated acceptance of the overall program.
Furthermore, to better reflect the agreement between the authorities and beneficiaries of disability benefits
(both veterans and civilians), the provisions for comprehensive eligibility audits for disability benefits
have been strengthened.


                              V.        THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                                   A.     OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE

71.     The proposed operation which is the first of a programmatic series of three DPLs spanning
about three years has three broad objectives: (1) to increase social assistance to the poor, while
reducing the fiscal deficit and creating fiscal space for poverty-reducing growth, (2) to improve the
structure and efficiency of public expenditure, and (3) to reduce social contribution rates and pressures on
private sector wages from faster wage growth in the public sector thereby enhancing private sector
competitiveness. These broad objectives will be pursued through policy measures falling in three areas
that form the core of the program: 1) introduction of more effective, efficient and equitable social
protection policies; 2) better public wage and management policies; and 3) social contribution and tax
measures that support competitiveness. The proposed DPL aims to tackle reforms in those areas of public
sector expenditure which have been the main driver of pro-cyclical, growth-hindering, and unsustainable
fiscal policies, notably very high and poorly targeted expenditure on social transfers and a high public
sector wage bill. In addition, the program aims to improve external competitiveness of the private sector
by lowering health (and possibly unemployment) insurance contributions in formal sector employment.
                                                     28
72.     The proposed operation would achieve its objective by contributing to a larger international
effort bringing together IMF, EU and other development partners providing financial support in
an amount of US$1.7 billion. The direct financial contribution of this operation is relatively modest at
the amount equivalent to US$ 111 million. However, the contribution of this operation to the reform
agenda is significant as it tackles the structural reforms needed to improve fiscal sustainability and the
quality and equity of access to public sector programs, enhance social protection systems to address the
immediate needs of the vulnerable but also to ensure more effective social protection over the longer
term. The Bank is well placed to engage in these areas as it can draw on its rich base of analytic work, and
an ongoing policy dialogue.

        B.       EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE SOCIAL PROTECTION POLICIES

73.     The actions in this pillar of the program support two of the operations' development policy
objectives (DPOs). The sustainability as well as the structure and efficiency of public expenditure are
addressed through better targeting and means-testing of social and unemployment benefits and
improvements to administrative arrangements. Progress towards attaining the DPOs is measured by
indices relating to overall benefit expenditure levels, targeting accuracy measures, growth and poverty
incidence impacts and a set of program-specific fiscal savings targets.

Targeting and means testing

74.     The prior actions for DPL1 are:
              Enactment of Laws on Targeting of Cash Benefits by the Entities' Parliaments mandating
              targeting to need. (FBH, RS)
              Enactment of legislation by the Entities' Parliaments amending: (i) FBH Law on Rights of
              Defenders and Their Families (OG No.33/04, as amended); and, (ii) RS Law on the Rights
              of War Veterans and Families of Deceased Soldiers (OG No. 55/07) so as to introduce as of
              January 1, 2011, targeting to means with respect to the following benefits: (i) disabled war
              veterans with disability level 20 percent to 50 percent, inclusive; and (ii) all family benefits,
              with the exception of children under age of 27 if in full time education. (FBH, RS)
              Enactment of legislation by the FBH Parliament amending the FBH Law on Special Rights
              of the Holders of Military Decorations (OG No. 70/05) with a view to introducing income
              means testing as of May 1, 2010. (FBH)
              Enactment of legislation by FBH Parliament repealing the Law on Rights of Demobilized
              Soldiers and their Families (OG No. 61/06) and providing that benefits extended to current
              beneficiaries pursuant to said Law will cease on April 30, 2010. (FBH)
              Enactment of legislation by the FBH Parliament for the introduction of the coefficient
              mechanism for all rights-based benefit schemes (FBH): FBH Law on Targeting of Cash
              Benefits; FBH Law on Rights of Defenders and Their Families (OG No.33/04, as
              amended), Law on Special Rights of the Holders of Military Decorations (OG No. 70/05)
              Enactment of legislation by the FBH Parliament for the introduction of indexation of
              rights-based benefits to inflation rather than wage growth: FBH Law on Targeting of Cash
              Benefits; FBH Law on Rights of Defenders and Their Families (OG No.33/04, as
              amended), Law on Special Rights of the Holders of Military Decorations (OG No. 70/05)




                                                     29
75.     The proposed triggers for DPL2 are:
              Adoption of regulations by the Entities establishing specific thresholds and all other
              parameters for means-testing of all civilian, military and veterans benefits. (FBH, RS)
              2010 the HBS data collected and processed on schedule. (FBH, RS)

76.     The proposed trigger for DPL3 is:
             Recertification and registration census complete; further applications and eligibility
             screening carried out with the revised (proxy) means testing criteria on an on-demand basis
             at local welfare offices. (FBH, RS)

Benefits administration

77.     The prior actions for DPL1 are:
              Enactment by the Entity Parliament of legislation mandating eligibility audits for rights-
              based veterans' benefits, which will include a detailed plan to implement the legislation
              with a clear set of priorities for the conduct of the said audits which would include, but not
              be limited to, a targeted review of all disabled veterans in the disability category of 60
              percent -80 percent. (FBH)
              Adoption of an action plan by the Entity Governments, in form and substance satisfactory
              to the Bank, to improve the carrying out of audits of the current status and rights of
              disabled war veterans, including all disabled war veterans in disability categories 1 to 10
              and the families of deceased soldiers. (RS)

78.     The proposed triggers for DPL2 are:
              Completion by the Entities' veterans' affairs ministries of eligibility audits for rights-based
              benefits including targeted review of all disabled veterans in the disability category of 60
              percent - 80 percent in the FBH and disability categories 1 to 10 in the RS. (FBH, RS)
              Revised functional and institutional arrangements approved by the FBH and RS
              Ministries of Finance for operation of integrated databases. (FBH, RS)

79.     The proposed trigger for DPL3 is:
              Unified registry functioning with common software and hardware platform that allows for
              real-time reporting, data-warehousing of eligibility information for all applicants, and
              tracking of multiple benefits for each beneficiary. (FBH, RS)



                  C.       PUBLIC SECTOR PAY AND WAGE BILL MANAGEMENT

80.      Actions in this pillar of the operation support two of the operations' DPOs. The proposed
operation includes reforms related to improving management of the public service, including the public
sector pay system. These serve to improve the sustainability of the public expenditures and limiting
pressure on private sector wages. As discussed above, the share of budget expenditures going to personnel
costs has been traditionally quite high but public administration effectiveness remains a challenge. The
EU accession process has brought to light a number of areas where the quality of public administration
needs to be strengthened for Bosnia to realize its longer time aspirations for membership. The reforms
covered in the proposed program include measures aimed at (a) controlling the aggregate cost of the
public service, and (b) bringing about structural reforms to the pay system that could improve ability to
recruit, retain, and motivate high skilled staff in the public sector while avoiding excessive pressure on
                                                    30
private sector wages. Progress on achievement of the DPOs is measured by indicators relating to the
overall public sector wage bill as a share of GDP and of recurrent spending as well as reductions in the
proportion of allowances in total compensation, the variation in pay across similar skill classes and the
compression ratio by skill class.

Wage Bill Management

81.     The proposed trigger for DPL2 is:
             BH consolidated public sector wage bill in 2010 is held constant as a share of GDP
             (compared to end-December 2009 levels and average gross pay rates do not increase more
             than inflation.

82.     The proposed trigger for DPL3 is:
             BH consolidated public sector wage bill in 2011 decreases by at least 0.4 percent of GDP
             (compared to end-2009) and average gross pay rates do not increase more than inflation.

Pay Structure, Consistency and Competitiveness

83.     The proposed triggers for DPL2 are:
                (i) Enactment of legislation by the FBH Parliament amending Federation Law on Civil
                Service Agency (CSA) to give it authority to maintain database for all civil servants and
                employees in the Federation regardless of tier, and (ii) ministerial decree issued requiring
                CSAs in RS, FBH to report detailed statistics annually on human resource management,
                including turnover, recruitment, promotions. (FBH, RS)
                Enactment of legislation by BH and Entity Parliaments to approve new or amended salary
                laws that are more transparent and better link pay with responsibility, and Entity
                Governments award a tender for an independent salary survey to be carried out in 2010 to
                measure external pay competitiveness. (BH, FBH, RS)

84.     The proposed trigger for DPL3 is:
                BH Council of Ministers and Entity Governments assess the implementation of their public
                salary laws and regulations and propose amendments to the respective laws to improve
                their effectiveness in rewarding performance.



           D.      SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION AND INDIRECT TAX MEASURES IN SUPPORT OF
                                     COMPETITIVENESS

85.     Actions in this pillar of the operation address the DPO relating to limiting social
contribution rates and enhancing firm competitiveness, while putting social protection on a more
sustainable financial footing. This will be achieved through measures to finance a larger share of health
insurance through general revenues and by indirect tax reforms aimed at harmonization of rates and bases
with EU and between the two Entities and other countries in the region. Progress towards this DPO is
gauged by indicators measuring reductions in the health insurance contribution rate (in the Federation)
and the realignment of indirect tax rates (across Entities).
Health insurance contributions

86.     The authorities have recently expressed strong interest in receiving World Bank assistance
in designing a plan to reduce the health contribution rate and reforming the health financing
                                                     31
system. The World Bank has had a dialogue with the Federation Government on the topic of reforming
the health financing system with the aim of enhancing firm competitiveness, increasing incentives for
companies to move from grey to formal sector, and enhancing fairness and equity. This is a medium term
reform requiring further preparation to ensure that health service delivery capacity is not compromised.
Accordingly this program element has triggers in DPLs 2 and 3 only.

87.     The proposed trigger for DPL2 is:
              Enactment by the Federation Parliament of legislation reducing the health contribution rate
              by a number of percentage points that is consistent with a constant share of health insurance
              revenues in GDP and subject to the budget constraint agreed through the IMF SBA. (FBH)

88.     The proposed triggers for DPL3 are:
              Enactment by the Federation Parliament of legislation reducing the health contribution rate
              by a number of percentage points that is consistent with a constant share of health insurance
              revenues in GDP, and subject to the budget constraint agreed through the IMF SBA. (FBH)
              De-linkage of health insurance benefits for the unemployed not entitled to receive
              unemployment benefits in the Federation from the role and responsibilities of the
              employment services and the transfer of this activity to a more appropriate agency. (FBH)

Social contribution base harmonization

89.     The main objectives of this reform are to: a) broaden the base for social security contributions and
personal income tax by including non-wage benefits; b) eliminate incentives to minimize tax liability by
increasing the portion of non-wage benefits in total employee compensation; c) remove an impediment to
labor mobility across the two Entities; d) reduce the administrative costs to companies which employ
workers from both Entities.

90.     The proposed trigger for DPL2 is:
              Legislation enacted by the Entity Parliaments fully harmonizing the bases for social
              contributions and personal income tax between the Federation and Republika Srpska and
              including all non-wage benefits in said bases. (FBH, RS)

Indirect tax harmonization

91.     The proposed triggers for DPL2 are:
              Enactment of legislation by BH Parliament with a view to increasing excise taxes and
              harmonizing the related rates with those of the EU and neighboring countries. (BH)
              Enactment of a new Law on Customs, harmonizing BH external tariff with that of the EU.
              (BH)

92.     The proposed trigger for DPL3 is:
              BH Council of Ministers will prepare an assessment identifying the costs and benefits of
              introducing higher rates of VAT for luxury goods. If the assessment shows that estimated
              benefits will exceed the estimated costs of introducing the higher rate, BH will enact a law
              amending BH Law on Value Added Tax ("Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina"
              No. 9/05 and 35/05), with a view to increasing the rate on luxury goods in line with the
              above-mentioned assessment. (BH)

Box 1: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
Ownership and commitment has been systematically built up by an active consultation process including with the
senior Government officials and parliamentarians at both the State and the Entity levels. This has been significantly
enhanced by the analytical work on the social transfer system which highlights the inefficiency of the current
system and its excessive cost relative to international comparators. The related Social Protection Project has
contributed to this process by clearly demonstrating the modalities by which the DPL objectives can be achieved
and building consensus and by-in within the relevant implementation bodies as well as decision makers.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The program is very closely coordinated with that of the IMF. The policy actions in the DPL and in IMF SBA
program as well as their respective financial support measures are interlinked and mutually supporting. There have
been extensive and frequent consultations with the EC and the DPL program has been designed in anticipation of
EC macro-fiscal support in the later stages. There is a fully articulated policy matrix and a set associated indicators
for measuring progress over the program

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
Both the financing being provided by the DPL and the policy measures in the program directly address challenges
associated with the fiscal gap that has emerged in the wake of the global economic crisis. The need to publicize and
roll back excessive and regressive social transfers to the levels prevailing prior to changes introduced in the mid-
2000s and to improve targeting have been amply supported by AAA on the social transfer system.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The policy actions focus narrowly on those measures needed to restore fiscal balance and enhance the efficiency,
effectiveness and fairness of public spending. They have also been crafted to take into account the additional
political challenges associated the electoral cycle and the sensitive nature of relations between the two Entities.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
There is clear set of quantifiable indicators for each component of the program. These will be monitored regularly
over the course of the program. The program itself requires the conduct of the 2010 Household Budget Survey
which is critical to both measurement of progress under the program and to the refinement of benchmarks in the
successor DPLs.




                                                         33
                               VI.        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                     A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

93.      Left unattended, the ongoing crisis can be expected to lead to higher poverty rates. Bosnia's
poverty rates declined substantially before the onset of the current global economic crisis. Between 2004
and 2007, the fraction of the poor below the poverty line declined by 22 percent. However, with
economic growth of minus 3.4 percent in 2009, the fraction of the poor is expected to increase. The data
from the most recent household budget survey (HBS 2007) show that a 5 percent decrease in the incomes
of those above the poverty line will increase poverty by 1.9 percentage points. Three transmission
channels of the crisis are likely as sources of income declines. First, with industrial production and
exports falling sharply in late 2008 and early 2009, some workers will lose their jobs. Second, about 7
percent of the population receives remittances in Bosnia and the slowdown in economic activity in
Europe may reduce remittances. Finally, since there is a large fraction of the population in the informal
economy, the decline in aggregate demand will depress this group's incomes through second round
effects. Reduced access to credit because of the global credit crunch is further impacting consumption.

94.     The reforms proposed under this operation have the potential to reduce the rate of poverty
by 1.2 percentage points by: a) improving the targeting of non-contributory cash transfers towards the
poor and vulnerable categories of the population; and b) by reducing the unsustainable and growth-
hindering fiscal deficits, and creating fiscal space to accelerate poverty-reducing growth.

95.      To mitigate adverse developments, the social assistance reforms proposed under this
operation are expected to improve the poverty reduction impact of Government spending. The
proposed reforms are expected to protect and increase access to poverty-alleviating means-tested
programs for the bottom quintile. At present, some transfers such as the civilian programs (child
allowance and all other programs handled by the Centers for Social Work) are relatively well-targeted.
But they still only reach a small fraction of the poorest 20 percent of the population (about 10 percent17).
This is because they are small in size (1.4 percent of GDP) compared to the rest of the transfer programs
and they are inadequate in the sense that the average benefits are only about 7 percent of the poor's
consumption.18 The proposed reforms address some of the major causes of the low efficacy of the bulk of
the transfer programs, namely the lack of accurate targeting. By focusing on improving the targeting to
the poorest population groups, identifying and removing the non-poor from the programs, the reforms
should protect existing poor and include some of those who have been left out.

96.      The proposed shift in the veterans' programs from rights-based to needs-based eligibility
will allow more effective use of resources for protection of vulnerable beneficiaries. Among the
current programs, veteran-related benefits are the most regressive, with 27 percent of veteran-related
benefits going to people in the richest quintile of the population, while those in the poorest quintile
receive less than 15 percent. The introduction of targeting mechanisms will minimize transfers to richer
veterans while allowing for poorer veterans to continue receiving benefits.
97.      The potential improvement of a proxy means testing (PMT) model over the current means-
testing (MT) programs is substantial. Simulations of a PMT model using the latest micro data for BH--
the 2007 Household Budget Survey (HBS)--indicate that the potential improvement over the current
means-testing (MT) programs is substantial. The PMT develops a scoring formula to evaluate applicants
based on a regression model. If the PMT scheme is implemented well, the empirical predictions suggest

     Source: Staff calculations using HBS 2007 data.
                                                       34
that a substantial improvement over the results achieved by means-tested programs in BH during 2001­07
is to be expected. Currently, the targeting accuracy, as measured by funds disbursed to the poorest 20
percent of the population, of the BH MT programs such as the Child Protection Allowance and social
assistance delivered via the Centers for Social Work is around 25 percent, while the forecasted targeting
efficiency--should PMT be used--is above 55 percent. In other words, accurately implementing PMT for
the two above mentioned sets of benefit schemes would double the efficiency with which the authorities
can target the poor who are the most in need of these benefits. This would be comparable to the
performance of PMT models in other countries.19

98.     The DPL program seeks the elimination or reduction of poorly targeted cash transfer
programs, some of which were introduced in the run up to the last elections, while at the same time
striving to insulate the poor and vulnerable from adverse effects. The overall poverty reduction
impact of the program is positive and significant. Some individual measures implemented in isolation,
instead of the full program, could have small negative effects because the insulation of every single poor
person from the effects of the cuts is impractical. Although it should be stressed that the package as a
whole will have a positive effect on poverty reduction, we wish to point out the small, but potential
negative poverty effects of specific measures, taken individually, as well as some sources of uncertainty:

              If taken in isolation and in the absence of poverty-reducing growth and potential
              reallocations of benefits towards the poorest veterans, the introduction of means testing for
              disabled war veterans with less than 60 percent disability could have a negative poverty
              impact of 0.5 percentage points. However, the overall poverty impact for disabled war
              veterans is expected to be positive due to increases in benefits to poor veterans as well as the
              contribution of fiscal deficit reduction to growth.

              Everything else equal, the poverty impact of introducing means testing for all work-related
              civilian disability benefits in FBH, so that only the poor and vulnerable receive the benefit,
              could be to increase the overall headcount poverty by between 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points
              depending on the effectiveness of the targeting mechanism used. However, consistent with
              the DPL program the Federation Government plans to introduce means testing only for
              benefits to disabled with disability levels between 60 and 90 percent once benefits are
              restored to those below 90 percent disability, as benefits to disabled civilians between 60
              and 80 percent disability were completely eliminated in 2009, due to the inability of the
              Federation Government to finance them. Thus, the reintroduction of these benefits, even
              with means testing is expected to have a poverty-reduction effect for this group of
              beneficiaries.

              The demobilized soldiers benefit in the Federation is part of the overall package of all
              benefits to veterans and this is the most poorly targeted of all the transfer programs (see
              figure 5 above). While it is not possible currently to split out the component going to
              demobilized soldiers, the poverty impact of its elimination, taken in isolation, would likely
              be very small and could be much more effectively addressed through alternative use of the
              resources saved, namely to support poverty-reducing growth and increase funding for
              programs targeted to the poor.

99.    The measures in Pillar 1 of the DPL program will create the fiscal space to sustain poverty-
reducing growth. The reduction and elimination of the more poorly targeted benefit programs will

19
  The targeting accuracy of any programs introduced in BH will depend not only on design, but also on the quality
of implementation. In addition there are some limitations of the empirical predictions including the quality of: (a)
income data from the HBS; (b) disaggregated social protection transfer information; and (c) administratively
feasible proxies in the HBS data.
                                                        35
generate fiscal savings of 1.8 percent of GDP (see Annex VII.F). In addition, Pillar 2 reforms should
generate that further fiscal savings from public sector wage adjustments. These would also contribute to
poverty reduction through redeployment into growth sustaining public investment, better targeted cash
transfers or simply reducing the drag of accumulating public debt.

100.     When overall effects are taken into account, despite the significant fiscal consolidation that
it entails, the operation creates conditions for reducing poverty by 1.2 percentage points over the
course of the DPL program, and further cumulative poverty reduction beyond the program time
frame, which, although difficult to quantify, is expected to be substantial. The DPL sets no specific
targets for overall social transfers but assumes the authorities deploy the fiscal savings in a manner that is
consistent with poverty reduction, growth, and macroeconomic stability. Therefore, in the RS where cash
transfers are a relatively modest 3.5 percent of GDP, it is assumed that the savings from the introduction
of means testing of transfers to disabled war veterans and families of deceased soldiers (about 0.21% of
GDP) are redirected to increase social expenditures on the poor. This will reduce the RS poverty
headcount by 0.75 percentage points, which is equivalent to a 0.23 percentage point reduction for the
whole of BH. 20 By contrast, the Federation sharply increased its expenditures on poorly targeted cash
transfers between 2006 and 2008 from 4.8 to 7.5 percent of GDP. This increase proved unsustainable and
was the main reason that the Federation ran up budgetary arrears amounting to 1.4 percent of national
GDP by end 2008 despite significant revenue growth. Thus it is assumed that of the total of 1.8 fiscal
savings for the country as a whole, 1.6 percentage points are used to reduce the fiscal deficit in the
Federation with the remainder spent on social programs in the RS. Empirical studies have shown that a 1
percentage point reduction in fiscal deficit leads to a sustained increase in the annual growth rate of 0.46
percentage points (see footnote number 7). Over three years the 1.6 percentage point of BH GDP fiscal
savings in the Federation would add another 2.3 percent to BH GDP during the same period.21 The
simulations we conducted using Household Budget Survey data for BH show that the combined effects of
the DPL-series policy measures (i.e. better targeting and enhanced growth) will lead to an incremental
reduction in poverty of 1.2 percentage points.22 Moreover, as our simulations show significant potential
for poverty reduction based on the introduction of means-tested programs, we expect that as these
programs gradually replace the rights-based benefits, the overall impact on poverty will be larger than
what is currently quantifiable.




20
   Key assumptions: the safety net in the RS is expanded to cover all of the recipients who fall into the bottom two
quintiles of the distribution of the predicted consumption under the proxy means test (PMT). This expands the
coverage by 4,845 households (from the original 14,206), which is equivalent to 16,267 individuals (the original was
56,506). Thus, coverage is expanded by 34 percent of the PMT baseline group. Given the larger group, the benefit is
reduced to 700 KM from the original 902 KM. Based on the above, the reduction in the poverty rate in Republika
Srpska is 0.75 percentage points (poverty headcount decreases from 15 percent to 14.3 percent).
21
   See Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth: Lessons for Europe and Central Asia
22
   Key assumptions for the simulation were the following: fiscal savings in the RS redirected to increase PMT-
targeted benefits, increase in consumption of 2.3 percent as a result of incremental growth due to fiscal
consolidation, elimination of veteran / survivor benefits, but with PMT-based protection of those poor or vulnerable
(i.e. within 150 percent of the poverty line).

101.    The poverty impact of the reforms in the public sector pay and wage bill cannot be
determined precisely, but is expected to be near zero with a positive effect from the contribution to
deficit reduction and small, but
negative contribution from wage Figure 9: Poverty Rate
reductions. The reforms under the
DPL aim to maintain the savings
achieved under the substantial
reforms of the IMF program by
moderating the wage growth and
the aggregate wage bill. These
very limited changes will affect a
group that already has a better
welfare status than other sectors.
Public sector employees have
lower     poverty     rates     than
employees in other sectors. About
6 percent of public sector
employees report consumption
below the poverty line while in the Source: World Bank staff estimates
private sector and in mixed
enterprises, the poverty rate is around 10 percent. Thus public sector employees are expected to better
weather the wage freeze. The aggregate wage bill is to be controlled at the choice of the Government
through allowing normal turnover to reduce public employment or through freezing real wages. If wage
growth is controlled properly, the impact on the employed can be partially avoided. The taxation of
allowances in FBH will not have an impact on the low-skilled, low-pay employees, for whom allowances
constitute a bigger share of their benefits, because of the fixed deduction for tax purposes. In any case,
this group is doing significantly better than their private sector counterparts, thus helping bring the public
and private sector pay in line.

102.     Work is underway to monitor and analyze the impact of the crisis and of the social safety
net reforms. Reforming safety nets is usually an iterative and ongoing process that takes place over a
significant period of time. Initial measures could involve the development of technical tools (for example,
targeting mechanisms) and legislative reforms to pave the way for implementing improved benefit
targeting and benefit administration and management. The Social Safety Nets and Employment Support
project, which complements the DPL series, has a large M&E component as well as surveying
mechanisms. The Bosnia and Herzegovina Agency of Statistics has two regular surveys (HBS, LFS) for
monitoring the living conditions and the labor market outcomes of households. They are currently
working on an improved income module to HBS 2010. The analytic activities will involve analysis of
both the HBS and the LFS to see changes in the living conditions and labor market outcomes of the
population before and after the crisis.

                                  B.       ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

103.     The policy actions of the DPL series have been assessed to ensure there are no significant
effects on the environment, on forests and natural resources. The actions supported by the series are
not likely to have significant effects on the environment and natural resources in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The program's measures are primarily geared towards supporting the Government's reforms in fiscal
management, social protection, and public employment. These reforms aim to cushion the impact of the
financial crisis on the poor and vulnerable, while strengthening the resilience of the economy to better
position BH to resume and sustain high growth over the medium term. None of these reforms are
                                                     37
expected to have direct significant links to the environment. However, there might be indirect positive
impact on the environment due to reforms in social protection and subsequent poverty alleviation,
especially in mitigation of unsustainable use of natural resources, including cutting firewood, illegal
logging, poaching, fishing or overgrazing and other activities that are a source of income for the poor. If
effects do materialize during the program, the legislation which is in place and functioning at the Entity
level will provide adequate identification, mitigation, monitoring and evaluation of environmental
impacts.

104.     The legal framework for environmental management in Bosnia and Herzegovina has
undergone significant reforms along the lines of the EU acquis, although enforcement and
implementation still need further strengthening. The overall responsibility over environmental
protection and management lies within the Entity level Governments (Federation of BH and Republika
Srpska) and the Brcko District. Both Entities and the District have adopted five key environmental laws in
2003 and 2002 respectively. These include: Law on Environmental Protection (including bylaws on
Environmental Impact Assessment, Strategic Environmental Assessment and environmental permitting),
Law on Waste Management, Law on Air Quality Protection, Law on Protection of Nature and the Law on
the Environmental Fund. Bosnia and Herzegovina has also signed the South Eastern European Energy
Community Treaty which subjects it to key pieces of the acquis, notably the Large Combustion Plants
Directive. This directive places restrictions on local pollution emissions (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides
and particulate matter). Environmental oversight in BH is delegated to the Ministry of Spatial Planning,
Civil Engineering and Ecology of RS, Ministry of Environment and Tourism in FBH, and the relevant
Cantonal ministries within the FBH. The Entity ministries have gained experience in the past 2-3 years
regarding Environmental Impact Assessment and environmental permitting procedures, while the major
issues faced are related to the lack of staffing and the lack of secondary legislation-bylaws in support of
the new laws which may lead to delays in the work of the ministries, but also to a varied interpretation of
the legal provisions.

                     C.       IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING AND EVALUATION

105.    The BH MOFT together with the Entity Ministries of Finance will be responsible for overall
implementation of the proposed operation and for reporting progress and coordinating actions
among other concerned ministries and agencies. The Bank will monitor actions and review progress
of the implementation of the proposed operation, as well as the subsequent actions of the Government
program by using the short term and overall program outcomes outlined in the Policy Matrix.

106.     At the same time, the overall status of the BH program will be monitored during
supervision to determine whether the specific conditions of the proposed operation have changed.
In addition, subsequent preparation missions will not only allow the Bank to continue the policy dialogue
with the institutions involved in the implementation of the program of reform, but will also ensure
synergies with other donors to avoid conflicting advice to the Government in the policy and technical
areas involved in the reforms.

                                        D.       FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

107.     Public Financial Management System. The 2007 Fiduciary Update23 on Public Financial
Management found that the key to improved budget execution and cash management has been the
automated treasury system in the State and the two Entities. This has improved controls, brought
discipline to the budget execution system, and improved overall cash management across the State and

23
   apart from the 2007 Fiduciary update, several recent external reports have been consulted to review the actions
taken to improve the public financial management system and to present the current reform status

                                                       38
Entities. Bosnia and Herzegovina has made good progress in establishing modern public financial
management institutions and systems. Further progress is needed to ensure that budget discipline is
uniform and consistent across the entire system of public resource management and to counter weak
compliance with procurement laws and internal controls, weak capacity of internal audit, weak
governance in SOEs, and widespread corruption. The Update concludes that the fiduciary risks
associated with the PFM system in Bosnia and Herzegovina are moderate.

108.      Bosnia and Herzegovina has made some progress in Government budget transparency as
measured by the 2008 Open Budget Index Assessment. Bosnia and Herzegovina's score on the Open
Budget Index shows that the Government provides the public with some information on the
Government's budget and financial activities during the course of the budget year. The budget proposal
provides minimal information to the public about the Government's plans for taxing and spending for the
upcoming year. It is difficult to track spending, revenue collection and borrowing during the year. Bosnia
and Herzegovina publishes quarterly in-year reports but does not release a mid-year review. Furthermore
it is also difficult to assess budget performance in Bosnia and Herzegovina once the budget year is over.
A year-end report is produced, allowing comparisons between what was budgeted and what was actually
spent and collected. Bosnia and Herzegovina makes its audit report public, and the report comprises all
expenditures. Information is also provided on whether the audit report's recommendations are
successfully implemented. Access to the highly detailed budget information needed to understand the
Government's progress in undertaking a specific action is not available.

109.     Public procurement remains weak in practice despite a common Public Procurement Law
(PPL) based on international best practice. The law is applicable across the State and two Entities but
compliance has been weak thus far. In a few instances, provisions of the law have been contravened,
resulting in noncompetitive procurement. It is evident that knowledge and understanding of the law has
not yet fully percolated down to the ministries and agencies. Progress has been made in terms of
establishing important institutions such as the Public Procurement Agency (PPA) and the Procurement
Review Body (PRB). Also the current PPL needs to be amended to allow better alignment of the BH
legal system with the EC Directives.

110.    The budget execution process has been steadily strengthened. MOFT has introduced a
Treasury Single Account (TSA). Although the system is in place, there is still room to further benefit
from the existence of the TSA. For example, currently there is no functioning cash management covering
both the state level and Entities, and furthermore, according to the Law on Financing the Institutions of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, all budget-users may request the MOFT to open a supplementary account for
the collection and use of donations as well as own revenues. According to the same Law, the MOFT is
required to record budget revenues and expenditures by using the modified accrual basis of accounting
and to promulgate a rulebook on accounting and financial reporting, which is to include a chart of
accounts and a budget classification framework in accordance with internationally recognized standards.

111.    A number of important improvements in public finance have been implemented in recent
years, and some steps have also been taken to improve co-ordination. For example the development
with the most impact is the adoption of the Law on the Fiscal Council. Further challenges remain in terms
of implementing the law. Some other results achieved relate to the steps taken to harmonize budget
calendars and the common Treasury Single Account (TSA).

112.    Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) are independent from the legislature and the executive.
The three Supreme Audit Institutions of, respectively, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federation BH, and
Republika Srpska have achieved significant results in a complicated environment and with very limited
resources. Since 2000 the three SAIs have gradually improved their audit capacity and enhanced their
audit coverage. They have played a key role in strengthening responsibility, transparency and efficiency
of financial management in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some of their audits have led to court
proceedings against officials and have sometimes raised considerable public interest. They have also
                                                   39
contributed to drafting a framework for internal audit law. All three SAIs in Bosnia and Herzegovina have
formally adopted the INTOSAI standards.

113.     Management of Foreign Exchange. The IMF completed a safeguards assessment of the Central
Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) in January 2005. This report made recommendations to address
vulnerabilities identified in the CBBH's control, accounting, reporting and auditing systems and legal
structure. The corrective actions taken by the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina to safeguard funds
in the foreign exchange account are deemed adequate. As per the IMF staff reports published in 2009, an
update of safeguards assessment of the CBBH has been initiated, and completed under the 2009 Stand-by
arrangement (SBA). The assessment updated the assessment completed in January 2005, and made
further recommendations to address weakness identified in the CBBH's safeguards. The general findings
of such assessment concluded that the CBBH continues to have a relatively strong safeguards framework
and is already taking steps to address 2009 safeguards report findings and recommendations.

114.    The overall financial management risk to Bank development policy lending (DPL) funds is
moderate. Ample safeguards exist in the Central Bank of BH to record and track foreign currency funds
received under the Bank/IDA DPL program.

                                E.       DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

115.     Borrower and Loan Amount: The Borrower is Bosnia and Herzegovina. This operation is a
single-tranche loan/credit. The loan/credit proceeds would be made available to the Borrower upon the
effectiveness of the Loan and Financing Agreements between the Bank/IDA and Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The IDA credit and IBRD loan will be on-lent by BH Ministry of Finance and Treasury to
each Entity by way of subsidiary loan/credit agreements (for the IBRD loan) and subsidiary financing
agreements which provide for 60 percent of the funds going to the Federation and 40 percent going to the
RS.

116.     Disbursement: Upon approval of the loan/credit and notification by the Bank of the effectiveness
of the Loan and Financing Agreements between the Bank/IDA and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
Borrower will submit a withdrawal application to the World Bank prior to the closing date of the loan and
the credit. The IBRD and IDA will deposit the proceeds of the loan and credit into a foreign currency
deposit account designated by the Borrower to be held at the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(CBBH). This account forms part of the official foreign currency reserves of the country and it will be
managed by and subject to control of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) of BH. The Borrower
shall ensure that upon the deposit of the loan and credit proceeds into the said account, the said proceeds
will be on-lent to the Single Treasury Accounts of the two Entities and will be split between the two
Entities as specified in Paragraph 115.

117.     Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date: The accounting of the loan and credit and loan/credit
administration will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The Ministry of Finance and Treasury will be responsible for the loan/credit administration
and for preparing the withdrawal application, and maintaining the withdrawal application as required.
The Ministry of Finance and Treasury, with the assistance of CBBH, will maintain records of all
transactions under the loan in accordance with sound accounting practices.

118.     Given the positive IMF's assessment of CBBH, an audit of the deposit account for the proceeds
of the loan and credit is not considered necessary. The Ministry of Finance and Treasury will provide the
Bank within 30 days a confirmation letter stating that the DPL funds have been received and deposited
into the designated account assigned by the borrower that forms part of the Borrower's budget
management system.

                                  F.       RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

Political and governance risks

119.    There are political and governance risks that turn on Government ownership of the
proposed reforms and its handling of powerful opposition to reforms by influential interest groups.
These risks are evident from the experience of policy reversals following the approval of previous DPLs
(SOSAC II, EMSAC). This is particularly the case with respect to the reduction and elimination of
rights-based benefits necessary to introduce targeting and means testing as discussed above and
backtracking on agreed reforms cannot be completely ruled out.

120.    Political risks derive in part from polarization and tensions between the two political
Entities. In recent years, there have disagreements over the internal organization of BH between the
predominantly-Serb leadership of Republika Srpska and the Federation BH (predominantly Bosniak and
Croat leadership). This atmosphere slows project preparation, negotiations, effectiveness, and
implementation. The economic crisis, however, seems to have focused minds heightening the need for
consensus and joint action to mitigate its effects. The political leaders of the two Entities have displayed
a welcoming degree of unity during the negotiations for the IMF SBA. During the inception missions for
the DPL program, the authorities have also proved cooperative and the Bank will seek to preserve such
cooperation at all stages of this operation.

121.    The complex governance structure in the Federation is an additional risk factor In addition,
the Federation, unlike the RS, is subdivided into 10 Cantons, which enjoy a broad degree of autonomy
again frustrating political consensus. Reforms have lagged in the Federation and the policy measures
which it needs to undertake in the context of the DPL are relatively more difficult than those on the RS
side.

122.     The complex and fragmented governance structure of BH potentially undermines
Government transparency and accountability. In an environment of poorly-defined political
competencies between different levels of Government, interest groups are able to exploit ethnic
sensitivities and create semi-formal power networks vulnerable to corruption. The perception of
corruption, as indicated in the Transparency International Corruption Perception Indexes, in BH is among
the highest of all countries in ECA.

123.     The economic crisis presents an opportunity to weaken the opposition of influential interest
groups. The economic crisis is not only increasing the understanding among citizens that reforms are
necessary; it is also changing the relative power of political interest groups. The combination of
awareness-raising campaigns highlighting that existing social benefit systems are unsustainable and unfair
is easing reform opposition among citizens and other budget users. Similarly the private sector is coming
to the realization that current social policies mean high payroll tax rates that limit competitiveness. The
authorities are also having intense discussions with the representatives of interest groups that will be
affected by reforms.

124.     Benchmark design incorporates risk mitigation. Benchmarks have been structured to ensure
that the socio-political characteristics of the country are taken into account. In particular for the sensitive
veterans' issues a balance has been sought between the socio-political environment in which war service
has to be recognized with the objectives of fiscal sustainability, efficiency, and equity. The changes are
also being introduced in a phased manner.

125.    Careful efforts to cultivate Government ownership are being taken. The lack-of-ownership
risk is being mitigated through intense dialogue and the inclusion of all key stakeholders in the
                                                      41
development and discussion over the policy matrix. The politically most sensitive social benefit reforms
have been developed together with the professionals from relevant ministries in BH. There is also a
broadening consensus within the Government and experts that current social policies are unsustainable
and inequitable, and that the system has to be changed.

126.     The communications strategy is a key risk mitigation measure. Champions of reform must be
able to build and maintain consensus within the leadership and in the public mind. This is particularly the
case with respect to the reduction and elimination of social transfers necessary to introduce targeting and
means testing. Success will depend on delivering the central message of the reform program through a
well-designed communications strategy, pressing home the message that the current social transfer system
is unaffordable, unfair and incentive destroying. Many who are truly needy get little or nothing, while
others get benefits they do not need because of poor program design and abuse. The system pays people
not to work or pushes them into the informal economy, concentrating the burden on dwindling numbers
of formally employed workers.

127.     The communications strategy is designed to help reform proponents deliver this message
effectively both within the political leadership and to the public. It has been worked out in close
association with the activities of the Social Safety Nets and Employment Support Project. Key reform
champions have been identified and have been offered supportive argumentation and data. The policy
note on social assistance has been widely disseminated and promoted. A two-day consensus-building
workshop for key officials was held on implementation of means-testing systems. A carefully crafted
message on social benefit reform in BH was prepared by Bank staff and delivered through an op-ed piece
in a prominent newspaper. The Bank has started, and will continue with, activities to mitigate the special
political risks in the Federation through intense dialogue with political leaders and other stakeholders at
the Entity and cantonal level of Government. These and similar activities are planned for the duration of
the DPL series. The strategy is to give the authorities the ammunition to persuade themselves and the
public to undertake the reforms, and to do it because of the logic of it, rather than because the Bank is
making them do it.

128.    Corruption risk mitigation measures. The risk of corruption in relation to the use of budget
funds has been addressed through the IMF SBA, wherefore the authorities have committed to strengthen
the fiduciary and expenditure reporting functions. The implementation of policy measures embedded in
the Bank program will also serve to limit the opportunities for corruption and misuse of expenditures on
social benefits and public sector salaries.

Economic risks

129.     There are clear risks associated with external economic developments. The future course of
the global economic crisis is both uncertain and beyond the control of the authorities. It is clear however,
that strong fiscal measures will be needed and may even have to be further adjusted over time.

130.    The inter-linkage of the Bank and Fund operations strengthens the likelihood of success of
the overall reform program. The IMF SBA has been designed in a way to introduce short-term savings
measures to ensure sustainable fiscal and external balances in the short-run. The IMF program relies on
the Bank operations to facilitate structural reforms to ensure the sustainability of public expenditures in
the medium and long run. While the Bank program sets roughly annual structural reform benchmarks, the
IMF program has regular quarterly benchmarks. Thus, both in design and oversight the two programs are
interdependent and reinforcing. Moreover, there is the potential of significant resources coming through
EC macro support operations in 2010 and these will be linked to continued adherence to the Bank-Fund
program targets. Success of the DPL program is dependent on the IMF's substantial support for BH
external financing needs under the SBA.

*The table assumes that the measures under the series of 3 DPLs take effect in 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively.

**Although some of the pillar I measures would have slightly negative poverty effects, the overall effect is to
reduce poverty and is attributable to a) better targeting of social benefits and b) fiscal consolidation which is
expected to result in positive incremental impact on growth. Specifically, in the RS, all the expected savings of
0.21% of BH GDP are expected to be used to increase the coverage in well-targeted programs. This measure is
expected to contribute to poverty reduction of 0.23 percentage points for the whole of BH. The savings of about
1.6% of GDP in the Federation will be used to reduce the fiscal deficit by an equivalent amount. Empirical studies
have shown that a 1 percentage point reduction in fiscal deficit leads to 0.46 percentage points of incremental
growth each year. This implies that the 1.6 percentage points of GDP fiscal savings in the Federation would add
another 2.3 percentage points to GDP growth over the 3-year DPL implementation period. Simulations conducted
using Household Budget Survey data for BH show that the combined effects of the DPL-series policy measures
(i.e. better targeting and enhanced growth) will lead to a net incremental reduction in poverty of 1.2 percentage
points.

 Conduct eligibility audits for
   all civilian and military
      disability benefits             360          20-1,800            1.4              22.5              53-90            0.22-0.36
                              Total estimated savings under the program                                                       1.8
                        IV Adoption of Framework Law on Targeting of Cash transfers
          This measure is likely to produce significant fiscal savings, but their size cannot be established at this stage as this will
          depend on specific thresholds to be established under subordinate legislation.
          It will introduce a unified information system for all cash benefits, which will prevent "double-dipping" and reduce
          options for fraud.
          It will eliminate discretionary ad hoc benefits by stipulating that all cash benefits will have to have to be based on a
          legal act.
          It will reduce options for adopting "populist" legislation as it stipulates the following prerequisites for the adoption of
          all new legislation introducing cash benefits:
                o detailed cost estimates
                o identification of financing sources
                o opinion from the Ministry of Finance on fiscal impact


*As it became evident that benefits to civilian invalids cannot be financed and are therefore not
sustainable, the Federation Parliament adopted amendments to the Law on the Rights of Civilian Disabled


                                                                  60
Persons in March 2009, eliminating benefits to beneficiaries with 60-80 percent disability, and retaining
only benefits to beneficiaries with 90-100 percent disability. The Federation Government aims to
reintroduce benefits to those with 60-80 percent disability and it plans to introduce means testing for all
civilian benefits with the exception of disability benefits for beneficiaries who are in need of care by a
third person. The base year for our savings estimates is 2008. The actual savings will, in fact, be very
small or even negative as the benefits will be re-introduced to disabled below 90 percent disability.

With 2008 as the base year, total estimated savings under the program will amount to around 1.8
percent of GDP. This amount includes the savings that are expected to materialize in 2010 and 2011.
The estimate includes projected savings under all three categories of measures in the table above. The
estimate does not include potential savings following the adoption and implementation of the Framework
Law on Targeting of Cash transfers, which could be significant, but whose size is difficult to estimate at
this stage. Nor does it include potential savings from the significant number of ad hoc transfers programs
at the cantonal level.

The overall savings on transfers to households are likely to be smaller than the program-related
savings, as the authorities may want to redirect some of the savings to increasing the programs
targeting the poor segment of the population. This would be especially desirable in the RS, whose
overall spending on transfers to households (3.5% of the Entity GDP) is not high, but is currently poorly
targeted. Ceteris Paribus spending on transfers to households following the program-related savings of
1.8 percent of GDP would amount to 4.6 percent of GDP.

Key assumptions:

    1) 2008 is used as a base year to quantify the fiscal impact of individual measures.

    2) Temporary savings measure under the IMF program, whereby most cash benefits have been
       reduced by 10 percent and some ad hoc benefits completely eliminated are not considered.

    3) While the number of beneficiaries for some of the schemes is likely to be changed since 2008, we
       assumed the same number of beneficiaries in each scheme as in 2008.

    4) The assumption on programs introducing means testing is that benefits will be eliminated to the
       wealthiest 50 percent of beneficiaries.

    5) Eligibility audits for disability benefits would result in 15-25 percent reduction in eligibility. This
       assumption is based on the discussions with the BH authorities, particularly the Disability
       Institute in the Federation, and the results of audits that have already been completed on a smaller
       group of beneficiaries.

    6) The savings estimates do not take into account the fact that some of the measures will have a
       common denominator (e.g. benefits for some beneficiaries will not be means-tested as they will
       be lost as the result of the audit). Therefore, the actual savings will be lower to the extent that the
       same beneficiaries and benefits will be affected by multiple measures.
