The program supports the\n            authorities' public expenditure reform efforts, with\n            blended loans and credits. The first loan and credit will be\n            for an amount equivalent to US$111 million, of which US$66\n            million is International Development Association (IDA)\n            credit and US$45 million is International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan. The IDA credit\n            and IBRD loan will be on-lent by the Ministry of Finance and\n            Treasury of BH to each entity by way of subsidiary loan\n            agreements (for the IBRD loan) and subsidiary financing\n            agreements (for the IDA credit) and the signing of which\n            will constitute additional effectiveness conditions. The DPL\n            supports the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) including\n            the goals of: a) reducing the burden of Government on the\n            economy and strengthening fiscal coordination; and b)\n            improving the targeting of social benefits, both of which\n            have taken on greater importance in the context of the\n            unfolding global economic crisis."}, "docdt": "2010-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
