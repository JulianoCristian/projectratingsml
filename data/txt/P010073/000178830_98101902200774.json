The\n            proposed project would enable utilization of this power. The\n            components of the project are: (1) 90 miles of 132 kV\n            transmission lines and associated sub-stations; (2) 400\n            miles of single circuit 33 kV distribution lines and\n            associated sub-stations; (3) 11 kV and low tension\n            switchgear, distribution transformers, and ancillary\n            equipment for the Colombo distribution system."}, "docdt": "1973-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
