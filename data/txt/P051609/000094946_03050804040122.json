is to create the\n            conditions to stimulate a sustained increase in private\n            investment through an improved investment climate, greater\n            private participation in economic activities, and policy and\n            sector reform. The project is expected to make important\n            incremental contributions towards Senegal attaining the 8\n            percent GDP growth called for in the Government's\n            poverty alleviation program. The project will support these\n            initiatives through interrelated actions aimed at\n            stimulating private investment, and consist of four mutually\n            reinforced components: 1) improving the investment\n            environment by facilitating the policy, legal and regulatory\n            interface between the public and private sectors; 2)\n            facilitating private participation and enhancing\n            competitiveness; 3) stimulating sector investment and\n            implementing policy reforms; and 4) supporting\n            implementation and capacity building. The project will\n            finance consulting services, studies, goods, computers and\n            equipment, vehicles, training and minor civil works repairs,\n            and operating costs."}, "docdt": "2003-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
