Re: Republic ofSenegal: Private Investment Promotion Project (PPIP)
Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement (Credit Number 3762-SE)
Excellency,
We refer to the Credit Agreement for the Senegal Private Investment Promotion
Project between the Republic of Senegal and the International Development Association
(the Association), dated May 20, 2003, and the Project Agreement between the Republic
of Senegal and the Association. We also refer to the letter from the Borrower's Minister
of Finance, dated September 22, 2011 requesting the cancellation and recommitment of
pa-t of the Project's undisbursed resources.
Following the Bank's policy on the "Cancellation and Recommitment of IDA
Resources," cancelled IDA balances from ongoing operations would be available for
recommitment to other purposes in the same country, either to supplement ongoing
successful operations or for new ac:ivities that are consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy, instead of returning them :o the general IDA pool for future redistribution.
Pursuant to Section 6.03 of the General Conditions, the Association hereby cancels
as of September 22, 2011, the amount equal to SDR four million two hundred seventy-six
thousand seventy-four (SDR 4,276,074) from the credit.
Therefore, the Association proposes to amend the Agreement as set out below:
1. The amount of the Credit is reduced by the cancelled amount of SDR four
million two hundred seventy-six thousand seventy-four (SDR 4,276,074). All
terms and conditions applicable to the Credit, as set out in the Agreement,
remain in full force and effect.
2. The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of the Agreement is amended to reflect
the cancellation set out in paragraph 1 of the Amendment as follows:
