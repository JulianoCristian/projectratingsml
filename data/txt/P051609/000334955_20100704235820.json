Executive Directors to introduce the changes\n            outlined in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), and\n            extension of the closing date from August 31, 2010 to\n            December 31, 2011. This restructuring is a level one\n            restructuring due to changes in the development objective\n            and in all of the project's four components which are\n            being refocused to meet the revised development objective.\n            The major modifications being are as follows: 1) increase\n            the importance of component one. Improving the investment\n            climate while focusing it on the most needed reform areas in\n            light of changes noted since the project's\n            effectiveness and the increased government clarity and\n            commitment to investment climate reform; 2) re-launch the\n            matching grant subcomponent of component two. Facilitating\n            private participation and enhancing competitiveness, so that\n            it operates, as originally envisaged, and fully complements\n            the investment promotion facilitation that has been\n            supported under the project and contributes meaningfully to\n            skills development in small and medium enterprises; 3) focus\n            the activities financed under the project component three.\n            Stimulating sector investment and implementing policy\n            reforms - by terminating project's assistance to the\n            following sub-components which have been completed or will\n            not be completed in light of an absence of consensus: (a)\n            telecommunication reform and development of information\n            technology sector; (b) postal reforms; and (c) edible oil\n            sector reform; 4) revise project development objective and\n            restructure, simplify, and update the results framework to\n            target and better measure the outcomes delivered by each\n            component and subcomponent; 5) extend the closing date so as\n            to enable sufficient time for implementation; and 6)\n            reallocate funds across the project categories to accomplish\n            the proposed changes."}, "docdt": "2010-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
