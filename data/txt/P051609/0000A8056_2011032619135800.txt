                         The Project's development objective is to create the conditions to increase private investment. This will be accomplished through an improved investment
                         climate, greater private participation in economic activities, and policy and sector reforms.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In January 2011, the progress towards meeting the Project Development Objective is rated moderately unsatisfactory ­ as it was in June of 2010 - due to the insufficient progress
                         towards meeting the project development objective, which are reflected in the slow disbursement rate and disbursement lag prior to the restructuring.

                         Overall, this project has had mixed results. On one hand, the project has several remarkable achievements. Among the most notable is the fact that it provided the assistance that

                         contributed to Senegal being ranked best reformer in Sub Sahara Africa in investment climate reform in 2009. The project also financed the establishment of the Public Procurement
                         Agency as well as its institutional capacity building, which were critical in reducing the percentage of sole source contracts awarded through public procurement in the country from

                         On the other hand, the Project has not been able to effectively complete the reforms in key areas, such as: (a) the partial credit guarantee; (b) the matching grant; (c) postal reforms;
                         and (c) edible oil sector reform. Moreover, the quality of its management has been inconsistent during most of the project life.

                         As a result, the Project had been restructured to meet its development objective.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As was indicated in the June 2010 ISR for the project to meet its development objectives, it is critical that a small team of high caliber local professionals dedicated to carry out the
                         Project's coordination, financial management, procurement, reporting, M&E, audit, and related functions be completely in place by November 2010. This critical institutional
                         arrangements was not in place at the end of January 2011.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
