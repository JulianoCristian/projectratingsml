risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: consensus with regard to the content of\n            project activities is critical to ensuring ownership and\n            successful implementation. The project included activities\n            for which there was no consensus among stakeholders. As a\n            result some activities lacked the requisite ownership for\n            efficient implementation. The objective was not achieved.\n            Restructuring should initiate as early as possible during\n            project implementation to maximize its impact. Following the\n            lifting of the suspension of project disbursement,\n            recommendations from the task team to restructure the\n            project were accepted both by government and International\n            Development Association (IDA) management. Project\n            supervision requires close oversight, and active\n            decision-making from management in light of early warning\n            signs. Failures in project implementation were compounded by\n            a lack of adequate supervisory oversight and management\n            inaction when the situation warranted bold action. The\n            capacity of implementing entities needs to be thoroughly\n            assessed prior to project approval or effectiveness. Project\n            implementation was significantly affected by the lack of\n            technical leadership on the part of beneficiaries, who were\n            intended to implement their own activities. Adequate\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework and impact\n            evaluation mechanisms should be institutionalized at project\n            inception. Project implementation and the ability to monitor\n            and measure achievements were negatively affected by the\n            lack of an appropriate M&E framework, and the absence of\n            impact evaluation mechanism. Steering committee composition\n            should be balanced and inclusive, and benefit from high\n            level representatives able to influence and/or accelerate\n            decision-making. In the early stage of project\n            implementation the steering committee was insufficiently\n            involved in project implementation and failed to ensure\n            adherence to credit agreement requirements."}, "docdt": "2012-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
