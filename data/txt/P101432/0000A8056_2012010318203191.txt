                         The Mid-Term Review showed the Project to be progressing satisfactorily. Among other achievements, the Project reached the project development objective (PDO) indicators. From
                         now until the Project’s close, OSE will focus its efforts on completing works at the Aguas Corrientes Water Treatment Plant, non-revenue water activities, household connections to
                         sewerage systems, as well as consolidating the environmental management (EMP) and the institutional renewal programs.
