water and sanitation\n            services. After an in-depth Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the\n            project in December 2011, the Bank team and OSE proposed a\n            restructuring to: (i) measure the Non Revenue Water (NRW)\n            intermediate indicators using a metric that is now\n            considered industry best practice and will provide a more\n            detailed understanding of the NRW reduction program's\n            progress; and (ii) adjust the environmental intermediate\n            indicators to better align them with OSE's current\n            vision for environmental management."}, "docdt": "2012-07-25T00:00:00Z"}
