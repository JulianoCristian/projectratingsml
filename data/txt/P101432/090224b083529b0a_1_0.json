Given\n            Uruguay\u2019s public utilities like water, electricity and\n            telecommunications were monopolies in their respective\n            sectors, which has made it difficult to benchmark and\n            provide entry points to improve performance. In addition,\n            the country\u2019s public water and sanitation utility lagged\n            behind other public service providers in terms of\n            operational performance and customer service. The\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            worked with Uruguay to modernize its water utility company,\n            Obras Sanitarias del Estado (OSE), helping in its\n            transformation from an inefficient monopoly into a more\n            accountable public utility providing better quality water to\n            more Uruguayans than ever before. With the help of IBRD,\n            Uruguay\u2019s OSE had slowly evolved from a highly inefficient\n            water utility into a solid one over the course of the last\n            two decades. As a result of IBRD involvement, Uruguay has\n            created a more transparent and accountable water sector.\n            OSE, which formerly acted as de facto policymaker and\n            regulator in addition to service provider in the water\n            sector, has become a part of a wider system that includes an\n            autonomous water and electricity regulator, and a separate\n            policy-making agency, created in 2006."}, "docdt": "2010-10-10T06:29:05Z"}
