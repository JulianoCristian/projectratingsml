Company -\n            Obras Sanitarias del Estado) Modernization and Systems\n            Rehabilitation Project for Uruguay were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory; risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: OSE's senior management commitment to enhance\n            utility performance and the Bank's long term\n            relationship with OSE promoted innovation and institutional\n            reform. The Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument and an\n            experienced implementation unit played a key role in the\n            project's full disbursement and on-time completion. The\n            Bank's global knowledge and convening power played a\n            key role in transforming OSE into an outward looking\n            utility. Prior to the project, OSE had a reputation for\n            being an inward looking utility. Focusing on best practices\n            is oftentimes more important than focusing on numeric\n            results. Human capacity development is a key to sustainably\n            reducing Non-Revenue Water (NRW). OSE found that human\n            capacity development was perhaps the most essential tool for\n            reducing water losses and that companywide day-to-day\n            operations have the greatest impact on NRW reduction."}, "docdt": "2013-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
