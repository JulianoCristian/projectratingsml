Section 1.Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of appraisal, Uruguay was an upper-middle income country characterized by
practically universal water supply and sanitation (WSS) coverage and a relatively high quality of
service and infrastructure compared to other Latin American and middle income countries. The
National Water Supply and Sanitation Company (OSE), provided WSS services to the entire country
except Montevideo, where the municipality provided sanitation services. OSE’s key challenges
included aging infrastructure, operational and financial inefficiencies and poor governance as well as
low sewerage coverage levels (56 percent) when measured as a percentage of the population with
household connections.

2.      In the early 2000’s a series of institutional reforms separated policy-making, regulatory, and
operational responsibilities in the sector. Prior to these reforms, OSE acted as the de facto policy
maker, regulator and operator. The new organizations created through this reform, the Regulator of
Energy and Water Services (URSEA) and the National Environmental Directorate (DINAMA), were
relatively weak at the time of appraisal. Another major reform came in 2004, when the Government
of Uruguay (GoU) issued a constitutional amendment, declaring water a human right and making the
provision of WSS services the exclusive right of public entities. Prior to this amendment, OSE had
planned to increase its competitiveness and efficiency through promoting private sector participation
in the sector.

3.       The GoU and OSE’s senior management embraced the reforms. President Vasquez, who was
in office from 2005 to 2010, was committed to enhancing the performance, competitiveness,
accountability and transparency of public utilities. OSE’s Senior Management began a flagship
initiative for institutional change and administrative reform. The World Bank supported OSE’s
reform-oriented agenda through the First Phase of the OSE Modernization and Systems
Rehabilitation Adaptable Program Loan (2001-2008, APL1, P063383). Among other activities, the
APL1 developed a publicly disclosed performance benchmarking system and helped establish the
environmental, social and Non-Revenue Water (NRW) units.

4.      The Second Phase of the APL (APL2, P101432) was a natural continuation of the APL1; it
supported the same goals to increase the efficiency, coverage, transparency, competitiveness and
sustainability of Uruguay’s WSS services. The APL2, however, fostered more innovative,
management-oriented activities, such as integrating the operational and commercial systems. OSE
had developed a strong partnership with the Bank by the time of the APL2 (the Bank and OSE had
begun working together in 1988) and sought the Bank’s assistance to implement these modernization
activities. The GoU was also working hand-in-hand with the Bank on the sector reform through the
UY Utilities Public Services Modernization Technical Assistance Loan (P070058) at the time of
appraisal, placing the Bank in a unique position to help align OSE’s operations with the reform,
specifically through promoting compliance with URSEA’s new regulatory frameworks.

Original Project/Program Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.     As written in the Loan Agreement, the PDO is to increase the efficiency, coverage and
sustainability of WSS services in Uruguay through (a) the improvement of the Borrowers efficiency
and effectiveness; (b) maintaining the reliability and enhancing the coverage of water supply
                                                                                                    1
infrastructure in Montevideo and in cities outside Montevideo; and (c) increasing the number of
household connections to new and existing sewerage systems.

6.      The PDO outcome indicators are: (i) OSE complies with URSEA’s “WSS quality of service
norms” to safeguard consumers interests and (ii) Regulatory accounting framework for the WSS
sector operationalized. The Project also had 22 intermediate outcome indicators, which are detailed in
the Data Sheet.

Revised PDO and Key Indicators

7.      Neither the PDO nor its PDO-level indicators were revised during the Project. The Project
was restructured on July 18, 2012 to revise the NRW and environmental management intermediate
indicators. See the Implementation Section for more detail.

Beneficiaries

8.       The Project expected to benefit OSE’s client base (3.05 million people) by: (i) instilling a
culture of customer orientation at OSE; (ii) optimizing organizational processes to cut costs and time
while improving the quality, reliability and accessibility of customer services; (iii) improving the
reliability and quality of WSS services through infrastructure renewal and increased laboratory
capacity; (iv) reducing NRW losses, leading to more cost-efficient, sustainable service; (v) expanding
access to sewerage services; and (vi) increasing transparency through publication of performance
indicators as well as participation in international, performance assessment initiatives.

9.      The Project also aimed to benefit OSE’s staff, sectoral agencies, and the GoU by: (i)
establishing an indicator program that allowed senior management, the GoU, and other related
organizations to access reliable and consistent information on OSE’s performance; (ii) developing a
code of ethics that clearly defined proper conduct internally and externally; and (iii) implementing
various new management software systems to provide more precise information on operations.

Section 2: Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

14.     Soundness of background analysis. The Bank’s long-term relationship with OSE provided
the team responsible for the design and background analysis with intimate knowledge of the culture,
organization and capacity of OSE and Uruguay. As this was the second phase of the APL, the Project
relied on the thorough background analysis done for preparation of the APL Program.
This comprehensive, in-depth analysis was financed through a Special Fund for Policies and Human
Resources Development Grant, the previous Water Supply Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2921-UR)
and OSE’s own resources; the analysis covered institutional renewal strategies, NRW reduction plans
for several cities (including both engineering and institutional aspects), a Master Plan based on future
water demand in the Metropolitan region, financial, and cost-benefit and social evaluation analyses.
In addition the team analyzed the lessons learned from the APL1 and adapted the design of the APL2
accordingly. For instance, the APL1 demonstrated that NRW could not be addressed through
operational solutions alone; deepening institutional integration between commercial and engineering
silos, specifically through integrating the systems, was identified as critical. The APL2, taking this
learning into account, financed the implementation of a commercial operative system and focused the
NRW component on institutional strengthening as well as operational actions. A Quality Assessment
of Lending Portfolio (QALP-2) review of the Project states, “the economic and technical analysis in
the appraisal documents demonstrates exemplary due diligence.”

15.     Assessment of the Project’s design. The Project’s design clearly supported Uruguay’s water
reform agenda and OSE’s strategic goals. The PDO was well-aligned with the Project’s components
and with the overall PDO APL Program.2 The design adequately reflected a causal linkage between
inputs, outputs and outcomes. Nevertheless, several aspects of the PDO were vague; for instance, to
increase the efficiency, coverage and sustainability of WSS services in Uruguay the PDO
recommended improving the Borrower’s efficiency and effectiveness. The PDO also did not mention
improved transparency or customer responsiveness, which were key aspects of the Project. In the
PAD, however, the PDO is broken down into four intermediate outcomes that add greater specificity
to the PDO and strengthen the linkage with the Project’s components. The intermediate outcomes
include: (i) OSE’s transparency, client responsiveness, efficiency and financial viability have
improved; (ii) the reliability of OSE’s potable water supply infrastructure is increased; (iii) NRW is
reduced; and (iv) household connection to new and existing sewerage system is improved. The
number of stakeholders involved, OSE, the GoU, and the Uruguayan population, was adequate given
the scope of the Project. Moreover, the Management Unit for Projects with External Financing
(GPFE), which was in charge of supervising the implementation of the Project, had demonstrated its
capacity to effectively manage Bank-financed projects over the course of three previous projects.

16.     In addition to having a well-designed, logical framework, the Project had a clear point of
entry following the implementation of the APL1. The APL2 design represented flexibility and
creativity. The APL Program had anticipated stimulating OSE’s performance through introducing
private sector participation, but the 2004 constitutional amendment made this approach impossible.
To compensate, the APL2 emphasized national and international benchmarking, performance based
arrangements and regional exchanges. In addition, the design reflected OSE’s culture of learning
through concrete results, utilizing pilot studies to test new concepts and approaches.

2
  The APL Program objective is to increase the efficiency, coverage and sustainability of WSS services in Uruguay by: (i)
improving the competitiveness of OSE; (ii) maintaining the reliability and enhancing the coverage of water supply
infrastructure; and (iii) increasing sewerage coverage and sewage treatment.
                                                                                                                       4
17.    Fiduciary and safeguards aspects. Financial Management (FM) arrangements were
appropriate. OSE had adequate financial management systems, software, and trained staff. A
thorough FM assessment was well documented in the PAD. FM risks were well identified, described
and captured in the Project documents. The Project’s FM benefited from experienced professionals
on OSE and the Bank’s supervision teams. OSE also had adequate procurement arrangements at the
time of Project design. The procurement team was very involved in the design of the Project,
permitting early preparation of bidding processes.

18.     With regard to the safeguard preparation tasks, the APL2 relied on an Environmental
Assessment (EA) that was conducted in 2007 by an external consultancy. The EA had a broad scope
and identified important aspects of OSE´s operations and their related environmental issues. This EA
served as the base for the establishment of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) that was
overly ambitious given OSE’s capacity at the time of appraisal. The environmental intermediate
indicator for the Project (a composite of six targets) was designed based on the programs of the 2007
EMP. The safeguards triggered, Environmental Assessment (OP / BP 4.01) and Physical Cultural
Resources (OP / BP 4.11), were considered appropriate given the issues posed by the Project. The EA
established a Construction Environmental Manual as the instrument for the environmental
management of works. However, it did not establish clear procedures for its application along the
works’ project cycle.

19.      Adequacy of Government and OSE’s commitment. The Bank’s long standing partnership
with OSE (the Bank first began working with OSE in 1988) and the structure of the Program, planned
as a four phase, 10 year APL, illustrate the GoU and OSE’s commitment. As mentioned in the Project
Context section, President Vasquez was committed to enhancing the performance, competitiveness,
accountability and transparency of public utilities. Through the APL1, OSE had developed a
publically disclosed performance benchmarking system and had established environmental, social
and NRW units. These areas were further developed in the APL2. The Project’s high-level of
synchronization with OSE and the GoU’s priorities for the sector created a sense of deep partnership
between the Bank and OSE and opened a window of opportunity to implement innovative ideas, such
as an output based disbursement (OBD) model and a NRW pilot study, which would generate real
change throughout the organization. The GoU was also highly committed to consolidating the recent
reforms in the water sector. Remembering the period of the Project’s design, OSE employees said
that the political environment for implementing the Project’s reforms was “unprecedented.”
Demonstrating its high level of commitment, OSE had executed US$620,500 on its flagship
institutional renewal program (VECTOR) and was executing US$3.3 million before the Project even
achieved effectiveness. The QALP-2 concluded that, “Project design is fully owned by OSE.”

20.      Assessment of risks. The main risks to Project implementation were adequately identified
during Project design, and the proposed mitigation measures were utilized effectively. For instance,
the risk, “OSE’s performance fails to improve due to lack of external competition” did not
materialize because of the strong mitigation measures geared toward increasing external
accountability through support of the sector reform; incentives based activities and transparency
initiatives.

21.     Under the risk related to maintaining OSE’s commitment for institutional change, no
mitigation measure was established to reinforce the institutional capacity to implement the ambitious
EMP. However, provisions were made to strengthen the Environmental Management Unit of OSE
(UGA) during appraisal by building, at a minimum, a six-member team; the LA contained a clause,
which required OSE to hire five additional staff for UGA. Another risk that was not identified was
the necessary institutional capacity to integrate the commercial and operating system (which required
structural changes and significantly changed the way of doing business) alongside other major
                                                                                                   5
reforms, specifically the strengthening of NRW reduction activities throughout OSE. OSE did not
have the capacity to implement both activities at once, and the start of the NRW activities was
delayed until after the commercial operating activities were completed.

Implementation
22.    Implementation was Satisfactory throughout the life of the Project. Project implementation
benefited from the GPFE’s extensive experience with Bank processes. As mentioned above,
investments in Project activities began before the effectiveness of the Loan, and disbursements were
made consistently throughout the life of the Project. The Project did not require an extension and is
considered a model project in the LC7 portfolio because of its ahead of the curve disbursements,
timely implementation, focus on institutional strengthening activities rather than traditional water
works, and emphasis on knowledge sharing.

23.     The Project benefited tremendously from the commitment of OSE’s senior management, who
created a high-level group with clear ties to the President devoted to carrying out several complicated
Project activities such as the implementation of the commercial operative (SGCO) and the financial
accountability systems. The implementation of these two new systems required a major company
overhaul, which included organizational changes, development of policies, procedures and
guidelines, and extensive training and capacity building exercises as part of a change management
strategy. Although there was expressed desire among OSE employees at the time of Project design
for these new systems, implementation encountered significant resistance due to the large degree of
change required. The implementation time for these systems was longer than expected and required
significant human resource commitment. The system changes were also done abruptly (the old
systems were dropped when implementation of the new systems began), causing both internal and
external volatility and complaints. The high-level mandate was indispensable in pushing these
activities forward. The push for these activities by management also ensured that the activities would
be carried out through the 2011political transition as implementation of these systems had reached “a
point of no return.”

24.     Nevertheless, the priority given to the implementation of the new software systems delayed
other critical activities such as the implementation of the RANC program. OSE did not have the
capacity to prioritize these initiatives at the same time; thus non-traditional RANC activities, those
apart from pipe replacement and meter implementation, did not begin to move forward until later in
the Project when the directorate approved the 2011-2014 Action Plan for Controlling NRW losses.
The Plan aimed to reduce NRW at a national level by consolidating RANC culture at all levels of
OSE, adjusting procedures and tools to permit correct analysis of NRW and promoting adoption of
best practices. The Project’s NRW activities directly supported this Action Plan. As a result of this
delayed start, however, the full impact of these activities was not seen during the APL2.

25.     The Project was only restructured once. After the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in December
2011, the GPFE and the Bank team decided to restructure the NRW indicators as well as the
environmental indicators. The NRW indicators were restructured to substitute a new metric, liter per
connection per day, for percentage of water elevated over water billed. The new metric is widely
considered more adequate to measure NRW over an extended period of time given its higher level of
sensibility to additional connections to the network and to seasonal differences in water consumption
among other elements. All of the water loss goals were kept the same. The environmental indicators
of the Project were restructured to align them with the OSE’s revised EMP. The revised indicator
consisted of targets to support the UGA through capacity building workshops at a companywide level
paired with the development of an improved environmental manual for works, environmental design
guides, an environmental database, as well as base information for the sludge management program.

                                                                                                     6
26.      Project costs. Project costs increased over the life of the Project for the following reasons:(i)
new structural requirements for the construction of the new clarification units at Aguas Corrientes;
(ii) the reach of the RANC program expanded beyond what was originally foreseen (210Km of the
network was acquired as opposed to the 70Km predicted in the PAD, and 400,000 half-inch water
meters were acquired as opposed to the 200,000 predicted in the PAD); and (iii)a significant increase
of US dollar costs for construction in Uruguay3. The total actual project cost was US$78.31 million,
US$10.2 million higher than originally envisioned during design. OSE provided the additional
financing from its own resources.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

27.     M&E Design. The two PDO level indicators supported the Project’s high-level goal of
transforming OSE into an outward-looking, responsive and transparent organization. The first PDO
indicator, to comply with the planned quality of service norm, was very well aligned with the
Project’s design to improve customer service and the extensive quality of service and commercial
operative activities included in the Project. The second PDO indicator, the operationalization of the
WSS regulatory accounting framework, did not illustrate the impact of the Project activities as
directly (although the implementation of the financial and commercial operative systems facilitated
the data uptake required to comply with this indicator), but reflected the Project’s high-level goal of
promoting transparency. The spirit of these indicators was well-aligned with the Project’s outcomes.
One design flaw was that, as envisioned, URSEA was supposed to produce Quality of Service norms
and to maintain a regulatory accounting framework, implying a transfer of responsibility to an
organization, URSEA, not directly tied to the Project.

28.     The intermediate indicator M&E framework for this Project was designed with two
objectives: (i) to develop a comprehensive base of indicators that OSE could utilize beyond the close
of the Project to monitor performance and that would help develop an indicator-based, results-
oriented culture; and (ii) to monitor the progress of the Project. The design of the M&E system was
fully satisfactory for meeting the first objective; OSE has fully integrated the indicators developed for
this Project into their internal monitoring system and utilizes indicators to guide investments and
strategies. The design of the M&E system was partially satisfactory for meeting the second objective.
The comprehensive nature of the indicators resulted in more than 90 indicators, some of which were
not directly tied to Project activities. This was especially true for the commercial operative efficiency
and quality of service indicators, which measured the respective areas rather than just the impact of
the Project. The RANC indicators were also not well aligned with Project investments. Six cities with
varying levels of NRW were chosen as a representative sample of the NRW situation in Uruguay, but
NRW activities were primarily focused on strengthening OSE’s internal capacity to manage NRW
reduction.

29.     M&E Implementation. For the most part, the M&E framework was implemented
successfully throughout the life of the Project. The various units carrying out the Project’s activities
calculated their own indicators and submitted the information to the Planning and Development Unit,
which produced detailed M&E reports for the Project every six months. During the APL1, the
indicators were calculated by the Planning and Development Unit; the shift of this responsibility to

3
 Mainly related to a 16% decrease of dollar exchange rate (from 1US$ = UY$23.93 at appraisal to an average of 1US$ <
UY$20 for all the disbursements made) and an increase of labor costs of more than 100% over the period of project
implementation. The construction cost increase also implied a need for funds reallocation under Component 1 in order to
cover the construction of the regional laboratories, whose costs increased beyond what was expected at appraisal.


                                                                                                                     7
the various units is illustrative of a higher level of institutionalization of M&E throughout the
organization. The data collected for the M&E framework was found to be largely reliable. The access
to service targets were based on information collected by the National Institute of Statistics and client
surveys were based on a statistically representative sample of over 3,000 clients. Many of the quality
of service and commercial operative system indicators were based on information generated from the
SGCO system. Some of the data generated from the system was skewed as the transition from the
separate commercial and operative systems to an integrated commercial operative system required a
complete overhaul and shift in OSE’s way of doing business. For instance, OSE had trouble closing
complaints in the new system once they had been attended to, artificially increasing both the number
of complaints as well as the time for attending to those complaints. During the life of the Project,
OSE was still adjusting to the new system

30.     The implementation of the new SGCO system temporarily disrupted OSE’s collection of data
on related indicators as the old system was dropped before the new system was fully implemented.
Once the new system was implemented and OSE began collecting data on these indicators again, a
significant gap emerged between the baselines and goals established during appraisal (generated from
the old system) and the data flowing from the new system. The new SGCO system was more robust
and captured data from a wider variety of sources, which provided more accurate information to
OSE, but also made comparisons with the baselines and targets established via the old system invalid.
In addition, the old system generated a more optimistic baseline given its limited reach. At the time of
the MTR, when restructuring this indicator would have been possible, the new system was still in the
process of being fully adopted, and OSE considered itself unprepared to generate a credible new
baseline and targets. OSE did, however, develop a plan to improve the monitoring of the information
generated through the new system and is currently working on setting new targets that will better
represent the new business model.

31.     M&E Utilization. The M&E framework’s large number of indicators challenged OSE to
monitor many different program areas adding complexity to the M&E of this Project. Nevertheless,
the framework is representative of OSE’s level of sophistication; M&E for high-ranking utilities is
inherently complex given the large quantity of programs, activities and clients to monitor. OSE is
utilizing the extensive numerical information generated for this framework to analyze the overall
health of the organization. For example, OSE is using the quality of service and operational and
commercial efficiency indicators to analyze current operational weaknesses and to guide new
investments. OSE is also utilizing these indicators to inform the development of a new set of
company performance indicators. OSE also supplies URSEA with a wide variety of indicators and
has worked closely with URSEA to monitor quality of service norms. In addition, as part of the
Project, OSE developed a system for calculating the company’s water balance, which has played a
key role in supporting monitoring and evaluation of water losses and increasing company awareness
and focus on this issue. OSE also uses the water balance to report its NRW losses to the GoU, which
tracks the company’s efficiency. The information OSE collected through its M&E framework
allowed the Bank to closely monitor the implementation progress of most activities (with the notable
exception of some of the commercial operative and quality of service indicators due to the issues
described above) and informed this report as well as the cost benefit analysis and the design of the
OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     Fiduciary Compliance. The Project complied with the FM arrangements and Bank
requirements, such as acceptable, periodic IFR reporting and up-to-date accounting records. Those
arrangements provided reasonable assurance that the funds were used for the intended purpose.
Project transactions were subject to the external oversight of the Court of Auditors of the Republic of
                                                                                                       8
Uruguay (TCR), whose last audit report submitted to the Bank (June 14, 2013) showed unqualified
audit opinions. Audit reports were reviewed through implementation and always deemed acceptable.

33.     The Project had no significant procurement issues during the life of the Project. The Project
had disbursed US$3.6 million four months after effectiveness, and US$18.35 million, or 37 percent
of the Loan, after two years of implementation. The Loan was fully disbursed by the Project’s close.
The consistent disbursements reflect the capacity of the GPFE as well as the high level of
involvement of procurement specialists in the design phase of the Project that enabled preparation
beyond the procurement plan.

34.     Safeguard Compliance. Over its implementation, the Project complied satisfactorily with
safeguards, OP 4.01, Environmental Assessment and OP 4.11, Physical Cultural Resources4, except
for the period from May 2010 to December 2011, when the Project received Moderately Satisfactory
safeguard ratings due to issues in the application of environmental instruments and procedures,
specifically observance of the Construction Environmental Manual provisions in bidding processes
and works execution. As a result, the UGA developed and implemented a remedial action plan. OSE
adequately followed the actions agreed upon in the remedial action plan and implemented the EMP,
which was revised during the MTR to better align it with the programmed activities. Several strategic
activities in the revised EMP will continue into the OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project.

Post-completion Operation / Next Phase

35.     The APL Program was originally envisioned to have four phases. Nevertheless, the APL was
frontloaded with US$77 million of the US$100 million program funds disbursed during the first two
phases. The Project team began to prepare the next phase of the APL but considered that OSE, in
large part because of the APL, had reached a point in its development where the Bank could provide
the most value added through supporting innovative green measures focused on future sustainability
rather than continuing with the operations-focused APL. For this reason, OSE and the Bank selected
a Specific Investment Loan for the OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project (P118064), which became
effective in March 2013. The project, whose objective is to increase the sustainability of OSE by
improving the reliability and resilience of OSE’s WSS systems, enhancing its efficiency, and
strengthening its management capacity, consists of four components: (i) investing in reliable water
supply infrastructure; (ii) managing water and energy more efficiently; (iii) preparing for the future:
management, planning and risk; and (iv) knowledge sharing and project management activities. This
new operation contains many forward looking activities, such as water safety plans and climate
change assessments, and incorporates some of the risk-related elements recommended in the QALP-
2. Several key initiatives promoted through the APL, such as RANC and UGA strengthening
activities, are also being continued under the new project.

Section 3: Assessment of Outcomes

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (Rating: High)

36.    The Project’s objectives, design and impact of its implementation were highly relevant in
terms of OSE’s strategic plan and the GoU’s objectives for the sector at the time of implementation
and continue to be highly relevant today. OSE’s current five-year strategic vision focuses on:

 Physical Cultural Resources was triggered because of a possible expansion of the sewage system in the influence zone of
a cultural heritage area of the Colonia del Sacramento City. Ultimately, these works were executed outside the influence
zone of the cultural heritage site, but foreseen chance find procedures were applied.
                                                                                                                      9
(i) investing in reliable infrastructure; (ii) improving operational and commercial efficiency; and (iii)
strengthening utility management. In addition, OSE’s 2013 action plan highlights transparency and
ethical management as well as customer orientation in its corporate values. The APL2 marks a
transition from works-focused projects to management focused projects and from the “what” to the
“how” of service delivery. The OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project (P118064) embraces this
transition, financing a number of institutional strengthening activities from asset management to
communication management that highlight the tremendous relevance of this shift. OSE is also
continuing to build on the large majority of the activities that the APL2 financed. For example, the
lessons learned from the NRW activities in the APL2 have transformed the NRW team’s approach to
reducing losses. Other initiatives supported by the APL2, such as the commercial operative system
and the environmental management programs, have also become integral parts of OSE’s day-to-day
operations. The Project is also still highly relevant from the Bank’s point of view; the Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy for the Republic of Uruguay 2010-2015 (Report No. 55863) discussed by the
Executive Directors on October 15, 2010 highlights the importance of improvement of
competitiveness and infrastructure and environmental protection.

Achievement of Project/Program Development Objectives (Rating: Substantial)

37.     Achievement of the PDO was Satisfactory throughout the life of the Project. The Project
achieved the two PDO-level indicators. Of the 22 intermediate indicators, the Project achieved 14, 11
of which exceeded target values, partially achieved four indicators and did not achieve four. The first
PDO indicator measured OSE’s compliance with URSEA’s quality of service norms. Although
URSEA did not publish quality of service norms, the ICR team considers this indicator met because
in the absence of its own set of service indicators, URSEA has adopted OSE’s quality of service
norms5 to monitor performance. OSE regularly provides URSEA with up-to-date information on its
performance in terms of quality of service.6 In addition, OSE complies with all of URSEA’s existing
regulatory norms. OSE is also working closely with URSEA in the development of a new set of
general performance indicators. The second PDO was based on OSE’s use of the WSS Regulatory
Accounting framework. OSE has consistently sent URSEA all required information since the
establishment of the norm in June 2009.

38.      The ICR team also measured the efficacy of the Project by analyzing the achievement of the
four intermediate outcomes: (i) OSE’s transparency, client responsiveness, efficiency and financial
viability have improved; (ii) the reliability of OSE’s potable water infrastructure is increased; (iii)
unaccounted for water is reduced; and (iv) household connections to new and existing sewerage
systems have increased. The indicators in the chart represent a blend of indicators from the PAD and
indicators the ICR team selected based on international best practices to best illustrate the Project’s
results.

 OSE has been carefully monitoring its quality of service, regularly sending performance indicator information to the
ADERASA and publishing its performance indicators, which include quality of service, in national newspapers twice a
year. http://www.ursea.gub.uy/inicio/articulossss/abril2013/regulacion+de+energia+y+agua+2011+2012

adopted 11 and partially adopted three. Based on a rating system developed for the ICR, OSE only
complied with 23 percent of these best practices prior to the Project, now OSE complies with 74
percent of them (See Annex 6). The best practices achieved and supported by the Project include
whether there is an operating 24 hour call center, the in-person client attention centers have adequate
number of personnel with appropriate training and computer support, and whether there are at least
three channels through which clients can pay their bills. The adoption of these best practices lays the
groundwork for sustainable improvement in OSE’s customer service. The best practices have already
led to significant gains for the consumer.

40.     Another best management practice, and a significant gain for the Project, has been the
development and operationalization of a code of ethics at OSE. OSE went beyond the scope of the
Project, developing an entire ethics framework with four instruments, which included not only the
development of a code of ethics, but also: (i) a code of good governance; (ii) the development of an
ethics committee; and (iii) the establishment of ethics agreements with all of OSE’s departments. In
addition, OSE has developed a robust benchmarking system and supplies ADERASA and IBNET
with information on 140 indicators annually, far exceeding the Project’s goal of publishing more than
61 indicators. In addition, OSE continues to publish its performance indicators in newspapers and on
its website every six months and submits its performance indicators to URSEA and its NRW
indicators to the GoU. These practices have significantly increased OSE’s transparency.

41.     The implementation of the SGCO system and OSE’s focus on organizational modernization
through the Project’s support of the VECTOR program has also led to efficiency gains throughout the
organization. The Project supported not only the implementation of the system, but also the
development of regulations and guidelines on service provision, delinquent payments, tariffs and
billing among other areas. The combination of both the new system and the guiding regulations led to
significant efficiency gains. The non-collections ratio went from seven percent in 2006 to four
percent at the Project’s close. This increase in collection rate has a significant impact on OSE’s
income; for every percentage point gained in collection, OSE gains approximately US$3.5 million.
The VECTOR program helped increase collections by supporting over-due payments recovery, social
outreach, more effective service cuts as well as fraud detection. Delinquent payments decreased by
20 percent. Since the implementation of the fraud program, OSE has been able to recuperate 3.35
million cubic meters of water lost through fraud. In terms of operational efficiency, the
implementation of the SGCO system helped reduce the commercial cycle from a 30 to 60 day period
to a 14 to 20 day period and improved the technology and procedures for meter readings; billing
based on actual readings went from 77 to 90 percent. Labor productivity has increased, going from
                                                                                                 12
4.3 employees per 1,000 connections in 2006 to 3.7 employees per 1,000 connections in 2012.9 The
cost of producing potable water has also gone down, decreasing from UY$14 per m3 in 2006 to
UY$12.2 per m3 in 2012.10

42.      OSE partially met the intermediate environmental indicator, which was composed of six
targets, but made significant progress in all the related activities. It complied with three targets and
reached more than 80 percent completion level for two additional targets11. OSE expects to achieve
the environmental indicator in December 2013. Despite not reaching all targets, OSE built an
appropriate structure for environmental management and made meaningful strides towards
institutionalizing the theme within the organization over the course of the APL2. The UGA now has
ten qualified professionals, surpassing PAD previsions and the LA commitment. Three of these
professionals have Master’s degrees in environmental sciences, and the professionals’ expertise
covers the areas of chemical engineering, civil structural and civil hydraulic-environmental
engineering, chemistry, biochemistry and biology. OSE’s long term vision for environmental
management has also been consolidated and formalized through the approval of a company-wide
Environmental Policy (approved by the General Management on February 8, 2013). The Project also
supported OSE’s decentralization initiative to strengthen regional laboratories by financing the
construction of eight regional laboratories utilizing the integrated laboratory management system
model. This initiative has led to significantly reduced times for analysis of samples. For example, the
average time from extraction of a sample to the emission of the result for regional laboratories
conducting physical chemical analysis went from 55 hours (December 2006) to 12 hours (June 2011).

43.    Intermediate Outcome 2: The reliability of OSE's potable water supply infrastructure is
increased. Rating: High. The Project surpassed the intermediate indicator, “Increase backup capacity
of Aguas Corrientes Water Treatment Plant (WTP) to771,000 m3/day,” for this objective, bringing
the WTP’s backup capacity to 790,000m3/day and ensuring a reliable water supply for Montevideo’s
population until 2035. The new clarification technology lowered chemical usage, saving OSE

  The Project is partially responsible for this gain as OSE was implementing managerial efficiency initiatives outside of
the Project as well. See Annex 3 for an estimate on the percentage which the APL2 directly improved this data point.

four percent reduction in water losses when cleaning the filters.

44.     Intermediate Outcome 3: Non-Revenue Water is reduced. Rating: Substantial. OSE met
only two of the six intermediate NRW reduction indicators. This can be largely attributed to the delay
in implementation of the NRW activities as well as a gap between investments and target cities. The
RANC program, however, made significant strides during the APL2. As a result of the APL2, OSE
successfully reversed a trend of increasing levels of water loss that was aggravated by decades of
chronic underinvestment, particularly in maintenance. On a national level, NRW decreased over the
course of the APL2 program resulting in 20.5 million of cubic meter of water recovered per year,
equivalent to US$10.1 million per year.12 The US$27.3 million investment in the RANC program
will be returned in just over three years, and in ten years OSE will see a return of US$34 million.
These reductions can be attributed to a campaign on the part of RANC to establish a culture of
metering, extensive pipe substitution as well as the integration of NRW management in OSE’s day-
to-day operations. Metering and pipe substitution at OSE are now seen as routine, organizational
requirements. OSE spends approximately two percent of its annual investment budget on replacing
water distribution piping; this was part of the LA and became a regular practice at OSE. NRW is now
considered a strategic theme at OSE and is incorporated in senior management’s action plans. NRW
levels are also reported to the GoU, helping maintain OSE’s commitment to maintenance and further
reduction of these numbers. During the course of the APL2, OSE’s vision for NRW shifted from
focusing efforts on operational maintenance to focusing on reducing water losses. The APL2 laid the
groundwork for this shift in vision and the adoption of more advanced, innovative approaches for
NRW loss methods. With the support of the Project, OSE adopted three internationally recognized
best practices for NRW. First, OSE established a water balance that followed the International Water
Association’s (IWA) guidelines. Second, the Project supported the strengthening of the RANC unit
(having a unit devoted to NRW is considered a best practice) at OSE. Third, OSE began to employ
performance-based contracts for NRW work. In addition, the Project financed a pilot project to
establish a District of Measurement and Control (DMC)13 in Artigas. OSE began the pilot the Ayui
neighborhood of Artigas where NRW loss went from 906 l/conn/day in 2006 to 81 l/conn/day by the
close of the pilot. The success of the initiative has spurred a movement to create a network of DMCs
throughout the country. The OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project supports this initiative.

45.     Intermediate Outcome 4: Household connection to new and existing sewerage system
improved. Rating: Substantial. The Project contributed to an increase in sewerage coverage from 49
to 59 percent in the targeted cities.14 Household connections to the new and existing sewerage
systems have increased. OSE expanded its services to more customers through promoting
connections with social campaigns and providing technical assistance to local governments, helping
connect 3,664 more families to the sanitation network, exceeding the target in the PAD of 3,600.
OSE utilized OBD in its campaign to expand connections. Elements of the OBD methodology, which
was both innovative for the Bank and for OSE at the time of appraisal, are now being utilized by OSE
in its National Plan for Connections. The impact of this activity would have been stronger had the
National Plan for Connections been approved prior to the Project’s closing date.


12
  Water recovered is estimated based on apparent and real losses, and the dollar amount is calculated based on the
average water tariff and variable cost for water production and distribution.
13
  A DMC is an area of OSE’s distribution system that has been defined following a leakage management approach,
which includes the closure of valves with the objective of metering the quantities of water entering and leaving the district
to reduce NRW.
14
     These percentages are based on the total number of households that are connected to OSE’s water systems.
                                                                                                                          14
46.     The Impact Evaluation (IE) supported by the Project focused on the health impact of
household sewerage connections on young children. The pairing of rigorous, analytical research with
a Project highlights how the Bank can distinguish its “value added” to client operations. The IE is
highly relevant as there are no other rigorous studies showing the impact of sanitation on childhood
parasites in the Bank. In addition, OSE and the GoU are utilizing the study to confront the
“connectivity challenge” in Uruguay. The first phase of the study was completed during the APL2,
and the second phase of the study is beginning this year. The main findings from the first phase are:
(i) domiciliary sewerage connection has a direct, positive effect on child health indicators; and (ii)
sewerage connections have positive externalities on health indicators. Sewerage connections
significantly reduce the probability of contracting parasites. The results generated from the first phase
validate the GoU’s decision to approve the National Law for Connections, and OSE’s decision to
focus its efforts on promoting household connections in cities with high population densities and
inadequate septic systems. OSE is also working to improve septic tanks and improve sewage
management in areas where constructing a sewerage network is not viable. The knowledge generated
from the IE is also highly applicable to other WSS projects; the first phase of the IE was presented at
the 2013 Sustainable Development Network Week as well as at a conference by the Independent
Evaluation Group. The knowledge gained from this IE would have been utilized by OSE to a greater
degree had the IE been conducted at an earlier stage of the Project; results from the first phase were
published during the last year of the Project’s implementation.

47.      The outcomes of this Project were achieved with minor shortcomings illustrated through
several missed intermediate indicators. Although these indicators were partially or not met during the
life of the Project, OSE expects to meet and exceed these indicators in the near future. The Project
laid the groundwork for successful and sustained progress in each of its components. Based on the
substantial ratings for three intermediate outcomes and the high rating for one intermediate outcome,
the ICR team rates the efficacy of the Project as Substantial. See Annex 2 for a more detailed analysis
of the Project’s outputs and additional outcomes.

Efficiency (Rating: High)

48.     OSE completed all agreed upon Project activities and achieved full disbursement by the
Project’s close. One of the reasons for this highly efficient implementation was OSE’s procurement
preparation prior to the start of the Project. As noted earlier, OSE had begun a number of works and
had committed significant resources prior to Project approval. The Project was also efficient in
economic and financial terms. A Cost Benefit Analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic and
financial efficiency of the Project. The same approach was followed at appraisal. The analysis
consisted of with and without Project scenarios and evaluated the impact of the improvements made
at the Aguas Corrientes WTP, the RANC program, the expansion of the sewerage network as well as
the efficiency improvements generated through the implementation of Plan VECTOR. Results show
that the Project had positive financial and economic benefits with a financial rate of return of 23
percent and an economic rate of return of 29 percent. When each activity is evaluated individually,
results show positive returns for all with internal rate of returns ranging from 13 to 28 percent from a
financial viewpoint and from 14 to 41 percent from an economic viewpoint.

49.     The following table compares the actual results to those foreseen at appraisal. Actual total
financial returns were US$51 million, which is lower than the US$98 million expected at appraisal,
but the benefits were twice as much as the actual costs reflecting the soundness of the Project. Actual
economic benefits totaled US$81 million, which was less than the US$98million expected. The
economic rate of return, however, was still a positive 29 percent. For more detail on the economic
analysis, see Annex 3.

                                                                                                      15
Justification of Overall Outcome Rating. Rating: Satisfactory

50.    The ICR rates the overall outcome of the Project as Satisfactory based on “High” ratings for
relevance and efficiency and a “Substantial” rating for efficacy.

Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
51.      Actions associated with the RANC and VECTOR Programs led to social development
initiatives within OSE. For instance, the APL2 promoted a national culture of paying for water,
especially in informal settlements. A unit working on social issues disseminated social tariffs in low-
income settlements, raised awareness on water care and sanitation, and promoted client
regularization. These efforts have resulted in 60 percent of the regularized clients paying their bills
and have benefited 31,200 families living across 72 different housing developments with improved
services.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

52.     The Project resulted in a shift from a product-focused to a service-focused culture at OSE.
The shift was achieved through the implementation of management software and procedures
throughout the organization that provided new methods for connecting with the client as well as the
carrying out of numerous capacity building workshops and change management activities with the
assistance of an external consulting firm. These workshops and activities involved regional and
headquarters based employees who were deemed key leaders with the capacity to bring the change
back to their respective units and multiply the effects of the workshop. As a result of these activities,
OSE has begun actively monitoring client services and sentiment and has begun providing more
robust client services. Moreover, OSE developed an effective model for change management through
this experience that it is now utilizing for new initiatives. In the OSE Sustainable and Efficient
Project, most new initiatives begin with contracting international experts and workshops for key
players.

53.     OSE also began to open its doors to outside expertise over the course of the APL2, sharing
with and learning from external partners. In addition to contracting external consultants to develop
specialized project activities, OSE participated in numerous regional workshops, visited utilities in
Colombia and Spain and hosted the Southern Cone Water Utility Workshop in June 2012 in which
more than 100 participants from five countries participated.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
54.     An unexpected impact has been the strengthening of the Social Unit, responsible for social
inclusion, corporate responsibility, and public outreach on water conservation, which was supported
through the NRW activities. The Social Unit’s staff went from 3 people in 2005 to 30 people at the
Project’s close. Another unintended impact has been the permanent establishment of the VECTOR
group. The group was expected to end with the APL but after an effective implementation period,
OSE’s upper management decided to permanently establish the group to carry out management
strengthening activities and to promote the improvement of technology and innovation at OSE. New
management initiatives at OSE are now managed by VECTOR, which utilizes Project Management
Institute techniques.


                                                                                                      16
Section 4: Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome (Rating: Low)

55.    The risk to the development outcome is Low. The new level of transparency will continue
given new levels of public expectation, URSEA’s role in promoting systemized monitoring, as well
as OSE’s management use of these indicators for strategic planning. The cultural shift from product-
focused to service-focused is highlighted in OSE’s strategic plan and lines of action over the next five
years. The new software systems and corresponding procedures are also completely integrated in
OSE’s day-to-day operations. The advances made in strengthening the UGA and in developing a new
approach to reducing NRW are being built upon in the new OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project.
The recently approved National Plan for Connections as well as a new project financed by the CAF
will help sustain and amplify the gains made in promoting household connection to the sanitation
network via OBD.

Section 5: Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (Rating: Satisfactory)

56.     The Bank team performed a comprehensive analysis of the APL1, integrated lessons learned
in the APL2 and updated objectives and activities to align the Project closely with OSE’s strategic
vision. The Bank’s work in the public policy sector via the TAL also helped the team design a project
that was forward looking and aligned with newly developed sector policy. The Preparation team was
led by a Task Team Leader (TTL) who had led the design of the APL Program and brought an
exceptional level of knowledge of OSE’s culture and operations. The high level of confidence
between the Bank and OSE led to the design of a Project that reflected OSE’s needs and included
best practices, such as establishing the code of ethics, which were not part of OSE’s growth plans at
the time of design. Design-related shortcomings included the complexity of the results framework,
the gap between the outputs and the intermediate indicators, and the lack of foresight on the
implications of implementing a new company-wide system.

Bank Performance in Quality of Supervision (Rating: Satisfactory)

57.      The same TTL led the APL Program from preparation until the last year of implementation.
The OSE team highlighted the importance of having continuity in leadership, which greatly
facilitated implementation and supervision of the Project. In previous projects, OSE worked with
various TTLs, which interrupted the flow of implementation given changes in leadership style and
supervision methods. In contrast, during implementation OSE and the Bank maintained a fluid
relationship with a high level of collaboration. OSE highlighted the procurement support the Bank
provided; the specialist who supported the APL2 was very responsive, consistently providing quick
feedback on bidding documents. The environmental and social specialists, who were based in
Argentina, played an especially active role in developing the respective units. OSE also remarked on
the impact the Bank’s convening power and technical assistance, specifically through hiring of
experts and connecting OSE with other regional water utilities, had on the development of the more
innovative Project activities. The QALP-2 review highlighted the quality of Bank supervision, citing
“very diligent and intense” supervision and “high value technical assistance.” In addition, the Project
benefited from high level support from LC7 and the Uruguay Country Representative.




                                                                                                     17
Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

58.    Given the Bank’s satisfactory preparation and satisfactory supervision of the Project, the ICR
team rates the Bank’s overall performance as Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance

Government of Uruguay (Guarantor) Performance Rating: Satisfactory

59.     The Project benefited from a high level of commitment from the GoU, the guarantor, during
preparation. The political will to carry out modernization reforms at OSE during the preparation of
the APL2 was unprecedented both within the Government and among OSE’s Board of Directors, who
were appointed by the GoU and reflected the position of the GoU. The Project also received high
levels of support from URSEA and the MEF. The commitment and involvement from senior officials
in the shaping and implementation of the APL2 led to a high degree of ownership that propelled the
Project forward.

Implementing Agency Performance Supervision Rating: Satisfactory

60.     OSE’s senior management played an active role in the design of the APL2, ensuring that the
Project was fully integrated with OSE’s strategic plans and prioritized among the different operating
units. Senior management’s high level of involvement continued throughout the Project’s
implementation; management actively participated in missions and in aide memoire reviews. OSE’s
GPFE successfully supervised the implementation of the Project, coordinating the actions between
the various units enabling the Project to close on-time with full disbursement. The GPFE wrote
detailed progress reports every six months, and as mentioned above, investments in Project activities
began before the APL2 became effective. OSE complied with all covenants and agreements.


Section 6. Lessons Learned

61.     OSE’s senior management commitment to enhance utility performance and the Bank’s
long term relationship with OSE promoted innovation and institutional reform. The large
majority of Bank-financed WSS projects are infrastructure based. Prior to the APL2, OSE had
focused the majority of its work with the Bank on infrastructure. The heart of the APL2 Project,
however, was institutional modernization due to the GoU’s priorities for the sector and senior
management commitment for real change coupled with the Banks deep knowledge on water sector
reform. The Bank has worked with OSE for more than 25 years, and the TTL who designed the APL
Program maintained leadership of the Program for more than 10 years. In addition to having an in-
depth understanding of the culture of OSE and the political economy of Uruguay, the Bank and OSE
teams developed a high-level of trust in each other permitting the implementation of company-wide,
transformative initiatives as well as innovative concepts, such as OBD, the NRW pilot, and company
benchmarking. For the OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project, OSE sought the Bank to finance the
most innovative aspects of its strategic plan and financed the predominantly infrastructure-based
components with its own funds and through the assistance of other financial institutions.

62.    The APL instrument and an experienced implementation unit played a key role in the
Project’s full disbursement and on-time completion. The upfront planning work during the APL
design and the APL1 implementation allowed OSE to have significant advances in procurement and
                                                                                            18
institutional reform studies before effectiveness, which allowed OSE to implement quickly at an early
stage of the Project. In addition, OSE’s experience working with the Bank coupled with Bank
supervision and guidance also played an important role in the Project’s timely completion.

63.     The Bank’s global knowledge and convening power played a key role in transforming
OSE into an outward looking utility. Prior to the Project, OSE had a reputation for being an
inward looking utility. The Bank facilitated knowledge sharing between water utilities by bringing
international experts to the utility, financing participation in international seminars, and including
knowledge exchange indicators in the APL2. These activities played a key role in helping OSE
become an active participant in the international water and sanitation community. OSE now considers
it common practice to contract external experts when developing a new thematic area and has become
an active participant in the southern cone water resource management community. These outward
looking activities helped OSE develop a model for prompting change within the organization. The
Project also included an impact evaluation study, which has provided OSE with a rigorous, economic
analysis on the health impacts of domestic sewerage connection and has highlighted how the Bank
can provide knowledge products and act as a knowledge bank for its clients.

64.      Focusing on best practices is oftentimes more important than focusing on numeric
results. The APL2 played a key role in supporting OSE’s adoption of best practices in customer
service, corporate management, environmental management and NRW among other areas. These best
practices will enable sustainable growth. For instance, OSE’s development of a NRW unit is
considered best practice by IWA. Having a strong unit devoted to NRW reduction, naturally
increases the sustainability and focus on reducing NRW levels. Another example of a best practice is
to have 24 hour customer service call centers. The establishments of these call centers lay the
groundwork for the provision of more attentive customer service and greater client satisfaction. The
results framework, however, was more focused on performance indicators than process, and did not
capture many of these gains. The experience from the APL2 led the preparation team for the OSE
Sustainable and Efficient Project to reevaluate the relative importance of supporting outputs versus
supporting the implementation of best practices. The new Project emphasizes best practices and has a
Business Management Efficiency Index that monitors OSE’s adoption of 15 best practices.

65.    Human capacity development is key to sustainably reducing NRW. OSE found that
human capacity development was perhaps the most essential tool for reducing water losses and that
companywide day-to-day operations have the greatest impact on NRW reduction. One of the greatest
challenges OSE faces in NRW is making NRW a priority for employees at headquarters as well as
regional offices. Employees, often faced with urgent operations maintenance, do not have time to
plan and focus on NRW reduction. OSE’s senior management’s prioritization of NRW reduction,
through budget assignation, human development initiatives and strategic plans, has been crucial for
promoting companywide cultural change.


Section 7: Comments on Issues Raised By Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

66.     There are no substantive differences between the Borrower and the Bank’s evaluation of the
Project. The Borrower reviewed and agreed with this version of the ICR and its overall ratings with
the exception of the rating on the Bank’s performance. The Borrower considered the Bank’s
performance at entry and during supervision Highly Satisfactory as opposed to Satisfactory. The
Borrower’s analysis and comments were incorporated in the ICR. For the Borrower’s report, see
Annex 5.

                             Annex 2. Project Outputs by Components
                                 (and additional Project results)

         Component 1. OSE’s Institutional Renewal (Vector Program). This component was
designed to support OSE’s flagship reform initiative and to support the WSS institutional sector
reform. The activities under this component are grouped under three areas of interventions: (i)
institutional modernization, (ii) strengthening regional decentralization and (iii) technical
modernization and optimization of organizational processes.
Institutional Modernization
        Performance Benchmarking: This activity deepened OSE’s internal benchmarking system
established under the APL1, stimulating internal regulation and competition. In the APL2, the
number and coverage of quality of service and commercial and operational efficiency indicators were
expanded. OSE continued to publish (on its website and in newspaper) its performance indicators,
and developed a framework for calculating, reporting and monitoring performance indicators with the
active participation of its technical units. Furthermore, OSE contracted a consultancy to conduct a
technical audit of the performance indicators and to provide specific recommendations for
improvement. In addition, OSE began working actively with URSEA to comply with existing WSS
national norms and standards aimed at improving quality of services and to create a shared set of
quality of service indicators. The APL2 also supported OSE’s foray into international performance
benchmarking. OSE now submits 140 performance indicators to IBNET and ADERASA, far
surpassing the APL2’s goal of sharing 61 indicators with these organizations. OSE has developed a
strong benchmarking culture and is currently developing a new, more comprehensive framework to
measure organizational performance.
         Regional Knowledge Exchange. The Project supported innovation and knowledge sharing
through financing participation in international seminars and regional exchanges. OSE far exceeded
the target for this indicator, attending 89 international seminars and 47 regional exchanges during the
life of the Project. OSE hosted the Southern Cone Water Utility Modernization workshop and other
technical workshops, such the biosolids management and NRW regional workshops. In 2012, OSE
visited various utilities in Spain and Colombia to learn from their water management experiences.
         Code of Ethics: The APL2 supported the development of a Code of Ethics at OSE to guide
internal and external relationships in a clear, transparent format. OSE went beyond the scope of the
Project, not only designing and operationalizing the Code, but also embarking on an awareness
building campaign and developing a code of good governance. OSE is also working to develop an
ethics committee and to establish ethics agreements across all departments. OSE has created a unit
responsible for institutionalizing business ethics and social responsibility to ensure the continuity of
this initiative. The Project financed a consultancy to develop an ethics management framework and
the code of ethics and code of good governance in highly participatory manner. Several workshops
where conducted internally and externally to share the approved code of ethics.
         Strengthening Environmental Management Capacity: The Project supported a number of
activities that leveraged OSE’s efforts to improve environmental management at the organization.
Overall, the Project has helped increase the visibility of the UGA at OSE and institutionalize the
environmental management within the organization.


                                                                                                     21
The 2013 Action Plan highlights nine areas in which OSE is going to be placing its efforts this year,
and the third priority is to promote best environmental practices. Like the APL2, the OSE Sustainable
and Efficient Project emphasizes environmental management and will support the further
development of many of the activities initiated in the APL2 Project. See Sub-Annex 2 for a detailed

Strengthening Regional Decentralization
        Strengthening OSE’s Regional Environmental Laboratory Capacity. The Project also
promoted efficiency and transparency through supporting OSE’s decentralization efforts and
financing the construction of eight regional laboratories utilizing the integrated laboratory
management system model. The laboratories are located in Paysandu, Colonia, Treinta y Tres,
Durazno, Canelones, San Jose, Fray Bentos, and Metropolitana. The Project also financed technical
equipment, office furniture, communication equipment, chemicals, and general supplies. In addition
the Project supported the certification of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) quality
management systems (ISO 9000), which improves procedures and documentation, at several regional
laboratories, the central laboratory, and the drinking water plant in Dolores among other locations.
The establishment of regional laboratories has led to significantly faster response times for sample
testing and improved confidence in the quality of water. The table below details these gains:

Technical modernization and optimization of organizational processes
       Modernization and Integration of the Commercial and Operative Systems. This is one of
Program Vector’s most critical sub-projects. The lack of integration between OSE’s commercial and
operative systems was OSE’s largest source of inefficiency. In addition, both systems were and the
technological tools that supported them were out of date. Specifically, the Project financed the
implementation of a new SGCO system, which included the following activities: (i) acquisition of
information technology (software, hardware, and equipment) and maintenance and consolidation of
the SGCO software, (ii) investments in regional infrastructures (offices, call center, etc) and (iii)
consultancies on change management, organizational structure and capacity building.



                                                                                                    22
To OSE, this subproject represented a complete transformation, requiring a new organizational
structure, new management systems and goals, as well as updated geographical administrative
boundaries with clear leadership guiding both commercial and operational activities. To support the
successful implementation of the system, OSE unified all of its commercial and operative procedures
and developed the following regulations to support the implementation of the system: (i) irregularities
in service; (ii) regulation in service provision; (iii) payments and delinquency; and (iv) tariffs and
billing. The implementation of the system transformed consumer services. Today, OSE has a SGCO
system that streamlined all client management activities in one system, increasing organizational
transparency, efficiency and efficacy.
        Prior to the Project there were 25 customer service centers with full functionality; now there
are 75 such centers. Prior to the APL2, customers had to visit the center that corresponded to their
geographic location. With the implementation of the SGCO system, clients can now visit any OSE
center to resolve issues. Prior to the APL2, customers had to pay their bills in person at a specified
attention center; customers can now pay their bills at any OSE customer center and register for auto-
pay with their credit or debit cards, pay at supermarkets or online through Banred. Customers wishing
to speak to an OSE representative in person can now make an appointment, while previously they had
to wait in line. The APL2 also financed the implementation of a free call center, which provided the
entire country with 24 hour service; previously, only Montevideo and Ciudad de la Costa had access
to the call center. Clients can now place their complaints and manage their accounts via an interactive
web interface. In addition to improving and expanding customer channels, OSE improved its
efficiency as indicated in the table and graphs below.

        Figure 1 depicts an important increase in the number of household connections that are made
to an existing water network in less than 45 days. In addition, Figure 2 illustrates an increase in the
number of connections made to existing networks in Montevideo, demonstrating an increased in
efficiency and efficacy by OSE in the provision of water services to its customers.

       Another important indicator to track is the commercial claim rates (number of claims divided
by number of connections) and the time it took to resolve them. Figure 3 depicts an increase in claims
when the new system became operational in June 2009; however, since March 2011, OSE has seen a
downward trend in claim rates while the number of connections has continued to increase. Although
the new system provides more channels to place complaints which inherently imply a higher number
of complaints, OSE was able to reduce complaints to acceptable levels. Figure 4 also shows an
increase of complaints that are resolved in less than 3 days.

        In addition, as depicted in Figure 5, after the implementation of the new system, OSE was
able to increase the percentage of customers that experience a response time to reestablish water
service of less than one day compared to 2009 values.

 Figure 5. Response time to reestablish water service




        OSE also worked on reducing fraud and debt, as well as increased commercial and
operational efficiency to improve the collections ratio and customer transparency. In terms of meter
reading, the SGCO system enabled flexibility in planning meter reading visits, tracking of meters,
optimization of the detection of consumption anomalies, and readings via the internet and telephone.
In terms of billing, the commercial cycle was cut from a 30 to 60 day period to a 14 to 20 day period,
and billings based on actual reading jump from 77 to 90 percent. The billing statements were re-
designed to show the breakdown of costs as well as graphics illustrating consumption, the calculation
of invisible losses was made automatic, billing processes were simplified and made automatic, and
the ability to detect anomalies in billing was enhanced. In terms of payments, the implementation of
the new system provided automatic payment channels, simplified and made payment agreements
automatic, made the calculation of invisible payment automatic and improved management of
delinquent payments. In terms of technical management, all work orders could be managed in one
system and all client complaints arrived in one folder. With the combination of these measures, OSE
was able to reduce the debt by 20 percent, recuperating 3.4 million m3 of water from fraud and
increasing the non-collection ration from seven to four percent.

        Other management and technological improvements. In the spirit of optimizing administrative
processes at OSE to improve efficiency, efficacy and overall management, the Project also financed
the implementation of a financial management and procurement model involving the implementation
of SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and new processes, norms, training, and organizational
structures. In addition, the Project strengthened human resources (HR) management by acquiring and
implementing HR software, which was complemented by the re-qualification and training of
personnel. The software and organizational changes have simplified processes and has reduced
transaction costs. The APL2 also supported the purchase and implementation of a Geographical
Information System (GIS).

                                                                                                   26
OSE successfully implemented the GIS, uploading information on the WSS systems and holding
training sessions. OSE is expanding the use of the GIS, especially as it pertains to NRW reduction
loss activities.

Component 2 – Water Supply

       Rehabilitation of the Aguas Corrientes Water Treatment Plant: The Project surpassed the
intermediate indicator, “Increase backup capacity of Aguas Corrientes Water Treatment Plant
to771,000 m3/day,” for this objective, bringing the WTP’s backup capacity to 790,000 m3/day and
ensuring a reliable water supply that meets the US EPA’s National Primary Drinking Water
Standards for Montevideo’s population until 2035. The Project financed the construction of 8 filters
and three new flocculation and sedimentation units. The new clarification unit improved efficiency in
the removal of solids; before the Project, only 10 percent of the water leaving the clarifiers was under
2 NTU, the level necessary to guarantee the proper functioning of the filters. After implementation,
100 percent of the exiting water was less than 2 NTU. The new clarification units also lowered the
required levels of Aluminum Sulfate, saving OSE approximately US$200,000 per year.

Unaccounted for Water Reduction Program (RANC):

        The RANC program at OSE was supported by the APL1 as well as the APL2. One of the
main lessons learned from the APL1 was the need to closely integrate NRW reduction activities with
normal operation, maintenance and commercial processes. In particular, the APL1 highlighted the
need for an integrated commercial operative system to improve not only general efficiency and client
attention, but also to reduce NRW levels.

         The APL2 played a key role in strengthening the RANC Unit, which was created in 2005, at
OSE. The Project financed: (i) pipe improvements (210 Km in total) in Montevideo and the Southern,
Northern and Eastern regions of Uruguay; (ii) the purchase and installment of 400,000 ½ meters; and
(iii) a pilot sectorization project in Artigas. The Project also supported a number of soft activities. For
instance, the Project supported capacity building workshops to develop a culture of metering at OSE.
The Project also provided technical assistance to support the implementation of a number of NRW
management best practices. For example, OSE developed a Water Balance in accordance with
international best practice, which has helped highlight the importance of NRW reduction to senior
management, guide strategic investments and increase accountability. Another best practice
highlighted by the International Water Association and the American Water Works Association that
the APL2 supported was the move from using the percentage of water elevated over water billed to
analyze NRW levels, to using liters per connection per day. The percentage metric was not sensitive
to average supply times, pressures, consumption levels, or the density of connections. Yet another
best practice the APL2 supported was the move from analyzing real losses as 50 percent of total
losses and apparent losses as 50 percent of total losses. OSE is still working to further define their
actual loss break down, but has moved to percentages more reflective of countries in Latin America
and Asia, counting approximately 70 percent of overall losses as real losses and 30 percent as
apparent losses.




                                                                                                        27
       The Project also supported a pilot DMC that utilized a performance-based contract in the
Ayui neighborhood of Artigas. The success of the DMC methodology as well as the performance-
based contract has spurred a movement to create DMCs throughout the country (supported by the
new OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project) and to expand the use of performance based contracts.

        The APL2 helped lay the groundwork for a successful NRW program at OSE. Given the late
start of the RANC activities, the full impact of the APL2 investments have yet to be seen.
Nevertheless, the OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project builds on the activities implemented under
this project and incorporates many of the lessons learned.

Component 3 – Expansion of sewerage systems

        The sewerage expansion activities financed network expansion activities in Treinta y Tres,
Minas, Mercedes, Colonia, Melo and Rio Branco, resulting in an increase in sewerage coverage from
49 to 59 percent in the targeted cities. In addition, the Project financed one of the Bank’s first OBD
activities, which assisted in 7,225 additional household connections to the sewerage network built
during the APL1, and 1,998 additional household connections to the network built during the APL2.
OSE is utilizing aspects of the OBD methodology to support the recently approved National Plan for
Connections. The Project also included feasibility studies for sewage treatment plants in Colonia and
Mercedes.

        The Project also supported an IE study that analyzed the impact of household sewerage
connection on health indicators, focusing on the correlation between sewerage connections and
parasite levels in young children. The study included a randomized experiment to support the
identification strategy. The study also used new instruments, such as collecting soil and fecal
samples, to measure impact. The evaluation was unique as it is attempting to answer some novel
questions related to externalities that, so far, are not covered in the sector, and may play a key role in
understanding the true impact of sanitation interventions. For more information on the IE, please see
“Measuring Human Development Outcomes through Water and Sanitation Connectivity” in the
Project files. The second phase of the impact evaluation study is scheduled to begin this year.

Component 4 – Project management, supervision and audits

       Under this component, the APL2 financed contracts for: (i) a procurement consultant; (ii) a
company planning consultant; (iii) two sanitation consultants; (iv) an environmental consultant; and
(v) a code of ethics consultant. The Project also financed software maintenance and various audits
under this component.

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Details on the economic evaluation

1.    Objective. The objective of the economic evaluation is to compare the net benefits gained
through Project implementation with those foreseen at the time of preparation.

2.     Methodology. The cost benefit analysis employed the same framework used during appraisal
in order to facilitate comparisons between expected and actual results. Actual costs and benefits were
estimated and compared with those projected at the time of appraisal. Actual net benefits were
calculated as the difference between incremental benefits and incremental costs of two situations:
with and without project. The analysis was carried out from two different perspectives: financial and
economic. The financial perspective measures the revenues and costs at market price. The economic
perspective measures the benefits and costs with adjustments for the impact of taxes, subsidies, and
externalities, using the same conversion factors used at appraisal, to calculate the economic flow of
costs and benefits. The results correspond to a net present value of flows during the useful life of the
project, estimated at 30 years and a 11 percent discount rate

3.     The analysis was carried out for the same components evaluated during preparation of the
Project, which were: (i) Aguas Corrientes and unaccounted for water works; (ii) expansion of
sewerage networks; and (iii) efficiency improvements from the institutional renewal program.
(VECTOR Plan).

4.     Aguas Corrientes Component. At the time of appraisal, the water produced by certain sections
of the plant was not of acceptable quality impeding the full utilization of plant capacity. The Project
enabled Aguas Corrientes to reach full capacity and comply with the quality criteria set by OSE,
which is similar to the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) water quality standards.
Before the Project was implemented, Aguas Corrientes could produce up to 620, 000 cubic meters
per day in compliance with water quality standards; with the Project, production capacity increased to
790, 000 cubic meters per day. With this capacity increase OSE can ensure a reliable water supply for
Montevideo’s population until 2035. Two additional benefits have been obtained. First, the turbidity
level of the clarifier effluent and treatment costs have decreased. Samples taken by OSE show that in
2011 only 10 percent of the samples had a turbidity level lower than 2 NTU; by April 2013, all the
samples presented levels lower than 2 NTU. This improvement led to a 21 percent reduction in the
amount of aluminum sulfate required. Second, backwash water generated from cleaning filters have
decreased 3 to 4 percent, reducing operating costs

5.      This evaluation includes the real benefits with some modifications to the consumption per
capita and the unbilled water parameters among others based on the real numbers registered by OSE
from 2008 to 2012 and included in both scenarios with and without project. For the with Project
situation the benefits attained, backwash reduction at the filters, treatment cost reduction, and
increase in the production at the water treatment plant up to its maximum capacity of 790,000 cubic
meters per day when needed were included. This improvement will satisfy water demand during the
projected period if consumption remains at 2012 levels. In the without Project situation there was a
restriction to satisfy demand during the whole period given that Aguas Corrientes could not produce
more than 620 thousand cubic meters of water per day with the required quality. For the economic
benefits the rationing cost were included using the same cost at appraisal.

                                                                                                     31
    6.     Unaccounted for Water Component. As during appraisal, this component was evaluated
    globally for all the localities. Even though some localities did not achieve the expected targets, the
    component as a whole met the expected goals.

    7.      Actual benefits were measured for both physical and commercial water losses. The full
    implementation of the program shows a reduction of total losses from 54.3 percent in 2007 to 50.2
    percent in 201216. For the analysis of the program, two indexes for the measurement of losses were
    employed: (i) for the economic evaluation, it was used the losses in respect to the volume of
    authorized water; and (ii) for the financial evaluation, it was used the losses in respect to billed water
    It is estimated that 70 percent of the losses were physical and 30 percent commercial. The volume of
    authorized water corresponds to the volume of water that OSE permits clients to consume without
    charge. For instance, OSE oftentimes authorizes water consumption in low-income settlements. The
    benefits were estimated as follows: (i) reduction of physical losses as decreases in the variable costs
    of producing water; (ii) reduction of commercial losses as increases in revenues as more clients are
    incorporated into the billing system and more water is billed. The increase in revenue is partially
    offset by reduced consumption from meter installation. For the economic costs, reduced rationing
    was included using the same rationing cost used at appraisal.

    8.    Efficiency Improvements through the VECTOR Plan. This component aimed to improve
    OSE’s productivity and its relationship with customers. At the time of appraisal the benefits were
    estimated as: (i) a 15 percent increase in labor productivity; (ii) a10 percent reduction on
    administrative costs; and (iii) a 1 percent reduction on commercial losses. OSE has implemented the
    VECTOR plan and has achieved important goals, including: (i) reduction on response time to
    complaints; (ii) reduction on the period of time for connecting new customers to the network and
    incorporating new customers into the billing system; (iii) improvement of payment facilities for
    customers; (iv) upgrading the accounting system; and (v) improvement in reports and registered
    accounting information.

    9.      At the same time that the Project was being implemented, OSE was implementing additional
    activities to further improve its efficiency. OSE achieved important efficiency gains by the end of the
    implementation period, including: (i) a 16 percent increase in labor productivity; (ii) a 26 percent
    reduction in administrative costs (not including personnel); and (iii) a 2.5 percent decrease in
    commercial losses. Isolating the efficiency benefits derived from Plan VECTOR alone is difficult. A
    break-even analysis shows that Plan Vector has financial benefits if it were responsible for
    improvements in all variable as follows: (i) a 2.5 percent increase on labor productivity; (ii) a 2
    percent reduction of administrative costs; or (iii) a 0.10 percent reduction of commercial losses. Plan
    Vector has economic benefits if it were responsible for improvements in both an increase in labor
    productivity of 4 percent and a reduction of administrative costs of 3 percent.

     Water losses are measured as the difference between volume of water produced minus volume of water authorized (some of which is
    not billed) divided by volume of water produced.
                                                                                                                                 32
 10.    OSE personnel assigned the following benefits to the VECTOR Plan utilizing conservative
 assumptions: (i) 0.2 percent reduction of commercial losses; (ii) 5 percent improvement in labor
 productivity; and (iii) 4 percent reduction in administrative costs. It is expected that the benefits of
 the program are actually higher.

 11. Sewerage Expansion. For this evaluation actual sewerage connections were included during
 the period of implementation of the Project up to 2012 for the with Project scenario. From 2013
 onwards, connections were increased with the population growth rate. For the without Project
 scenario, the number of connections were left unchanged at 2008 levels. Financial benefits
 correspond to revenue increases from the new sewerage connections. Economic benefits correspond
 to savings from eliminating the onsite sewage disposal used before the connection. Operating costs
 were increased in pace with the expansion of the service utilizing the unit prices that OSE has for
 sewerage systems.

 12. Financial Results show total benefits of US$51 million and an IRR of 23 percent. Although
 these numbers are lower than what was foreseen at appraisal, they affirm the achievement and the
 value of the Project. All components also show positive results with IRRs ranging from 13 to 28
 percent.

 13. Economic Results show benefits of US$81 million, which albeit lower than expected, are
 significant and important for the whole economy. The economic rate of return for the Project was 29
 percent. All components show economic benefits and have economic IRRs ranging from 14 to 41
 percent. The benefits derived from the components are more than twice the actual costs.

                                    Annex 5. Borrower’s Report
OSE prepared its own implementation completion report following the close of the APL2. There are
no significant differences between the Bank team’s ICR and OSE’s ICR except for the Borrower’s
rating of Bank performance at entry and supervision as Highly Satisfactory (the Bank ICR ranks
Bank performance as Satisfactory). OSE considered Bank performance Highly Satisfactory given the
level of technical assistance and close collaboration that accelerated capacity building activities and
program design. OSE reviewed the Bank’s ICR and fully agreed with the analysis. The text below
represents a shortened version of OSE’s report; for the full report, please see the Project files.
Section 1: Background
In 2000, OSE and the World Bank agreed on the execution of the OSE Modernization and Systems
Rehabilitation APL. The purpose of the APL was to increase the efficiency, coverage and
sustainability of WSS services in Uruguay by: (i) improving the competitiveness of OSE, the national
public water company; (ii) maintaining trust and increasing the coverage of water supply
infrastructure; and (iii) increasing the coverage of sewerage services and wastewater treatment.
The APL was originally designed in four stages with a loan totaling US$100 million and was
expected to be carried out from 2001 to 2012. The APL1, with a loan of US$27 million, was carried
out from July 31, 2001 to March 31, 2007.
The APL2, with a loan of US$50 million, was carried out from October 17, 2007, to March 31, 2013.
The APL2 was aimed at continuing the modernization of OSE’s drinking water and sanitation
systems, as well as increasing the efficiency, coverage and sustainability of WSS services in
Uruguay, placing greater emphasis on improving OSE’s transparency, responsibility, customer
service and efficiency.
The APL2 supported OSE’s strategic guidelines as well as national sectoral policies. In the early
2000s, Uruguay initiated a series of institutional reforms aimed at separating the policy, regulatory
and operational responsibilities in the water sector. Prior to these reforms, OSE held all these
responsibilities.
A constitutional reform approved in October 2004 declared the right to water a human right and made
the provision of drinking water and sanitation into an exclusive right of public institutions. During the
execution of the APL2, the legal and institutional framework was consolidated in the following
manner:
           The MVOTMA is in charge of policy formulation. DINAGUA, an agency of MVOTMA,
            is responsible for formulating policies on water, sanitation and water resources
            management. DINAMA, another agency of MVOTMA, is responsible for supervising
            water quality in bodies of water and for controlling wastewater discarges.
           URSEA is an autonomous, decentralized executing unit of the Executive Branch of
            government; it has technical independence and regulates the provision of energy, fuel,
            water and sanitation.
           OSE is the operator responsible for the provision of drinking water and sewerage services
            throughout the country, with the exception of the Department of Montevideo, where the
            Municipal Government (Intendencia) offers sewerage services to the population.
            Departmental Intendencias are in charge of providing rainwater drainage services.


                                                                                                      35
Due to the impending conclusion of the APL2, the Bank and OSE began preparing a new operation in
2011. In light of the results achieved during the APL1 and APL2 and OSE’s strategic objectives for
the coming years, OSE and the Bank decided to carry out a new project: “OSE Sustainable and
Efficient”, aimed at increasing OSE’s sustainability by improving the reliability and resilience of its
WSS systems, improving its efficiency, and strengthening its management capacity, rather than
continue with the APL.
Project Development Objectives and Indicators
Development objectives
The development objective of the APL2 was to ensure that Uruguayans receive greater accountability
for water and sewerage services, a more consumer-oriented service, and greater value for the money
they pay for these services.
Results indicators
The PDO level results indicators were: (i) OSE complies with the service quality regulation issued by
URSEA in order to safeguard the interests of consumers; (ii) the regulatory accounting framework for
water and sewerage services is operational. These indicators were not modified during project
execution.
Intermediate indicators
During project execution, a set of 22 intermediate indicators were defined to gauge progress. These
indicators were calculated and reported to the Bank in semi-annual progress reports.
During the MTR, the following indicators were restructured:
        i. NRW indicators, which are part of the set of operational and commercial efficiency
           indicators, were initially defined as the percentage of water elevated over water billed. In
           the MTR, the unit of measure was restructured to liters per connection per day. This
           change was made because the indicator in percentage terms is not the best suited for
           evaluating the systems over time as it lacks the necessary sensitivity to capture their
           growth.
    ii. Environmental management improvement indicators were restructured to reflect the current
        Environmental Management Plan. The original and restructured indicators are presented
        below:
  No.   Original indicators                              Restructured indicators

                                                                                                                 36
Direct and indirect beneficiaries
The project’s direct and indirect beneficiaries by component are described below.
Component 1: Institutional improvement
Program of Indicators: The direct beneficiaries are mainly OSE’s customers who receive objective
information on the service provided by OSE as a result of this program. OSE staff members
(especially senior managers, managers and heads of individual sections) also have benefited from the
information on the indicators, which allowed them to assess the company’s management and take
corrective measures to improve it.
Code of Conduct: The main beneficiaries are OSE authorities and staff as the Code provides clear
guidelines on internal and external relationships.
Strengthening of Decentralization: Integrated Laboratory Management System: The main
beneficiaries are staff members from OSE’s operational sections, who saw a considerable reduction
in the delivery time for analytical information on the quality of water supplied, as well as increased
knowledge on the water quality levels, enabling OSE to improve its control of the quality of the water
it supplies.
Commercial–Operational Project: There are two large groups of beneficiaries. OSE customers
benefited from OSE management’s change in orientation from a product-focused to a customer-
focused culture. Customers obtained greater means of access to services that are better suited to their
needs, including more efficient in-person attention at multi-functional locations by service executives
and more timely operational responsed. OSE employees working on commercial-operational
activities, particularly the customer service sections, also benefited from the comprehensive, reliable
information the SGCO system produced, as well as the historical information, information on people,
locations and meters that the system housed. Staff also benefited from having offices and locations
with designs and equipment suited to the services provided.
It should be noted that as a company, OSE has also benefited from having a more efficient
commercial-operation management structure, which has enabled OSE to obtain greater revenue
(decrease in delinquent payments, shortening of the commercial cycle, more effective cuts, increase
in actual readings compared to estimated readings, etc.) and has thus improved OSE’s image in the
eyes of the population.
Improvement of the Financial-Accounting and Supply Process: OSE staff, as well as high-level
managers, obtained benefits from improvements in management, simplification of processes, and
reductions in transaction costs as a result of the implementation of the SAP system.
Modernization of Human Resources Management and Asset Liquidation: Beneficiaries are OSE
personnel, particularly in the Human Resources Management section, whose work has been
facilitated by a more modern, functional system for managing these resources.
Geographic Information System: The work of OSE staff in technical, commercial and operational
sections has been facilitated, in terms of time and form, by more reliable and comprehensive
information on the geo-referenced mapping of networks and services.
Projects for the Implementation and Certification of Quality Management Systems: Staff,
especially those that have past experience in implementing and certifying a quality management
systems, have benefitted from having clear, documented processes and procedures.

                                                                                                    37
Strengthening of Environmental Management Capacity: UGA staff and staff from related sections
have benefited from the strengthening of the technical team and from the definition of the company’s
environmental policy, as well as the higher profile of environmental issues in OSE’s activities.
Moreover, society as a whole has benefited from more environmentally responsible activity on the
part of OSE.
Social Project–Regularization of the Provision of Drinking Water Services in Settlements: 31,200
families located in 72 settlements benefited from these activities.
Component 2: Drinking water
Aguas Corrientes: The direct beneficiaries of this program were the approximately 1,700,000
residents of the Montevideo Metropolitan Area, who saw an improvement in the provision of
drinking water, in terms of quality and reliability.
RANC Program: OSE is the beneficiary of the NRW reduction program, which has led to increases
in tariff revenue (commercial losses), decreases in production costs (physical losses) and the
postponement of infrastructure investments to produce more water. Staff working in operational
sectors that deal with distribution also benefited from improved networks, which facilitated their
operational work.
Component 3: Sanitation
Under this component, 7,225 homes benefited from connecting to networks constructed during the
execution of APL1, and 1,998 homes benefited from connecting to networks constructed during the
execution of APL2.
Section 2: Key factors that affected implementation and outcomes
OSE understands that the stated objectives for the APL and the APL2 were valid both for OSE’s
development as well as that of the country’s WSS Sector. In the APL2, focusing the project’s
objectives on customers was adequate and continues to be OSE’s current outlook.
During the preparation phase, objectives were aligned with guidelines established by the GoU, both
for public enterprises and for the sector. In general, the overall project design was adequate for
achieving the objective of modernizing and rehabilitating OSE’s systems.
The key factor for the successful implementation of the institutional improvement component was the
alignment of this component’s objectives with the strategic objectives of OSE’s Board of Directors
and the strong support of OSE’s senior management throughout the implementation period.
Improvement works in the Aguas Corrientes plant responded to needs detected in the Metropolitan
Region Drinking Water and Sanitation Master Plan; this was a key factor for the achievement of this
indicator.
For the execution of the RANC Project, the support of OSE’s Board of Directors and senior
management was essential. Even with this support, project implementation was negatively affected
by the priority assigned to the implementation of new commercial-operational, financial-accounting
and supply systems for the institutional improvement activities. In addition, another factor that
limited the outcomes was the fact that many of the resources for pipe replacement were used with the
objective of highlighting improvement in distribution networks in order to facilitate their operation
rather than the objective of reducing losses.

                                                                                                  38
Based on experience gained by OSE staff during the execution of this component, and in light of the
pilot experience conducted in the city of Artigas, it is understood that a more efficient means of
reducing losses is to work with DMCs. OSE has begun utilizing this strategy.
Although the activities to promote connection to the sewerage network, conducted under the
framework of expanding networks by demand, showed good results, the execution of the sanitation
component was affected by OSE’s inability to subsidize intra-residential connections. The
agreements reached with departmental intendencias were only partially successful due to the
impossibility of providing subsidies to the population. A law stipulating mandatory sanitation
connection was approved in December 2011 (and regulated in February 2013). This law authorizes
OSE to subsidize intra-residential connections for the most vulnerable population.
In general, one factor that greatly aided the rapid implementation of all project components was the
fact that the design included not only those activities considered priorities for OSE, but also activities
that had already begun when the LA was signed; therefore, the initial delays that are common in this
type of projects did not occur.
Section 3: Evaluation of project outcome
Relevance
Despite the passage of time, OSE understands that the stated objectives for the program were
adequate and valid during the project’s development, particularly the APL2’s focus on customers.

Effectiveness
Both development objectives were achieved:
        i. OSE complies with the service quality regulation issued by URSEA to safeguard
           consumers’ interests: to date, URSEA has prepared a draft Water Quality Regulation that
           was submitted for public consultation during the period from April 4 to May 9, 2011.
           OSE sent its contributions to this draft regulation. URSEA is currently revising this
           regulation, taking into account the contributions made and the 2012 Public Health
           bromatological regulation. In addition, OSE is complying with URSEA’s resolution on
           service quality.
        ii. The regulatory accounting framework for water and sewerage services is operational. On
            June 4, 2009, URSEA approved the Regulation on the Provision of Accounting
            Information for Regulatory Purposes on the Drinking Water and Sanitation Sector. Since
            then, OSE has been sending the information to URSEA in accordance with this
            Regulation.
With regard to intermediate indicators, 14 of the 22 indicators were complied with. An analysis of
noncompliance with indicators is presented below:
Indicators of service quality: OSE feels that the targets set during project preparation were overly
optimistic, due to the following factors: (i) the implementation of new commercial-operational,
financial-accounting and supply systems had an unexpected initial negative impact on any of the
indicators; (ii) due to initial difficulties in the use of the new systems, the information used to
calculate the indicators did not reflect reality; this made it necessary, whenever possible, to take
corrective actions to clean up system information (e.g., many work orders were not closed in the
system but claims were addressed); (iii) the baseline, and consequently the targets, were established
                                                                                                       39
using information available up to that time, which in some cases ended up not being complete or
reliable; and (iv) the change in commercial-operational management caused the baseline not to be
comparable with the current situation (e.g., management aimed at minimizing the number of users
coming to OSE offices, and facilitation of claims and procedures by telephone and Internet, so that
in-person claims and procedures now correspond to those that are more difficult and take longer to
resolve
Indicators of the Operational and Commercial Efficiency: The program that most affect this indicator
set is NRW (seven RANC indicators are not complied with). This is because, although this program
achieved very good results at national level and in the metropolitan region (in both cases the planned
targets were met), the targets set for selected localities were not met. In this regard, it should be noted
that the indicators were selected with the aim of seeking adequate representation of the country’s
different localities, selecting some with good indicators, others with average values, and others with
low values. Although the effort of changing meters was carried out nationwide with uniform criteria,
the same did not occur with the replacement of pipes, which was done more selectively and with
priority given to several localities. Thus, work was not necessarily carried out intensively in cities
that had previously been selected for monitoring
Indicators of Financial Efficiency: The three indicators with which OSE is currently not complying
are the operational ratio, operational margin and liquidity index. With regard to the operational ratio
and the operational margin, both of these indicators measure the same thing (one as a subtraction and
the other as a quotient), and thus their noncompliance is linked. The variation observed in these
indicators occurred because the cost components experienced a real increase that was higher than that
of the tariff. This situation responds to macroeconomic policy considerations, not strictly to the
analysis of the company’s profitability. The liquidity index reflects the works executed during the
period in terms of their value expressed in dollars with respect to associated financing. Short-term
indebtedness incurred for such purposes is the subject of a long-term re-profiling, more in line with
the recovery period for these investments. This would improve the ratio because a portion of the
current liability would become non-current.
Environmental Indicator: After the project closing date, activities continued to be carried out in order
to enable compliance with the Environmental Management improvement indicator. On April 18 and
19, 2013 two training workshops were held to present OSE’s environmental policy, the Works
Management Manuals and the Environmental Guidelines for project design. With this activity two
other environmental indicators were complied with. In addition, in May the consultant who was
preparing the Environmental Guidelines for project design submitted the final version to OSE. With
regard to the last environmental indicator, the design and implementation of the Environmental
Database, it should be noted that this is in the final phase of development: its design, the migration of
information, and 4 of the 11 required reports have been finalized.
Non-revenue water in Salto, Trinidad, Tacuarembó and Melo: Although the outcomes achieved
under the Non-revenue Water Reduction Program have been evaluated positively, the expected
targets were not achieved in these localities. The reasons for noncompliance with these indicators
were mentioned above in the commercial operative efficiency indicator (the indicators are repeated).
In this regard, OSE wishes to highlight the good experience gained in the City of Artigas, where the
program’s execution strategy was changed: DMCs were formed and measurements were taken in
these zones with the objective of reducing losses.


                                                                                                        40
This allowed Artigas, which had not substantially modified its NRW indicator from project start-up
to June 2012, to comply with the target in March 2013.
Beyond the outcomes shown by project monitoring indicators, which in some cases have been
adequate and in other cases not as much, OSE wishes to highlight the following achievements:
       ‐   The implementation of the new commercial-operational system has implied a major
           change in the Administration. It has allowed significant improvements to be made in
           management, which in turn have allowed most of the initial aspirations to become a
           reality. This has resulted in an improvement in terms of image and customer satisfaction,
           as seen in the results of satisfaction surveys in which it is clear that the agency underwent
           a process of changes with positive results, placing the primary focus on clients.
       ‐   Implementation of regional laboratories: these laboratories are part of the Integrated
           System for Laboratory Management, which is currently composed of the Central
           Laboratory, which conducts analytical activities on Quality Control (drinking water and
           wastewater) and control of the critical inputs that OSE uses in its water purification
           processes; Water Plant Laboratories that carry out analytical activities for the operational
           control of the production sub-process; and 10 Regional Laboratories that carry out
           analytical activities for the operational control of the distribution sub-process. Regional
           Laboratories have made it possible to considerably reduce delivery times for analytical
           information on the quality of water supplied to the population and to increase
           understanding of water quality levels.
       ‐   Strengthening of environmental capacity: The project played an essential role in the
           process of strengthening and institutionalizing Environmental Management at OSE. The
           UGA has been strengthened in terms of its members and its activities. OSE has an
           Environmental Management Plan that is being executed with ALP2 support and will
           continue to be executed with the support of the new operation.
       ‐   The construction of new filters and purification units in Aguas Corrientes allowed a
           substantial improvement in several parameters (especially turbidity) of the quality of the
           water produced by the plant, as well as operating conditions (reduction in the use of
           coagulants in purification units and in water used to wash filters). This work also supports
           water purification in compliance with water quality standards.
       ‐   NRW Reduction Program: Although the initially stated targets were not met, in OSE as a
           whole there is an improvement in the indicators, from the viewpoint of percentage values
           and of indicators expressed in l/connection/day, reversing a previous trend by which they
           constantly dropped in annual terms. It is also worth noting that the execution of this
           program was an initial, inevitable step toward consolidating bases and making it possible
           to develop more advanced stages that require greater evolution from a technical
           standpoint.
       ‐   Expansion of sewerage networks in Minas, Colonia and Treinta y Tres: This project
           component fulfilled the planned objective of completing the execution of sewerage
           networks by demand, which had been generated and executed under the APL1 stage of
           the program.



                                                                                                     41
Efficiency
Although project costs were higher than expected, so was the scope of many of the components.
Higher costs were mainly in the drinking water component because:
        ‐    Civil works for the construction of new purification units in Aguas Corrientes: the higher
             costs were mainly due to the fact that the use of prestressed concrete structures from the
             old accelerators to build the new purification units was initially planned. An analysis was
             later conducted, which showed that it would be better to build new structures.
        ‐    Non-revenue water Reduction Program: this component had a higher cost than planned,
             but the scope of the works was also greater than initially expected (the plan was to
             replace 70 km of networks, but 210 km were replaced instead; 200,000 ½” meters were
             expected to be purchased, but 400,000 were purchased instead).
Although the total costs of the Institutional Renewal component did not vary substantially from what
was initially planned, some amounts were reallocated:
        ‐    The cost of the regional laboratories was higher than originally planned because the dollar
             cost of construction in Uruguay increased significantly during the period, in some cases
             commercial offices were built as well as laboratories, and in other cases the intention was
             to use existing structures but later on this was not possible.
        ‐    Regional warehouses and electromechanical workshops were not built, due to a change in
             OSE’s strategy; it decided to revise its logistical and asset management model. Therefore,
             it was decided that the construction of this infrastructure would be postponed until it
             could be decided whether, with the new models, it is still necessary.
        ‐    The costs of Environmental Management improvement activities implied lower costs
             because many of the activities were carried out without using project resources.
An ex-post financial and economic assessment of the project was conducted, using the same
methodology as that used in the PAD and with the current values of investments and the benefits
obtained. The results show that the project’s results were positive from a financial and economic
standpoint. The IRR obtained for the project as a whole are 23 percent in financial terms and 29
percent in economic terms.
The table below compares the actual values obtained with the project, and those that had been
estimated in the PAD. As one can see, the total net benefits are in financial terms of US$51 million
and the financial internal rate of return of 23 percent, which, although lower than that estimated in the
PAD, is a rate that shows significant benefits. The economic results of US$81 million and the IRR of
29 percent are similar to those estimated in the PAD and demonstrate the project’s significant impact
on the economy.
Justification for overall project rating:
OSE considers the overall project rating to be Satisfactory for the following reasons: (i) All of the
project’s development objectives were met in the time frame initially estimated; (ii) work was
conducted in all components, and all planned activities were substantially carried out; (iii) throughout
the life of the project, disbursements were above initial estimates; and (iv) fiduciary and procurement
performance was rated Satisfactory in all reviews

Section 4: Evaluation of the Risk of Not Maintaining Project Outcomes
It is not believed that there are any major risks for maintaining project outcomes. The different
components are analyzed below:
‐   The commercial-operational, financial-accounting and human resources systems are operational
    in OSE. They are using their own funds to continue maintaining the systems and improving their
    functions under an ongoing improvement process.
‐   Environmental Management will continue to be supported by the new operation with the World
    Bank: “OSE Sustainable and Efficient”
‐   Nine of the 10 regional laboratories are operational and the other (in San José) will begin
    operating before the middle of this year. In addition, as already stated, the laboratories are part of
    SIGLA, which, in order to carry out the next phase, has financing from the Corporación Andina
    de Fomento.
‐   The improvements made in the Aguas Corrientes plant are already being operated and
    maintained by OSE’s corresponding section.
‐   NRW Reduction was incorporated by the Board of Directors and senior management as a
    strategic issue within annual action plans, generating strong commitment for the sustainability
    and improvement of achievements. This program also continues to have the support of the new
    “OSE Sustainable and Efficient” project
‐   The sanitation works conducted are now being operated by OSE. In addition, financing for the
    execution of the National Plan for Sanitation Connections was included in a loan signed with the
    Corporación Andina de Fomento.

Section 5: Evaluation of the Bank and OSE
OSE during preparation and implementation
OSE’s Senior Management and Board of Directors assumed the commitment to support the program
and its development objectives throughout the project. This support was maintained even with
changes in authorities. This situation was a key element for allowing the project to be executed in the
originally planned time frame. The various sections of OSE that were involved also provided their
support during project execution. During the design phase, the Government provided its support to
the project, allowing the project to be signed and become eligible quickly.

Bank during preparation and implementation
The Bank, through the various mission members and consultants hired, advised and supported OSE
actively and efficiently during the project’s formulation, design, execution and evaluation phases.
The Bank provided technical assistance to OSE in various aspects during the various phases: in the
design and implementation of the system of indicators, in the preparation and execution of the
Environmental Management Plan, in matters related to the reduction of NRW, and in the design and
implementation of the assessment of the impact of connection to sewerage networks on the
population’s health.
The support received made it possible to accelerate training processes and improvement of the
technical design of various aspects of the project, as well as to contribute to achieving the cultural
                                                                                                   43
change needed for the implementation of several programs (RANC, environmental, etc.). OSE staff
participated in various courses or seminars organized by the Bank: procurement, project financial
planning, and disbursements.
Section 6: Lessons learned
‐   Support from senior management and the Board of Directors: This aspect was essential during
    project design and execution, especially in management improvement components. It is
    understood that this support was due to the fact that the project’s objectives were in line with the
    Administration’s strategic objectives and that these were maintained during project execution.
‐   Training and dissemination of programs: To ensure the success of the implementation and
    sustainability of new programs in the Administration, in addition to technological aspects,
    emphasis on staff training and the dissemination of objectives and outcomes is essential. These
    efforts facilitate cultural change in the company and the involvement of its staff in the projects.
    This is a key element for their success.
‐   Project design using programs: Project design using a program format provides continuity over
    time and ensures the sustainability of the outcomes achieved.
‐   DMC strategy of the RANC program: The RANC experience in Artigas has demonstrated that
    the sectorization of systems to reduce pressure and combat leaks, using the DMC strategy, can be
    very effective. DMCs offer possibilities for integrating commercial, operational and socio-
    environmental efforts, secure monitoring of the impacts of these efforts, and elimination of
    subjectivity by operators, providing a favorable environment for the growth of a culture of
    metering and improvement of knowledge about the system; reduction in the time it takes to know
    about leaks; and allowing careful control of pressure. They also allow the use of modern tools to
    evaluate losses and proper modulation for the implementation of actions, thus avoiding
    scattering.
‐   Simultaneous implementation of more than one management improvement program that impacts
    the same area: There should be no overlapping in the implementation of more than one large-
    scale management improvement project involving common resources. The efforts made by
    commercial-operational sectors to implement the new commercial-operational system caused a
    delay in the implementation of the RANC program.
‐   Importance of a good design of the project monitoring system and determination of the baseline:
    During the design phase, it is important to be especially carefully in selecting the monitoring
    indicators of the project’s various components, so that they reflect expected results in the best
    possible manner. Moreover, when the indicators’ targets are defined, consideration should be
    given to individual negative impacts that may occur at the start of the implementation of new
    management systems. Special care should also be taken in determining the baseline in order to
    ensure that it reflects the reality at that moment, so that the indicators are comparable once the
    new systems are implemented.
‐   Starting procurement processes prior to loan signing: OSE had already begun the procurement
    processes for several works, goods and consultancies before the loan agreement was signed.
    This made it possible to accelerate the initial execution of the project, and contributed to the fact
    that disbursements have been greater than expected during the life of the project and that the
    project has been executed during the originally planned time frame.
                                                                                                      44

     has increased from 23% to 75% in terms of adopting best practices with the implementation of the Vector Program, especially with activities for the
     implementation of the SGC system, improvement in the Call Center, modification and construction of local offices, as well as the restructuring of organizational
     procedures and changes
