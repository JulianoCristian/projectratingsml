expand Ethiopia's road network to reduce poverty and\n            increase employment through promoting  growth and access in\n            a socially and environmentally sustainable manner.  The\n            major component is the rehabilitation and upgrading of 412.9\n            km of federal roads.  Roads affected by this are:\n            Nekempt-Mekenajo; Nazareth-Assela; Woreta-Gob Gob; and\n            AdiAbun-AdiPrat roads.  The second component will construct\n            the Dera - Magna section of the Dera-Mechara road in the\n            Oromiya region.  The construction supervision component will\n            provide consultancy services for the supervision of the\n            civil works.  The rural travel and transport component will\n            support the implementation of the Ethiopia Rural Travel and\n            Transport Program (ERTTP).  The HIV/AIDS control and\n            prevention component focuses on the efforts in the road\n            sector to mitigate the spread of HIV/AIDS and the Ethiopian\n            Road Authority in the areas of project planning and\n            implementation.  The road financing study and technical\n            auditing component will provide support to the Office of the\n            Road Fund Administration. The preparatory activities\n            component will provide consultancy services and support to\n            the Addis Ababa City Government in preparation of an urban\n            transport strategy and policy document and a prioritized\n            pilot project."}, "docdt": "2003-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
