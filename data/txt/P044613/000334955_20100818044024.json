Sector\n            Development Program Project for Ethiopia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some key lessons learned from the project\n            include: a number of key environmental actions need to occur\n            toward the end of the construction cycle, such as restoring\n            parts of construction sites, borrow pits, and quarries.\n            Although provisions for environmental mitigation were made\n            in bills of quantities, further action can help ensure\n            contractors do not renege on their contractual obligations,\n            such as requiring up-front environmental performance bonds,\n            or increasing retention amounts and creating specific\n            set-asides for end-of-contract payment upon supervisor\n            certification of environmental compliance. Training and\n            capacity building are not as effective as they could be, as\n            long as civil service reform is not on the agenda. Inability\n            to retain staff results in high staff turnover; as a result,\n            investments in human capital do not have much longevity,\n            since junior staff tends to move on to other opportunities\n            elsewhere after being trained. Road asset management\n            requires needs-based maintenance programming. To effectively\n            address constraints to accessibility and unmet transport\n            needs, the government of Ethiopia (GOE) and its donor\n            partners will need to look beyond the provision and\n            maintenance of road infrastructure, toward a more holistic\n            approach to the sector, including services."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
