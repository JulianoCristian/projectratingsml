1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Following serious decline and deterioration of the road network during the period of
Communist Party rule, which ended in 1992, the Government of Ethiopia (GOE), in concert with
the Donor community, including the World Bank, developed its Road Sector Development
Program (RSDP), as an initially 10-year program of road rehabilitation in two phases.
Implemented in 1997, this program was subsequently extended, such that the fourth phase of the
program will continue until 2015. An early example of donor harmonization, RSDP from the
beginning included arrangements to coordinate the actions of various donors, including the
International Development Association (IDA), the European Commission, the African
Development Bank, OPEC Fund, the Nordic Development Fund, and various bi-lateral aid
agencies toward a set of mutually agreed, Government-driven objectives. Support from
development partners, including the Bank, strengthened Ethiopia Road Authority (ERA)
management, for example, with TA support and reporting systems for monitoring program
performance. These arrangements later remained with the ERA management with advisory
support from its Board during program implementation.

2.      IDA's support for Phase I of the Government's RSDP (RSDP I) took the form of a
Specific Investment Loan (SIL) known as the Road Sector Development Program Support
Project (RSDPSP-Credit 3032-ET), providing a credit of US$309.2 million between 1998 and
2005. This credit funded the rehabilitation and upgrading of four major roads totaling 1,380
kilometers, and also supported capacity building to the ERA. Collectively, with funding from
the GOE, IDA, and other donors, RSDP I facilitated the rehabilitation or upgrading of over 1,500
kilometers of trunk roads, and the construction or upgrading of over 800 kilometers of link roads
between July 1997 and June 2002. As a result, the proportion of asphalt, gravel, and rural roads
in good condition had increased from 17 to 35 percent, 25 to 30 percent, and 21 to 28 percent,
respectively. Average road density by land area had increased from 24 to 30 kilometers per 1000
km2, and the average distance to an all weather road had declined from 21 to 17 kilometers.

3.     Phase II of the RSDP (RSDP II) was designed to build on the achievements of RSDP I,
continuing and enhancing the pace of road network rehabilitation, while at the same time placing
more emphasis on institutional development, capacity building, and tying the results to larger
developmental goals and poverty reduction, through reference to the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). It emphasized improved project and results monitoring, strengthened, and in
some cases restructured, government institutions, further development of domestic construction
capacity, and better environmental and social management of road construction projects. About
40 percent of the US$1.5 billion investment program would be funded by the GOE, and the
remainder financed from the donor community, including roughly 25 percent from IDA.

4.      As a long-range program with multiple phases and clearly defined interim and long-range
targets, the Government's RSDP was a logical candidate for an Adaptable Program approach as a




                                               1
means of IDA support.8 The follow-on credit to the RSDPSP, therefore, was conceived as an
Adaptable Program Loan (APL), in three phases, the first stage of which (APL1) was designed
as a US$219.27 million credit. However, during project preparation, a grant envelope for
Ethiopia became available, with a total amount allocated to the transport sector of US$126.80
million. The program was therefore redesigned as a four-stage APL program, whereby the
components of the original APL1 were split into APL1 and APL2.

1.2 Original Program and Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

Programmatic Objectives
5.      The primary objective of the APL program as articulated in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) for the APL1 is to restore and expand Ethiopia's road network to reduce
poverty and increase employment through promoting growth and access in a socially and
environmentally sustainable manner. This objective has been refined through succeeding stages
of the APL program; the programmatic objective is articulated in the PAD for the most recent
and final stage (APL4) as follows: support the Government's RSDP9, and support the GOE in
increasing the efficiency of the road sector through sector reform.

Project (Stage) Objectives
6.     The Project Development Objectives (PDO) for the APL1 stage as reflected in the Grant
Agreement are to assist the Recipient in increasing its road transport infrastructure and
improving the reliability thereof, strengthening the capacity for road construction, management
and maintenance and enhancing the financing program in relation thereto in order to ensure
sustainability, and creating conditions conducive to private sector participation in the road
transport sector.
7.       The PDO for the APL1 stage as reflected in the PAD Annex 1 were as follows:
     (i)      Construct, rehabilitate, upgrade and preserve the Federal road network
     (ii)     Improve mobilization and use of resources for road maintenance
     (iii)    Develop capacity in the private sector
     (iv)     Strengthen ERA reform program

8.     These latter objectives as articulated in the PAD have the characteristics more of
intermediate objectives as understood in current, results-oriented practice, than of Project




8
  Indeed, the IDA RSDPSP had been conceived as the first of a phased participation in a Sector
Investment Program. At the time of appraisal of that project, however, the World Bank Board of
Directors had not yet approved the Adaptable Program Loan instrument, so its use was deferred
to the follow-on operation.
9
 RSDP's primary objective was to restore and expand Ethiopia's road network to reduce poverty
and increase employment by promoting growth and access in a socially and environmentally
sustainable manner.


                                                2
Development Objectives per se. There are minor inconsistencies between the Annex 1
articulation of the PDOs, and that presented in the main body of the PAD (Section A.2.2).
Key indicators

9.      There are substantial inconsistencies in the labeling and phrasing of the different
indicators among the PAD main text (section A.3), the logical framework table in Annex 1 of the
PAD, and Schedule 3 of the Project Agreement. This latter identifies the following as
programmatic indicators:
       Reduction in freight and passenger tariff.
       Reduction in travel time.
       Reduction in vehicle operating costs.
       Number and value of contracts awarded to domestic contractors
       Number of people employed (by gender) in road works.
       Total annual payments made to domestic contractors.
       Ratio of Road Fund annual collection against total annual maintenance needs.
       Maintenance expenditure as percentage of needs of maintenance network.

10.   However, these are identified as project (i.e. stage)-level indicators in the logical
framework table in Annex 1, with the following indicators included as well:
       ERA DMOs as cost centers by January 1, 2004
       ERA DMOs as profit centers by July 2005
       ERA DMOs as commercial center by July 2006

11.    Section A.3 of the main body of the PAD identifies "key output" indicators as the
following:
       Increase proportion of asphalt roads in good condition from 35 percent in 2002 to 57
       percent in 2007; of gravel roads from 30 percent to 42 percent; and of rural roads from 28
       percent to 40 percent.
       Increase road density from 30 km / 1000 sq. km in 2002 to 35 km / 1000 sq. km. in 2007.
       Decrease average distance to all weather roads from 17 km in 2002 to 14 km in 2007.
       Ratio of maintenance expenditure (routine and periodic) to total requirements of the
       maintainable network increased from about 60 percent in 2002 to more than 90 percent in
       2007.
       Number of people employed in road works in project areas (disaggregated by gender)
       Share of administrative costs to total expenditures

12.     For the purpose of this evaluation, this Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
interprets those indicators listed in the logical framework table of Annex 1 of the PAD (page 54)
as the key outcome indicators for the project stage. All other indicators are treated as
programmatic indicators. Under the Bank's standard PAD template at the time, no indicator
monitoring plan was provided, and there were no objective targets provided for any of the stage-
level outcome indicators, except the DMO-specific indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

13.    The PDO / indicators were not formally revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.    The enumerated target populations included: road users (including pedestrians,
IMTs/NMVs users and non-transport structure / services beneficiaries), who would benefit
through improvement in road surfaces, availability of all-weather roads and road safety;
producers and consumers, through improved access to municipal and/or other basic social
services, and in the transport of goods to the local markets and environmental protection;
domestic construction industry, through enhanced opportunities to participate in business
opportunities; road agencies, through improved management practices; and finance ministry,
through greater efficiency in the use of resources and reduced demands placed on the national
budget for road development and maintenance.

1.6 Revised Components

16.     No components were formally revised. However, about 20 kilometers of the federal link
road from Dera to Magna were removed from the project because engineering conditions would
have required a substantial increase in time and resources to complete this section. Consequently,
physical output for Component 2 was reduced from about 119 kilometers to 99 as planned
originally.

1.7 Other significant changes

17.     The project was extended by six months, from June 30, 2009 to December 31, 2009, in
order to facilitate full disbursement owing to a number of minor procurement-related and design-
change delays. Resources associated with the IDA grant increased from US$126.8 million at the
time of appraisal to US$142.6 by project close, because of appreciation of the dollar against the
SDR.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

       2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.     Sufficiency of Background Analysis. The IDA grant was based on analysis performed for
the development of the RSDP Phase II program in general; the form it took and the components
it funded came out of this larger, programmatic analysis carried out jointly by the GOE and the
development community, including the Bank.

19.     Project Design. APL1's design mirrored the structure of the parent RSDP II program as a
whole. In keeping with ERA practice, project components were distinguished from one another
based primarily on the types of services being procured (e.g. works v. consultancy), the types of
roads being addressed (e.g. trunk v. link road), and/or the nature of the improvements (e.g. new
road v. upgrading existing road). Thus, Component 1 consisted of rehabilitation and upgrading
of trunk roads, Component 2 of construction of a new link road, Component 3 of supervision,
and so on. While this design helped to make the relationship of the APL1 to the Government's
RSDP II more transparent, it also rendered the relationship between the IDA-funded components
and their intended objectives more difficult to discern, thus complicating assessment of the
project's success. This is discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.

20.   Government Commitment. The project was designed to support the Road Sector
Development Program, to which the government was and remains fully committed.

21.     Assessment of Risks. The PAD identified most of the important risks to the main project
development objective but in some cases did not characterize or categorize them accurately. As
a result, a number of the proposed mitigation measures proved to be optimistic. For example,
delays in contract implementation were characterized as a "negligible" risk, but in fact were
fairly prevalent. Similarly, risk of availability of human resources in implementing agencies was
characterized as moderate, but opportunities for carrying out the proposed mitigation measures ­
contracting out for additional capacity ­ in practice were limited by the fact that much of the
human resource deficit occurred at the mid-level management level.

                                                5
2.2 Implementation

22.     Implementation processes. Implementation of the project was generally satisfactory.
Project staff in ERA was diligent, if not always fully effective, in pursuing timely execution of
the civil works and other components. Where there were procurement-related delays or
contractors fell behind in mobilizing resources and making progress, ERA generally responded
appropriately, though there were some notable lapses in supervision quality and timeliness, as
was the case, for example, with the supervision of the Nekempt-Mekanajo works. Similarly, the
Bank team generally responded in a professional and timely manner to requests for No Objection
and other required feedback. A midterm review was carried out in May 2006 and made no
recommendations on structural changes to the project.

23.     The contracting of the Wereda-Gob Gob section, intended to help develop the capacity of
the Domestic Construction Industry (DCI), proved successful following a difficult start. The
roughly 100 kilometer section had been separated into six lots to allow as many domestic
contractors as possible to participate in the program. However, the lot sizes proved to be too
small, and attracted few bidders; the road length needed to be divided into two lots, in order to
attract bidders. 10 In addition, because of increased traffic volumes, road surface treatment
needed to be redesigned. In the end, the contractors performed quite well, but these delays
meant that the works were unfinished by project close, and needed to be finished using GOE's
own funds.

24.      Aspects of the project that could have been improved were:
         In-town road sections were not always well designed and/or well executed, requiring
         subsequent work to fix some of the problems (see Annex 2);
         Compliance with environmental monitoring plans ­ particularly restoration of borrow pits
         ­ was inconsistent;
         One International Competitive Bidding (ICB) civil works contract in particular was
         problematic, both in terms of pace and quality. The problem was exacerbated by poor
         performance of the Supervising Engineer; and
         While construction contracts for firms selected under ICB specified the number and kinds
         of expatriates that could be used on the contract, monitoring and enforcement of those
         provisions proved to be insufficient. Some ICB contractors employed skilled labor from
         their home countries. Although local employment may have been less than anticipated,
         some local employment, and the extent of use of skilled labor imported from home
         countries, was not readily reported under the ongoing monitoring and evaluation
         arrangements using data from the works progress reports. The question of employment
         generation and use of local labor resources on works contracts perhaps warrants more
         detailed study.


10
   The division into six lots had been derived from a country procurement assessment for domestic contractors that
limited contract size to $5 million. The Bank agreed to repackage the lots on an exceptional basis, with special
contractual provisions including guarantee requirements, in order to allow larger-sized domestic contractors to
participate in the bidding.


                                                         6
           Anecdotal evidence suggested that a number of the ICB contractors were using more
           skilled labor imported from their home countries than was needed or permitted under the
           contract. This probably resulted in less local employment generation than had been
           anticipated in the PAD, particularly for skilled laborers, since many positions that
           otherwise would have gone to locals were instead occupied by expatriates.
25.    These problems may be symptoms of a more deep-rooted challenge for ERA; the long-
standing difficulty in recruiting and retaining experienced mid-level staff ­ that is, staff with
enough experience to know how to address these challenges.

26.    Civil works cost control. Costs of the civil works components (Components 1 and 2)
were estimated at appraisal at about US$132 million (US$158 million including contingencies).
The ICB contracts were awarded between August 2004 and January 2005 with works period of
3.5 years, and with formal extension of time, were substantially completed between December
2008 and December 2009. Final estimated cost was about US$176 million, an increase of about
11 percent over appraisal estimates. This trend is notably low considering the high inflation rate
experienced in the past two to three years and is much lower than the cost-increase trend
observed on the road projects under APL2, which was contracted between July 2006 and July
2007 and for which close to a doubling of costs was observed.

27.      ERTTP implementation. The ERTTP component, particularly the development of the
Wereda Infrastructure Development Plans (WIDP), also posed a substantial implementation
challenge to the implementing agency, because of its ambitious size and scope. The 100 WIDPs
intended to be financed in APL1 were reduced to 6411, but 40 more were then financed under
APL2. Additionally, other donors also financed some of these plans. The WIDPs involved the
creation of two substantial reports ­ an information analysis report, and the development plan
itself.12 Since each of these reports tended to be between 200 and 300 pages long, the WIDP
sub-component of the ERTTP produced around 75,000 pages of text for review. Dedicated and
committed staff in ERA could not fully cope with the review. Provision for additional consulting
services to enhance ERA's capacity to review all the reports was not made in a timely manner,
and staff of the Rural Roads Coordinator's office was called to support other rural roads
implementation activities.

         2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

28.     M&E Design. Tracking the performance of the RSDP as a whole has been a clear
priority of the government from early on, and a robust program of indicators was designed and
funded from the outset. Under RSDP phase II, in technical collaboration with the Bank, an
additional set of indicators were added to track the program's impacts on poverty and social
development, linked to the MDGs. This committed approach to tracking both efficiency and
effectiveness indicators earned the RSDP accolades.


11
     As a result of higher costs for services than anticipated, even though mostly local firms were used.

12
     Each of these reports, in turn, would involve production of a draft and final version.


                                                             7
29.     The M&E framework put in place for the APL project stage, however, presented
challenges. The approach agreed upon by the Government and donors from the outset of the
RSDP was a single, unified indicators framework for both the parent program (RSDP) and
individual donor financing. Thus, projects such as the APL1 would adopt the parent RSDP's
indicators. By definition, such an approach meant that gleaning the relative contribution of the
IDA-financed project activities to the overall RSDP effort (with the exception of easily
quantifiable physical outputs) would be difficult. This difficulty was exacerbated by both the
non-results-oriented structure of the project components, as discussed in Section 2.1 and by the
inconsistent use and specification of intended project indicators across different parts of the
project documentation, as discussed in section 1.2.

30.     A Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) in mid-2003 had rated this project's strategic
relevance and approach as highly satisfactory. Of note were the highly satisfactory ratings of the
consistency of project design and the clarity and realism of the project's development objectives.
In the current environment, however, it is not clear that a QEA assessment of this project would
garner the same high rating, for a number of reasons. First, subsequent experience with APLs
has highlighted the need to differentiate indicators appropriate to different levels of
programmatic design and implementation. Second, a shift in orientation within the Bank toward
monitoring for results in operations has reinforced the need to account for results at all levels of
an operation. While donor harmonization and country ownership in design and implementation
remain important, the need to show operational results has emerged as a critical priority.

31.     M&E implementation. Implementation of the M&E framework was effective and carried
out with due diligence by the implementing agency. The methodologies applied to the gathering
of data for construction of the required indicators were done so consistently throughout the life
of the project, and were in line with best-practice.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     Environment. The project was classified as Category A, requiring a full environmental
assessment; OP 4.01, OP 4.12 and OPN 11.03 were triggered. Performance on environmental
management during project implementation can best be described as a strong improvement over
past practice, but still somewhat inconsistent. While Environmental Management Plans (EMPs)
prepared for each of the contracts awarded under the APL1 were consistent with the
Environmental and Social Management Framework which was developed for the project as a
whole, and were linked contractually to the performance of the contractors, compliance to those
plans has not been consistently enforced. Contractors were slow to formulate work plans to
implement the EMPs, and, initially at least, slow to appreciate the need for and importance of
compliance. Similarly, ERA seems to have been inconsistent in enforcement of those plans.
While compliance generally seems to have improved throughout the implementation period,
some of the contractors toward the end of their contract periods reported difficulties in restoring
borrow-pits and quarry sites.

33.    Social protection. Procedurally, the project implementation has complied with Bank
policy and expectations regarding resettlement and HIV-AIDS prevention and control.

                                                 8
Resettlement Action Plans were prepared and implemented in a timely manner (though there
were some early problems with the reporting on that implementation), compensation was paid in
a timely manner and in line with the RAPs, and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) / HIV-AIDS
prevention and awareness plans were developed and implemented along the project routes and
construction sites.

34.    Substantively, however, a consistently weak point in the social protection performance of
the project was the lack of attention to the needs of town dwellers in the towns and villages
through which the roads passed, as alluded to earlier and discussed in more detail in Annex 2. In
a number of instances, the Bank supervision team noted shortcomings related to pedestrian safety,
safeguarding access of adjacent properties, neighborhood continuity, and quality of workmanship
in urban road amenities that the contractors may have considered ancillary (such as drain covers).

35.     This weakness appears to be a systemic problem, a function of institutional and financial
constraints on ERA, as well as ambiguity in the allocation of financial responsibilities between
ERA and the various towns through which its roads pass. While there is clear delineation of
roles and jurisdictions, the sources of finance for ancillary urban treatment of roads, which are
necessary during and after major works, are not clear. This problem has emerged in a number of
different contexts, within the various stages of the APL and RSDP program as a whole. The
contractor and consultant's performance monitoring system being implemented under APL3 may
help alleviate aspects of this problem, but there is room to address the problem more
systematically.

36.     Financial Management. Financial management for the project has generally performed
well. Bank-acceptable procedures were consistently followed, and reflect the fruits of past
capacity-improvement efforts. Toward the end of the project, some audit reports were late, and
there are some small difficulties in wrapping up Accounts Receivable / Accounts Payable, and in
disposing of obsolete equipment for some of the contractors, but the overall good performance of
financial management in the project is noteworthy in the larger context.

37.     Disbursement. The estimated project cost at appraisal had been US$186.44 million, of
which US$126.8 million (SDR 93 million) from IDA. The actual project cost totaled US$195.3
million, of which US$142.3 million was from IDA, reflecting historical exchange rates of the
SDR. Disbursements throughout the project generally lagged on average by about 16 percent
behind. This persistent lag is associated, initially, with the lengthy customs clearance process,
and subsequently, with slow mobilization on the part of a number of the contractors in the
project. Nevertheless, the disbursement performance is rather good compared to other sectors.

38.     Procurement. Concerted focus on ERA's procurement capacity during the Bank's
RSDPSP and other previous projects has resulted in the development of a strong procurement
unit within ERA. As a result, there were no major problems with procurement per se during the
project. Some delays occurred in the National Competitive Bidding (NCB) works procurement,
with a large number of small lots procured. The Wereda-Gob Gob section needed to be re-
tendered, but the resulting delay would likely have been substantially longer were it not for the
strength of the procurement unit.



                                                9
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.    APL1 contributed to a number of initiatives in the RSDP that remain ongoing in further
phases of the program.
       Further road network development. All three of the follow-on stages provide funding for
       road upgrading, and two provide funding for new links. For the most part, this financing
       extends and in some cases completes the links invested under APL1.
       Further development of ERTTP. APL1 funded the development of 64 WIDPs. APL2
       provided further support to the ERTTP in the form of funding for 40 additional WIDPs,
       and institutional support to ERA to enable it to facilitate implementation of the WIDPs.
       Further support to the ERTTP in stages 3 and 4 were not included, however, because of
       the backlog within ERA associated with management of the already-submitted WIDP
       reports. The original program phasing of the APL anticipated implementation of at least
       some of the WIDP's developed; DFID-financed implementation of eight pilot WIDPs has
       yielded encouraging results. However, priorities for later APL stages did not include
       implementation of these programs, and current expectation is that these plans will be
       implemented under a successor-program to the ERTTP.
       Migration of ERTTP-oriented capacity-building products to new URRAP. The
       Government is pursuing a Universal Rural Road Access Program (URRAP) into which
       the ERTTP is being subsumed. The details of the URRAP have not yet been announced,
       nor shared with the Bank group, but GOE officials have indicated to the Bank that it will
       be based substantially on lessons learned under the ERTTP program supported by the
       Bank in the RSDPSP, and the RSDP APL1 and APL2 projects.
       Further institutional support to ERA. All three follow-on stages include important
       institution- and capacity-building components that build on the work of APL1, taking
       advantage of the overlapping implementation design. For example, APL2 further
       developed ERA's capacity in specific core functions. APL3 focused on enhancing ERA's
       ability to monitor and control quality and costs of contractors, as well as supporting
       ongoing efforts to commercialize the DMOs. Finally, APL4 provided resources to help
       ERA expand its capacities and core mandate to also assist the regions and possibly lower
       levels of government in the future. This includes the establishment of a Highway
       Engineering Research Center.
       Road network planning and management. APL4 builds on some of the initiatives begun
       under APL1 to improve the way roads are planned and financed in Ethiopia. This stage
       is funding an analysis of the results of the TPOs, and the implications for future planning.
       It is also updating the 2005 road financing study in the context of a greatly expanded
       network.
       Support to Addis Ababa on urban transport and traffic management. APL3 provides
       additional funding to the Addis Ababa transport branch, initially intended to support
       implementation of the urban transport strategy developed under APL1. Because of
       institutional and political challenges following the national and municipal elections of
       2005, however, this activity was reoriented to support general traffic management needs
       in the city.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

40.     With reference to longer-term outcomes envisioned in the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), dated April 2, 2008, and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (the Plan for Accelerated and
Sustained Development to End Poverty or PASDEP), from September 2006, the project's
objectives are relevant. At least three of the four core strategic objectives of the above-
referenced CAS have been addressed in some way by this project: (i) fostering economic growth,
(ii) improving access to and quality of basic service delivery, and (iii) reducing Ethiopia's
vulnerability. Expansion of the road network certainly helps to foster economic growth in a
myriad of ways, enables the potential for physical access to a wide array of basic services, and
reduces vulnerability by allowing for more rapid movement of people and goods. Enhancing
capacity for road network expansion and maintenance also helps ensure the sustainability of such
benefits for the long term. Furthermore, the PASDEP outlines, among other key approaches to
poverty reduction, the need for geographically differentiated strategies, and the strengthening of
urban-rural linkages. A strengthened trunk road network ­ and enhanced capacity for the future
to deliver further strengthening of the road network ­ is fundamental to these approaches.

41.     The emphasis in the CAS on improved access and in the PASDEP on geographical
differentiation and interconnection, however, requires further work specifically on ensuring
adequacy of transport service supply. Indeed, some of the indicators collected under the RSDPII
/ APL1 monitoring and evaluation framework suggest that transport prices, in real terms, have
not come down in proportion with road quality improvements, suggesting the need for further
study.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42.    Effectiveness of achieving this overall PDO is rated as satisfactory. This rating is based
on the observed improvement in the pace of conversion of roads into the "good" category under
the RSDP II period, compared with RSDP I, and project's effectiveness in achieving the
individual enumerated objectives, discussed below.

43.      Objective 1. Construct, rehabilitate, upgrade and preserve the priority federal road
network. APL 1 was responsible for rehabilitation, substantial upgrading and construction of
approximately 512 kilometers of the Federal road network. The road works components
(Components 1, 2, and 3 of the project) were clearly a priority of both the Government and the
Bank supervision team, based on a review of the supervision documents, including ISRs and
Aide Memoires. All four of the ICB contracts were completed by the close of the project,
though defect-liability period for one ­ Adigrat-Adi Abun ­ continued beyond the close of the
project. The two NCB contracts for the Wereta ­ Gob Gob road were also substantially delayed,
such that completion will occur after the Grant closing date. The reasons for the delay included:
(i) initial procurement delay associated with changes in contract sizes to facilitate procurement in
a manner agreeable to the Bank, (ii) lack of experience of the local contractors, (iii) adverse

                                                11
weather in recent years, (iv) variation orders arising from increased works volume, (v) surface
design change due to substantial traffic increase than initially forecasted, and (vi) the need to
adjust alignment in response to recently encountered landslides on one of the road contracts.

44.     Looking at the larger programmatic indicators, by the close of the project, road density
went from 30.8 to 42.6 kilometers per 1000 sq. km. (end-of-project target: 35). The proportion
of Federal roads rated Good were as follows: Asphalt roads, 70 percent, Gravel roads, 54 percent,
rural roads, 50 percent (end-of-project target: 57 percent, 42 percent, and 40 percent
respectively). Average distance to all weather roads was 11.8 km (end-of-project target: 14 km).
Based on these indicators and overall performance over the life of the project, progress toward
this objective is rated as satisfactory.

45.     Objective 2. Improve mobilization and use of resources for road maintenance and
strengthen the Office of the Road Fund. The main indicators specified in the PAD to track this
objective were the ratio of the road fund annual collection and annual maintenance expenditure
to annual maintenance needs. However, only the numerators of these indicators (annual road
fund revenues and annual maintenance expenditure) are available. What can be calculated,
however, is the ratio of expenditure to available revenues in any given year (a measure of
resource use if it is assumed the funds are spent productively), and the ratio of annual growth of
maintenance expenditures to annual growth in roads classified in good condition (which shows
whether there is at least parity between changes in need and changes in resource mobilization).
These indicators show that expenditures on road maintenance have grown from 72 percent of
available resources in 2003 to 82 percent in 2009, suggesting that resource use is improving.
The ratio of annual growth in maintenance expenditures to annual growth in the network needing
to be maintained (that is, roads in good condition) between 1997 and 2003 was 0.83; while
between 2003 and 2009 was 1.58. This suggests that resources are being better mobilized and
used with respect to need in the RSDP II period than they were during the RSDP I period.

46.     These indicators point toward progress in the better mobilization and use of resources for
road maintenance. What cannot be determined from them, however, is the extent to which IDA-
financed activities contributed to this result. Project activities carried out under APL1 seem to
have had ambiguous impact on the source and use of resources for road maintenance, and on the
Office of the Road Fund itself. For example, project Component 6 included a study on road
finance and some technical audits on the functioning of the Office of the Road Fund (ORF). The
road finance study was completed in 2005, but its forecasts were questionable, and its modest
recommendations were not implemented. The audits (twice completed, and one ongoing as of
this writing) found technical weaknesses in the capacity of the ORF to follow-up on the use of its
funds, and raised questions about the kinds of activities that ERA in particular was funding with
ORF revenues. Nevertheless, the audits so far seem to have had little impact in practice.
Notwithstanding these ambiguities, progress toward this objective is rated as satisfactory.

47.    Objective 3. Develop capacity in the private sector (i.e. Domestic Construction Industry).
Civil works on the Wereta ­ Gob Gob link under project component 1 was reserved for NCB, in
order to strengthen the capacity of the DCI. Originally divided into six lots, the link was
eventually divided into two, which attracted the larger firms and proved to be more viable for the
firms involved. These firms were able to deliver their output while containing cost escalation
more successfully than their ICB counterparts under APL1. Despite some problems and delays

                                               12
associated with the contracts, the NCB sub-component showed that the domestic industry can
successfully compete for and deliver road projects in the context of an IDA credit or grant.

48.    There is also some evidence suggesting that the DCI is getting stronger. The value of
construction contracts awarded annually to domestic contractors has increased, from ETB 569.1
million to ETB 2,776.1 million during the implementation period. Also, the average price per
contract awarded to domestic contractors grew substantially - which was ETB89 million in 2002,
ETB203 million in 2004, and ETB619 in 2009. Figures provided by ERA's Consultant tracking
RSDP indicators also show that active contract value held by domestic contractors rose from 5.1
percent of all contracts in 1999 to 17.6 percent in 2009 (after peaking at about 58 percent in
2007/8). More significantly, the proportion of total road disbursements made to domestic
contractors increased from 4.7 percent in 1998 to 31.5 percent in 2009. At the same time, the
share of disbursements to foreign contractors decreased by 5.1 percent, and those to force
account operations by 21.7 percent, over the same period. Finally, the range of works
capabilities of domestic contractors has also increased, as demonstrated by the redesign of the
Wereta­Gob works to include asphalt concrete. Because of this evidence, and successful ­ if
somewhat delayed ­ implementation of the NCB sub-component of Component 1, progress
toward this objective is rated satisfactory.

49.      Objective 4. Strengthen ERA reform program. This outcome objective was addressed in
APL1 primarily through Project Component 5, particularly Technical Assistance on project
planning, and was also reinforced through a number of activities undertaken in other APL stages,
and support from other donors such as the AfDB. With regard to the APL1-funded activities, the
client's assessment of this activity was extremely positive (see Annexes 2 and 7), suggesting that
it likely had a positive impact on staff performance. However, the only formal indicators
specified in the original monitoring and indicators framework related to the accomplishment of
milestones in the structural changes in ERA service delivery. Of the three, the milestone for
transformation of the DMOs into cost centers was met.

50.     Nevertheless, there are some other indicators available in the parent RSDP's general
monitoring framework (not incorporated into the APL1 M&E framework) that show that ERA's
performance has been improving. Evidence suggests, for example, some improvement in
contract processing and service delivery. Contractor invoice approvals and payments have
become more efficient, with a reduction in the ratio of actual invoice approvals to contract-
specified invoice approvals of 0.61 in 1997 to 0.23 in 2008, and in the ratio of actual payment
time to contract-specified payment time of 0.85 in 1997 to 0.08 in 2008. Indicators of ratios of
approval and payment to a benchmark for consultants also show substantial improvement during
this period. Similarly ­ though less convincingly ­ data suggest some improvement in average
delivery time of contract and civil works milestones against contractual benchmarks, as shown in
Table 1.

51.     Notwithstanding these improvements however, the reform program has had some
challenges. Staff turnover and difficulties in retention have meant that capacity building within
ERA has not been as sustainable in the long-term as had been anticipated. ERA transformed the
DMOs into cost centers, but subsequently prioritized other reform measures, so that
transformation into profit or commercial centers has not met anticipated milestones. Finally, a
concerted effort to develop a coherent and coordinated Federal / regional resource allocation
methodology or process has not borne fruit. So while some trends are encouraging, others are
not, and success at reaching the formally identified targets for the project cannot be reported.
For these reasons, overall progress toward this objective is rated as moderately satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

52.    Efficiency is rated as satisfactory. The project's civil works, with the notable exception
of Adi Abun-Adigrat, performed more or less as expected (notwithstanding some cost increases),
and in the case of Wereta-Gob Gob, created more economic value than had been anticipated.
While project costs escalated more than had been anticipated in the sensitivity analysis of the ex
ante economic analysis (20 percent) for all projects except Nekempte-Mekanajo, traffic also
grew faster than had been anticipated (again, with the exception of Adi Abun-Adigrat). However,
even this latter project meets the threshold for cost-of-capital (EIRR of 18.6).

53.     The project's non-civil works components' expenditures were in line with those
anticipated at appraisal, and these investments yielded the outputs that were anticipated.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

54.     The project contributed substantially to the achievement of the implicit overall
development objective, which was to improve domestic capacity to deliver and maintain quality
road infrastructure in the face of constraints, and it did so at a reasonable cost overall. This
implicit objective is important for facilitating many of the goals of the CAS and the PASDEP,
but had the project taken a more holistic approach to road transport (that is, focusing on
infrastructure and services) it may have done more than just facilitate, but also improve the
chances for attainment of the CAS goals.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(i) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

55.      Provision of roads is conventionally seen as a key enabler for poverty reduction. Roads
facilitate access to services, which help alleviate poverty in both the short and long runs, such as
medical services, markets for surplus household products, off-farm employment activities,
agricultural and small industrial support services, and schools. Prior to the APL, the magnitude
of this impact, however, was generally assessed based on anecdotal evidence or not at all. To
allow for more rigorous and quantitative assessment of the impact of road development on
poverty alleviation, the project established a Transport Poverty Observatory, whose role was to
monitor the poverty alleviation impacts of road project investments in areas of influence of
RSDP-supported projects, at both the community and household levels. Three years of data on
35 indicators of poverty and transport behavior have been collected so far, and will be continued
and rigorously evaluated in a study funded under APL4.

(ii) Institutional Change/Strengthening

56.     In addition to components supporting the strengthening of ERA's capacity to manage
non-force-account road construction and maintenance and the Office of the Road Fund, APL1
also supported institutional development and better management of rural accessibility. While
rural accessibility was not a primary focus of the Government's RSDP2, there is clear recognition
by both the GOE and the donor community on the need to scale up rural connectivity once the
core road network is restored to a functioning critical mass. Thus, the project invested over
US$4 million in institutional strengthening to enable better management of rural accessibility
investments. Expanding a previous pilot that had been funded by Ireland Aid and DFID for
preparation of WIDPs, the project developed 64 such programs (which were supplemented by
additional WIDPs supported from other APL stages and other donors). It also developed an
information, education and communication strategy for reaching out to Weredas, developed a
systematic capacity-building program targeted to different levels of government (Federal,
regional, Wereda, and Kebele), and, unsuccessfully, tried to harmonize the information platforms
for detailed Wereda-level information gathering.

57.     The effort turned out to be timely, because the Government is currently developing a
large-scale program for rural accessibility enhancement, to be known as the Universal Rural
Road Access Program (URRAP). Unlike the RSDP, which was the result of a collaborative
process between the Ethiopian Government and the donor community, particularly the Bank, the
URRAP is wholly a government project, so the precise details are not yet known. However, the
counterparts have affirmed that institutional development outputs of the ERTTP component of
the RSDP, including those under the APL1, are being incorporated and used in the new program.

(iii) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

58.    There are no noteworthy unintended outcomes or impacts.



                                                15
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

59.      A number of factors may adversely influence continued progress toward the project's
development outcome. Financially, there is a risk that prices will continue to escalate in a
manner that will push the continuation of the RSDP beyond the reach of the Government.
Institutionally, there is also a risk that the rapid growth in the size of the road network will affect
the ability of Federal and sub-national institutions to maintain it.

60.    These risks, if they occur, will mostly affect future road development activities; the
benefit stream from project components of the APL1 has already produced long-term
development outcomes. For that reason, this project's risk to development outcome is rated as
low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(i) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

61.    The design of the project, and the APL program as a whole, supported the overall RSDP
in an effective and responsive way. The project was conceived to effectively support and
respond to the size and complexity of that program. The project preparation stage involved
senior Bank experts and consultation with the Government, stakeholders and development
partners in confirming the strategic and program development targets and priorities. Notably, in
June 2002, the Bank with PPIAF resources and co-financing from DFID assisted GOE in
organizing a workshop on Public-Private-Partnership in Infrastructure that introduced the Toolkit
on PPP for Highways. The workshop contributed to the sensitization and acceptance of
increased domestic contractor participation in road contracts, which was also an increasing
Government priority and private sector desire.

62.     As discussed previously, the project's design and M&E framework were rooted in the
overall RSDP framework; it did not incorporate later standards for Bank-financed projects
requiring monitoring for results. Nevertheless, that design and framework pushed the envelope
for donor harmonization and support to country-driven processes, and, as such, were considered
best practice for the standards of the day, as evidenced by the project's Quality at Entry
Assessment (QEA) rating. In the final analysis, it is possible to gauge overall progress toward
the project's enumerated objectives, because of extensive parent-project monitoring program put
in place, in part, through due diligence of the design team at up-stream phases of the project
cycle. For these reasons, Bank performance at quality-at-entry is rated satisfactory.

(ii) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory




                                                  16
63.     Because of the volume of activities not only within the various components of APL1, but
also occurring simultaneously in first the preparation, then supervision of subsequent stages of
the APL, this has been a difficult project for Bank staff to supervise and manage. The APL
program as a whole has required the dedication of two full-time civil engineers, engaged in a
near-continuous cycle of procurement review. Unfortunately, constraints on variable costs
within the supervision budget have limited the ability to engage international consultants to
relieve the burden of these reviews. Despite these difficulties, the client has expressed
satisfaction with the performance of the task team.

(iii) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
64.    Notwithstanding problems in the clarity of how the project's objectives were articulated
and the results monitored discussed above, the Bank team maintained fidelity to those objectives,
through several changes of task teams and task team leaders, and generally guided the project
successfully to fruition, and put the adaptable lending program on a sure footing to meet its
programmatic objectives. For this reason, the Bank's performance is rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(i) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

65.     Road network development is clearly a priority area for the Government, but its
commitment goes beyond simply providing kilometers of serviceable roadway, to ensuring both
the quality and effectiveness of the roads developed. Ministry of Finance has identified road
network development as a priority area, and was a committed partner in the development of the
APL1 and subsequent stages, but has also largely stayed out of the way in terms of
implementation. However, the Government needs to address problems in the structure of the
road transport service sector, if the benefits of its road development programs are to be fully
realized.

(ii) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

66.     The Ethiopian Roads Authority's (ERA) primary mandate has been to build and maintain
roads classified under the federal road network. It is generally perceived as one of the most
effective public institutions in Ethiopia. Beginning with the RSDP, however, ERA effectively
and successfully began integrating new functions and roles into its operations. It has developed
capacity not only to manage stringent environmental and social safeguards requirements, but also
to learn from problems related to their compliance and improve practices, as well as foster an
appreciation among staff of the value of these additional "burdens". It has improved its
performance vis-à-vis procurement and contract processing, and developed an appreciation for
the benefits from more effective information management.

67.   One structural problem that continues to affect ERA's performance during the project
implementation, however, has been high staff turnover, particularly of experienced staff in mid-

                                               17
career positions. On the ground, this is particularly noticeable where conditions are non-
standard and require more thorough case-by-case monitoring, such as highly variegated terrain or
urban environments. A second noteworthy challenge is the need to ensure more effective and
timely interaction between ERA and the ORF, which is charged with ensuring the technical and
financial accountability for road maintenance.

(iii) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

68.    Borrower performance is rated satisfactory because of the overall level of support
provided by the highest levels of Government, and the consistent and improving performance of
the implementing agency.

6. Lessons Learned

69.     Contractual obligations to ensure environmental performance of contractors can be
strengthened. A number of key environmental actions need to occur toward the end of the
construction cycle, such as restoring parts of construction sites, borrow pits, and quarries.
Although provisions for environmental mitigation were made in Bills of Quantities, further
action can help ensure contractors do not renege on their contractual obligations, such as
requiring up-front environmental performance bonds, or increasing retention amounts and
creating specific set-asides for end-of-contract payment upon supervisor certification of
environmental compliance.

70.     The urban interface is a complex component of roads projects, which must be
approached more systematically. Urban areas ­ cities, towns, even villages ­ have more
complex, contextual elements that must be planned for and incorporated than standard rural
sections of roadway. The additional complexity comes from a number of sources, including the
nature and frequency of vehicular cross-movements and parking, the amount of concentrated
pedestrian activity, the rapid increase in recent years in the length of roads near towns and cities
requiring urban treatment (that is, urban expansion), and generally more complex relationships
with abutting properties and their access to the road. Not only must the road adapt to these urban
conditions, which generally require detailed and accurate contextual design, but also the city or
town needs to adapt to the new or newly reshaped road. There is room for these complexities to
be more systematically taken into account at the national level, as the outcomes affect the rural-
urban interface created by roads' passing through urban areas, and consequently affect national
development. This would have two implications for how GOE manages its trunk road
development program. First, ERA must effectively coordinate with regional and urban
authorities in the planning, scope and timing of urban section designs and development. In the
process, it must ensure that design of urban sections not only is contextual, but also makes sense
from an urban development as well as a traffic-moving point of view. Although there are
provisions for incorporation of such considerations in the design stage TORs, more effort could
be made to ensure compliance. Second, the GOE needs to address more squarely the question of
how resources for ancillary improvements around roads in towns and cities are funded and
allocated. These questions might form the basis of a more detailed study.



                                                18
71.      Training and capacity building are not as effective as they could be, as long as civil
service reform is not on the agenda. Inability to retain staff results in high staff turnover; as a
result, investments in human capital do not have much longevity, since junior staff tend to move
on to other opportunities elsewhere after being trained. For example, the environment
management branch has difficulty filling vacant posts, and when they do, training and capacity
development efforts have to restart from zero. Civil service / public sector reform could address
this issue, improving retention rates by emphasizing good salaries and performance-based
monitoring. This will be increasingly important as ERA moves to separate its planning and
implementation functions.

72.     Scaling up works under the Government's RSDP, both in terms of size and pace,
requires redoubled efforts to ensure no loss of quality. Unless concerted efforts are made,
quality of various aspects of the civil works program ­ design, safeguards, follow-through
(particularly in urban areas) ­ could suffer in an effort to maintain the pace of expenditures, and
keep up the rate of growth of the network. One potential solution to this challenge is greater use
of Output and Performance-based Road Contracting (OPRC). APL3 is funding the preparation
of bidding documents for a potential (OPRC) project, the financing for which would be
identified later. Another potential solution is to further strengthen capacities in ERA, but this
potential is, again, limited by difficulties in staff retention identified above.

73.    Mobilization delays continue to be a source of difficulties for both on-time delivery of
promised outputs and final project costs; ERA and the donor community need to maintain
focus and collective purpose to avoid such delays as much as possible, and to minimize their
financial impact when they do occur. As a result of experience from earlier projects, including
the Emergency Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (ERRP-Credit 2351-ET) and the RSDP
phase I, ERA had put into place measures under APL1 to minimize government-caused delays
associated with customs clearances and land acquisition, and to allow more time contractually
for mobilization. Yet some of the ICB-procured civil works still suffered from significant delays.
These delays seem to stem from contractors' weak management capacity, indifference, and / or
malfeasance, combined with ineffective supervision by selected firms.

74.    Further recognition and accounting for the above problems have led to additional efforts
under APLs 3 and 4 to address them. For example, APL3 funds the development within ERA of
a contract performance monitoring system, which will allow ERA to monitor contract
performance and progress via benchmarks, rather than relying exclusively on supervising
engineers' assessments. Similarly, project costs will also be monitored and compiled, enabling
more independent assessments of engineers' cost estimations.

75.     Road asset management requires needs-based maintenance programming. The road
asset value in Ethiopia has climbed substantially since concerted investments began under the
RSDP in 1997, and requires concerted efforts to preserve it. The project financed a study to
assess maintenance needs, currently being updated under APL4, but the results need to be fully
incorporated into the maintenance planning cycle. To do so, the ORF needs to be strengthened
to allow them to provide timely technical and financial audits of road maintenance by different
agencies, including ERA. Doing so will allow planners to make good, long-term strategic
allocations of resources and preserve the asset developed to date.


                                                19
76.      To effectively address constraints to accessibility and unmet transport needs, the GOE
and its donor partners will need to look beyond the provision and maintenance of road
infrastructure, toward a more holistic approach to the sector, including services. The RSDP
and the APL1 focused almost exclusively on road hardware, and strengthening the necessary
institutions to deliver and maintain it. To ensure that transport plays its full role in alleviating
poverty and contributing to the economic life of the country, however, the availability and
affordability of transport services will need to be approached in a consistent policy framework.
In the process, there is need to pay more attention to strengthening the institutions that monitor
and regulate this sector.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(i) Borrower/implementing agencies
77.     Comments made by ERA on earlier drafts of this ICR have been fully incorporated into

78.     The Borrower's ICR, shown in Annex 7, includes a table of project performance
indicators that are not fully consistent with the project indicators as identified in Annex 1 of the
PAD, and as discussed in Section F, the Results Framework Analysis, and Section 3, Assessment
of Outcomes of this ICR.

                               Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1. Rehabilitation and upgrading of federal trunk and link roads

i. Nekempt-Mekenajo Road (127 km. Estimate US$41.86 million, actual US$49.72 million)

1.     The Nekempt-Mekenajo Road upgrade from gravel to asphalt was undertaken by a
contractor following International Competitive Bidding ICB). Works were completed on time
by December 2008, with the defects liability period extending through December 2009. This
represents a substantial catching up compared to the contract performance at the time of the mid-
term review. At that time, physical accomplishment had been 26.4 percent, against a planned
accomplishment of 30 percent.

2.      Visits to the town sections of these works (Nekempt, Gimbi) exemplify some of the
distinct challenges that urban sections have presented during the Government's RSDP
implementation. In a number of cases, initial design and / or execution of the road had cut off
access - both road and town access - for adjacent residents and businesses, necessitating redesign
and / or corrective measures. Earlier attention to appropriate traffic calming measures, to ensure
that through traffic negotiates the urban areas at town speeds, rather than highway speeds, and to
pedestrian movements might have also improved conditions for town residents.

ii. Nazret-Assela road (79 km. Estimate US$23.13 million, actual US$29.13 million)

3.     The Nazret ­ Assela Road rehabilitation was awarded under ICB procedures, and work
was completed by February 2008, with defects liability period extending through February 2009.
Civil works for this contract were completed ahead of schedule.

iii. Wereta ­ Gob Gob road (98.9 km. US$28.82 million, actual US$33.33 million)

4.      The upgrading of the Wereta-Gob Gob Road from gravel to bitumen was undertaken in
two lots, awarded under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. The works were
originally intended to be contracted out in six lots of 15 to 20 kilometers each, following a local
capacity assessment, which suggested about US$5 million per NCB contract. However, when
the works were put out to bid in summer of 2004, the resulting proposals were substantially
higher than expected. In even the least-cost bid, the proposed price was 195 percent the cost
estimated by the Engineer, with most of the difference coming in the day-work rates applied.
ERA speculated that the reasons were the relatively small size of each lot (between 14 and 18
kilometers each) and the ratio of qualified bidders to the number of lots up for tender (four : six).
Consequently, ERA proposed, and the Bank eventually agreed to, an exception to the
procurement limit, with the works to be repackaged as two lots of about US$13 million each, and
rebid. The construction period was extended from two to three years, and each (previously
qualified) contractor was limited to bidding on only one contract.

5.      In the intervening time, however, traffic had grown on the existing roads more
substantially than expected. A decision was made, therefore, to redesign the road surfaces in
order to handle the existing traffic. This led to further delay in the progress of the works, but did
give the local contractors valuable experience in working with asphalt bitumen, one of the key
                                                 23
objectives of this component. As of the close of the project, the works were 92 percent (Lot 1)
and 85 percent (Lot 2) complete. The reasons for the delay included: (i) lack of experience of
the local contractors, (ii) adverse weather conditions during the construction period, (iii)
variation orders arising from increased works volume, (iv) surface design change due to a traffic
increase substantially higher than initially forecasted, and (v) the need to adjust the alignment in
response to recently encountered landslides on one of the road contracts. The uncompleted
portion of these contracts is being funded from the Government's budget.

iv. Adi Abun Adigrat road (108 km. Estimate US$29.57 million; actual US$43.75 Million)

6.     While all four of the ICB contracts suffered from slow initial mobilization to some degree,
the upgrading of this portion of the Adigrat ­ Shire road from gravel to asphalt suffered from
such mobilization delays that the contractor was unable to recover within the contract period.
Progress remained well below 50 percent of expected performance, throughout much of the
contract period, for a number of reasons, including: repeated changes in project management of
the contractor, lack of support to the site by the Contractor's headquarters, lack of equipment and
experienced staff, poor quality of the equipment that was available on-site, lack of
communication skill in English, and poor site protection practices prior to and during the rainy
season (leading to the subsequent need to rectify erosion problems).

7.     As a consequence, the contract period for this work needed to be extended to August
2009 and while the main works were completed by that time, the defects liability period
extended beyond the closing date of the IDA grant; consequently, cost of some claims might
need to be borne by the Government.

8.      Price adjustment on this contract was particularly onerous. According to ERA figures,
contractual adjustments to unit prices more than doubled the initial contract price. As a result the
AdiAbun-Adigrat road had a relatively large price escalation compared to the other civil works
contracts under APL1; final contract price was more than double the initial price, and almost 1.5
times the cost estimated at appraisal.

Component 2. Construction of federal link road ­ Dera-Magna section of Dera-Mechara
road. (Originally 119.4 km; reduced to 99 km. Estimate US$34.41 million; actual
US$19.43 Million).

9.      The construction of the Dera-Magna section of the Dera-Mechara Road was undertaken
following International Competitive Bidding. The road alignment goes through five towns, and
follows about 28.6 kilometers of previously gravel and about 2.4 kilometers of earth road,
respectively. The remaining 68 kilometers is greenfield development, primarily through difficult
soil known as "black cotton".

10.     The contract was reduced in scope following contract signing in August 2004; the final
stretch of the link (about 20 kilometers from Chole to Magna) was removed from the contract,
because of a changed alignment through mountainous terrain. The Government is constructing
this link with its own resources. In addition, the contract originally called for about 19
kilometers of bituminous penetration macadam ­ through townships and along steep portions ­
but this was reduced to less than 6 kilometers, when it was found that aggregates were not

                                                24
bonding with gravel surfaces because of prevailing temperatures and rates of precipitation. (The
remaining 13 kilometers of these areas were finished with gravel surface.) The Bank's civil
engineers believe that this latter problem probably could have been identified and corrected by
the design consultants. As a result of these changes, the cost of the civil works for this
component was substantially lower than anticipated at appraisal.

11.     The construction period was extended from an end date of February 2008 to June 2009,
but even that deadline was missed as there were a number of items outstanding at project closing,
including completion of about 20 kilometers of roadway, some erosion protection works,
erection of traffic signs, and reinstatement of borrow and quarry sites.

12.     Notwithstanding these problems, the project team rated the progress of the contract as
satisfactory in its final supervision mission report. To some degree, this rating may reflect the
superior performance of the contractor in fulfilling his obligations under the Environmental
Management Plan, particularly in the reinstatement of borrow pits and quarries, relative to other
contractors active in the project.

Component 3. Construction Supervision. (Estimate US$11.93 million; actual US$8.38
Million).

13.     Six construction supervision contracts were issued to oversee the works, one for each of
the civil works contracts.

14.     Quality of the supervision of the Nekempt-Mekenajo road suffered, initially because of
performance problems associated with the assigned Resident Engineer (RE), and later because of
the prolonged absence of an RE from the site because of inability to find a suitable replacement,
and related continuity problems.13

Component 4. Rural travel and transport program. (Estimate US$7.54; actual US$4.59
Million.)

15.     The Road Sector Development Program, which the entire IDA APL program is
supporting, was primarily envisioned to make progress on trunk roads in Ethiopia. It has long
been recognized that as the network matures, focus needs to be placed increasingly on rural
access to that trunk network. The ERTTP was intended to explore the mechanisms by which that
objective might eventually be operationalized. The program was intended to build on the
experience of eight "Wereda Integrated Development Plans" (WIDP) that had been piloted using
financing from the Development Cooperation of Ireland (DCI) and technical support from the
World Bank; the core of the ERTTP under APL1 was the development of 64 WIDPs, in eight
lots of eight Weredas each. The program also involved the development of an information,
education, and communication strategy, and capacity building for institutions likely to be


13
   The lack of RE in this contract seems to have exacerbated some of the quality performance problems of the
contractor in urban areas in particular, such as Nekempt. Recruitment and retention of qualified engineers on site is
a growing industry-wide challenge.


                                                        25
involved in scaling up of a WIDP program at the federal, regional, and Wereda levels. Together,
the development of the WIDPs, the IEC strategy, and the capacity building formed the three key
elements of the ERTTP that had been identified in the PAD. These are discussed in more detail
below.

16.    In addition to the above core components, the IDA grant has also financed a number of
support elements to the program, including:

       Capacity building, training, and some material support (procurement of vehicles) to
       support implementation of the eight pilot WIDPs (with the implementation itself
       supported by DCI and WIDP); and
       Development of a unified and consistent database to compile data collected during WIDP
       development process. Work carried out on this activity was largely ineffectual. A
       consultant was hired to develop a common database framework, and, indeed, this tool
       was released in November 2006. However, the database platform eventually developed
       turned out to be overly cumbersome; while consultants could physically enter data in a
       program with a friendly user interface, once entered, the data could not be extracted in a
       useable way. The consultants engaged in WIDP data collection exercise, therefore, were
       forced to maintain two data base maintenance exercises, one to put the data in the
       "common" format ERA was requiring, and one to put the data in a form that was useable
       for subsequent analysis.

i. Preparation of 64 Wereda Travel and Transport Plans.

17.      This subcomponent proved to be challenging for implementation. . Reduced from 100 to
64 Weredas, this component's output involved production of two substantial reports (in both
draft and final form) for each Wereda ­ an information analysis report, and the development plan
itself. Each of these reports tended to be between 200 and 300 pages long, meaning that this
subcomponent alone would have produced over 75,000 pages of text that would need to be
thoroughly reviewed if the work was to be properly supervised. ERA tried to procure consulting
services just to help with the review of this material, but that procurement was interrupted by
shifts in personnel and programmatic priorities.

18.      These difficulties highlight the inherent problems of top-down coordination of local
development strategies. The sheer volume of analysis and processing involved can easily
overwhelm the capacity of centralized (federal) agencies; such an initiative may require an
element of bottom-up organization to be manageable, but this approach would require a great
deal of already-developed decentralized management capacity. Such decentralized capacity is
feasible in Ethiopia in the near term, given its high levels of economic growth in recent years,
but it is unlikely to be available equally in all locales. Rather, local management capacity likely
occurs as a by-product of local economic development, which, in turn, would happen where
economic concentration (urbanization) occurs and facilitates economic development. In short,
ERA's experience with the WIDP may point to the need for a more bottom-up orientation in the
approach to rural infrastructure development, supported by funding at the Federal level which
recognizes inherent differences in capacity to develop and implement programs.



                                                26
ii. Development of information, education, and communication strategy.

19.    This subcomponent led to the development of a strategy paper for information, education,
and communication (IEC) on the ERTTP. The strategy paper recommended specific
communications approaches to different stakeholders on a range of issues, grouped by seven
themes:

   1.   Rural accessibility and mobility;
   2.   Productivity and income diversification in rural areas;
   3.   Integrated holistic approaches to rural development;
   4.   Community ownership, gender equity and empowerment;
   5.   Environment;
   6.   Resource mobilization; and
   7.   Performance monitoring and evaluation.

20.     The strategy paper also recommended a rather elaborate institutional structure to ensure
coordination of the ERTTP and its communication strategy. As the Bank team noted, this
strategy could be used not only for the ERTTP and its successor program(s), but also for
investments made under the Protection of Basic Services project as well. Staff at ERA indicated
that they expected this strategy to be adopted for the URRAP program.

iii. Capacity building for ERTPP institutions at national, regional, and Wereda levels

21.     This activity included development and implementation of a capacity assessment method
for Weredas, strengthening information technology availability, and providing some vehicles for
selected ERTPP institutions. The capacity building strategy developed was recommended for
use in the subsequent URRAP program.

Component 5. Technical Assistance (TA) support services for ERA

i. Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune-Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS)
Control and Prevention (Estimate US$500 thousand; actual US$0)

22.    Although TA for HIV/AIDS control and prevention had been identified in the PAD to
support the RSDP II's objectives in this area, ERA was fully able to meet its objectives regarding
HIV/AIDS control and prevention without recourse to such TA. Indeed, it has maintained a
vigorous and robust effort on HIV/AIDS, hiring three full-time professionals in the
Environmental Monitoring Branch and requiring specific line-items in contractors' budgets for
HIV/AIDS prevention and control for the first time under APL1. Such mechanisms are now
generally required on all Bank-financed road contracts over US$10 million value, but it is
noteworthy that ERA adopted these measures prior to such standardization. Unfortunately,
monitoring of HIV/AIDS infection rates has not been as successful as the control measures
themselves; placeholder indicators on HIV/AIDS were incorporated into the RSDP M&E
framework, but, to date, have not been populated with data.




                                               27
ii. TA Support for ERA in Project Planning and Implementation and Social Impact
Monitoring (Estimate US$4.30 million; actual US$4.26 million).

23.     This component entailed three relatively distinct activities. First, about 15 or so ERA
staffs were trained at the Masters' level, in accredited programs in the UK and the Netherlands.
Second, a detailed training program on all aspects of project planning and implementation was
developed and implemented for ERA staff. This training program covered aspects of project
management, planning, procurement, contract administration, review of engineering designs,
claims avoidance, and dispute handling. This program was well received by staff at ERA, who
not only appreciated the quality of the training itself and the materials produced, but also ­ and
particularly ­ the attitude and availability of the consultant's personnel carrying out the training.
Material developed for the training has been deposited with the University of Addis Ababa,
where it is intended to be made available to engineering students.

24.     Finally, this component involved the development and fielding of a Transport and
Poverty Observatory (TPO), to monitor the poverty alleviation impacts of road project
investments in areas of influence of RSDP-supported projects, at both the community and
household levels. While the link between transport and poverty alleviation has long been
suspected, it has never been studied systematically in Ethiopia. This ongoing effort examines
transport service characteristics and poverty outcomes along four corridors, and tracks 35
indicators. The APL1 grant tried to reverse this, by developing a program to examine transport
service characteristics and poverty outcomes along four corridors rehabilitated under the
Government's RSDP. The grant funded three years of data collection, tracking 35 indicators, but
annual monitoring is expected to continue until at least 2012, using resources to be determined.
(About ETB 1.7 million remains on the monitoring contract.) So far, the data collection exercises
have yielded a wealth of information and interesting indicators, summarized in Annex 11. Under
APL4, an analytical study will be commissioned to assess those results in more detail.

Component 6. Road Financing Study & Technical Audits (Estimate US$0.46 million; actual
US$0.28 million)

25.     This component funded a road finance study which looked at existing revenue sources
and planned future development of the road network, and estimated the extent of maintenance
needs through 2015. However, it only provided detailed needs expenditure estimates for five
years, from 2004 through 2009, and these estimates subsequently proved to be inaccurate. Since
its recommendations were not taken up by the Road Fund, it is already obsolete. In fact, a new
Road Fund study has recently been launched financed under APL 4, which will look at additional
revenue sources besides the traditional fuel levy.

26.     This component also financed some technical audits of the road fund itself. The first two
of those audits examined maintenance works that were being funded by the road fund, and found
that ERA was using Road Fund resources to fund more than routine maintenance, but rather
periodic (heavy) maintenance activities and even rehabilitation. They also found that the
evaluation capacity of Road Fund staff was somewhat weak. It remains unclear the extent to
which the results of this audit have affected either ERA or Road Fund staff in terms of their day-
to-day practices.


                                                 28
Component 7. Planning activities

Urban Transport study (Estimate US$ 1.12 million; actual US$0.37million)
Preparatory Activities for future stages (US$2.79 million; actual US$1.76 million)

27.     This component funded preparatory studies of potential investments to be funded later. It
included feasibility, design, and environmental and social impact studies for civil works
investments under stage III of the APL. It also funded an urban transport strategy for Addis
Ababa, the implementation of which was also meant to be prepared under APL 3. Shortly after
the strategy was completed, however, the Addis Ababa municipal Government entered a period
of institutional instability, so efforts to implement the strategy were halted. The preparatory
activities for future stages of the APL, however, did come to fruition, as APL3 is currently
financing civil works for facilities whose plans were developed under APL1.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

I.       Introduction

1.     The ex post economic analysis was carried out by ERA staff, using updated numbers
based on the original Feasibility Study.

2.     Economic results were updated for the following road projects, using a benefit-cost
approach with the HDM model:
          Nazareth-Assela,
          Adigrat ­ Adi Abun -Adwa,
          Wereta ­ Gob Gob , and
          Nekempte ­ Mekenajo
3.      Economic analysis of the Dera-Magna section (part of Dera ­ Mechara link) had used a
producer-surplus approach, and had determined an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of
18.5 percent for the entire Dera ­ Mechara link. That analysis has not been updated, because
resource constraints have precluded the collection of detailed agricultural production data for the
zone. However, field observation suggests that agricultural activity in the zone has been robust
since completion of the road link, and construction costs were substantially lower than
anticipated, because of the removal of about 20 kilometers of bypass around Chole.
Consequently, it is a reasonable proposition that the final EIRR was at least as high as that
assessed in the ex ante evaluation. For the other links, a number of the assumptions of the initial
economic evaluation have been revised as a result of observations during the implementation
period. The results of the economic viability of the roads have been modified taking into
consideration actual projects cost and updated traffic figures. Moreover, the analysis period has
been changed to incorporate the current starting period of construction.

II.      Methodology

4.      The Highway Development Management (HDM 3) model (in HDM Manager) that was
developed by the World Bank has been used for the analysis for sake of consistency with the
original analysis. The project scenario has been compared with a "do minimum" case. The "do
minimum case" assumes that a minimum amount of maintenance of the existing road will be
carried out. The economic analysis is based on benefits to road traffic (in terms of savings in
vehicle operating costs (VOCs) & road maintenance costs) compared with the costs of
rehabilitation/upgrading and maintenance. Discounted benefits are then compared to discounted
costs to produce measures of worth.

5.      The results are expressed in Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRRs) and Net Present
Value (NPV). The basic concept of economic evaluation is to maximize the returns on
investment. Costs are expressed in terms of financial and economic costs. The financial costs are
market prices that the consumers pay for. However, economic costs explain the true cost of
resource consumption. Financial costs have been converted to economic costs by subtracting
taxes, levies and duties.


                                                30
6.      To be acceptable for implementation, the proposed investments have to result in an EIRR
of at least equal to the opportunity cost of capital in Ethiopia, which is set at 10 percent. NPV's
are calculated using opportunity cost of capital as the discount rate.

III. Construction Alternatives

7.     The construction and maintenance alternatives for the HDM analysis have been defined
based on the improvement options identified for each road. For each alternative defined, a set of
maintenance and improvement standards are assigned. The maintenance and improvement
standards define the work items to be carried out on the project road over the analysis period.
The different alternatives proposed for each road are presented below.

                      Table 1. Alternatives Proposed for Project Roads
                    Project road                  Alt 1             Alt 2
                    Nazareth-Assela           Do Minimum         AC Option
                    Wereta -Gob Gob           Do Minimum         AC Option
                    Adigrat ­ Adi Abun        Do Minimum         AC Option
                    Nekempte ­ Mekenajo       Do Minimum         AC Option


8.    It is assumed that the road is open to traffic in year 2010 and the analysis period is
assumed to cover 20 years.

IV. Traffic Projection

9.       Traffic projections on the project road have taken into account past and future trend in
GDP growth, population increase, agricultural activities, tourism, Average Annual Daily Traffic
(AADT), vehicle fleet and fuel consumption. These are among the major factors influencing
traffic growth rates on the project road.

10.     It is assumed that the current fairly high level of traffic growth rates will reduce in the
future as the economy stabilizes to steady growth. Thus, two sets of growth rates have been
estimated for the period 2009-2019 and 2020-2029.

11.    Table 2 shows the Average Annual Daily traffic considered for the base year, and Table 3
shows the growth rates assumptions for the two periods.

VI.   Sensitivity Analysis

13.     The benefit estimate which mainly deals with traffic forecasting involves uncertainties.
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing benefit estimates. The results of the
sensitivity analysis are given below. The results indicate that all the project options have a high
economic rate of return.

        Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.    General
In 1997, the challenges facing the roads sector in Ethiopia were immense. The total road
network was only 26,550 km, of which over half was in a poor condition. Only 22% of the
network at that time was in a good and serviceable condition, finances were scarce and
maintenance was all but neglected.

The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) set out a clear strategic direction for the
restoration and expansion of Ethiopia's road network under the Road Sector Development
Program (RSDP). The first 5-year phase of the RSDP, known as RSDP-I, was officially
launched in September 1997 with the major portion of the finance provided by the World Bank,
EU and the Government of Ethiopia. RSDP-I ended in June 2002. The second phase, RSDP II,
stretched over the period July 2002 to June 2007. The third phase, RSDP III, commenced in July
2007 for a period of 3 years.

Under the RSDP priority construction and rehabilitation of the road network was undertaken and
coupled with actions and reforms that would improve both road management and road
maintenance. At the same time efforts were made to strengthen the capacity of the domestic
road construction industry (DCI).

During the period of the RSDP the total road network has grown by some 20,262 km to 46,812,
an average annual growth of 8%, of which 54% is now in a good and serviceable condition. The
Road Fund now supports routine and periodic maintenance works and a whole series of policy
and institutional reforms have been realized that bring with them an improved efficiency and
effectiveness to the sector.

The World Bank has remained an important development partner during the execution of the
RSDP through its significant financial support and its contribution to knowledge learning and
sharing in the sector. The experience shared by the institution and its experts has made a
significant contribution towards a better understanding, meeting the challenges of the sector and
delivering the RSDP.

Donor support to the RSDP implementation amounts to around 31%, of the requirement. The
contribution through the International Development Association (IDA), alone, has been
significant, amounting to 14.2% of the total requirement.

This Credit Closing and Implementation Completion Report presents an assessment of the
achievements of the project objectives and identification of important lessons learned during the
implementation process.

The report captures an assessment of Borrower's and Bank's performance, the physical
accomplishment to date and an analysis of project costs by component that gives the actual costs
to date compared to appraisal estimates (Loan Utilization). The report further summarizes key
performance indicators and results, along with assessment of the performance of the key actors.
Emphasis is given to the Environmental and Social Impact of road projects, along with
identification of any major factors affecting implementation and any lessons learned.

Part II of the report gives detailed information on Performance Indicators, the Ethiopian Rural
Travel and Transport Program, Safeguards, the Transport Poverty Observatory and finally an
analysis of the project costs.

(i) Construct, rehabilitate, upgrade and preserve the priority federal road network.
(ii) Strengthen the ERA reform program with a focus on:-
          - creating a more commercially oriented ERA through upgrading systems and
              procedures;
          - creating commercially oriented District Maintenance Organizations which can
              deliver cost effective maintenance services;
          - strengthening Regional Road Organizations; and
          - developing a coherent planning and programming approach based on network
              stabilization program, in which federal and regional agencies formulate common
              methodologies for allocation of available resources.



                                               39
(iii) Improve resource mobilization, allocation and use for road maintenance and strengthen the
Office of the Road Fund.
(iv) Develop capacity in program implementation with a specific focus on:-
         - enhancing the capacity in road construction and maintenance by creating an
            enabling environment for participation of domestic private contractors and
            exploring feasibility and option for private sector participation,
         - reducing adverse effects of road works on road safety and the environment by
            incorporating mitigating measures during design and implementation stages,
         - promoting use of labor ­ intensive technology and ensuring community
            participation in building and maintaining regional and community roads,
         - planning for the provision of integrated community ­ based village travel and
            transport infrastructure and services, and
         - conducting monitoring and evaluation studies on the poverty alleviation and
            environment of investments in the sector.

2.2 Assessment of Objectives
Objective I
Under APL I 513.1 km of main asphalt and gravel roads have been upgraded, rehabilitated or
constructed. This has contributed to an overall improvement in the proportion of asphalt roads in
good condition from 17% (1997) to 70% (2009) and for gravel roads from 25% (1997) to 54%
(2009).
Objective II
This component was mainly supported by DfID and Government of Ethiopia. IDA provided
backstopping support for short term experts and significant feedback on strategic issues related
to the whole ERA reform package. ERA's District Maintenance Organizations were divided into
two functional units, assuming the role of the client and service provider. As a result own force
maintenance is provided through commercial principles under a pre ­ agreed Internal Service
Level Agreement. Both units are now ready to separate from the regulatory body of ERA when a
decision is taken on the implementation of the Business Process Re ­ engineering of ERA.

Government has provided significant support to assist the reform process and provide
institutional upgrading in the regional/rural road authorities (RRAs) of the four emerging regions,
namely Somali, Benishangul­Gumuz, Gambella and Afar. Guidelines were provided on Network
Planning and Contract Management and a number of associated training events for regional staff
were conducted. Importantly, four senior engineers were assigned to work with each RRA for a
period of over 18 months. These engineers were tasked with providing RRA staff on-the-job
training and to transfer skills in nine priority areas:
      (i)     Construction projects planning
      (ii)    Microsoft project application in project planning,

                                               40
    (iii)    Contract formulation and procurement,
    (iv)     Labour-based contracts administration,
    (v)      Computer application in road design,
    (vi)     Works contracts administration,
    (vii)    Design and supervision contacts administration,
    (viii)   Claims assessment and management in works contracts, and
    (ix)     Construction project monitoring and control.
Objective III
Two important studies were undertaken as part of APL I to identify improved resource
mobilization for road maintenance funding and to strengthen the administration of the road fund.
These were:
   i. A study of Road Financing in Ethiopia providing a main report and three manuals on,
       Road Fund Procedures, Evaluation and Assessment of Fund Utilization to Work Done
       and Financial Recording Systems; and
   ii. Establishment of Technical and Financial Auditing of the Road Fund

Objective IV
APL I made provision for the exclusive participation of local contractors in asphalt road works.
Contracts, which are now substantially completed, were awarded to two local contractors for
asphalt road construction works. These local contractors have managed to build up their capacity,
improve turn-over (to an estimated ETB500 million) and can compete effectively on the local
market

APL I provided sufficient funds to undertake training of personnel and to provide technical
assistance (TA) services to support ERA in areas of project planning and implementation. More
than 15 key staff and senior professionals undertook post-graduate MSc training in UK and the
Netherlands on Construction Management, Transport Planning, Procurement, Structural and
Highway Engineering, Construction Law and Environmental Management.

SMEC Int. Ltd. of Australia was engaged in a 3 year technical assistance programme to provide
additional support on contract administration, planning and design. This support also provided a
series of guidance manuals on:
               Planning and Procurement
               Environmental Management and Road Safety
               Contract Administration
               Claims Avoidance and Dispute Handling
               Human Resource Development




                                              41
Over 2000 participant training-days were provided through more than 60 courses. These course
included delivery of `Training for Trainers' courses for a number of selected and experienced
staff.

To strengthen regional and wereda planning for integrated community ­ based village travel and
transport infrastructure and services APL I supported provision of transport to 8 Districts and 8
Regional Road Authorities. APL I also supported development of an Information, Education and
Communication (IEC) strategy to promote wider implementation of the Ethiopian Rural Travel
and Transport Program. APL I also assisted with the development of a District Capacity Building
Strategy and supported provision of over 70 Wereda Integrated Development Studies throughout
the country.

APL I also introduced a Transport Poverty Observatory (TPO) study that is aimed at assessing
and measuring the poverty alleviation impacts of road and road transport interventions in
Ethiopia. Under this initiative poverty surveys and data collection was undertaken in 2007 &
2008 on four road corridors for collation and comparison to 2005 baseline information. The
poverty impact assessment uses three indicators groups, based on (i) Transport operation output
indicators, (ii) Transport operation outcome indicators, and (iii) Welfare or living standard
outcome indicators. The third year survey is underway and the service will continue until 2012.

In developing and enhancing capacity in the sector, APL I has benefited the local industry and
provided vital road infrastructure in parallel with important capacity building initiatives that have
supported the federal, regional and local management agencies. Road safety systems and the
needs of the environment have been integrated and addressed in the design and construction
process. Importantly, planning systems for sustainable community infrastructure have been
tested and rolled out and monitoring and evaluation programmes have been implemented that
will allow a better understanding of the poverty alleviation impacts of investments in the sector.
Most importantly, all of the components of the APL I have been delivered and are integrated in
revised and improved working practices across the sector.

Dera ­ Magna projects have been completed. The Woreta ­ Km 49 and Km 49 ­ Gob Gob roads
have been substantially completed; more than 96% at the end of March 2010. The delay in
completion was due to the landslide problems incurred on some stretches. The five technical
assistance and study components of the APL I are all complete.

The details of implementation status of each project component of APL I are presented in the
sections below.


3.2 Engineering Design and Environmental Impact Assessment
Africon of South Africa were appointed by ERA to undertake the design reviews and the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies for the road works projects that were designed
by different Consultants.

3.3 Rehabilitation of Trunk Roads
       3.3.1   Rehabilitation of Nazareth ­ Assela (79km)
General
The project road is situated in the southern part of Ethiopia, starting at Nazareth, in Oromiya
regional state, approximately 98 km southeast of the capital city, Addis Ababa. The road passes
through five towns en route, namely Awash Melkassa, Dera, Iteya, Gonde and Kulumsa before
terminating at the southern end of Assela town. The original riding surface was paved with a 7m
carriageway and 1.5m shoulder. The road was in a fair to poor condition.

within the defect liability period and the defect liability certificate was issued by the Engineer on
June 1, 2009.

Main Factors Affecting Contract Performance

       Contract specification problems for the AC wearing course
       Design problem which resulted in flooding at km 3 ­ 5

3.4 Upgrading of Trunk Roads

   3.4.1       Nekempt ­ Mekenajo (127 km)
General
The road is located in the western part of Ethiopia, entirely situated in the Oromiya region, at a
distance of 330 km from Addis Ababa. The route is situated at the heart of a coffee producing
area, and is also a potential area for mining, mainly marble and gold, all of which are essential
sources of foreign exchange earnings for the country. The area also experiences surplus
production of cereals and grain for domestic needs. The road links two major towns Nekempte
and Gimbi and also connects five villages and towns enroute. The project was upgraded from an
existing gravel road to an asphalt concrete surface, with a 7.0 m wide carriageway and 1.5 m
shoulders.

529,400 and ETB 5.914 million and an original completion date of February 25, 2008.

The project was completed on December 27, 2009. Almost all outstanding issues have been
settled. A defect liability certificate will be issued soon.

            
Main Factors Affecting Contract Performance
   Delay in removal of obstructions, i.e., late possession of site
   Design problems resulting in modifications and the issuance of variations
   The project was subject to adverse climatic conditions
   Consultant's poor handling of claims, resulting in additional dispute costs

                                                 44
3.5 Upgrading of Link Roads
 There are two road projects under the civil works of rehabilitation of federal link roads; Wereda
­ Gob Gob (98.9km) and Adigrat ­ Adi Abun (108km). The detailed status of each project is
presented as follow.

        3.5.1. Wereta ­ Gob Gob (98.9 km)
General
The road, entirely in the Amhara region, commences from the western end of the town of
Wereda and terminates at Gob Gob, a small settlement on the road leading to Woldiya. This 98.9
km section is part of the Wereda ­ Woldiya road upgrading project that covers a total length of
about 293 km. The road is of high socio­economic importance and serves as a major traffic
collector, traversing difficult terrain between the Wollo and Gondar sub­regions. The road is
classified as a major link road, and was a fully engineered gravel surface road, originally
constructed between 1977 and 1983, and later regravelled as part of the ERRP. The mountainous
nature of the area caused rapid and severe erosion and surface wear. The road was recommended
for upgrading from gravel to a double bituminous surface treatment with carriageway width of
7m and 1.5m wide shoulders.

This project consists of two sections; Wereda ­ 49km and 49km ­ Gob Gob. The status of each
section is presented as follows;

   Revised Contract Price:                   ETB 229,153,109.91


The supervision contract was awarded on 12 April, 2006 with contract price of ETB 7.503
million. The commencement and the original completion dates of the project were on April 24,
2006 and April 23, 2009 respectively.


The Project has been substantially completed i.e., 92% of the total work. The outstanding works
will be completed before May 2010.

Main Factors Affecting Contract Performance
   Resurveying and re-fixing of the survey reference. Re­design of the entire length of the
      road was mandatory due to missing benchmarks.
   Alignment problems needing alignment adjustment.

   Revised Contract Price:                   ETB 253,856,067.33

On April 12, 2006 the supervision contract was awarded with an original contract price ETB
8.067 million.

The Project has been substantially completed i.e., 85 percent of the total works. The remaining
works will be completed by the end of June 2010.

Main Factors Affecting Contract Performance
   Delay in mobilization of equipment.
   Frequent breakdown of asphalt concrete equipment

   3.5.2.      Adigrat - Adi Abun

General
The road is part of the Adigrat ­ Axum ­ Shire road that provides an important east ­ west link
between the two primary North ­ South trunk roads in the northern region of Tigray. The
mountainous terrain, which the road traverses, makes transportation difficult during the wet
season. The road was a fully engineered gravel surface road with a carriageway width of 7m
covering an underlying Telford base. The Telford base was exposed over some sections of the
road in spite regravelling under the ERRP. The road was 50 ­ 60 years old and the pavement
condition was fair to poor. It is classified as a major link road and was been recommended for
upgrading from the existing gravel surface to an asphalt concrete surface.

4,742,643.


                                               46
The physical work of the project has been completed. A few disputed issues are under settlement.

Main Factors Affecting Contract Performance
   Delay in mobilization, lack of permanent work and withdrawal of sub­contractors
   The Contractor did not understand the role of the consultant which made the supervision
      difficult
   The contractor mobilized without the consent of the Engineer and this made it difficult to
      follow up on the defect and environmental mitigation works.

3.6 Construction of Federal Link Roads
   3.6.1      Dera ­ Magna (99.3km)
General
The project is located in the central part of Ethiopia in the Oromiya region 124km from the
capital. The road branches off at Dera town on the Nazareth - Assela trunk road, and runs in a
northeasterly direction to connect to the Arbreketi ­ Mechara road.

   Revised Contract Price:                         ETB 146,212,273.09.


The Consultancy service contract was awarded at a contract amount of GBP 428.6 and ETB
4.198 million.

Following the start of construction in the severe escarpment section, KM.99+200 ­ 119+434
(Chole ­ Magna), construction was subsequently halted due to unforeseen ground condition.
Following submission of preliminary and final reports by the Consultant, ERA approved the
omission of this section from the contract. A variation order was approved for the
accommodation of the omission, reducing length to 99.2 km, resulting in revised contract value
of ETB 146,212,273.09.

The physical works have been completed. A few disputed issues are under settlement.

Main Factors Affecting Contract Performance
   The contractor had no experience of working in Ethiopia and made an apparent
      underestimate of the individual unit rates. This resulted in site staff, attempting to
      construct at BoQ rates, which in many cases were apparently significantly below the
      actual cost of work. This resulted in cash flow difficulties and progress of the works.
   Considerable delay in mobilization of the contractor's staff and plant.


                                              47
       Realignment of the escarpment section km. 25+000 ­ 28+500 to improve vertical and
       horizontal alignments and reduce construction costs and time
       Realignment of the escarpment section km.13+700 to remove potentially dangerous deep
       cuts in unstable terrain to accommodate designed retaining walls
       Redesign of Kaleta Bridge due to anomalies in the original design and site location of the
       proposed replacement structure
       Raising the road level km. 0+080-9+500 to accommodate drainage provisions
       Increase in the provision of slab and pipe culverts through the alignment to accommodate
       storm water flow

3.7 Ethiopian Rural Travel Transport Program

   3.7.1       Wereda Integrated Development Plans in 64 ­ Wereda

The objective of this component was to formulate Wereda Integrated Development Plans
(WIDP) using the integrated rural development and accessibility planning framework of ERTTP.
Development of the plans involves consultation and assessment that considers the overall
development needs of the Wereda, Kebele and communities. The consultancy services were
carried out by eight consultants working in 77 wereda. The study has resulted in preparation of a
ten year Wereda Integrated Development Program that captures both transport and non- transport
interventions to address community access problems. The cumulative status of the studies is
summarized below.

     *Exchange rate used US$1= ETB 8.75 - available at the time of appraisal

     The total project cost for the entire project components under APL I was ETB 1653.8 million at
     the time of appraisal. At completion this cost has increased to ETB 2350.8 million. For the civil
     works (rehabilitation and upgrading of federal/link roads) the reasons for the cost increase are
     summarized as follows:
            The final completion cost of upgrading the Nekemept ­ Mekanejo Road was ETB 523.9
              million. Delays and problems with the original designs explain the cost increases at
              appraisal rising by 42 percent and from the original contract amount rising by 74
              percent.

               The final completion cost of upgrading the Wereta ­ Gob Gob Road was ETB 553.4
               million. Changes of pavement type from DBST to AC due to traffic levels increasing


                                                    55
         significantly, design modifications and substantial increases in design quantities explain
         the cost increases at appraisal rising by 50 percent and from the original contract amount
         rising by 120 percent.

         The final completion cost of upgrading the Adigrat ­ Adi Abun Road was ETB580.4
         million. Widening of the road in three towns sections, provision of dual carriageway for
         Adwa and Adigrat towns and mobilization delays explain the cost increases at appraisal
         rising by 105 percent and from the original contract amount rising by 126 percent.

         The final completion cost of the Nazereth ­ Assela Road was ETB 280.2 million.
         Contract specification problems, flooding on a 2 km section and additional works to
         construct vehicular access and DST asphalt parking lanes explain the cost increases at
         appraisal rising by 38 percent and from the original contract amount rising by 58
         percent.

         Construction of Dera ­ Magna Road showed a reduction in its final completion cost as
         compared to cost at appraisal and original contact agreement. The major reason for the
         reduction was the omission of Chole ­ Magna section (about 20 km) due to instability of
         the escarpment sections and geometric design problems.

         Other components except road financing study and technical audits have also a
         reduction in their final cost as compared to cost at appraisal. The completion cost for
         road financing study and technical audits component increased from appraisal by 160
         percent due to inclusion of the training component after the appraisal.

These factors have increased the overall cost at appraisal of the APL I project components by
about 42 percent.

6.      Assessment of Beneficiaries

Traffic has grown significantly on all of the rehabilitated and upgraded projects under APL I.
There has been substantial traffic growth in public and goods transport services indicating
improved mobility of people and the availability of transport for agricultural and industrial inputs.
Movement of consumer goods to and/or from the affected areas has also increased considerably.
The targeted groups who have benefited through implementation of the APL I and RDSP
include;
     Road users (Pedestrians, IMT/NMV users, motorized road users, non­transport
       structure/services beneficiaries), who has benefited through improved in road surfaces,
       availability of all weather roads and better road safety;
     Producers and Consumers, in the transport of goods to the local markets and
       environmental protection.
     The Domestic Construction Industry, through enhanced opportunities to participate in
       business opportunities;
     Federal, Regional and Local Road agencies, through improved management practice, and




                                                56
          Ministry of Finance and Economic development and the Road Fund Office, through
          greater efficiency in the use of resources and reduced demands placed on the national
          budget for road development and maintenance.

 7        Impact of Intervention on Mobility

 An assessment of traffic along the main roads has revealed a rapid increase in volume of traffic.
 The rate of traffic growth is on average about 9 percent per annum, even where improvement
 works have not yet been completed under the RSDP. The traffic growth in all rehabilitated and
 upgraded projects under APL I has significantly increased. The following table shows the
 comparison of volume of traffic before and after the intervention of the road projects under APL
 I program.

After the intervention, the volume of traffic in each major vehicle category on the roads
substantially increased. In most cases, the traffic movement for buses and truck with trailer has
shown a very significant increase. Movement of cars has also increased significantly, particularly
along the Nazereth ­ Assela and Nekempt ­ Mekanejo roads. The slight reduction of traffic
movement observed along Wereda ­ Gob Gob route for truck and trailer occurred because the
route was under construction in 2008 when it was difficult for trucks with trailer to use the
detour. In general, the volume of traffic has grown and it indicates that the movement of people
and goods has considerably increased along all roads under the APL I program.

8.     Assessment of Borrower and Bank Performance

 8.1   Borrower

The Government of Ethiopia

The road rehabilitation project was initiated by the Government of Ethiopia through the Ministry
of Finance and Economic Development which requested about US$ 181 million from IDA to
support the implementation of the second phase of the Road Sector Development Program.
Accordingly, the IDA Grant No. H0490 was signed with an amount of US$ 126.8 million
between IDA & the Government of Ethiopia on August 27, 2003; and the grant was finally
declared effective on November 14, 2003 after the fulfillment of all of the conditions of
effectiveness. The Government's commitment in meeting its counterpart funds and overall
coordination was exemplary as proved from time to time by the IDA supervision mission.

Implementing Agency

The Ethiopian Roads Authority, the legal authorized agency of the Government, responsible for
management of the country's roads, was the Implementing Agency. For the purposes of the
project, ERA opened and maintained in dollars a special deposit Bank account (IDA USD A/C
No 02615/013146/00) in the National Bank of Ethiopia on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the IDA,

During the project implementation period, ERA assigned suitable counterpart staff to assist with
management and implementation of each component of the project. These staff followed the
project works and ensured that the projects were carried out according to the design and the
agreement made between ERA and the Contractors. The quality and the quantity of the works
performed by contractors and consultants were approved and certified by ERA's Contract
Construction Implementation Division. Accordingly, ERA's Finance Division, with the approval
of IDA had withdrawn the required amount from the Grant Account, and payment was effected
on time to the Contractors and Consultants for their specific services rendered to the project.

During execution of the project, quarterly progress reports were prepared by ERA's Planning and
Programming Division and these were sent to IDA regularly. In order to prevent or reduce


                                               58
problems being encountered during the execution of the project, ERA would conduct regular
meetings with contractors, supervising and project consultants as well as delegation from the
Bank. In addition, ERA evaluated and approved work schedules and performance, material
delivery schedules, on site availability programs for major construction equipment, projected
cash flows, project organization charts and staffing plans that were prepared by the contractors to
ensure practicability and effective utilization of resources.

During the course of implementation, all of the project components were regularly inspected by
ERA and IDA staff and subsequent discussions would be held with the contractors and
supervising consultants.

     8. 2 The World Bank
Lending
The Bank has been supporting the primary objective of the road program which is to restore and
expand Ethiopia's road network, reduce poverty and increase employment through promoting
socially and environmentally sustainable growth and access. Accordingly, IDA agreed to grant to
the Government of Ethiopia, an amount of USD 126.80 million for investment under the second
phase of the road sector development program. The grant covered primarily i) the rehabilitation
and upgrading of priority Federal Roads, ii) rehabilitation and construction of priority Federal
Link roads, and iii) the implementation of the Ethiopian Rural Travel & Transport Program,
along with technical assistance support to ERA and the Addis Ababa Transport Authority.

Supervision
The Bank's team continuously and closely monitored the execution of the various APL I projects.
The team focused on the implementation of the projects, adequacy of the Bank and Government
input for implementation, project restructuring, and the financial status and claims.

During the implementation period supervision missions of the World Bank would undertake field
visits to inspect ongoing and completed works on the road projects and would also carry out
effective supervision on all of the other project components. The reports of the supervision
missions, i.e. submitted by the Task Team Leader to ERA, reflected their thorough assessment;
and the aid memoirs provided detailed advice for improving the performance and correcting any
short-comings. The missions rated as satisfactory progress of the projects toward meeting the
development objectives and moderately satisfactory the implementation progress and the project
management.

9.      Implementation of Safeguards

Following the Ethiopian Roads Authority's full commitment an independent Environmental Unit
was established within its structure in order to mainstream environmental issues in road
infrastructure planning and implementation. Key activities undertaken as new initiatives in the
course of APL I implementation (detail is attached to part II of this report as Attachment 3)
include the following:




                                                59
 (i)    Mainstreaming HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities at the work places of ERA.
        Noticeable is the inclusion of separate costs for the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS
        activities at road construction projects which was started for the first time in APL I road
        projects. The implementations of the prevention activities were regularly monitored by
        independent personnel recruited only for HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities.
        This practice has been extended to all ERA Projects under RSDP.
 (ii)   Inclusion of sociologists and environmentalists as permanent staff in construction
        supervision team. This practice started for the first time on APL I road projects and is
        now extended to all projects.
 (iii) Development of Report Formats. To follow up the implementation of ROW
       Management, HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities, specific reporting formats
       were developed with the World Bank and as part of a quarterly reporting regime.

10.     Lessons Learned

In the course of implementing the APL I road projects, ERA has learned many important lessons,
some of the most important, summarized below:

 (i)    Availability of quality design is crucial for timely delivery of the road and to avoid
        incurring unnecessary additional costs at construction.
 (ii) Close follow up is required for the mobilization of contractors' major resources within
        the stipulated mobilization period. Late mobilization of resources by contractors affects
        the performance of the projects, causes delay and prevents timely delivery of the project.
 (iii) Availability of advisory input to properly handle claims and disputes is necessary.
 (iv) Timely removal of right of way obstructions should be considered as a priority measure
        to prevent delays and to minimize the claims.
 (v) The preparation of Resettlement Action Plans was first started during the appraisal of
        APL I road projects. This has brought a new idea of identifying the exact PAPs and
        calculating affected properties at its replacement costs, which left the PAPs much better
        off.
 (vi) The inclusion of environmentalists and sociologists in the supervision teams has helped
        to provide opportunities to update works contracts with stronger socio-environmental
        clauses.
 (vii) ERA has clearly understood that carrying EIA study alone cannot bring about the
        required results unless key recommendations are captured as items in the BOQ of the
        works contract.
 (viii) Preparing site specific Environmental Management Plans improves the quality of
        monitoring and environmental performance.
 (ix) The 2002 ERA technical specifications lack key environmental clauses. Important
        clauses have been modified for incorporation in future projects.

                 Annex 10. Ex Poste Assessment of Ex Ante Risk Analysis


1.     This annex provides an analysis of the specific risks associated with the project by the
appraisal team.

2.      The Government of Ethiopia (GOE) budget and Road Fund levels may not be kept high
enough to meet the road maintenance needs (M). In practice, it is difficult to assess this risk,
because there is little effort (and perhaps little capacity) in Ethiopia to continuously assess road
maintenance needs on a rolling basis. Road maintenance funding is generally assessed in
relation to revenues available (or likely to be available) rather than a detailed needs assessment
per se. Project and the Ethiopia Road Authority (ERA) staff think that maintenance expenditures
are meeting about 60 percent of needs, but nobody is really sure. While the project did carry out
a maintenance needs assessment for the period 2005-2010 (and an update is just getting
underway funded under the Adaptable Program Loan (APL4)), the results of this study were not
subsequently evaluated against available revenues. Nevertheless, given the size and rate of
growth of the Federal network, it is likely that a moderate rating was understated.

3.      Annual road maintenance program may not be implemented as scheduled (M). Following
the road maintenance study of 2005, an implementation plan or program, was not developed.
Rather, maintenance needs tend to be articulated with respect to funding available. This risk as
articulated made an assumption that there would be a maintenance program to be implemented.

Contractor claims may not be settled on time (M)
4.     This risk was probably rightly assessed at the time of appraisal. Evidence suggests that
ERA's contract management practices in general have been improving; while a specific indicator
on claims has not been tracked, it is likely that claims settlement time would improve as other
aspects of contract management improves as well.

5.     Private sector may not show much interest (M)

6.     Domestic contractors may not be willing to bid for available work (M).

7.     In retrospect, this risk turns out to have been negligible, and probably not particularly
relevant, because the supply of work is plentiful relative to the size of the domestic industry.
Disbursements to domestic contractors has increased from 4.7 percent of all road construction
disbursements in 1998, to 31.5 percent in 2009, and the proportion of contracts captured by
domestic contractors increased from 5.1 percent in 1999 to 17.6 percent in 2009. Currently,
about 27 percent of funds disbursed to private contractors for road construction go to domestic
firms.

Further investments may not have an impact on poverty alleviation (S).
8.     The risk matrix under the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) rated this risk as
substantial. But the "mitigation" measures proposed consist primarily on developing indicators
and mechanisms to monitor project impacts, including the Transport Poverty Observatory. In




                                                63
other words, there were no real mechanisms put in place to ensure that future investments
actually do have an impact on poverty alleviation, merely that the effects be monitored.

9.      That said, the preliminary results from the Trade Promotion Organizations (TPO)
(baseline and first follow-on survey) seem to provide some limited evidence that the road
investments are having a positive impact on poverty alleviation. The number of households in
the project areas with tin rather than thatched roofs (a measure of wealth) increased by about 10
percent over three years, the daily travel distance and time spent traveling by women in the
project areas declined from the baseline, and the number of schools in the area of the road
corridors under study increased by 227 percent.

10.     Material and human resources in implementing agencies may not be available and
capacity adequate as needed (M). This risk turns out to have been validated, but perhaps for
reasons other than what the appraisal team had in mind. ERA did suffer from staff turnover,
particularly at the mid-career level, and this turnover affected the quality of different outputs in
various ways. However, the mitigation measures proposed in the risk mitigation matrix ­
namely, contracting out for additional capacity and institutional strengthening in critical areas ­
suggest that the appraisal team thought the risk might apply more either to junior staff or to areas
of activity wholly new to ERA.

Resettlement Framework paper and Action Plans may not be implemented on time (N)
11.     The PAD risk matrix characterized this as a "negligible" risk. This rating seems to have
been borne out by experience. The risk was real, as this was the first time the ERA was to
prepare and implement resettlement action plans. Perhaps, because of the awareness of the risk,
and its contractual implications in terms of claims for late site possession, actions were taken to
minimize the risk. Result on the ground confirmed that the risk was taken seriously and
addressed.

Delays may occur in procurement, contract processing and implementation (N)
12.    The PAD risk matrix characterized this as a "negligible" risk. In fact, delays in
mobilization and implementation occurred in a number of the works contracts that were procured
under the first stage of the APL. While these delays did not affect the overall quality of the
works or the attainment of the project's objectives, they did ultimately lead to the extension of
the project beyond the initial closing date, and their ubiquity suggests that a "negligible" rating
was overly optimistic.

Contractor performance may not be satisfactory as per contract (M)

13.    This risk was probably well characterized and rated. In practice, most of the contracts
did not finish exactly as per contract, particularly in the area of on-time delivery. Only one
contractor finished the works within the initial contract period; the remainder needed contract
extensions, and the sum total of these extensions necessitated an extension of the project itself.
The mitigation measures proposed, "Contractor post qualification, early and prompt warning of,
penalty clause application for delayed contractors," may have prevented even further delays.

             Annex 11. Transport Poverty Observatory Status and Findings

1. Introduction

In addition to the extensive monitoring assessment of the RSDP using more than 60 indicators
(Roads and MDG-related), the Ethiopian Roads Authority, in collaboration with the WB, has
initiated the "Transport and Poverty Observatory" study in four selected road corridors
located in different parts of the country. The target corridors are: Woreta-Woldya, Dera-
Mechara, Assosa-Guba, and Alemgena-Butajira-Sodo Road corridors.
Thus the following section of this status report presents the objective of the initiative,
summarized findings of the study, the financial status, and the way forward to the reaming
services at hand.

2. Overall Objective

The overall purpose of this initiative is to monitor the poverty reducing impacts of road project
investments at local community and at household level in the Ethiopia RSDP road-rations.

3. Overall Accomplishment

On the basis of the base line survey which was conducted on April 2005, a large number of
monitoring indicators have been provided, classified into direct and indirect impacts as well as
short, medium and long-term in relation to the time frame of realizing the impacts. Finally,
monitoring indicators were selected on the basis of availability and reliability of information
without going into the conceptual and methodological issues. A set of 35 monitoring indicators is
given, comprising largely of 10 direct indicators and 25 indirect indicators, having impact on and
reflecting the growth of the economy, its diversification and socio-economic welfare of the
people.

In accordance with the service contract agreement the Consultant has performed various tasks in
the last two years; and has submitted an Inception Report, First Year and Second Year
Preliminary Findings and Monitoring Updating Reports.

The Preliminary Findings Reports Outlines, the preliminary first year and second year
poverty impact analysis based on the comparison of findings from the baseline (2005) and the
follow-on survey (2007). These reports comprise of:
     A general introduction to the study. This part has been literally taken from the baseline
       report with minor adjustments.
     The general poverty profile of the country and the project road corridor Regional States
       in terms of the income (monetary) non-income (non-monetary), as well as temporal and
       spatial dimensions of poverty.
     Survey design and methodology along with the sample size.
     A conceptual framework for the study of poverty impact analysis in the context of
       transport operations.




                                               65
       The report also presents the results of the households survey carried out in the project
       influence area of all the four corridors. The survey results at the house hold level have
       been aggregated at the village/town level, classified by male and female head of
       households. The results are presented for each project road corridor separately, classified
       by rural and urban divide.

Concerning the Monitoring Update Reports, since the poverty impact assessment of road
improvement and transport operations covers a large range of issues; a large set of variables was
collected. And the relevant monitoring indicators were organized in three broad categories as:
     Transport Operations Output Indicators: covering vehicle operating costs, travel time,
        fares and freight rate(s) of transport, accessibility of services, and frequency of trips.
     Transport Operations Outcome Indicators: including access to jobs, markets,
        commodities and services, health and education facilities, and narrowing down rural­
        urban inequality (disparity) as well as price differential.
     Welfare or Living Standards Outcome Indicators: comprising incomes, literacy,
        health status, house structure, etc.
 Generally these reports presents the findings from the assessment of the trends in the updating of
the transport operations out put indicators for the first year of analysis (2007).

   6. The Study to Continue for the Coming Three Years
   Up to the end of this quarter of the fiscal year, about 50 percent of the contract time has been
   elapsed; half of the financial resource and also half of the total service were accomplished. The
   3rd year survey is in progress. But as the service is under APL -I package and since this grant is
   closed by December 31, 2009, there is a need of financial amendment to finance the remaining
   works according to the supplementary agreement made on the of October 9, 2007.
