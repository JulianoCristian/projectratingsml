to\n            assist the Korean National Railways (KNR) to increase\n            transport efficiency and capacity of rail services in the\n            Seoul-Busan Corridor. The loan funds would help finance part\n            of a Management Improvement Program to be implemented over\n            the l985-88 period. KNR's program includes: (a)\n            institutional and policy measures aimed mainly at ensuring\n            long-term economic and financial viability of the railways\n            by further improving services that are most profitable; (b)\n            measures to improve intermodal complementarity and railway\n            competitiveness and to prepare the ground for a high speed\n            train, a major capacity increase to be introduced in the\n            90s; and (c) capacity expansion through resignalling and\n            central traffic control between Suweon and Daegu on the\n            Seoul Busan Corridor, and related rolling stock and\n            equipment, providing over one-third more trains more safely\n            and at faster speed."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
