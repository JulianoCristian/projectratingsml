This environmental assessment (EA) reviews the legal\n            framework on indigenous rights, which articulates social\n            promotion, and guaranteed access to justice, particularly\n            addressing their legal practices, and customs on land\n            ownership, and tenure rights. The EA examines the cultural\n            diversity, and socioeconomic profiles in the area, drawing\n            strategic lines based on consultations with indigenous\n            communities, and on institutional capacity to execute\n            environmental planning. Mitigation measures will be staged\n            between the years 2001-2004 as follows. Organizational\n            capacity will be strengthened, by sharing experiences,\n            preparing communal technical tables for management, and\n            administrative practices within participatory approaches.\n            Sustainable production, and conservation will be promoted\n            through training on agro-ecology, forestry management, and\n            organic production, aiming at stabilizing, promoting, and\n            marketing basic production. Access to environmental programs\n            will be ensured, within the institutional framework, and\n            monitoring/evaluation systems."}, "docdt": "2000-11-21T17:14:00Z"}
