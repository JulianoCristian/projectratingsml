1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background

1.      Mexico is classified as one of the world’s top five “mega-diverse” countries:1 it
represents approximately 12% of the world’s biodiversity, compared to only 1.5% of its
land surface, and has high levels of endemism.2 At the national level, however, only
about 12.9% of priority terrestrial sites for biodiversity actually coincide with federal,
state and municipal natural reserves (3.91% of national territory).3 This is also true in
south and southeast Mexico: its Mesoamerican region.4 Mesoamerica is considered a
global “hotspot” in terms of biodiversity; it has a high level of species richness and is also
one of the most threatened5 regions in the world.

2.      The four states of the project area (Chiapas, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Yucatan)
comprise a variety of high-priority ecoregions and biomes, including Tehuantepec and
Yucatan moist forests, Yucatan dry forests,6 Quintana Roo wetlands, and Chiapas
temperate cloud forests.7 Flora and fauna in these states show a significant proportion of
endemic species and a variety of ecosystems of high priority for conservation: lowland
rainforests, cloud forests, dry forests, wetlands and savannas. Among these, the
ecosystems bordering the Guatemalan and Belizean territory constitute the largest mass
of continuous forest ecosystems in all of Mexico and Mesoamerica. The mosaics of
different ecosystems and different age patches within each of these ecosystems constitute
a unique laboratory of ecological relations and are of strategic importance for continuing
speciation and sheltering of species in the face of the continuing reduction of forest cover
and global climate change.

1
  There are more than 170 countries in the world. Of these, 12 alone harbor between 60% and 70% of the planet’s total biodiversity
and thus earn the privilege of being called mega-diverse. Mexico is one of them. Mexico, together with Brazil, Colombia and
Indonesia, is considered one of the most bio-diverse countries, ranking first place in reptile diversity, second in mammals, fourth in
amphibians and vascular plants and tenth in birds.
2
  Endemism is the ecological state of being unique to a particular geographic location, such as a specific island, habitat type, nation or
other defined zone. To be endemic to a place or area means that it is found only in that part of the world and nowhere else. Endemism
reported on the national level: 50–60% of plant species (15,000 species); 32% of mammals; 10% of birds; 57% of reptiles; and 65% of
amphibians. Ref: CONABIO. 2006. Capital natural y bienestar social. Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la

  Mesoamerica or Meso-America is a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Prehistoric groups in this area are characterized by agricultural villages and large ceremonial
and political-religious capitals. This cultural area included some of the most complex and advanced cultures of the Americas,
including the Olmec, Teotihuacan, Maya and Aztec.
5
  www.biodiversityhotspots.org/ of the world’s twenty-five biologically richest and most threatened ecosystems the Mesoamerican
forests comprise the third largest among the world’s hotspots. Their spectacular endemic species include quetzals, howler monkeys,
and 17,000 plant species. The region is also a corridor for many neotropical migrant bird species. The hotspot’s montane forests are
important for amphibians, many endemic species of which are in dramatic decline due to an interaction among habitat loss, fungal
disease and climate change.
6
  The Yucatan Peninsula boasts an impressive diversity of flora and fauna: over 900 plant species and 200 animal species have been
found in a hectare of tropical evergreen forest, some 70 species of herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles), 320 species of birds and
120 species of mammals are known to inhabit the peninsula.
7
  The temperate clouds forests in Chiapas are an ecosystem that covers 1% of the national territory but contains 10% of the country’s
floral diversity.



                                                                    1
3.       In addition to the biological importance of the project’s area in its own right, these
ecosystems form part of a critical link in the Regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor
(RMBC). The concept of a regional eight-country initiative was discussed at the Rio Summit in
1992. In 1994 the University of Florida published a report on the feasibility of establishing a
corridor in Central America. The agreement formalizing the commitment of the region to
establish a corridor linking five states in Mexico with Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama was signed in February 1997 and officially adopted at the
Presidents’ Summit in July 1997.8

4.      Historically, Mexico’s many indigenous groups played an important role in
shaping the region’s biodiversity; they have domesticated a great array of plants,
maintaining a high degree of genetic variation (including semi-domestic forms) and the
knowledge on how to use the domesticated plants’ wild relatives. This process is strongly
linked to traditional patterns of land use, in which genetic exchange with wild relatives
plays an important role in maintaining genetic variability and agro-biodiversity.

5.      At appraisal, primary threats to natural resources and biodiversity in this region
resulting from human activities included large-scale conversion of forests and other
pristine ecosystems to agriculture as a stepping-stone to extensive cattle ranching (this
process has been particularly intense in the tropical lowlands) and uncontrolled tourism
development and overfishing along the coasts of Quintana Roo, Yucatan and Campeche.

6.      The hypothesis was that these practices resulted from the interplay of two major
forces: on the one hand, the demand for development opportunities and activities
expressed by communities residing in the project area; and, on the other hand, the supply
of development programs provided by government agencies. Without the integration of
biodiversity considerations in both of these forces, many of the activities would result in
continuing threats to biodiversity.

Government Actions

7.      At appraisal, priority natural resources management conservation challenges for
Mexico included: (i) high deforestation rate (one of the highest in Latin America); (ii)
unsustainable land use practices, including slash-and-burn agriculture and extensive cattle
ranching; (iii) unsustainable levels of exploitation and loss of habitat for aquatic
resources; (iv) unsustainable tourism development and increased urbanization; (v) limited
participation of rural populations in conservation and natural resources management
efforts; and (vi) loss of biodiversity and agro-biodiversity.

8.     To address these threats, key courses of action that the Government of Mexico
(GOM) pursued included: the consolidation of the Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources9 (SEMARNAT); a strategic shift toward increased decentralization of
environmental management to states and municipalities; the development of an integrated

 The Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Fishing (SEMARNAP) was established in 1994; it was converted into the
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) in 2000.

model of sustainable development with a regional focus (PRODERs); increased public
participation; and a stronger commitment to international environmental issues and the
global commons.

9.       A key step toward institutional coordination in order to put the above into practice
came with the 1998 signing of a framework agreement—“Foundations for Inter-
institutional Collaboration” (Bases de Colaboración Inter-institucional)—by the
Ministries of Environment (SEMARNAT), Agriculture (SAGARPA), Social
Development (SEDESOL), Transport (SCT) and Agrarian Reform (SRA), to be later
joined by the Ministries of Education (SEP), Health (SSA) and Trade (SECOFI). The
agreement represented ministerial commitments to join efforts in promoting sustainable
development in priority regions of the country. Moreover, in early 1999, in an effort to
mitigate damages from recent natural disasters (forest fires and floods) and to prevent
future ones, the President of Mexico launched a countrywide initiative to promote the
adoption of more environmentally conscious agricultural practices. For southeastern
Mexico (one of the areas most vulnerable to natural and human-induced environmental
degradation), this initiative was a good opportunity to move toward a path of sustainable
development.

10.      However, the GOM faced obstacles to achieving the harmonization of the
different agencies’ programs and implementing integrated, on-the-ground interventions
that demonstrated the incorporation of biodiversity criteria into policy instruments. Chief
among these obstacles was the lack of a unifying mechanism through which to reorient
public expenditures along with the demand and supply of sustainable development
initiatives. The creation of the Mexico Mesoamerican Biological Corridor using GEF
resources proposed to meet this need, to induce in the medium to long term a much wider
adoption of on-the-ground, tested practices compatible with biodiversity conservation and
sustainable use.

Rationale for Bank Assistance and GEF Involvement

11.      At the time of appraisal, the Bank had been assisting the GOM in the conceptual analysis
of institutional coordination and regional development through Economic and Sector Work and in
piloting, under the Rural Development in Marginal Areas Adaptable Program Loan (APL),10
institutional mechanisms (such as regional councils) to promote participatory, decentralized
management of rural development programs. Other natural resource management projects
supported by the Bank at the time (Community Forestry Project P007700, closed in December
2003; On-Farm and Minor Irrigation Networks Improvement Project P007701, closed in March
2002) contributed to strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework for sustainable
natural resources management.

12.    In line with the government actions described above, at the time of appraisal the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, June 1999) for Mexico identified three themes
central to the support provided by the World Bank Group to Mexico: i) social
sustainability, ii) removing obstacles to sustainable growth, and iii) effective public

10
   The Bank’s Rural Development in Marginal Areas APL was implemented under the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural
Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) in two phases (P007711 and P057530).

administration. Within this broad framework, the CPS identified several priority areas for
intervention by the Bank in the environmental sector, which guided the project: i)
institutional development, ii) decentralization of environmental management, iii)
improved management of natural resources (e.g., forests, water and biodiversity), and iv)
design of sector policies.

13.     With the support of various GEF operations, the World Bank assisted in
strengthening the institutional policy and infrastructure responsible for the system of
protected natural areas in Mexico, including the creation of a trust fund with resources
from the pilot phase of the GEF. The purpose of this corridor project was to help the
government to address the sustainable management of biodiversity beyond these
protected areas. GEF funds for this project have augmented those already invested, in
order to focus on biological corridors as a complementary strategy for biodiversity
conservation. The involvement of the GEF is justified on the basis of the project’s
innovative approach to the integration of biodiversity criteria into development programs,
and to biodiversity management within a productive landscape. During the
implementation of the RMBC, together with its regional partners Mexico promoted the
formation of an integrated system composed of protected areas. The MMBC strategy
focuses on connectors for the conservation and sustainable management of natural
resources, including biodiversity, in the natural and productive landscapes surrounding
natural protected areas of southern Mexico.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

Original Global Environmental Objective

14.     The project’s global environmental objective is the conservation and sustainable
use of globally significant biodiversity in five11 biological corridors in southeast Mexico,
through the mainstreaming of biodiversity criteria in public expenditure and in selected
local planning and development practices.

15.    At appraisal, the project was one of the first in the world to apply the innovative
corridor concept for the purpose of biodiversity conservation hand-in-hand with
sustainable local development. It covers a total of approximately 6.8 million hectares of
land and 448,798 hectares of sea surface in the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Quintana
Roo, and Yucatan, and it connects the habitats of 23 protected areas (2.86 million
hectares).
Key Indicators

16.     The project’s key performance indicators for outputs and outcomes were included
in the PAD (p. 8), as follows:


11
   Note: Although the PAD logframe mentions six corridors, the PAD Project Development Objective states five corridors.
Unfortunately, the document’s logframe was not updated after the Tabasco Corridor was dropped during the preparation, and the
project focused on the remaining five corridors and four states.



                                                             4
     a) After seven years, in focal areas (15% of the Corridor’s12 total surface):
          i.    Rate of native habitat loss is decreased, and/or area under native
                vegetation cover is increased (with specific targets varying across
                individual focal areas);
         ii.    Degree of perturbation of populations of corridor-specific indicator
                species (e.g., selected birds, mammals, insects, plants) is decreased.

     b) Communities (and/or producer groups) in focal areas are engaged in different
        forms of local planning (depending on levels of organization) aimed at
        conservation and sustainable use:
           i.  Awareness raising (in at least 80% of communities);13
          ii.  Problem assessment (in at least 50% of communities);
         iii. Priority setting (in at least 30% of communities);
         iv.   Development of action plans (in at least 10% of communities)

     c) In focal areas, no more than 30% to 50% (depending on each focal area) of
        production (in area or producers) is associated with selected, high-impact resource
        use practices detrimental to biodiversity (e.g., uncontrolled use of fire in
        agriculture, inadequate waste disposal, overfishing, overhunting) in native
        ecosystems.

     d) In focal areas, at least 30% to 50% (depending on individual focal areas) of
        production (in percentage of area, or of producers or value) is generated by
        financially sustainable, biodiversity-friendly practices of natural resources use
        (forest products, honey, maize, vegetables, ecotourism activities, etc.) in the
        productive landscape.

     e) In the various corridors, at least 40% of existing and new public programs and at
        least 20% of public spending with impacts on the natural resource base take into
        account biodiversity considerations, including:
           i.   Programs reoriented from potentially harmful to biodiversity-friendly or -
                neutral activities;
          ii.   Programs actively promoting activities aimed at the sustainable use of
                biodiversity.

   “Corridor” is used to refer to: the collective area of the five different corridors included in the project, the project itself, and as a
recognized concept/initiative within Mexico. On the other hand, “corridor” is used to refer to the individual corridors included in the
project or the associated concepts and strategies that are applicable in any location, not just within the project areas or in Mexico.
13
   The estimate of the number of communities referred to in original targets as 80, 50, 30 and 10% is based on the PAD reference of
130 target communities in focal areas: 80% = 104 communities; 50%=65 communities; 30%=39 communities and 10%=13
communities.



                                                                    5
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

18.     The project’s main beneficiaries were communities and rural producer groups.
The project’s global environmental objective was the conservation and sustainable use of
globally significant biodiversity through mainstreaming of biodiversity criteria in public
expenditure in strategic lines, as defined in PAD Annex 7, by strengthening of productive
practices of indigenous and rural populations to be compatible with conservation,
including the production of aggregate value from local raw material. Among others, the
project supported agroforestry and forest management activities, including chicle gum,
vanilla and organic coffee production as well as apiculture.

19.     Producers who live in the corridors were specifically targeted by project activities
that promoted conservation and sustainable development. In these areas, most are
organized in ejidos and indigenous communities. Indigenous peoples benefited in
particular,14 because they live in areas that still maintain extensive forest cover in
southeast Mexico; they are considered the strongest allies in the conservation process due
to their broad knowledge of the natural resource base and its uses. As anticipated during
project design (see PAD), mestizo15 people also benefited from the project; in many cases
they manage forestry and agroforestry systems that are recognized for playing an
important role in biodiversity conservation. Those who derive their livelihood from
ecotourism and ethnotourism also benefited through the project’s promotion of
biodiversity and cultural diversity conservation.

20.     Because the project focused on enhanced biodiversity conservation by developing
and testing a bioregional approach to biodiversity management (e.g., improved
ecological, biological and genetic connectivity of fragmented habitats), its activities also
incorporated institutional-level beneficiaries throughout implementation (thus
contributing to future national, regional and global replication and adaptation of the
project’s corridor model):

             i.      The research community and NGOs16 with environmental and social
                     objectives aimed at promoting biodiversity conservation and various forms
                     of sustainable use of natural resources benefited from the project’s
                     reorientation of public expenditure in support of their common goals;

   Predominantly Maya. In Calakmul also Chol, Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Zoque, Nahua Mame, Lacandón, Mestizos, Mam, Mochó,
Cakchiquel, Kanjobal, Tojolabal and Totonaco. See Ethnicity in table in Annex 2. Outputs by component.
15
   Mestizo literally means half-breed. In Mexico it refers to everyone—in this case peasants—who do not belong to an indigenous
group or are not of European ancestry.

             ii.     Federal, state and municipal governments17 increasingly interested in
                     conservation (through the provision of training and technical assistance)
                     benefited, particularly on a national level, from project activities that
                     helped to stabilize agricultural frontiers in primarily tropical forest areas of
                     the Yucatan Peninsula and Chiapas and to maintain ecosystem integrity
                     through sustainable natural resource management subprojects. This was
                     one of the first projects to employ the innovative concept of biological
                     corridors to target biodiversity conservation along with sustainable local
                     development. Experiences from and lessons learned during project
                     implementation will contribute to future national, regional and global
                     applications and adaptations of the biological corridor model.

1.5 Original Components (as approved):

21.    The project had four components: (A) Design and Monitoring of Biological
Corridors; (B) Corridor Integration into Development Programs; (C) Sustainable Use of
Biological Resources; and (D) Project Management and Coordination. Total project costs
at appraisal amounted to US$90.05 million, with US$14.84 million from the GEF
(expressed as 11.5 million SDR in the original Grant Agreement), US$1.24 million from
CONABIO, US$0.29 million from project beneficiaries, US$2.44 million from GTZ,18
US$66.99 million from the Government of Mexico, and US$4.25 million from IBRD.19

Component A. Design and Monitoring of Biological Corridors (US$5.91 million,
GEF US$4.26 million)

22.     The objective of this component was to finance the detailed definition of priorities
in the focal areas for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, through processes
of participatory community planning, and on the basis of expert scrutiny of
biological/ecological field and cartographic information. It financed the establishment
and operation of an integrated monitoring and evaluation system to track project
performance through monitoring bio-ecological, socioeconomic and institutional
indicators at the corridor and focal area levels.




17
   Government participants included CONABIO Dirección de Análisis y Prioridades, Banchiapas, Secretaría de Medio Ambiente de
Chiapas, Secretaría de Desarrollo Urbano y Medio Ambiente de Yucatán, SEMARNAT, Instituto Nacional de Ecología (INE),
Comisión Nacional de Áreas Protegidas, Instituto de Historia Natural del Estado Chiapas. (IHNE).
18
   GTZ cofinancing focused on the promotion of economy and commerce, state modernization and environmental protection. GTZ
collaborates in the region’s Indigenous Peoples Sector Network on Rural Development/Management of Natural Resources, through
the Coordination Office for Indigenous Peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean.
19
   PAD Annex 4. Incremental Cost: “it is estimated that some US$4.25 million would be financed by the World Bank Loan ‘Rural
Development in Marginal Areas’, which includes in its list of target areas two regions in Chiapas comprised in the Corridor project
area.” The Bank’s Rural Development in Marginal Areas APL was implemented under the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural
Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) in two phases (P007711 and P057530) without having cofinanced MMBC activities.



                                                                7
23.      Specific activities financed under this component included:

      a) Analyzing relevant existing information to design and implement biological
         connectors, with a focus on biological data, current land use patterns, user rights
         and the role of agro-biodiversity.

      b) Involving stakeholders in local planning for the management of biodiversity in
         focal areas to be implemented according to a typology of community capacities
         and organization designed for the project (PAD, Annex 11). This activity
         specifically included: (i) raising awareness among stakeholders on the economic
         and environmental benefits of the corridors; (ii) promoting the assessment of
         natural resource management problems and issues; (iii) assisting in the definition
         of priorities for natural resource and biodiversity management; and (iv) natural
         resource management strategies at community and organizational levels (local,
         regional).

      c) Implementing a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) protocol at different scales
         with a geographic information system (GIS) that integrates biological, ecological,
         socioeconomic and institutional information. It includes both formal scientific
         aspects and evaluation of change by project beneficiaries. Implementation of the
         M&E protocol will entail the establishment of baselines for the project’s
         indicators. This will be done by gathering, organizing, analyzing and validating
         existing data (biological, ecological, socioeconomic and institutional) on corridors
         and focal areas. Only when required data are not available would the project
         finance the ad hoc generation of baseline information.

Component B. Corridor Integration into Development Programs (US$71.72 million,
GEF US$3.98 million)

24.     The objective of this component was to remove institutional, technical and
informational barriers that prevent the adoption, in regular rural development programs,
of win-win natural resources and biodiversity management options. At appraisal,
Mexico’s Federal Government funded about 50 programs for social, agricultural and
infrastructure development (some with state and/or municipal counterparts) in the project
area. An analysis undertaken during preparation showed that at least half of them had
direct relationships with the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and
biodiversity. To account for the variation across corridors (biodiversity relevance of the
individual programs and the institutional, technical and political opportunities for their
reorientation), the implementation modalities of this component were made specific to
the characteristics of each corridor and its areas of intervention.

25.    Specific activities financed by this component included: (i) studies and
consultations to analyze the positive and negative biodiversity impacts of development
programs; (ii) development and periodic update of corridor strategies in individual
corridors, agreed upon at the level of the State Corridor Council (SCC) created by the



                                              8
project and addressing short-, medium- and long-term threats and opportunities in order
to promote conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, taking into account the
results of studies on biodiversity impacts, and current patterns of government programs
for rural development in the corridors; (iii) institutional strengthening, capacity-building
and awareness-raising activities, such as appropriate training of public officials, to
promote provisions for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity for inclusion in
selected state and municipal development plans; and (iv) technical assistance to redesign
development programs shown to have actual or potential negative biodiversity impacts,
field-test modified programs, incorporate biodiversity indicators into M&E systems of
development programs, and prepare and disseminate lessons learned.

26.     Activities under this component were financed at no more than 80% by the GEF
(with the exception of corridor strategies that could be financed 100% considering their
importance to kick off the mainstreaming process). However, GEF resources would be
incremental to baseline government funding of much larger amounts (with estimated
ratios of 1 to 20), which were to be reoriented in biodiversity-compatible directions as a
result of the project’s interventions.

Component C. Sustainable Use of Biological Resources (US$9.31 million, GEF
US$4.01 million)

27.     The objective of this component was to develop an integrated approach to
promote sustainable use of biodiversity in focal areas within the five selected corridors.
The approach included activities aimed at: (i) maintaining native ecosystems (forests,
coastal ecosystems, marshes, etc.), wildlife viewing, studies of population dynamics for
targeted wild species (native only), rule establishment for ecotourism, forest enrichment
with desirable species, extraction schemes for NTFP, etc.; (ii) restoring degraded
ecosystems, such as the restoration of water flow to original ecosystems (wetlands,
marshes known as “ciénagas” in the region), planting of native trees in patches of
vegetation that are isolated and not close to a river (called “petenes” in the Mayan
regions), reforestation with native species compatible with biodiversity conservation
objectives, pilots for rebuilding dunes by replanting with native species, etc.; and (iii)
developing the sustainable use of biological resources in productive landscapes, such as
capacity building for alternative use of wood products (non-timber species),
establishment of rules for extraction of ornamental plants, sustainable use of plant
biodiversity in home gardens, tests of native species as cover crops, pilot projects for the
improved use of local species and varieties (fauna and flora), studies on market access for
organic products and/or “sustainably managed” biological resources, certification, etc.

28.      Specific activities in this component included:

      a) Capacity building and training programs on sustainable use of biological
         resources for producers and their organizations’ front-line agents. These included
         workshops, field visits, short study tours, networking by producers, specific
         training in the development of organizational capacity and managerial skills,
         particularly for vulnerable groups such as women and indigenous peoples, for a



                                              9
         total amount of about US$0.6 million supported by the GEF grant;

      b) Studies at rural community level to identify practical steps in the implementation
         of community- and producer group-based subprojects, including constraints and
         opportunities for developing biodiversity-friendly markets, and fine-tuning of
         selected practices to specific biophysical, social and cultural conditions. Studies
         and capacity building were considered barrier-removal activities and were
         therefore financed 100% by the GEF;

      c) Development and implementation of pilot projects for the sustainable use of
         biodiversity. Pilot projects were to be demand driven, on the basis of broad
         categories of eligible expenditure, and were to be financed by GEF resources
         either at 80% or at 33%, depending on a) the level of organization of the
         requesting community or other legal entity, and b) the presence of vulnerable
         groups. (See PAD, Annex 2.)

Component D. Project Management and Coordination (US$3.10 million, GEF
US$2.59 million)

29.     This component financed the establishment and operation of a National Technical
Unit (NTU), and of two Regional Technical Units (RTU) (one for Chiapas; one for the
Yucatan Peninsula: Campeche, Yucatan and Quintana Roo), as well as operational costs
of the National Corridor Council and State Corridor Councils.

30.     The RTUs were responsible for day-to-day management of project activities,
ensuring compliance with project objectives and procedures, procurement, reporting to
the NTU, informing the National Corridor Council and State Corridor Councils about
project progress and operation, and taking into account their recommendations.

31.     The NTU, in coordination with the RTUs, prepared and executed the
Consolidated Annual Operational and Budget Plan (AOP), based on annual corridor
operational plans proposed by the Regional Units. The NTU ensured the liaison between
the project and related activities in the broader Mesoamerican Corridor initiative.

1.6 Revised Components

32.      Not applicable (no revisions)

1.7 Other significant changes

33.     Effectiveness. The Grant Agreement was signed on November 30, 2000, on the
last day of the then out-going GOM administration, followed by three extensions of
effectiveness (original date: February 28, 2001) until the project was declared effective




                                             10
on January 30, 2002.20 Three amendments were made to the Grant Agreement
(November 2001, September 2004, November 2005), as follows:

34.     First amendment (November 2001): The integration of the State and National
Corridor Councils (SCCs and NCC, respectively) with representatives from state and
municipal governments as well as local producers, as a condition of project effectiveness,
was revised to specify that only the eight state and municipal membership positions in
each SCC needed to be filled before the project could access GEF grant resources.21 This
allowed the Project Coordination Unit to access resources to carry out consultation
workshops (with rural producers, NGOs, academia and the private sector) in order to
achieve the full SCC representation, but which had not been conducted during the final
stages of project preparation. The consultation workshops were held between 2002 (after
the project became effective in January 2002) and 2004.

35.    Second amendment (September 2004): The amendment included the
redenomination of GEF funds, originally expressed in terms of SDR (Special Drawing
Rights), to United States dollars (USD). The amount of GEF grant for the project was
from then on quoted as US$14,840,000.

36.    Third amendment (November 20, 2005): With the results of the External
Evaluation conducted as part of the Midterm Review process, changes included:

     a) The trigger indicators (signaling transition of the project from phase I to phase II)
        were adjusted.
     b) Changes were made to the schedule of expenditures based on project progress.
     c) The term “primary tropical moist forest”, used in the Grant Agreement and the
        Implementation Letter, was aligned with 2002 OP/BP 4.36, Forests Safeguard
        Policy.
     d) Funding for expenditure categories “goods,” “consultant services and training,”
        “subprojects” and “operating costs” was increased to 100%.
     e) The amount of GEF resources available for each subproject was increased from
        US$20,000 to US$50,000, which led to the adjustment of the target of 565 total
        subprojects to 120 (Operating Rules, Annex 4).
     f) The Procurement and Consultant Guidelines, May 2004 edition, were officially
        adopted.
     g) The project’s focal area concept was expanded: “focal area” means a locality,
        identified in the Implementation Letter as a “Phase I” or “Phase II” area, and
        located within a biological corridor and any other locality to be agreed between
        CONABIO and the Bank.




20
   Project effectiveness was delayed for over one year due to what proved to be an incorrect design assumption. The need for an
amendment was identified by the new task manager appointed in September 2001, during his first mission that same month. The
project became effective in January 2002. (For further details, see ISR #6. 09/26/2003.)
21
   While this condition was meant to achieve broader participation from civil society from the start, it proved to be unrealistic and
turned into an obstacle. The amendment granted CONABIO access to GEF resources to complete the task for which it could not or
would not devote its own resources.



                                                                11
37.     It is important to re-emphasize that throughout all the three amendments, the
Project’s Objectives and Key Indicators as specified in the PAD, were never revised or
amended through the formal Bank procedures. This is not surprising given the fact that,
as summarized above in paragraphs 32-34, the amendments were not meant to address
the indicators.

Project Extensions

38.     On January 22, 2007, the project closing date was extended from June 30, 2008 to
December 31, 2009. This request was made by the GOM, taking into consideration new
projections of implementation progress based on the improved performance of the new
Project Coordination Unit appointed by the GOM after the Midterm Review to turn
around the project’s unsatisfactory performance at that time.

Reallocation

39.     As a result of the extension of the project closing date, authorized by the World
Bank and the GEF, the GOM (through SEMARNAT) agreed to provide compensation for
local staff during 2008 and 2009, thus making more resources from the GEF grant
available for equipment and subprojects. In light of this, a request was made to reallocate
“unallocated” funds from the grant and the remainder available in “goods.” This request
was approved by the World Bank (Table 1).

40.     A standard four-month grace period was approved by the Bank in 2009 in order
for the Borrower to submit documentation for expenses incurred prior to the December
31, 2009 closing date. By the end of this period (April 30, 2010), NAFIN submitted
documentation supporting total disbursement of the grant (US$14.84 million) including
the special account (US$650,000).

       2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

       2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

       Project preparation

       41.     A large body of research and scientific evidence was produced or gathered to
       strengthen the project concept, which was innovative and carried a number or risks,
       including the challenge to communicate project objectives to the GOM agencies involved
       in rural development, and the lack of information on sustainable practices.

       42.      A cross-sectoral coordination experience became the foundation of the corridor
       approach: the Foundations for Inter-institutional Collaboration Agreement was signed in
       1998 to coordinate regional and rural development efforts from the Ministries of
       Environment (SEMARNAT), Agriculture (SAGARPA), Social Development
       (SEDESOL) and six other ministries. In the September 28, 2000 PAD Review Meeting
       minutes, it was agreed that the overall risk rating for the project should be “Substantial”
       given the change in GOM administration, and the project team was advised to consult
       with the new administration in order to ensure its support for the project. This seminal
       initiative was discontinued when the GOM administration changed (December 1, 2000).

       Lessons learned and incorporated




                                                        13
43.     Lessons learned regarding institutional development and the broader policy
environment led to the identification of key activities: Resources for training of officials
at different levels were budgeted; the policy environment was to be systematically
improved through the promotion of public participation to strengthen social organizations
and build capacities on sustainable development. The project built on the experience of
the Technical Advisory Committees of the Protected Areas and adopted State Corridor
Councils as participatory and transparent forums at the corridor level to make decisions
on strategic aspects of the projects.

44.    Similarly, the main lesson of working with small rural producer organizations is
that one must identify the existing patterns of natural resource management and build on
them, combining local traditional knowledge with modern technology and working
together in search of technological alternatives that are appropriate for current
socioeconomic conditions. In addition, it is important to provide support and incentives to
improve crop marketing.

Corridor design22

45.     Workshops conducted with stakeholders in the four participating states
(Campeche, Quintana Roo, Chiapas and Yucatan) included discussions on the project’s
goals and components and were held with officials of federal and state institutions, NGOs
involved in environmental issues, academia and local producers. Workshops were also
organized with experts to identify criteria for Corridor design and potential project focal
areas in order to develop pilot subprojects with the communities.

46.      Corridor consultation groups in each state also contributed to the creation of an
agreed list of sustainable development subprojects to be financed with project resources
and eventually lead to the creation of the State Corridor Councils (SCCs), with
institutional, social and private sector participation.

47.     To ensure the continued participation of stakeholders and officials throughout
project implementation, workshops were designed for officials, partners, small producers
and rural organizations to share experiences, combine local traditional knowledge with
modern technology, and publicize relevant economic incentives, fair trade and niche
market opportunities.

Social Considerations

48.     A social assessment (SA) was performed for each of the corridors, with special
attention to indigenous peoples and gender, including participatory workshops with
communities with the support and participation of social specialists. As a result of the
social assessment, five key issues were identified for project implementation:

          •    the need to consider the region as a living space

22
   Although the process of appointing representatives to the corridor councils was not completed during preparation, numerous
meetings were held with stakeholders, officials and experts who contributed to the project design.



                                                            14
          •     the relationship between local culture and environment
          •     land tenure and distribution
          •     economic activities
          •     social organization

49.     Of the total 1,163,490 inhabitants living within Corridor areas, 45% are
indigenous: 23 indigenous languages are spoken, eight of which originate in the region.23
An Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) (see PAD, Annex 12) was formulated in order to
ensure that local indigenous peoples would be able to participate in the project, receive
culturally compatible benefits and not be negatively impacted by project activities. The
studies conducted as part of the SA analyzed the degree of organization of the indigenous
groups and opportunities to increase their access to improved technologies applicable to
their management and use of natural resources. The following key factors were identified
to enhance indigenous peoples’ effective participation in the project: a) strengthening of
social organization; b) training in legal issues (such as land tenure); c) promotion of a
gender approach to the generation and distribution of income and to community decision
making; and d) enhancement of their technical capacity to manage sustainable
development projects.

50.     In response to the SA’s results, a special window was created to finance pilot
projects presented by vulnerable groups (such as indigenous communities and women’s
groups), representing approximately 10% of total project resources during project
implementation. This special window was created due to the low level of organization
among some 70% of these vulnerable groups, in order to improve their access to
resources to fund their sustainable development initiatives. Project design also envisaged
their access to project resources through capacity-building workshops, pilot projects,
studies and involvement in local planning activities for biodiversity management in focal
areas. In the end, the project design took into account differences in the degree of
organization of stakeholder communities and groups by creating and applying a typology
that included a spectrum from weak (type 1a) organization to strong (type 2b)
organization. (See PAD, Annex 11.)

51.     Taking into consideration the particular conditions of one project focal area—La
Cojolita, in the Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas—characterized by social conflicts over land
tenure (between resident communities and the federal and state governments), the project
IPP specified that additional consultation activities would be carried out during the first
year of implementation in order to develop a site- and context-specific Indigenous
Peoples Plan with and for the three indigenous communities living in the focal area.
Project design also allowed the National Corridor Technical Unit to use GEF resources in
order to assist the indigenous communities through a training in agricultural legal issues
so that they could better negotiate the land tenure conflict. These activities were included
as an obligation in the Grant Agreement and were considered a condition for the use of
project resources in La Cojolita.

23
   Updating of data related to the indigenous population living in the corridors was conducted by the National Commission for the
Development of Indigenous Peoples (CDI, previously the National Institute of Indigenous People, INI), through a collaboration
agreement with the MMBC in 2007.



                                                              15
Risk Assessment

52.     Risks identified during project preparation were classified in two main categories:
i) technical aspects related to the design of corridors and the subprojects to be carried out
in the focal areas; and ii) institutional, political, social and public policy aspects to
integrate biodiversity into public programs and to encourage local development practices.
Classification of the risks showed that, in general, they were manageable. (See PAD, p.
30.)

53.     To mitigate the first risk, project design incorporated a series of activities that
combined the efforts of NGOs and institutions in order to promote the sharing of
technical information on: i) the creation of corridor maps based on consensus; ii) the
definition of focal areas based on technical studies; and iii) the reorientation of public
policies, development plans and programs to be favorable to biodiversity.

54.     In terms of institutional, political, social, and public policy risks, mitigation
measures included: i) inclusive participation of all stakeholders in project activities in
each of the corridors; ii) efficient and useful training for all stakeholders, emphasizing
training on the project’s technical aspects for public officials at different levels and in
different sector agencies in order to facilitate the implementation of plans and programs
that integrate biodiversity criteria, as well as to highlight the importance of supporting
local development agendas that have conservation-friendly aspects; and iii) a
comprehensive communication strategy.

55.      Despite the deficiencies in design and implementation, monitoring activities
contributed to mitigate institutional risk by bringing together academia, NGOs and other
institutions in an M&E network (formed in 2006) and by promoting the flow of
information and knowledge among different local groups and policy makers.

56.     During the project’s final design stage, a small NGO led by a former Bank social
development specialist working in the La Cojolita focal area in Chiapas demanded that
the team carry out a more in depth consultation with the three indigenous communities
within the Lacandona community. In order to avoid any delays, highly detailed mitigation
measures for this area (more so than in any other area of the Corridor) were incorporated
into the IPP as well as the Grant Agreement. They included ongoing consultations with
stakeholders and participatory planning to define the specific actions to be financed as
part of the design and sustainable use of the part of the Corridor in La Cojolita. During
supervision, the Bank team and the MMBC team within CONABIO maintained a
constant presence in the area, conducted consultation workshops and created a detailed
social and agricultural diagnostic to facilitate smooth implementation. The same NGO
had suggested that the project coordinator to give a presentation of the project’s
achievements at the Fourth GEF Assembly held in Uruguay in May 2010.24




24
     The World Bank ended up supporting the project director to attend the GEF Assembly and present on the MMBC project.



                                                                16
Borrower Commitment

57.     During preparation, the GOM fully supported the MMBC initiative. The eight
ministries that had signed onto and participated in the Institutional Coordination
Framework (Foundations for Inter-institutional Coordination; Bases de Colaboración
Inter-institucional) pledged to refocus their development programs to better integrate
biodiversity criteria. During the design and preparation of the project, the GOM indicated
that relevant ministries could designate parts of their budgets for activities within the
project area in order to encourage the reorientation of development activities within the
individual corridors. The National Council for Natural Protected Areas (CONANP)—
composed of researchers, NGOs, industry and local producer organizations—and
Mexico’s GEF Focal Point also supported the Corridor project proposal. In addition,
during negotiations an agreement was reached on a Schedule of Obligations of
Counterpart Resources, including projections regarding the counterpart funding (federal
resources) to be allocated to the Corridor areas for the duration of the project.

58.     During the first part of project execution, the GOM was not supportive of the
project. The outcome of a national election signaled an impending change in the
government administration.25 The outgoing administration had supported the preparation
of the project and thus accelerated the signing of the Grant Agreement on November 30,
2000, before having the opportunity to complete the social consultations for the
formation of the State Corridor Councils (SCCs). A new Minister of Environment was
appointed in September 2003. The project operated under 90-day plans closely monitored
by the Bank, NAFIN and the Ministry of Finance (SHCP) in 2004. After the MTR in
January 2005, a new project team was appointed, followed by the appointment of a new
head of CONABIO. The project took off with a renewed commitment from the GOM, but
with the handicap of a four-year delay in implementation, overcoming major
shortcomings that had led to an Unsatisfactory rating in the ISRs from September 2003 to
December 2004. These ratings were gradually upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in
June 2005 and Satisfactory in June 2007.

Institutional Arrangements

59.     As the financial agent for the project, the Borrower was Nacional Financiera
(NAFIN). The role of the financial agent is critical in reviewing project execution and
processing disbursements, but the agent had limited experience in project execution. The
National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO), a
federal-level, public-sector, inter-ministerial commission in charge of developing the
National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, was appointed as the executing agency
due to its experience in and international recognition for work on environmental issues,
and because the project’s objectives coincided with CONABIO’s mandate to promote the
integration of biodiversity criteria into the development programs of the eight Ministries
that signed the Foundations of Inter-institutional Collaboration agreement and that make
up its Board. The National Technical Unit for the project was incorporated as a

25
     The project’s Grant Agreement was signed on November 30, 2000, the last day of the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo.



                                                                  17
department in CONABIO with two Regional Technical Units located in the Yucatan
Peninsula (for the states of Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatan) and Chiapas.

2.2 Implementation

60.     The project became effective on January 20, 2002, more than a year after it had
been approved by the Board of Executive Directors and signed by the GOM on
November 30, 2000. The Grant Agreement was signed with CONABIO, which seemed
the best institution to host the project but it had not participated in the preparation. The
Bank team underestimated both the difficulty of meeting the effectiveness conditions and
the lack of experience of the new administration. For the first time in 70 years, a different
political party had won the election, and new, inexperienced officials took office. Major
programs were nearly paralyzed, particularly the more complex projects with
international donors. Other Bank projects were equally affected.

Creation of the National and State Corridor Councils

61.     Creation of the four SCCs and the NCC was originally a condition of
effectiveness, because the consultations to form the councils had not been completed
during preparation. The GOM would not or could not provide support for this activity. As
previously explained, the project’s Grant Agreement was signed at the same time that
newly appointed officials took office throughout the government leading to paralysis in
many sectors. Grant resources were needed to fund social sector workshops that would
contribute to the formation of State Councils. As a result, project effectiveness was
delayed for over one year until the first amendment (November 2001)26 was signed, thus
freeing up these resources. The social sector information workshops were then held
between 2002 and 2004.

62.     The election of national and state government officials, members of NGOs,
academia and the private sector as representatives to each SCC was a relatively quick
process. Workshops with producers in the project focal areas and their election to the
SCCs constituted a much longer process, since their organizations are weaker and divided
by region or product. This was especially the case in Chiapas,27 where the MMBC and
the Puebla-Panama Plan were identified by stakeholders as two parallel projects in the
same geographical area. This situation created confusion and reactions against the
MMBC28 in a context characterized by polarized views of regional development as a
result of the 1994 armed conflict. Expectations raised by the change in the federal
government in 2000 altered the dormant conflict and the Zapatista rebel group marched
to Mexico City to negotiate with the new administration.



26
   The need for an amendment was identified by the new task manager appointed in September 2001 during his first mission, and the
project was declared effective in January 2002.
27
   By July 2003, the other three SCCs (Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo) had been formed while that in Chiapas was still being
constituted.
28
   The Plan Puebla-Panamá was an infrastructure project launched by the previous GOM administration (Zedillo), which had not been
well received by affected stakeholders. The confusion stemmed from subsequent presentation, by the incoming GOM administration
(Fox), of the MMBC as the “green” arm of the PPP.



                                                              18
63.     In the end, the Chiapas SCC was established in late 2004 with a well-represented
social sector: 11 representatives of producer organizations (from the 11 areas in which
the project would intervene), whereas, in accordance with the Operations Manual, only
three producers were elected to each of the SCCs of the Yucatan Peninsula (Campeche,
Quintana Roo, and Yucatan). However, the more extensive and comprehensive
consultations together with greater producer representation in Chiapas contributed to
increased MMBC project visibility, leading to the implementation of a greater number of
subprojects in that state relative to the other participating states. (See Section 3.2, Key
Performance Indicators.)

Implementation Risk and Personnel Changes

64.     In accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines, selection of the project
coordinator began in the first quarter of 2001 with a public invitation to apply posted on
CONABIO’s website and the creation of a multisectoral selection committee.29 Without
providing an explanation, SEMARNAT objected to hiring the candidate chosen by the
selection committee, who happened to be a former high-level official of the outgoing
administration. The World Bank task team leader attempted to support the selection of
this candidate based on Section 3.04 of the Grant Agreement,30 but was unsuccessful in
convincing SEMARNAT to agree.31 As a result, during the first years of project
implementation, the project had a coordinator whose lack of vision and experience
contributed to poor project performance32 as well as to the slow recruitment process for
Regional Technical Unit staff in both the Yucatan Peninsula and Chiapas. The perceived
absence of management leadership further hindered progress in achieving results between
2002 and 2004.

65.     From September 2003 (ISR #6) through April 2005 (ISR #11), the project was
rated Unsatisfactory33 due to slow project progress and the corresponding lag in
disbursement. In response, an external institutional specialist from the FAO/CP was hired
to support the Project Coordination Unit and to improve its administrative capacity
(2003–2007). However, implementation obstacles due to poor staff qualifications
persisted.

66.    During the June 2004 supervision mission, the Bank task team and CONABIO
created a 90-day plan that included CONABIO’s commitment to have an external
evaluation34 and to change the project coordinator. Stricter supervision was also provided
by Nacional Financiera (NAFIN), the Ministry of Finance (SHCP), the Ministry of
Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and the World Bank. The Bank team

29
   The committee consisted of a researcher from the National University, a representative of indigenous and peasant producers from
Chiapas, the Director of the Mexican Conservation Fund (FMCN), and a representative of the Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources (SEMARNAT).
30
   Section 3.04 of the Grant Agreement: “[The United Mexican States], through its representatives on the [selection committee], shall:
(a) cause the Recipient, acting as trustee of the Trust, to hire and thereafter maintain throughout project implementation, personnel in
numbers and with experience and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank.”
31
   June 8, 2001, the World Bank gave its no objection to the contract for the project coordinator.
32
   Including a greater focus on localized actions at the expense of the project’s broader objectives (i.e., public policy mainstreaming
and corridor connectivity).
33
   Unsatisfactory ratings were given for Agreed Procedures and Schedules, Monitoring and Evaluation and Project Management.
34
   The external evaluation was conducted as part of the project’s Midterm Review (January 2005).



                                                                  19
conducted a supervision mission every 90 days in order to review project progress. The
first and second 90-day plans, covering the period from July to December 2004, were
satisfactorily completed.

67.    The Midterm Review (including a third 90-day action plan) was conducted in
January 2005 (after the external evaluation was completed in the second half of 2004).
The main conclusions of the independent evaluation were: (i) project objectives
continued to be relevant and feasible; (ii) the institutional design, approach and
instruments continued to be valid; (iii) the main change the project required was to focus
on reorienting policy and public expenditure; and (iv) the main areas requiring attention
were the operation itself and technical assistance to support communities’ demands to
take advantage of a reoriented government “supply.” The Bank mission concurred with
the main conclusions of the independent evaluation after discussing it with relevant
stakeholders, including members of the NCC and SCCs. The full report can be
downloaded from the project files and CONABIO’s website.

68.     As a result, a third amendment was approved (November 2005) and a more
qualified project coordinator, with appropriate administrative and management skills, was
recruited. New technical staff members were also selected, and were better able to link
local development interests with available institutional programs (i.e., reoriented public
spending) to successfully support local efforts for sustainable development, conservation
and natural resource management (the subprojects). The new team’s increased capacity
for project management in conjunction with federal, state and municipal partners was
readily observed during Bank supervision missions. As a result, implementation of
project components improved because they were now more in line with project goals.
The project was reclassified as Moderately Satisfactory in June 2005 (after 19 months).

Fostering Local Support in Light of Implementation Delays

69.     Because on-the-ground project implementation was delayed longer than expected,
the confidence of local producers and communities in the project (and in the general idea
of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, MBC) began to wane (especially as local
perceptions increasingly associated the MMBC project with the negatively viewed PPP).
To bolster interest in and positive opinions of the MBC and the project (both in Mexico
and regionally), the social experts on the Bank’s task team applied for a US$350,000
grant from the World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP) Global and
Regional Initiatives to implement a series of workshops collectively titled Strengthening
Social Participation in the Regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (RMBC) in
Guatemala, Panama and Southeast Mexico. The objectives were to strengthen: (i) the
participation of indigenous communities, small-scale producers and women’s
organizations through the sharing of experiences in conservation and local organization
in the context of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor; and (ii) individual and
community decision making in corridor areas so that local communities could help guide
governmental institutions toward efficient decentralization and local and municipal
development through informed participation and by making their preferences known. The
workshops provided a forum for these exchanges, which were held in MBC areas in



                                           20
Panama, Guatemala and in Southeast Mexico (Yucatan, Campeche, Chiapas and
Quintana Roo) between 2003 and 2004. The workshops allowed the MMBC to reposition
itself in order to retain necessary local interest in MMBC objectives and activities during
the unexpected and prolonged lag in project implementation. It also provided innovative
and practical instruments for engaging local communities within the MMBC through
opportunities to demonstrate the importance of the MMBC in their daily lives and for the
future of economic development in the region.

Implementation of Community Capacity Typology

70.      The typology of community capacities and organization proposed in Component
A of the project (see PAD, Annex 11) contributed to improved targeting of resources for
subprojects by enabling the project team to better tailor Corridor activities to
communities, for example by: i) identifying communities and producers in need of
assistance and training in order to improve their awareness of the economic and
environmental benefits of the corridors; ii) monitoring the use of the resources provided;
iii) including a wide range of beneficiaries with respect to the disparity among their levels
of organization; iv) implementing, with Bank Procurement Guidelines, the allocation and
control of resources awarded to producer organizations; and v) publicizing the project in
Corridor areas and prioritizing natural resource management activities within them.

71.     Although the logical framework provided benchmarks to ensure the achievement
of anticipated project goals outlined in the PAD and to reinforce the relevance of
biodiversity mainstreaming, during implementation some indicators limited project
interventions to only 16 predefined focal areas. The Midterm Review highlighted this
obstacle and proposed that the focal areas be expanded to include ejidos throughout the
Corridor. This allowed the project to incorporate a greater number of local producers and
to maintain the demand-driven structure of subproject implementation while achieving
project objectives. This change was reflected in the third amendment (November 2005),
providing the opportunity to work in new areas while using the same budget. The amount
of GEF resources available for each subproject was increased from US$20,000 to
US$50,000, which led to adjusting the target of 565 total subprojects to 120, so as not to
increase the total amount available under the subproject disbursement category
(Operating Rules, Annex 4).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

72.      An M&E protocol was developed during preparation.35 Based on this protocol,
CONABIO was to prepare a M&E system to link monitoring indicators to project
activities in order to track both project impact (overall development) and process
(component activities and specific outcomes) at project, corridor, focal area and
community levels. The M&E system should be based on the key project indicators
(Section F above) which are also identified as the main indicators in the project’s logical
framework. (See PAD, Annex 1.)

35
   PAD p. 27: A Monitoring and Evaluation protocol has been developed during project preparation, based on indicators listed in the
project’s logical framework.



                                                               21
73.     The M&E system’s design and implementation were affected by the delay in
effectiveness and weak institutional capacity. The MTR highlighted this shortcoming and
the need to update M&E indicators during the MTR. The midterm evaluation mission
(January 18–28, 2005 Aide-Mémoire) recommended that a consultant be hired to develop
a conceptual framework and the methodology to produce M&E indicators for the MMBC
focal areas.

74.     On June 2005, the FAO/CP consultant prepared a basic proposal for M&E.
However, the team focused on critical actions to put the project back on track and
upgrade the project to avoid cancellation. By the time the new team was appointed in
2005, developing a protocol to capture all the logical framework indicators proved
technically and economically more costly and less useful than anticipated. Under a
second FAO/CP contract in December 2005, the specialist assisted CONABIO in
implementing the managerial component of the M&E system.36 The project teams from
CONABIO and the World Bank decided to focus activities on the field and monitoring
efforts in reorienting investments and mainstreaming biodiversity criteria into
development programs as well as initiating a longer-term effort to build a network of
research institutions and researchers willing to embrace the corridor concept and related
activities in their own work.

75.     The recommendation to develop an M&E system focused on the project
indicators, highlighted by the MTR, did not produce the comprehensive M&E framework
required to make up for the deficiencies of the original M&E design. However, the
project sought opportunities for collaboration and exchange with local organizations
(NGOs, academic institutions) that have the necessary capacity for monitoring. This
resulted in the Multiscale Monitoring Network being formed in 2006 which brings
together specialists in the area for conducting biological monitoring on a regular basis.
The NTU entered into contracts with qualified academic or research organizations to be
able to report on relevant habitat and species indicators with robust research findings.
This, together with the use the biological monitoring system of CONABIO helped to
address the significant shortcomings in the M&E protocols. But the issue of tracking
performance using the key indicators as specified in the PAD continued to plague the
Project.

76.     There is no record of habitat loss or change in the native vegetation cover in the
focal areas (15% of Corridor surface). The proxy reported shows deforestation rate was
reduced from 1.5 to 1.0%/year (National Forest Inventory: 2002–2007; 1993–2002) in
the 4 corridor states.

Presence of indicator species was reported for four (4) corridors:

Sierra Madre del Sur

77.    Panthera onca, Puma concolor, Leopardus pardalis, Leopardus weidii,
Herpailurus yaguaroundi, Tapirus bairdii, Pecari tayacu, Mazama americana,
Odocoileus virginianus, Nasua narica, Agouti paca, Dasypus Novemcinctus and Ateles
geoffroyi were monitored through Cybertracker, direct and indirect observations and
surveys in the Chiapas Sierra Madre del Sur Corridor.37

Selva Maya Zoque

78.    Didelphis sp, Dasypus novemcinctus, Tamandua mexicana, Sciurus sp., Cuniculus
paca, Galictis vittata, Panthera onca, Leopardus wiedii, Herpailurus yagoaroundi,
Conepatus semistriatus, Nasua narica, Ateles geoffroyi, Pecari tajacu and Mazama
americana were monitored in the convergence of the Sierra Madre del Sur and the Selva
Maya Zoque Corridors in Chiapas, using still-picture traps, footprint identification and
direct observation inside transects and outside transects, and processed using the
EstimateS program (available at http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/estimates).38

Sian Ka’an–Calakmul

79.     Panthera onca was monitored with transponders in the Sian Ka’an–Calakmul
Corridor, which allowed their movements to be modeled, confirming the connectivity
function of the corridors. In 1930 Mexico hosted around 20,000 jaguars. The current
population is estimated at 3,500. The Chiapas Corridors and the Campeche and Quintana
Roo Sian Ka’an–Calakmul Corridors represent key habitats, linking relicts of tropical
forest in the Ocote, Sepultura, El Triunfo, Montes Azules, Calakmul and Sian Ka’an
natural protected areas. In the Calakmul area alone, the jaguar population is estimated at
900 individuals (Ceballos et al., 2002; Chávez et al., in press). The protection of the
jaguar can save 70,000 species of flora and fauna. (Ceballos 2007: Censo Nacional de
Jaguares). The jaguar is at the top of the trophic chain, regulates a large number of
species in the ecosystem and requires large extensions of conserved habitat (Miller and
Rabinowitz, 2002). The study39 cofinanced by the project in the two Sian Ka’an–
Calakmul Corridors used the results of the jaguar habitat modeling produced by a well-
known longitudinal study by Amor Conde et al. in 2006.

80.     Moreover, the project commissioned a comprehensive study of the impacts of
fragmentation and infrastructure on the jaguar populations in the Quintana Roo and
Campeche Sian Ka’an–Calakmul Corridors. The study produced an evaluation of threats
to habitat and jaguar populations, based on the potential jaguar habitat map produced by
the Selva Maya-Zoque-Olmeca Project (Amor Conde et al., 2006), using the algorithm

developed by Miradi™. It was instrumental in the effort to mainstream biodiversity
criteria in the public utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad’s investment planning
process, leading to relevant modifications and mitigation measures in the original design
for a high-tension transmission line that was planned through the Sian Ka’an—Calakmul
Corridor in Quintana Roo and the establishment of a compensation fund for cattle
ranchers when their livestock is harmed by wild felines.40

Biological Monitoring Network

81.     In 2006, the MMBC’s biological monitoring network was formed with the
participation of GOM institutions, researchers from various disciplines, members of
NGOs, universities, research centers, institutes and independent consultants, all focused
on the conceptualization and development of multiscale monitoring and identification of
ecological indicators to assess and guide public policies in the region (as part of M&E
activity ii). The biological monitoring network has contributed to the systematization of
the information and data already generated (Component A), including data generated
through coordination workshops organized twice a year and participation in relevant
seminars and congresses in which progress reports are shared. Many participating
researchers and research centers have incorporated into their institutional agendas studies
and research programs linked to the MMBC’s thematic and geographical scope. For
example, some NGOs collaborated to develop systems to monitor jaguars, tapirs, spider
monkeys and birds. To consolidate Corridor information, the MMBC team is also being
assisted by the Jorge L. Tamayo Center for Geography and Geomatics (part of the
National Council for Science and Technology network). Because these activities only
began after the change in the Project Coordination Unit in 2005, the process is not yet
complete; comprehensive data for every corridor and focal area are not yet available.

82.     In general, the generation of relevant baselines, data collection and analysis for
project indicators (biological, ecological, socioeconomic and institutional) as part of the
M&E protocol remains an ongoing process and a significant shortcoming in measuring
the achievement of the operation’s objectives. On the positive side, the network approach
is proving highly efficient; mainstreaming the Corridor monitoring and knowledge
sharing objectives in the scientific community’s agenda highlights the relevance of the
project’s contributions.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

83.     Safeguard compliance was Satisfactory throughout project implementation. The
Bank supervision team included biologists, foresters, environmental specialists and social
scientists to supervise the project’s compliance with Bank policies: i) Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01), ii) Natural Habitats (OP 4.04); iii) Forests (OP 4.36); iv) Physical
Cultural Resources (OP 4.11); v) Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10); Gender (OP 4.20) (in the

original documents although not in subsequent ISRs); and vi) Involuntary Resettlement
(OP 4.12).

84.      Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01): This Category B project was designed to
be positive from an environmental standpoint, specifically through the promotion of
conservation and sustainable use of globally significant biodiversity in selected
communities, ejidos and private lands. The Satisfactory rating is based on the various
activities undertaken to assess the current trends and threats to biodiversity in the project
area, and to identify the interventions necessary to reverse the accelerating loss of
biodiversity. These activities included: i) environmental assessment; ii) a study by the
Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford, United Kingdom, which proposed a
number of criteria to identify activities in terrestrial corridors; iii) a study of the specific
problems in the northern corridor in the State of Yucatan; iv) technical reports; and v)
direct consultations with producers, fishermen and other stakeholders to identify pilot
projects for sustainable development. (See PAD, Annex 2.) This information was
analyzed together with the data generated through the social assessment.

85.      During project implementation, subprojects were also screened to verify their
eligibility. All assessments made by the RTU were based on a typology and checklist of
potential environmental impacts contained in the Operations Manual. These assessments
were in turn delivered to the National and State Councils responsible for subproject
approval screening (this included the national environmental authority, SEMARNAT).
Selection criteria included whether the subproject comprised activities for: i) restoration,
ii) maintenance of ecosystem quality, and iii) sustainable use of biodiversity. As
described in Annex 2 of the PAD, the goal of the subprojects was to promote sustainable
development for local producers and indigenous communities.

86.      Natural Habitats (OP 4.04): The question of whether pristine and valuable habitats
should shape the design of the corridors was discussed thoroughly among specialists
during project preparation. The solution was to use the Natural Protected Areas—which
included pristine areas and were subject to federal protection—as the “anchors” to be
connected by the corridors in order to enhance effective biodiversity protection, reduce
anthropogenic pressures (e.g., by promoting agro-ecological and silvopastoral activities
while containing urban expansion and the production of crops dependent on large
quantities of agrochemicals), and preserve natural forest cover to facilitate movement of
species. The southern states of Mexico have a large proportion of their territory under
protection (e.g., nearly 60% of the municipality of Calakmul is composed of private
areas, or is under state and federal protection decrees). During implementation, all project
activities facilitated the above goals as embodied in Corridor design. Compliance with
this safeguard was therefore Satisfactory because the impact of the project on natural
habitats was positive, reducing pressure from human activities and even reversing (in
selected areas) the deforestation produced by past livestock expansion (by promoting
silvopastoral practices and allowing pastures to revert to tropical forest41).

41
   Fragmented areas of tropical forests where extensive livestock grazing took place for decades are reverting to forests in a process
known as “acahualamiento de potreros” in which surrounding parent trees provide seed and environment for natural regeneration of
forest patches.



                                                                 25
87.      Forests (OP 4.36): In line with the Bank’s forestry policy at that time (Forests, OP
4.36), for the first half of project implementation no subprojects involving forestry
activities were funded. Based on the experience of World Bank Community Forestry
projects in Mexico and the region, and in order to allow sustainable forest management
practices to be promoted by the MMBC, during the Midterm Review (January 2005) the
updated forestry policy (November 2002: Forests, OP 4.36) was included in the project’s
Implementation Letter. This allowed the project to develop a best-practice framework to
support silvicultural (sustainable forest management) activities and the sustainable use of
NTFPs and wildlife. These activities were regulated through management programs
approved by SEMARNAT and supervised by a Bank senior natural resources specialist,
leading to the Satisfactory rating for this safeguard. The update in the safeguard also
allowed additional areas of the Corridor to be included in project activities and to receive
resources for implementing sustainable development subprojects (i.e., Marqués de
Comillas). Subprojects supported sustainable forest management activities in Corridor
areas only when they followed the best-practice guidelines and had a management plan
(approved by SEMARNAT).

88.    Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) and Gender (OP 4.20): An Indigenous Peoples Plan
(IPP) was designed to identify practical ways of involving indigenous communities in the
design and implementation of the project, particularly through technical assistance and
organizational strengthening so that they could better harness the benefits of their
environmentally friendly productive activities. (See PAD, Annex 12.) In essence, this
involved the creation of a special window to finance pilot projects presented by
vulnerable groups (i.e., indigenous communities and women’s groups); these projects
represented approximately 10% of total project resources; indigenous communities were
also given access to those resources dedicated to Component C activities. (See also
Section 2.1, “Social Consideration.”)

89.      The January 2005 supervision mission detected an alarming rate of indigenous
youth emigration (national and international) from project areas. In response, the project
included a focus on youth within awareness-raising and environmental education
activities, in addition to promoting their participation in productive subprojects. In the
case of La Cojolita, Lacandona Rainforest, Chiapas (one of the project’s original focal
areas), a series of additional consultation actions were considered during the early years
of project implementation in order to adapt the overall strategic guidelines of the IPP. In
addition, the Project Coordination Unit gave support to several indigenous communities
in the form of consultancies that provided training in existing land law and conflict
resolution. (For additional details, see Section 2.1, “Social Considerations” and “Risk
Assessment.”) As a result of these efforts on the part of the World Bank and MMBC
project teams, compliance with this safeguard was rated Satisfactory.

90.    In addition, the series of workshops financed with BNPP resources reinforced
actions taken as part of the IPP (Section 2.2, “Strengthening Social Participation in the
Regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (RMBC) in Guatemala, Panama and
Southeast Mexico”).



                                             26
91.    Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12)
were triggered in order to ensure that if during implementation a situation arose which
required the application of these safeguards, an appropriate plan would be in place.
However, such a situation was never encountered, and thus compliance with these
safeguards was rated Satisfactory throughout.

Fiduciary

92.     During the first four years of the project, the NTU required intensive training in
administrative management. World Bank financial management and procurement
specialists provided support to the NTU and RTU management teams.

93.     NAFIN, as the financial agent, maintained adequate records to reflect the
project’s operational and financial conditions, complying with Bank requirements and
providing adequate support for project implementation, and thereby contributing to the
successful management of the project and ensuring that financial arrangements were
employed in accordance with the terms of the grant. NAFIN staff accompanied the Bank
and GOM missions throughout the project’s life.

94.    Monitoring of the financial and procurement aspects was conducted on an
ongoing basis during supervision missions (twice a year) by the Bank’s Country Office
staff.

95.     Financial management implementation during the project was rated Satisfactory
(in terms of timeliness and complete documentation) by Nacional Financiera (NAFIN)
and the Bank. Audit reports have been acceptable to the Bank (Audit Report Compliance
System, ARCS), as have Project Management Reports (PMR), including the last PMR for
the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009, dated April 13, 2010. The Grant was fully
disbursed and the final audit is due June 30, 2010.

96.     Capacity for procurement and contracting was consolidated and rated Highly
Satisfactory in the May 2009 ex post assessment and Satisfactory in the last ex post
review completed on December 1, 2009.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

97.     During National Corridor Council meetings, participating ministries and
stakeholders demonstrated consensus on and commitment to: i) the significant role
played by biological corridors as connectors for genetic exchange between populations
otherwise condemned to isolation in NPAs; ii) the possibility of government actions to
refocus development; iii) the ability of local planning activities to develop awareness and
capacities of local governments and landowners; and iv) the capacity of local sustainable
development projects to drive the reorientation of public programs and to provide
economic, social and conservation benefits. Through the framework of the State Corridor
Councils, CONABIO has demonstrated the importance of involving local producers and



                                            27
communities through participatory and consultation processes so that they become allies
of biodiversity conservation.

98.    In 2009, the Mexican Congress and the Minister of SEMARNAT reaffirmed their
commitment to the corridor concept by expanding the program to include the States of
Tabasco, Oaxaca and Veracruz and allocated a budget to support the commencement of
MMBC activities in these states. The expansion of the MMBC to other Mexican states is
consistent with SEMARNAT’s National Environment and Natural Resources Program
2007–2012 (PSMARN), and its focus on the transversality42 of public policies for
sustainable development and territorial integration (Section 6.9).

99.     This program emphasizes the role of biological corridors in promoting habitat
connectivity—allowing movement of species between conserved habitat patches—while
also stressing their importance in those areas most affected by climate change. The
PSMARN also highlights the need for biological corridors to promote the integration of
development policies in relevant regions, emphasizing policies for regulation,
ecotourism, wildlife, forestry and rural development, among others. For the PSMARN,
the strategic use of biological corridors is as “a public policy tool for transversal
environmental management and an urgent task that should be extended by the present
administration to various parts of the country and linked to disaster prevention, payment
for environmental services and the National Climate Change Strategy.”43

100. Since 2008, core MMBC project personnel have been funded by the GOM with
an annual budget of approximately US$2 million (MXN$25 million) to continue their
work toward achieving national Corridor objectives. The MMBC has been incorporated
into the structure of CONABIO/SEMARNAT and MMBC staff members are currently
working on: i) diagnostics for the new corridors (Tabasco, Oaxaca, Veracruz), to which
around 59% of the resources provided by the GOM have been allocated; ii) management
of the Sustainable Rural Development Program (PDRS) in Chiapas jointly with
SAGARPA, and in two similar programs in the Sian Ka’an–Calakmul Corridor and in the
El Triunfo region in Chiapas; iii) the establishment of the MMBC “eco-label” and
payment for environmental services; iv) studies on environmental economics (jointly
with CEPAL, 2009); v) promotion and continuity of the multiscale ecological monitoring
network; vi) financing of subprojects under the MMBC’s strategic guidelines; and vii) the
provision of logistical support to the State Corridor Councils.

101. In an effort to comply with the framework of the Special Program on Climate
Change (PECC), the MMBC and SAGARPA are working together under the PDRS
program in Marqués de Comillas, Chiapas to reorient 25,000 hectares/year of land under
production toward sustainable management, and to reduce the use of fire as an
agricultural practice in at least 30% of the participating area by 2012.

42
   In this case, transversality is used here to describe the intersection of public policies from various sectors when applied to
sustainable development across states and regions. Such public policies invariably overlap and influence one another as they
implement programs and incentives on the ground with similar target groups. Such programs and incentives often influence the
decision-making prioritization process of local communities who live off the land and thus influence land use decisions, no matter
whether the original program/incentive focused explicitly on land use or not.

                                                               28
Next Phase

102. To take the work done by the MMBC a step further, the MMBC team is preparing
a new GEF-financed project for Mexico, with the Bank’s assistance, to be implemented
from 2011 to 2016: “Fostering Sustainable and Competitive Production Systems
Consistent with the Conservation of Biodiversity.” Building on the foundation and
corridor context of the MMBC project, the new GEF project focuses on green product
and market development in biological corridors through socially and environmentally
responsible production and marketing of goods and services, with a specific focus on the
protection of biodiversity. The new project also proposes to support MMBC activities
that are expanded into new states (i.e., Tabasco, Veracruz, Oaxaca). Sustainable
production sectors targeted by this new GEF/IBRD-financed intervention include those
that were piloted during MMBC project implementation, such as cacao, coffee, forestry,
honey, gum, etc. The initial project concept was approved by the GEF on June 7, 2010
signaling its further development and the availability of GEF resources for its future
implementation.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

103. Ten years later, the project objectives, outcomes and activities are relevant for the
country’s development priorities, as reflected in the Bank’s current CPS for Mexico
(2009) and the National Development Plan (2007) which emphasize the environmental
issues central to both reviving the economy and securing an environmentally sustainable
path.

104. The long-term sustainability of corridors and NPAs is strongly linked to their
capacity to provide multiple services to regional and local society. These services go
beyond the conservation of biodiversity and include the generation of economic
opportunities for local people who live and depend on the natural resources. Unlike the
creation of protected areas, corridors provide geographical and institutional spaces to
promote conservation and good management by refocusing investment for sustainable
development.

105. The MMBC concept is helping to shape future biodiversity conservation and
climate change initiatives in the country. For example, the MMBC was particularly
instrumental to Mexico’s first Environmental Development Policy Loan (SAL/DPL) in
its shaping of the agreement between SEMARNAT and SAGARPA for the conservation
of the humid tropics in southern Mexico.

106. Finally, the design and implementation of the MMBC project has provided
breakthroughs in necessary crosscutting approaches, offering insights into climate change
adaptation alternatives for Mexico. These insights include experiences with regard to:



                                           29
variety of crops (including native species/varieties and traditional multi-product plots),
variety of spaces (corridors incorporating conservation and production areas in a
landscape management approach), hillside management (reducing vulnerability with
integrated watershed management techniques), and conversion to silvopastoral systems
(improving yields and quality while restoring tropical forest areas that had been
converted to pastures).

107. For the GOM, the National Strategy of Integrated Biological Corridors (which
emerged from the MMBC project) links directly with Objective 844 of the National
Development Plan (2007–2012). Moreover, the project’s close ties with the larger
Mesoamerican region (through the RMBC initiative) has helped prioritize this regional
ecosystem in the framework of Mexico’s actions for: (i) South-South cooperation, (ii) its
National Development Plan and the Special Program on Climate Change, which is linked
to the Climate Change DPL, and (iii) the GOM’s interest in scaling up the
implementation and furthering the innovative approach of the MMBC as reflected in the
new GEF project proposal under preparation: “Fostering Sustainable and Competitive
Production Systems Consistent with the Conservation of Biodiversity.”45

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

108. The project’s global environmental objective was the conservation and
sustainable use of globally significant biodiversity in five46 biological corridors in
southeast Mexico by mainstreaming biodiversity criteria in public expenditure and in
selected local planning and development practices.

Mainstreaming

109. The project contributed to mainstreaming biodiversity criteria in public
expenditure (both in terms of operational rules and investments) and private efforts that
combined to achieve reduced deforestation and improved management of natural
resources and biodiversity conservation.

110.     Specifically, the MMBC contributed to mainstream biodiversity criteria in the operational
       47
rules of SAGARPA, which is the single largest source of public spending in the four corridor
states. Last year alone SAGARPA allocated US$30.9 billion48 to its rural development programs
in the country. In the field, the MMBC directly reoriented investments potentially harmful to
biodiversity and promoted bio-friendly activities on the order of US$34,869,81149 (ca.

44
   Objective 8 of the National Development Plan (2007–2012): “To ensure sustainability through responsibility in the care for,
protection and rational use of natural resources, thus securing both economic and social development without compromising the
natural heritage of Mexico nor quality of life for future generations.”
45
   The project concept for the new GEF-financed proposed operation: Fostering Sustainable and Competitive Production Systems
Consistent with the Conservation of Biodiversity, submitted by CONABIO, was approved by the GEF (June 2010). The project
preparation grant was approved on May 12, 2010.
46
   Although the PAD logframe mentions six corridors, the PAD Project Development Objective states five corridors. Unfortunately,
the document’s logframe was not updated after the Tabasco Corridor was dropped during the preparation, and the project focused on
the remaining five corridors and four states.
47
   See SAGARPA’s operational rules: http://sagarpa.gob.mx/programas/Paginas/default.aspx The operational rules state as one of
SAGARPA’s five objectives: Reverse the deterioration of ecosystems, through actions to preserve water, soils and biodiversity.

   The amount allocated to subprojects is relevant as a counterpart funding target of the project.



                                                              30
MXN$439,708,312.28) in the Corridor areas (see Table 7). Through project activities, the
operating rules of SAGARPA, the federal institution that provides more subsidies to the
country, were adjusted to take into account biodiversity criteria in addition to directly
funding various programs through the MMBC. Furthermore, the project was successful in
influencing and working directly with other key institutions to promote in-situ
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the target areas. Among these
institutions are: the National Forestry Commission (Conafor), Ministry of Social
Development (SEDESOL), National Institute of Women (Inmujeres), and the National
Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (CDI).

111. During project life, 2,238 officials at federal, state and municipal level were
trained and are now contributing to design and implement selected development plans
and programs in ways that integrate biodiversity considerations Additionally, the MMBC
worked closely with 14 federal, state and municipal programs in the Corridor areas to
include criteria for conservation of biodiversity. Rural Development Programs where
MMBC50 cofinanced subprojects, now include these criteria in their operational rules. In
some cases, the cofinancing provided by MMBC to implement subprojects in accordance
with the objectives of MMBC allowed agencies to include some communities in their
programs for the first time.

Habitat loss and perturbation of populations

112. There was no satisfactory monitoring in place from the start of the project that
would have made it possible to monitor populations of indicator species and to record its
evolution during the project implementation. This represents a significant shortcoming in
the project design, which does not allow the achievement of the stipulated indicators to
be properly measured. That said, using a proxy for assessing the expected outcomes: rate
of native habitat loss decreased and degree of perturbation of populations reduced are
likely to have been accomplished since over 40,000 producers improved their capacities
and sustainable use/conservation practices in focal area plots.

113. There is no record of habitat loss or change in the native vegetation cover in the
focal areas (15% of Corridor surface). The proxy reported shows that the deforestation
rate was reduced from 1.5 to 1.0%/year (National Forest Inventory: 2002–2007; 1993–
2002) in the four corridor states.

114. Presence of indicator species was reported for four corridors, and the general
conclusion of the regional monitoring network hosted by the project is that indicator
species are present in larger numbers in corridors than in isolated patches.51

   Because there was no baseline at the time of design/approval nor was one produced during execution, Corridor monitoring was
completed in isolated patches chosen by graduate students in order to prepare their dissertation papers. The patches chosen had similar
conditions to the corridors, but were located outside of them in areas with no project interventions. See Section 2.3 (below),

            Conepatus semistriatus, Nasua narica, Ateles geoffroyi, Pecari tajacu and
            Mazama americana were monitored in the convergence area, using still-
            picture traps, footprint identification, direct observation inside transects and
            outside transects, and processed using the EstimateS program (available at
            http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/estimates).

          ¾ Campeche and Quintana Roo Sian Ka’an–Calakmul Corridors:54 Panthera
            onca was monitored with transponders in the Sian Ka’an–Calakmul Corridors,
            which made it possible to confirm the connectivity function. In 1930 Mexico
            hosted some 20,000 jaguars. The current population is estimated at 3,500. In
            the Calakmul area alone, the jaguar population is estimated at 900 individuals
            (Ceballos et al. 2002). The protection of the jaguar can save 70,000 species of
            flora and fauna. (Ceballos 2007: Censo Nacional de Jaguares). The jaguar is at
            the top of the trophic chain, regulates a large number of species in the
            ecosystem and requires large extensions of conserved habitat. (Miller and
            Rabinowitz 2002). The study cofinanced by the project (Unidos para la
            Conservación [2007]: Modelos de control y conservación para el
            mantenimiento de corredores) in the two Sian Ka’an–Calakmul Corridors
            used the results of the jaguar habitat modeling produced by a well-known
            longitudinal study by Amor Conde et al. in 2006.

115. There was no satisfactory monitoring in place from the start of the project that
would have made it possible to monitor populations of indicator species and to record
their evolution during project implementation. This likely represents a significant
shortcoming in the project design; it does not allow the achievement of the operation’s
indicators to be properly measured. However, the efficiency of the operation improved
significantly after the MTR and its relevance is widely recognized by the GOM and civil
society. Although there are no reports on analysis of nonlinear models to assess the
impact of the perturbation55 or the change in parameters that determine the demographic
dynamics of these populations in the focal areas, the expected outcomes (rate of native
habitat loss decreased and degree of perturbation of populations reduced) is likely to have
been accomplished since over 40,000 producers improved their capacities and sustainable
use/conservation practices in focal area plots.

Engagement of communities in focal areas:

116.   Subprojects required promotion, training and technical assistance, and a
questionnaire was answered by a large proportion (97%) of subproject participants: 98%
of those surveyed56 perceived that the MMBC significantly supported regional
development; 96% said that the MMBC is helping to conserve the tropical forest; and
88% were aware of the MMBC’s objectives. Land management and planning activities were
completed in 62 communities (47%). 111 community promoters received training (85%)57 and
technical assistance to set community priorities for the conservation of biodiversity. Participatory
action plans were developed for 15 social and productive organizations (11%).

117. Awareness-raising activities (workshops, training, trade promotion of bio-friendly
products) were completed in the target communities. In addition, new focal areas were
incorporated, as approved in the amendment to the Grant Agreement signed on
November 20, 2005, which expanded the concept and number of focal areas by including
in the definition the localities identified in the Implementation Letter, and any other
locality to be agreed between CONABIO and the Bank. As a result of the incorporation
of additional areas, a total of 628 communities participated in at least one of the
abovementioned activities. (See Annex 2.) Training and technical assistance to develop
action plans were provided under the strategic line58 Knowledge Sharing, complemented
by additional activities leading to design and implementation of action plans under other
strategic lines. (See Annex 2).

118. On the Bank’s side, there were significant shortcomings in the reporting scheme
for the achievement of the operation’s objectives since the Project Indicators were not
updated/revised to ensure consistent reporting after the amendment was signed. This did
not reflect on the project’s efficiency or its relevance, but it did affect the consistency of
the Bank’s reporting instruments.

Reduction of high-impact resource use practices detrimental to biodiversity

119. The project did not produce a baseline to follow up on this indicator. The proxy
used: a total of 47,042 producers in 15 of the 16 original focal areas and in new
communities within the corridors incorporated after the MTR59 have adopted sustainable,
biodiversity-friendly productive activities, which would be equivalent to more than 50%
of the number of producers60 estimated in the focal areas.61
58
   Strategic lines are defined in PAD Annex 7. Strategic lines: Strengthening of productive practices of indigenous populations
compatible with conservation, including production of aggregate value from local raw material. The project will support agroforestry
and forestry management activities, including chicle gum, vanilla and organic coffee production as well as apiculture.
59
   The MTR highlighted the lack of definition of corridors and focal areas, and the lack of understanding of the purpose of the
mainstreaming effort to reorient, rather than replace, investments in sustainable development. During the MTR, CONABIO proposed
to review the limits of the original 16 focal areas to adjust them to ecoregional and socio-economic characteristics, and in particular
suggested the incorporation of the southern and western forest areas in the State of Quintana Roo, because of their relevance to the
conservation of Calakmul and its vicinity to Selva Maya in Guatemala. (MTR Aide-Mémoire, January 18–28, 2005). The amendment
to the Grant Agreement signed on November 20, 2005 expanded the concept (and number) of focal areas by including in the definition
the localities identified in the Implementation Letter, and any other locality to be agreed between CONABIO and the Bank.
60
   Total population in the focal areas was estimated at 374,999 (PAD). Based on INEGI’s estimate of the proportion of producers
among the total population, the total number of producers in the focal areas is estimated at 31,263. Thus, the reported figure of 47,042
producers who are effectively engaged in reducing their high-impact resource use practices that are detrimental to biodiversity exceeds
the original target (30–50% of 31,263 producers).



                                                                  36
120. The capacity to appropriately measure the achievement of the operation’s
indicators was limited by the lack of an appropriate baseline of all producers associated
with high-impact resource use practices detrimental to biodiversity in native ecosystems
in focal areas. Such a baseline would have helped to appropriately respond to the
question of whether no more than 30–50% of producers continue to use such practices
after the project’s intervention. However, the proxy indicator used does suggest that the
involvement of producers in sustainable management with improved livelihoods is more
likely to have the expected result.

Increased share of production is generated by selected, financially sustainable,
biodiversity-friendly practices of natural resource use

121. Sustainable/biodiversity-friendly production was established through subprojects
financed or cofinanced by the MMBC in 22,580 ha, which represent approximately 32%
of the productive areas of the focal areas. CONABIO used the following proxy: area
under sustainable production initiatives supported by subprojects to estimate the share of
sustainable production with regard to the total estimated productive land.62 There were
shortcomings in the design of the indicator to assess the share of sustainable production
achieved: the measurement and verification means were left undefined for number of
producers or hectares, since the project did not have a baseline for either. This did not
compromise the achievement of the operation’s objectives, its efficiency or its relevance,
but it did affect the consistency of the reporting on the progress and performance.

Increased proportion of public programs and spending take into account biodiversity
criteria

122. The PAD indicator requires that in the various corridors, at least 40% of existing
and new public programs and at least 20% of public spending with impacts on the natural
resource base take into account biodiversity considerations, including: a) programs
reoriented from potentially harmful to biodiversity-friendly or -neutral activities; b)
programs actively promoting activities of sustainable use of biodiversity. However, no
baseline was defined during preparation.

123. The mainstreaming target was accomplished by incorporating biodiversity criteria
in objectives and operational rules of public spending with impacts on the natural
resource base, achieving the objective of ensuring that at least 40% of existing and new

61
   The PAD defined Focal Area as the area in which actual project activities are targeted and where progress and impact indicators will
be monitored. The basic building blocks of a focal area are land tenure units (ejidos, communities, private properties); therefore, the
boundaries of a focal area result from the boundaries of the land tenure units that constitute it. When the project was designed, the
ministries participating in the National Corridor Council had signed the Institutional Coordination Agreement to assist priority
regions. The focal areas were selected in the priority regions to ensure specific assistance from the institutions (as committed in the
project’s Implementation Letter). When the new administration was inaugurated, the priority regions strategy was discontinued and
the project asked the Bank to allow the new focal areas to be incorporated in the work program, adding new ones or replacing those
where the project’s work was no longer promising or feasible. (Amendment to the Grant Agreement signed on November 20, 2005).
62
   On average 20% of the land is devoted to primary productive activities in the country. This represents 68,477 ha in the focal areas.
The area under subprojects (22,580 ha) represents 32.9% of the productive area in the focal areas. This is also true for Chiapas
(1,515,175 ha agriculture; 7,421,100 ha total) and even less for Campeche: 18,900 ha agriculture+21,499 ha forestry; total 5,792,400
ha). (INEGI)



                                                                 37
public programs and at least 20% of public spending with impacts on the corridors take
into account biodiversity considerations.63 Given the project’s objective to mainstream
biodiversity criteria in public spending, baseline government programs were considered
an integral part of the project’s financing package: if the project was successful in its
mainstreaming efforts, funds for regular development programs that would have had a
negative impact on biodiversity conservation in the corridors, would be reoriented in a
biodiversity-friendly direction, including: a) programs reoriented from potentially
harmful to biodiversity-friendly or -neutral activities; b) programs actively promoting
activities for the sustainable use of biodiversity. (See PAD, p. 14, Component B and
Annex 4 for details.)

124. The proxy used by CONABIO to report at the policy level was that the MMBC
contributed to mainstreaming biodiversity criteria in the operational rules64 of SAGARPA
which is the single largest source of public spending in the four corridor states, and last
year alone allocated US$30.9 billion65 to its rural development programs in the country.
The proxy indicator for the work in the field66 was that the MMBC directly reoriented
investments potentially harmful to biodiversity and promoted bio-friendly activities on
the order of US$34,869,81167 (MXN$439,708,312.28) in the Corridor areas.

125. Qualitatively speaking, it is possible to confirm that SAGARPA has been the
most benefited by the MMBC work, including changes in operational rules, increasing
allocation to Corridor areas and a coordination agreement with SEMARNAT to improve
the environmental performance of the sector in the Corridor areas (see reference above
and contribution to EnvDPL in Section 3.1. below). SEDESOL incorporated a new
objective in its sectoral program: “Objective 5. Integrate conservation of natural capital in
the         country’s           social        and          economic           development”
(http://www.sedesol.gob.mx/archivos/1/file/Prog_Sectorial_WEB.pdf).

126. The inter-institutional coordination for investments in the field with relevant
partners such as SAGARPA has placed the corridor concept on the political agenda. Most
of the achievements reported have a problem of attribution, since deforestation rates and
landowners’ decisions depend on multiple factors. However, in the case of the corridor
concept as a public policy approach that is embraced by relevant federal agencies and
state governments other than in the participating states, such impacts can be fully
attributable to the project since the concept has not been promoted by any other relevant
initiative in the country. The collaboration agreement signed between the Ministry of

63
   In a study commissioned by the MMBC for the Bank’s MTR (Aguilar 2005), 52 relevant programs were identified in the Corridor
area: Ministry of Environment (SEMARNAT, 17); Ministry of Agriculture (SAGARPA, 9); Social Development/Indigenous Peoples
(SEDESOL/CDI, 13). SEMARNAT’s programs already had sustainability/biodiversity criteria and the project focused on increasing
their contribution to the Corridor areas; SAGARPA has been the most impacted by the MMBC work (see reference above and
contribution to EnvDPL in Section 3.1 below) and SEDESOL incorporated a new objective in its sectoral program: “Objective 5.
Integrate     conservation     of    natural     capital     in     the    country’s      social   and  economic       development”

64
   See SAGARPA operational rules: http://sagarpa.gob.mx/programas/Paginas/default.aspx The operational rules state that one of
SAGARPA’s five objectives is to “Reverse the deterioration of ecosystems, through actions to preserve water, soils and biodiversity.”

66
   There are two dimensions to mainstreaming: a) policy design, norms and operational rules; and b) increased reorientation of public
expenditure for sustainable use/conservation projects. (MTR Aide-Mémoire, January 18–28, 2005)
67
   The amount allocated to subprojects is relevant as a counterpart funding target of the project.



                                                                38
Environment (SEMARNAT) and Ministry of Agriculture (SAGARPA) to halt the
expansion of agriculture and livestock and to redirect investment toward conservation
and sustainable natural resources management (NRM) best practices compatible with
corridor connectivity objectives, was endorsed by SAGARPA and SEMARNAT as a
prior action for the rural sector, in the Environment DPL (P095510) that closed in
December 2009.68

127. During field visits, the team witnessed effective intersectoral coordination and the
impact of reoriented investments. Based on this experience, SAGARPA is expanding its
agreement with SEMARNAT—promoted by the MMBC—to mainstream biodiversity
criteria in rural development programs and redirect investments in the region, which in
turn contributes to its objectives and obligations within the Climate Change Special
Program.69

128. In coordination with the MMBC project (but not transferred to the project unit for
direct execution), GTZ (German Technical Cooperation) on behalf of German Federal
Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) has supported the national
commission for protected areas CONANP in the management of the Calakmul biosphere
reserve, mainly in the field of land use planning (“ordenamiento territorial”).

129. Other donors have renewed their interest in the region. The Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) co-sponsored the first and second International Connectivity
Workshops in 2008–2009, hosted by the MMBC in Chiapas. The project continues to
support target communities and corridor strategies, while the project’s administration has
been restructured to incorporate three new states in the program. Sustainability and
expansion have been secured through the formalization of the program and the creation
of a dedicated department in CONABIO. Congress has allocated US$2 million to the
corridors in the 2009 budget.

130. The reorientation of public expenditure toward sustainable/biodiversity-friendly
options (e.g., apiculture, shade coffee, reduced tillage, compost, organic production,
improved forest management, non-timber forest products, extractive reserves,
silvopastoral practices, ecotourism) has reduced the volume of resources available for—
and promotion of—activities that negatively impact biodiversity. As such, the project has
contributed to the stabilization of the agricultural frontier as documented in vegetation
maps generated by the project, and as demonstrated by the presence of indicator species,
according to the records of the research groups that collaborated in the MMBC multi-
scale monitoring network. (See www.cbmm.gob.mx .)

131. On the ground, the project’s success has been due to its ability to reduce
deforestation and thus habitat degradation by consolidating the work of technical groups,
NGOs and local producers who, over several decades, have demonstrated the usefulness

   Keeping track of public investment programs was not possible because the new administration designed a new approach, reducing
and regrouping many of the existing rural development programs. The Bank’s Rural Development in Marginal Areas APL I was
closed in June 2003 (P007711) and the APL II in June 2005 (P057530).

   Because there was no baseline at the time of design/approval nor was one produced during execution, Corridor monitoring was
completed in isolated patches chosen by graduate students in order to prepare their dissertation papers. The patches chosen had similar
conditions to the corridors, but were located outside of them in areas with no project intervention. Section 2.3 (below), Monitoring and

   Strategic lines are defined in PAD Annex 7. Strategic lines: Strengthening of productive practices of indigenous populations
compatible with conservation, including production of aggregate value from local raw material. Among others, the project will support
agroforestry and forestry management activities, including chicle gum, vanilla and organic coffee production, as well as apiculture.

   The MTR highlighted the lack of definition of corridors and focal areas, and the lack of understanding of the purpose of the
mainstreaming effort to redirect, rather than replace, investments in sustainable development. During the MTR, CONABIO proposed
to review the limits of the original 16 focal areas to adjust them to ecoregional and socioeconomic characteristics, and in particular
suggested the incorporation of the southern and western forest areas in the State of Quintana Roo because of their relevance to the
conservation of Calakmul and its vicinity to Selva Maya in Guatemala. (MTR Aide-Mémoire, January 18–28, 2005). The amendment
to the Grant Agreement signed on November 20, 2005 expanded the concept (and number) of focal areas by including in the definition
the localities identified in the Implementation Letter, and any other locality to be agreed between CONABIO and the Bank.
79
   Total population in the focal areas was estimated at 374,999 (PAD). Based on INEGI’s estimate of the proportion of producers
among the total population, the total number of producers in the focal areas is estimated at 31,263. Therefore, the reported figure of
47,042 producers effectively engaged to reduce their high impact resource use practices detrimental to biodiversity exceeds the
original target (30–50% of 31,263 producers).
80
   The PAD defined focal area as the area in which actual project activities are targeted and where progress and impact indicators will
be monitored. The basic building blocks of a focal area are land tenure units (ejidos, communities, private properties). Therefore, the
boundaries of a focal area are a result of the boundaries of the land tenure units constituting it. When the project was designed, the
ministries participating in the National Corridor Council had signed the Institutional Coordination Agreement to assist priority
regions. The focal areas were selected in the priority regions to ensure specific assistance from the institutions (as committed in the
project’s Implementation Letter). When the new administration was inaugurated, the priority regions strategy was discontinued and
the project asked the Bank to allow the new focal areas to be incorporated in the work program, adding new ones or replacing those
where the project’s work was no longer promising or feasible. (Amendment to the Grant Agreement signed on November 20, 2005).

   On average 20% of the land is devoted to primary productive activities in the country. This represents 68,477 ha in the focal areas.
The area under subprojects (22,580 ha) represents 32.9% of the productive area in the focal areas. This is also true for Chiapas
(1,515,175 ha agriculture; 7,421,100 ha total) and even less for Campeche: 18,900 ha agriculture+21,499 ha forestry; total 5,792,400
ha). (INEGI)

    In 2001, SAGARPA reorganized over 40 product-oriented programs into four programs defined by type of intervention:
Organization, Training, Production, Commercialization; in 2007, SEMARNAT reorganized six forestry programs into one umbrella
program and doubled the budget for the new program: Proarbol.

SAGARPA’s five objectives is to “Reverse the deterioration of ecosystems, through actions to preserve water, soils and biodiversity.”

   There are two dimensions to mainstreaming: a) policy design, norms and operational rules; and b) increased reorientation of public
expenditure for sustainable use/conservation projects. (MTR Aide-Mémoire, January 18–28, 2005.)

   Strategic lines are defined in PAD Annex 7. Strategic lines: Strengthening of productive practices of indigenous populations
compatible with conservation, including production of aggregate value from local raw material. Among others, the project will support
agroforestry and forestry management activities, including chicle gum, vanilla and organic coffee production, as well as apiculture.
(See Annex 3.)

   After the project was designed, and before it was declared effective, SAGARPA reorganized 38 rural development programs into
four programs. The three programs cited here concentrate the largest budget and potential (and track record) of environmentally
harmful investments.
93
   “Alianza Contigo” was one of the new programs launched by SAGARPA after the reorganization/regrouping of its subsidy
programs. Alianza Contigo consolidated 12 programs that were operating separately at the time of the MMBC’s preparation.
94
   The first three of the CONAFOR programs cited were regrouped with six other programs under the ProArbol umbrella program
starting in 2007. Now the operational rules for the larger program contain positive incentives assigning priority for activities with both
development and biodiversity benefits.

   Given the project’s objective to mainstream biodiversity criteria in public spending, baseline government programs are considered
an integral part of the project’s financing package: if the project is successful in its mainstreaming efforts, funds for regular
development programs that would have had a negative impact on biodiversity conservation in the corridors, would be reoriented in a
biodiversity-friendly direction, including: a) programs reoriented from potentially harmful to biodiversity-friendly or -neutral
activities; b) programs actively promoting activities for the sustainable use of biodiversity. See below the description of Component B
and Annex 4 for details. (PAD, p. 14.)

   From a total of 215 subprojects implemented by the MMBC between 2005 and 2009, 209 assessments were conducted in 29
locations in the five corridors. (See Section 3.6: Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops; Survey

132.     Although it is still too early to effectively attribute any part of observed gains to a single
intervention, there is a definitive link among (i) the project’s mainstreaming efforts, (ii) the rural
development interventions by relevant actors, (iii) the trends in the land and resource use that
drive, or contain, the rate of native habitat loss99, (iv) the impact of specific human-economic
activities promoted in the region, and (v) the prevalence of wildlife, illustrated by their presence
in the corridors100, where research and monitoring activities are carried out. With regard to the
corridor concept as a public policy approach that is embraced by relevant federal agencies and
state governments other than participating states, such impacts can be fully attributable to the
project since the concept has not been promoted by any other relevant initiative in the country.

Local Planning

133. Planning activities to improve organizational and technical capacities were
identified early in the preparation of the project as key tools for the Corridor strategy.

134. Subprojects, training and technical assistance were the means to approach the
above objective: although the original number of subprojects was reduced from 565 to
120 when the amount of GEF resources available for each subproject was increased from
US$20,000 to US$50,000 (3rd Grant Agreement Amendment, 2005); demand kept
growing as promotion progressed and project allies and cofinanciers became increasingly
important.

135. Direct financing for subprojects was modest compared to federal investments in
the region. They were designed to leverage resources from other government programs in
order to reorient those programs’ objectives in order to sustain the biodiversity-friendly
impacts beyond the execution of the subprojects. Screening criteria for a subproject to
receive cofinancing support from the MMBC included both the activity’s potential
contribution to the economic and social development of the Southeast Mexico and the
extent of its environmental sustainability/biodiversity friendliness.

136. Additional activities supported by the MMBC were guided by the need to
strengthen the core activities in the field with:

   The five corridors cover more than 10% of the total area of the four states (21,976,200 ha total), while the focal areas represent an
estimated 347,388 ha (15% of the Corridor area). The rate of habitat loss remains high at 195,773 ha/year, which is equivalent to more
than half the land surface in the project focal areas where habitat loss has been contained. Source: National Forest Inventory (2010)

Indigenous Peoples and Gender

137.     The project was based on socially- and culturally-appropriate means of technology
transfer, organization and decision making through traditional community processes.

138.    The MMBC project has facilitated local producer access to many institutional regional
and rural development programs.101 In the case of indigenous peoples, a “coaching” approach was
employed to ensure that communities were assisted through the many steps required to help them
101
    It has been able to do so in part by building on the achievements of the IBRD Community Forestry project (P007700, closed in
December 2003) and its ability to facilitate strengthening the technical and organizational capabilities of local producers.



                                                               54
manage their resources. Community planning tools mainstreamed through the project helped
them to develop a broader vision of their own future. Consensus building and the participation of
community members in decision making to increase social capital helped to ensure the
sustainability of the project’s impacts and achievements. In the region covered by the MMBC,
with 85,000 people attended by the project, 36% of the population is indigenous.

139.    An estimated 30,600 indigenous producers and over 600 women from 226 indigenous
communities participated in MMBC subprojects: 73 subprojects for indigenous peoples,
including 38 subprojects for women, represent an estimated investment of MXN$12.4 million
pesos (ca. US$977,979.68).

3.3 Efficiency

140. The project did not have an economic analysis in the original PAD. During
appraisal, a choice was made to base the economic chapter on an Incremental Cost
Analysis, instead of doing a cost-benefit, or other type of economic analysis.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

141. While over its nine years of implementation the project did not report on some of
the indicators that were intended to measure progress and results (as specified in the
PAD), evidence suggests that the overall Global Environment Objective of
mainstreaming biodiversity into public investments has been achieved. The substantial
shortcomings in achieving the operation’s objectives (or difficulty to appropriately assess
the results), and in its performance during the first part of its implementation (2001–
2004), was largely overcome in the second period (2005–2009).

142. As shown in table 7 above, during 2009 the MMBC directly reoriented
investments potentially harmful to biodiversity and promoted bio-friendly activities by
significant amounts in the Corridor areas. Additionally, there is general agreement among
the Borrower, the partners, and the donors about the relevance and contributions of the
operation.

143. The project’s accomplishments and impacts described above explain why the
GOM, the NCC and the SCCs consider it successful. Biodiversity criteria were
incorporated into the objectives and operational rules of various public investment
programs and Corridor areas received greater allocations of funds for sustainable use and
biodiversity conservation activities.

144. The GOM, the NCC and the SCCs have expressed their perception that the
establishment of the five biological corridors has helped to preserve ecosystem
connectivity between 24 protected areas. As such, the corridor concept has become a
model for other regions of Mexico. Since 2009, the GOM has established new corridors
to ensure the conservation of biodiversity in the states of Tabasco, Oaxaca and Veracruz.
The demarcation of the new corridors was conducted by the MMBC team within
CONABIO to include territories that enhance connectivity and conservation of
landscapes between NPAs in order to stem direct threats of further ecosystem
fragmentation.

145. When approved, this project was one of the first in the world to apply the
innovative corridor concept, in an area of 4.5 million hectares of land in Campeche,




                                            56
Chiapas, Quintana Roo and Yucatan.102 Monitoring activities were not appropriate to
report on progress of the project indicators defined in the PAD, but fieldwork has
provided data confirming that biological corridors promote the survival of emblematic
species through improvements in habitat integrity by coupling sustainable use initiatives
with conservation of habitats. It also indicates that the landscape mosaic including
remaining forest patches within the corridors provide essential resources for the survival
of species that require less space, such as the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), contributing to
genetic connectivity between sub-populations, promoting their regional persistence and
thus the maintenance of their current population levels.

146. It is important to note that both qualitative and quantitative evidence suggests that
the use of adequate indicators (for example through a formal revision in a project
restructuring), would have allowed to appropriately assess the project achievements,
which might have earned the Project an overall Satisfactory rating.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

147. During preparation, the results of the social assessment highlighted the need to
tailor the activities of the project to the specific conditions of the communities located in
the Corridor, taking into consideration their socioeconomic and cultural differences. To
enhance the social impact of the project, the following activities were identified: (1)
strengthening social organization; particularly where oriented to income-generating
activities; (2) promoting a gender approach in the generation and distribution of income
as well as in communal decision making and distribution of labor; and (3) increasing
technical capacity to manage sustainable development projects in different fields (as
discussed above, Section 2.1 “Social Considerations”).

148. Thirty-four percent of the subprojects supported by the MMBC were directed to
women: family vegetable gardens, wood-saving stoves, solid waste management, and
mangrove reforestation. 151 (42%) subprojects were directed to indigenous communities
in the corridors. In total, 628 communities benefited in 75 municipalities: 59 located in
Chiapas, 2 in Campeche, 4 in Quintana Roo, and 16 in Yucatan. The total project
investment directed toward indigenous communities was equivalent to the US$1 million
resources described in the PAD. (See PAD, Annex 2, p.6.)

149. Those communities and producer organizations that receive project resources
have been equipped to take advantage of opportunities to promote their products in fair
and “green” markets, which value sustainable natural resource use, biodiversity
conservation and the biological corridor context. This can help producers achieve a
premium price for their products. In addition, the use of zero tillage, composting and
other biodiversity-friendly practices reduce the need to buy agrochemicals, while

                                             57
generally demanding additional labor. The outcome of this equation: is that the
investment remains largely within the same community, contributing to strengthen social
capital, providing additional livelihood and income opportunities (the additional labor),
while improving income and quality of life. One idea the MMBC team has been pursuing
is the creation and use of a Corridor “eco-label” as a mechanism to strengthen marketing
of products from MMBC communities.

150. With the aim of developing the potential “eco-label” niche market, the MMBC
team signed an agreement with the Latin American Food Show (LAFS) to allow
producers to exhibit their products in LAFS fairs held each year, the first being in Cancun
(Quintana Roo) in September 2008. The MMBC also participates in the Biological
Resource Collective (PRBC), established by CONABIO in 2002, which provides support
those producers who use natural resources sustainably in order for them to develop
commercial products. As a result of these experiences, the MMBC organized two
promotional shows with products from the five corridors, presenting them to the dynamic
tourism sector of Quintana Roo and the international Fair Trade market: X Caret 2008
and Cancun 2009.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

151. The National and State Corridor Councils have been institutionalized as
participatory spaces where environment sector government institutions can collaborate
with stakeholders to promote activities to harmonize public development programs and
spending with local demand for sustainable development activities. This participatory
approach has established trust and cooperation among institutions and communities,
strengthening the function of the councils in future MMBC activities. Moreover, the
transparency associated with the councils’ participatory decision-making process has
helped establish mechanisms for resolving conflicts and improving governability in the
region. GOM resources designated for the MMBC region (i.e., to finance logistics for
meetings and transportation of stakeholders to attend council meetings) guarantee the
operational sustainability of the SCCs after the close of the project.

152. The project also contributed to strengthening academia and NGOs, since the
corridors and associated conservation and sustainable development subprojects became a
subject of discussion in seminars and a theme of research projects. Seventeen books on
project management, sustainable management and use of resources, information systems,
fair trade, assessment of forest plantations, etc., were published as a result of this impact.
These publications provide rich and varied information that will facilitate not only
MMBC-based promotion of community efforts of biodiversity conservation and
sustainable use of natural resources, but also similar activities and interventions
throughout Mexico and the region to be lead by strengthened and informed institutions
(See Annex 2: Publications).

153. In particular, government institutions such as SEMARNAT and SAGARPA (as
well as the other Ministries that had signed on to the Foundations for Inter-Institutional
Collaboration agreement) benefited from the MMBC project. Through project promotion



                                             58
of and activities for reorienting public investments and development programs, in
addition to facilitating the flow of project data and information, many public officials and
decision makers were exposed to and trained in the importance of including biodiversity
considerations in their investment programs. As a result, not only did the MMBC
contribute to supporting the mandate of the collaboration agreement (signed in 1998,
prior to project implementation) and reinforcing sustainable development activities in
Corridor areas, but it also strengthened the individual institutions so that their subsequent
investment impacts might extend beyond the MMBC region to other areas of Mexico.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

154. The project facilitated institutional re-direction within CONABIO. Before,
CONABIO focused primarily on ecological and biological research and lacked
experience working with stakeholders. Now, the organization values and actively
supports participatory conservation with local communities, helping to manage and lead
that process. Moreover, the MMBC team within CONABIO has emerged as a credible
institutional stakeholder: a consensus-building institution capable of implementing
successful sustainable development projects to the point where it is a sought-after partner
in other regions of Mexico with governments and stakeholders from other Mexican states
petitioning to be included in the Corridor initiative. Similarly, the MMBC team has been
invited to facilitate dialogue and collaboration between actors among different levels of
government (municipal, state, national), and with various stakeholders and governments
of Central American countries: as a result of this project, the MMBC team is stepping
into the role of facilitating south-south cooperation and exchanges to support sustainable
development initiatives within the Regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.

155. Considering the complex social and environmental nature of the region, the
MMBC succeeded in establishing itself as a highly respected program with a great degree
of influence and consensus in order to achieve alignment between bottom-up community-
driven development and top-down operational policy-driven development, ultimately
reinforcing its overall goal to promote the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity. As a part of that process, it brought together diverse institutions across all
levels (national, state, local) into a participatory network for sustainable development and
biodiversity conservation. The capacity-building opportunities provided by the project
through implementation of project activities, has strengthened institutions (and thus the
network) to the point where they are leading follow-on initiatives in which they
incorporate activities and priorities piloted in during the MMBC project (see Section 2.5).

156. Corridor activities have contributed to a strategy for adaptation to climate change.
Following the impact of Hurricane Stan (2006) in the coffee-producing region of
Motozintla-Chiapas, an assessment supported by GTZ, Banchiapas and UNAM identified
five measures that would reduce vulnerability of the region to such extreme climatic
events: i) conservation and use of diversity of species and varieties for intercropping
(maize-field poly-culture: native maize, beans, squash, chili); ii) diversification of
productive activities of land along altitudinal gradients (corridors), iii) watershed
management and slope stabilization; iv) protected agriculture (greenhouses); and v)



                                             59
silvopastoral systems. The MMBC helped to establish the importance of such activities as
part of its broader sustainable development objective. Based on the MMBC experience, it
is clear that such actions constitute valuable inputs into any strategy that targets climate
change adaptation in rural areas of Mexico.

157. In Mexico’s national strategy for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
Degradation (REDD)103, the set of actions that the MMBC promotes has also been
identified as a valuable contribution to preventing negative changes in forest use and soil
degradation. In the REDD pilot project for the state of Michoacán (2009–2010), the
strategy consists of four instruments: Forest Programs (PROCYMAF, COINBIO, PSA,
etc.); the Special Program for Food Security (PESA-FAO); the Land Management
Program (UNFCCC); and Biological Corridors.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

158.       During 2009, the Project Coordination Unit commissioned the following survey:

Sustainable Rural Development Program MMBC-CONABIO-SAGARPA in the Region of
Marqués de Comillas, Chiapas.104

159. The Sustainable Rural Development Program in the region of Marqués de
Comillas (PDRS-MC), Chiapas, has been executed by the MMBC since 2008. The
program seeks to integrate the conservation of natural resources (mainly tropical
rainforests) into improved production and social development in local communities. It is
an initiative attempting to provide continuity to efforts in Mexico and Chiapas aiming to
achieve environmentally sustainable and socially equitable rural development and
production. The Marqués de Comillas region forms part of the MMBC given its
importance for Corridor connectivity. However, subsistence farming is the most
prominent activity (85% of the population is in “asset poverty”105), contributing to a
cumulative loss of forest cover in this area ranging from 40% to 50%.

160. The PDRS-MC is coordinated by SAGARPA, MMBC, CONABIO, SEMARNAT
and the Government of Chiapas. It initially operated in 29 ejidos, in three focal areas
within the Municipalities of Marqués de Comillas, Benemérito de las Américas,
Ocosingo and Maravilla Tenejapa. The total area of participating ejidos is 120,447
hectares.

161. The first stage of the fieldwork included interviews, a socioeconomic assessment,
and a workshop with ejidatarios, municipal and ejido authorities, civil servants and
researchers. The main findings of the survey were:

    The study was conducted in September 2009 by the Centro Interdisciplinario de Biodiversidad A.C (CEIBA) with the help of the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID), focusing on achievements/results from 2008.

162.       Preliminary quantitative findings:

                    (i) The stabilization of 20,000 ha was achieved, based on agreements with
                          production units, which reward conservation and promotion of
                          biological connectivity associated with productive investment plans
                          for local agricultural and forestry development;
                    (ii) 1,500 families have been incorporated into sustainability processes;
                    (iii) Actions are helping to stabilize 422 hectares of farmland that produce
                          maize with sustainable use methods. This area excludes the use of fire,
                          and around 50 tons of dry matter was incorporated into the soil by
                          adding Mucuna pruriens106. As a result, the need for rotating the use of
                          agricultural lands is reduced and there is a possibility for converting
                          4,222 hectares that are currently abandoned and form part of the fallow
                          lands (of the maize fields). The recovery of 350 hectares of abandoned
                          land is ensured by enrichment with useful forest species;
                    (iv) 173 silvopastoral modules were established, which planted 260,000
                          trees and shrubs, and launched the restoration of 795 hectares of
                          degraded pastures;
                    (v) 53 riverbank restoration modules were established, corresponding to
                          five kilometers of streams or runoff systems.

163.       Technical evidence:

                    (i) The MMBC team documented scientific evidence regarding the
                          biological connectivity of forest ecosystems and processes of
                          fragmentation in the humid tropics and in the region of Marqués de
                          Comillas;
                    (ii) The MMBC team, as executor of the PDRS-MC, integrated and
                          formalized the program’s working rules at different levels: through the
                          MMBC-CONABIO-SAGARPA agreements, and with the producer
                          organizations;
                    (iii) The MMBC team helped to avoid duplication of programs and actions
                          and to achieve confluence with programs for environmental services,
                          protected natural areas, timber forests, and ecotourism, among others.

164.       Perception of the participants:

                    (i) 78 % of participants were involved in the design of the subprojects,
                        objectives of the Corridor and implementation of activities as opposed
                        to other public programs, which have not requested such input from
                        local producers;

                                                                61
              (ii) Municipal officials who were interviewed approve of the program as it
                    made efforts to involve them in its planning and operation;
              (iii) In general, participants expressed that the program has brought various
                    economic and environmental benefits.

       Economic and social impact in the Corridors of Chiapas and the Yucatan
       Peninsula

165. From a total of 215 subprojects implemented by the MMBC between 2005 and
2009, 209 assessments were conducted in 29 locations in the five corridors. The
summarized findings are as follows:

       Economic:

              (i) 98% of those surveyed perceive that the MMBC has significantly
                    supported regional development through the subprojects and
                    associated training;
              (ii) 38% felt that both production and marketing have improved;
              (iii) 18% have their product on the market;
              (iv) 54% consider that their income has improved.

       Environmental:

                 (i) 96% think that the MMBC is helping to conserve the tropical and/or
                      temperate forest;
                 (ii) 88% are aware of the objectives of the MMBC.

       Social:

                 (i) 97% stated that the subprojects are approved in community
                      assemblies;
                 (ii) 86% believe that the transparency with which the MMBC reports on
                      the project objectives has improved relations within the community
                      and organizations and everyone is aware that they are directed to
                      conservation; and
                 (iii)57% of the subprojects were implemented in indigenous communities.

166. One of the conclusions of the above evaluation is that the socioeconomic impact
of the MMBC since 2005 is evident in production processes that have been improved
(ecotourism, cocoa, honey, coffee, gum, pepper, vegetables, etc), and by products
currently sold through alternative market channels and in markets for environmental
services; as well as by the inclusion of gender and cultural equity in production activities
and incentives. Another impact identified is the strengthening of social capital by
supporting activities that improve local capacities for design, management, evaluation
and monitoring of productive projects and activities.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

167. The corridor concept has gained wide acceptance in government, academia and
civil society. Therefore, risks that would endanger continued development of project
results are low. Since the end of 2009, project activities in the corridors of southeast
Mexico have been funded by SEMARNAT/CONABIO. Integration of conservation and
sustainable management objectives into public policy planning is a long-term task that
requires generating consensus. The MMBC has become a program of the GOM with the
ability to foster that consensus in the four states where the corridor approach was piloted.

168. Since 2008, the State of Tabasco has allocated resources to perform diagnostics
for the new corridors supported by its State Corridor Council (formed outside of MMBC
activities). These will connect the Biosphere Reserve Pantanos de Centla (302,707
hectares), the private area Rancho la Asunción (572 hectares), the Laguna de Términos
Protected Areas of Flora and Fauna (705,017 hectares) and Usumacinta Canyon (46,128
hectares). These corridors have been named “Humedales costeros – Sierra de
Huimanguillo”, “Pantanos de Centla – Cañón de Usumancita” and “Sierra de Tabasco”.
Togethr, they comprise 56.6% of the land area of Tabasco.

169. Furthermore, CONABIO/SEMARNAT is currently preparing with the World
Bank a GEF-financed project: “Fostering of Sustainable and Competitive Production
Systems consistent with the Conservation of Biodiversity”, to be implemented from 2011
to 2016. The objective of the project is to promote sustainable production chains for
goods and services that take into consideration biodiversity criteria, in order to underpin a
development strategy in the region and to reinforce this project’s actions and gains made
from 2001 to 2009.



5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

170. The performance of the Bank in identifying, preparing and appraising the
operation was Moderately Unsatisfactory given its underestimation of political and
institutional obstacles. As mentioned earlier, the uncertainty posed by the imminent
change in the government administration moved the Bank team to appraise without
including in project design the baselines for key indicators, leading to over-ambitious
indicators (i.e., indicators to monitor and report on perturbation of habitats and species
populations), which were too general in the sense that it was unrealistic to measure and
monitor them effectively. Yet, linking mainstreaming objectives to the biological corridor
concept in project design made it innovative, bold and the first of its kind. There were no



                                             63
preceding corridor projects from which to draw lessons; rather, the task team relied on
prior protected area and community forestry projects from which to glean applicable
inputs for design and implementation.

171. The resulting project was highly pertinent to both Bank and national priorities.
The Bank conducted an assessment of the current state of key biodiversity and social
issues, associated threats and alternatives for confronting them, highlighting the need for
a highly participatory process. The Bank focused its efforts on contributing to better
management of natural resources by promoting planning and monitoring tools based on
the biological corridor concept. The goal was to better balance conservation and use of
biodiversity and agro-biodiversity within a sustainable development framework.

172. The accelerated signing of the Grant Agreement complicated the completion of
the stakeholder consultation process (later recognized in the ISR) that was essential to the
creation of strategic alliances. The Bank task team should have anticipated that a change
in GOM administration would have presented complications, such as less commitment to
the project and the selection of a poorly qualified project coordinator. In response, the
Bank task team provided additional training and institutional support. Although mounting
evidence suggested that project administration was still not improving, it remained slow
to insist that more qualified staff be contracted at both the national and regional levels. In
light of the unresolved and rushed social consultations at the time of the signing, the
Bank task team coordinated the amendment process in order to facilitate access to GEF
resources and complete the consultations. However, considering this option sooner could
have greatly benefited project implementation.

173. Sufficient support from the incoming GOM administration did not materialize
until the new Minister of Environment, various Undersecretaries, head of CONABIO and
a new project coordinator were appointed. The incoming officials saw the project as an
opportunity to promote mainstreaming with a territorial approach and embraced the
concept. As a result, project implementation picked up and it was then that the new GOM
administration became an ardent supporter of the project.

174. Overall, while the Bank’s focus on substantive goals for the project was
satisfactory, its ability to anticipate and respond to political and social obstacles
expeditiously during design could have been improved in order to ensure timely project
implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

175. Project effectiveness was delayed for over one year due to what proved to be an
incorrect design assumption that it would be possible to establish the project’s State
Corridor Councils prior to and as a condition of effectiveness. The role of the SCCs was
such that unless they were credible entities in the eyes of project actors they would not
function well and subsequently, achieving goals at the state and local level would be
difficult. Without project funding it was impossible to establish the state councils. In late



                                             64
2002, the Grant Agreement was amended to include processes for establishing the state
councils with civil society participation; they were no longer part of preparation and a
condition of effectiveness. The amendment also conditioned subsequent actions in the
states on first forming the state councils and delinked the states to allow each one begin
implementation as it formed its respective council. Original design demanded that all
states must form their councils before any state could move forward. The need for an
amendment was identified by the new task manager during the September 2001 mission,
who was appointed the same month. The project became effective in January 2002. (for
further detail, see ISR #6. 09/26/2003)

176. In December 2002 the supervision team reported that “the project continues to
rate as Satisfactory”, with a focus on putting in place the implementation framework and
developing institutional arrangements at the state and local level. At the time, the team
saw no critical risks that threatened the project's ability to achieve the GEO (ISR #4,
12/19/2002).

177. By June 2003, the supervision team recognized that the project coordination unit
lacked necessary experience for successful project management. In response, the task
team worked closely with them to provide short-term assistance for training in strategic
planning and developing critical actions to move the project forward. The Bank team
reported the PCU had been strong in beginning in forming partnerships required to
achieve mainstreaming objectives and that the project coordinator had good experience,
credibility and skills in interacting with indigenous groups and local dynamics. However,
this resulted in setbacks to implementation efficiency early on for the project’s larger
goals (i.e., institutional mainstreaming). The expectation was that in the long run the
PCU’s strengths would allow the project to catch up. (ISR #5, 06/18/2003.)

178. Given the importance of measuring and demonstrating results, the Bank should
have (a) insisted on the collection of baselines early on during implementation, and (b)
formally revised the indicators through a deliberate project restructuring process.
However, this was never done and as a result, at project closing it was very difficult to
credibly measure and attribute specific outcomes to project interventions as specified in
the PAD. This is a significant shortcoming in the quality of supervision by the Bank.

179. In June 2004, the project completed one year with an Unsatisfactory rating after
failing to comply with agreed actions necessary to improve implementation. The World
Bank’s Country Management Unit (CMU) and SHCP agreed to a series of 90-day action
plans. The project’s compliance with recommendation in each plan was to be closely
monitored by the Bank, SHCP and NAFIN. The second 90-day action plan was
successfully completed in January 2005, allowing for the project’s midterm review as
well as a review of CONABIO's proposal to reprogram the project. Among the key
elements that allowed the project to move forward were: (i) the completion of an
excellent independent evaluation that provided an opportunity for all relevant actors to
objectively discuss problems and obstacles that needed to be overcome; (ii) the
appointment of a new project coordinator, who had the necessary vision, background,
experience, and personal and institutional skills to direct implementation; (iii)
establishment of basic conditions for moving forward in all participating states, including


                                            65
the formation of the state councils; and (iv) the support and commitment from the highest
levels of SEMARNAT (Minister Alberto Cardenas and Undersecretary Fernando Tudela)
with assistance to help the project its mainstreaming objectives.

180. It was not until 2005, after reviewing project advances as part of the third and
final 90-day action plan, that the project would finally be rated Satisfactory in the ISR.

181. Early in 2005, the quality of project implementation improved greatly with the
new project coordinator. It showed promise of meeting its development objectives: in the
last year it became one of SEMARNAT’s key instruments for achieving biodiversity
conservation mainstreaming objectives. Among other actions, project management had:
(i) put in place the planning, budgeting and internal monitoring instruments necessary for
successful project implementation; (ii) established formal alliances and agreements with
relevant GOM entities (especially CONAFOR, SAGARPA, SEDESOL, INI) for
mainstreaming biodiversity in public expenditures; (iii) completed priority studies and
strategies at the national and state level in order to implement investment programs for
biodiversity conservation in the project area; and (iv) identified and prepared with
communities and producer groups a first series of subprojects to receive financing
through the principal public rural investment programs.

182. Although activities in 2005 advanced satisfactorily with regard to strategic
interventions at the national, state and institutional levels for mainstreaming biodiversity
and reorienting public expenditure, the advances were imbalanced. The bulk of the
achievements were on the institutional side with more limited advances in the field, aside
from local-level planning and participatory processes.(ISR #13, 06/01/2006.)

183. By November 2006, the supervision team recognized that despite significant
advances in meeting its central objectives to reorient public policy—with a high degree
of appropriation/ownership on the part of the key sectoral institutions (e.g., SEDESOL,
SAGARPA, CONAFOR, CDI) that provide the bulk of rural development financing to
the MMBC area—the project could not meet its development objectives within the
original timeframe (original closing date: June 30, 2008). At least 18 additional months
were required. The following supervision mission focused on evaluating the merits of a
project extension. The World Bank’s GEF Regional Coordinator for Latin America and
the Caribbean joined the mission to provide an objective opinion; her conclusion was that
the extension appeared justified, assuming certain conditions were met.107 (ISR #14,
12/27/2006; site visit 11/17/2006.)

184. Three task managers managed the project throughout its life. On average,
supervision missions were carried out two or three times a year, with a total of 20
supervision missions. The FAO-World Bank Cooperative Program (FAO-CP) made
strong contributions to project supervision and provided key technical supervision that
would otherwise not have been available. The Bank team: (i) processed three
amendments to the Grant Agreement to address the need for more comprehensive social
107
    Conditions such as keeping up project implementation pace, demonstrating that with the extension it would be able to achieve the
project development objective within the new timeframe, and to show progress in mainstreaming and acceptance of the corridor
concept.



                                                                 66
consultations as well as recalibration of project activities given the implementation lag
(though recognizing the need for such amendments may have been slower than
expected); (ii) provided extensive training and assistance to both phases of the PCU to
encourage more efficient implementation; and (iii) ensured compliance with all Bank
norms and procedures.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

185. The preparation and supervision teams failed to highlight the fact that there were
significant shortcomings in the operation’s capacity to monitor the achievement of its
objectives, even after the MTR. The team did focus on improving the efficiency of the
implementation, initially assisting an inexperienced PCU and later advocating for a
change in the project coordination team. The Bank team never lost perspective of the
operation’s relevance and continued to focus on its innovative mainstreaming approach.

186. CONABIO reported on project achievements using proxy indicators because (i) it
seemed impossible to follow the PAD’s territorial restrictions and to operate exclusively
in the original focal areas108, and (ii) the absence of clearer definitions of the project goals
in order to make them operational and to produce a baseline for evaluation of concepts
such as “reduced loss of habitat” or “population perturbation”. Although this was not
highlighted as a priority by the independent midterm evaluation, the team mentioned it in
the MTR Aide-Mémoire, but failed to restructure the project to better reflect indicators
and to include verification guidelines in order to report on them in ISRs. The Bank team
should have formally revised the indicators through a project restructuring process in
order to facilitate improved reporting that would better reflect important and relevant
project achievements. Indeed, there were significant shortcomings in the operation’s
capacity to measure and report on the achievement of its objectives, which prevailed
during the whole period of execution. As a result, the Borrower used proxy indicators that
were accepted by the Bank supervision teams.109 On the other hand, the team was
probably too risk averse with regard to the La Cojolita focal area in Chiapas, which led to
detailed implementation restrictions110. Considering the Bank’s performance during
project preparation and supervision, the overall rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

187. However, the Bank team was proactive in promoting partnerships with
institutional stakeholders and civil society and in providing technical assistance through
FAO/CP staff to overcome the delays resulting from the steep learning curve and
expectations raised by the project. The Bank team promoted the integration of gender and
culture and obtained additional resources (BNPP) to promote awareness and consensus-
building in the region; all of which contributed to strengthen CONABIO to achieve the
GEO and promoting the corridor concept nationwide.
108
    The definition of the focal areas was expanded in the amendment to the Grant Agreement approved in November 2005, but the
Bank team failed to update the monitoring indicators that this amendment affected.
109
     The Bank’s performance is being rated Moderately Unsatisfactory precisely because the team failed to update the indicator matrix
and propose a project restructuring accordingly.
110
    Considering the special conditions of the focal area La Cojolita, during the first year of project implementation there were
additional consultation activities carried out in this focal area. The conclusion of these activities was a condition for the application of
investment resources in La Cojolita. (PAD, Annex 12, p.9).



                                                                    67
5.2 Borrower
NOTE: When the government and implementing agency are indistinguishable, provide
rating and justification only for Overall Borrower Performance.


(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

188. The GOM supported the preparation of the project as it became a high priority for
biodiversity conservation in the states of southeastern Mexico. They collaborated with the
entire project team when the new PCU was hired in 2005. Prior to this, however, lack of
support from the GOM to ensure selection of qualified and experienced project staff
contributed to implementation delays. During the period in which the project was
declared Unsatisfactory, the support of SHCP and NAFIN were key to prompting
SEMARNAT and CONABIO to recognize the need for greater attention to the project.
(At the same time, the Bank recognized that the social consultation and integration of
state councils would require additional time and resources, leading to the first amendment
of the Grant Agreement.) CONABIO, SEMARNAT, NAFIN and SHCP followed up on
the three 90-day plans (2004–2005) in order to achieve the Moderately Satisfactory rating
in June 2005. At the close of the project, SEMARNAT assumed responsibility for its
operation and continuity as part of the overall environmental agenda. SEMARNAT also
increased its operation to the states of Tabasco, Oaxaca and Veracruz with resources from
the federal government.

189. Project implementation was severely limited during the period 2002 to 2005.
Although the initial efficiency of project implementation had significant shortcomings,
the GOM was instrumental in getting a new coordination team appointed in 2005,
recognizing its relevance.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

190. In light of significant shortcomings in the operation’s capacity to measure and
report on the achievement of its objectives, the GOM used proxy indicators that were
accepted by the Bank supervision teams, even though the indicator matrix was not
updated formally. Although initial project implementation efficiency suffered significant
shortcomings, these were appropriately dealt with and minimized by the new
coordination team appointed in 2005 at the same time that they increased the project’s
visibility and strengthened its relevance.

191. It should be clarified that CONABIO was not involved in the preparation phase,
which was led by SEMARNAT (General Directorate of Sustainable Development
Programs). CONABIO’s performance suffered many setbacks during the first stage of
implementation, in contrast to the performance of their new project management team
during the second stage (2005—2009), which was much improved. CONABIO-
SEMARNAT made the necessary changes identified in the midterm review (2005), such


                                           68
as the appointment of a new project coordinator with the required technical and
management skills to guide the project. Because CONABIO did not have sufficient
experience dealing with Bank operations, NAFIN provided relevant support and overall
guidance. As a result, procurement was rated Highly Satisfactory in the penultimate ex
post review and Satisfactory in the last ex post review (2009). Since 2002, the project has
been audited by an external private firm that issued an unqualified opinion on both the
project’s and NAFIN’S financial statements for FY2008. The audits have been received
in a timely manner. The last project audit report, corresponding to the CY2009, will be
furnished to the Bank before June 30, 2010 and will include all withdrawal applications,
as well as any expenditure documentation that was processed before April 30, 2010.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

192. Overall borrower performance is considered to be Moderately Unsatisfactory.
There were major shortcomings during the September 2003–June 2005 period when the
project was rated Unsatisfactory, before the GOM appointed a new project coordination
team. Nevertheless, during that period the GOM was closely in contact with the Bank to
seeking appropriate solutions. The resulting series of 90-day action plans were closely
monitored and finally allowed the project to be gradually upgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory and then to Satisfactory in June 2007. Although initial project
implementation efficiency suffered significant shortcomings, these were appropriately
dealt with and minimized by the new coordination team appointed in 2005 at the same
time that they increased the project’s visibility and strengthened its relevance. If one
could rate the second stage of project implementation (2005—2009) separately, it would
be Satisfactory.

193. The National Corridor Council, which included institutions linked to the
environmental sector, committed to promoting the operation’s objectives, thus facilitating
project management with institutions at all three levels of government. It is worth noting
that the active and committed participation of members in the State Corridor Councils,
particularly in Chiapas, resulted in a great number of actions implemented at local level
that had the consensus of all council members. Considering the scale and great diversity
of stakeholder interests, the project incorporated relevant risks during the design phase;
some risks were unexpected and posed challenges to the Borrower, however they were
managed in the end, with assistance from the Bank team and other partners (i.e.,
specialist from the FAO/CP). Due to its innovative biodiversity conservation activities,
positive project results and the high level of impact generated and reflected in the surveys
conducted during 2009, the project’s approach has been adopted by other states of
Mexico.

6. Lessons Learned
Strategic operationalization of the project PDO was not captured by the output and
outcome indicators

194. The project pursued a policy development objective that contributed to the
reorientation of development programs and Mexico’s first Environmental Structural
Adjustment Loan. The mainstreaming objective was difficult to measure quantitatively
while also capturing the project’s direct impact on policy development. CONABIO
reports that the project achieved significant policy development objectives given the
success in mainstreaming biodiversity criteria in public expenditures as evidenced by
their incorporation into the objectives and operational rules of relevant SAGARPA,
SEDESOL and SEMARNAT investment programs. It also became apparent that that
while monitoring of vegetation cover and perturbation of species populations and habitats
(the original indicators in the PAD) is important, they cannot fully grasp nor reflect
biodiversity mainstreaming achievements, especially within institutions.

Guiding criteria to define working areas

195. While some indicators were vague and no baseline defined, other parts of the
project were defined in detail, reducing the capacity for adaptive management.
Conceptually, focal areas were originally designed to provide geographical structure for
specific and targeted interventions in the Corridor area. It was also thought that their
limited geographical scope would aid in monitoring and measuring indicators to report on
project achievement and impacts. However, the a priori definition of focal areas, led to
difficulties in expanding project activities to the most promising product lines and as
opportunities to work with institutional partners and communities emerged. In order to do
so, the Grant Agreement was amended to redefine the scope of the focal areas. Instead of
selecting specific project intervention sites prior to implementation, agreed-upon site
selection criteria should be used to identify intervention areas during implementation.
This allows the project to adjust to changing circumstances on the ground, to take
advantage of unforeseen opportunities to expand project impact and achievements, and to
adequately respond to the demand-driven nature of subproject implementation to achieve
wide participation.

Additional sources of support

196. Trust funds and other assistance available through the World Bank can
complement project resources when ad hoc trainings, consultations, or assessments are
needed. This was the case for the MMBC: the Bank team applied for a US$350,000 grant
from the World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP) Global and Regional
Initiatives to implement a series of workshops and activities collectively titled
Strengthening Social Participation in the Regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor
(RMBC) in Guatemala, Panama and Southeast Mexico. The workshops contributed to
improving to the MMBC project by financing and fostering additional cooperation,



                                           70
learning opportunities, technical assistance and facilitating access to other sources of
technical and financial support.

Investments in regional development

197. The project’s success has lain in its ability to consolidate the work of technical
groups, NGOs and local producers who, over several decades, have demonstrated the
usefulness of agro-ecological activities and use this evidence to promote reorientation of
public investment. Through training and organization, development and conservation
can be harmonized if we learn from local groups’ experience and build bridges with
public officials.

Conservation based on community participation has great transaction costs, but is
more sustainable

198. In order to achieve community-based agreements for conservation in the
corridors, the MMBC worked with ejidos and communities (with the consent of their
assemblies). The process of designing, implementing, and enforcing a set of rules to
conserve public goods in the corridors is equivalent establishing a local collective good
in the community.111 In Chiapas, prolonged consultation processes ultimately led to a
greater buy-in and demand for subprojects and thus increased investments in the area.

Activities for strengthening social capital112 should be targeted to organizational
networks (NGOs, academia, research institutions, etc.)

199. Investments in strengthening institutional and local social capital (NGOs and
producers) contributed to the project’s monitoring network. Investing in institutional
partners also contributed to cost-sharing for the more intricate/extensive/expensive
monitoring activities: the project helped to establish long-term alliances with regional and
mid-level organizations that collaborated on monitoring responsibilities and activities.
These organizations will also contribute in future activities to develop regional markets
for MMBC sustainable products.

Building political buy-in and capital for a project

200. During preparation, the Bank team and management identified that Chiapas was a
high-risk, high-reward place to work (especially after the 1994 Zapatista social uprising).
With a new federal administration taking office on December 1, 2000, there was an
additional risk that political support for project activities would wane and undermine
goals to conduct extensive consultations in socially complicated areas of the country. At
the decision meeting113, the Bank team was advised to contact the incoming federal
administration in order to start building the necessary political buy-in and capital to

support project implementation and strengthen alliances with government institutions.
The fact that this was not achieved contributed to the slow implementation pace from
2000-2005.

Corridors are relevant for Adaptation to Climate Change:

201. During project preparation, the Central American isthmus suffered the brunt of
Hurricane Mitch (1998), the impact of which reached the Yucatan Peninsula. During
implementation, the project area was hit by two more hurricanes: Wilma (2005) on the
peninsula, and Stan (2006) in Chiapas. All three extreme events severely affected
producers in the Corridor areas, especially those involved in apiculture, coffee,
silviculture and tourism.

202. The extent of the hurricanes’ impacts demonstrated that the MMBC can provide
breakthroughs in the necessary crosscutting approaches to achieve relevant mitigation
goals, and it has provided yet more insights into the adaptation alternatives in the field.
Following the impact of Hurricane Stan (2006) in the coffee-producing region of
Motozintla, Chiapas (that had been supported by the MMBC), an assessment by GTZ,
Banchiapas and UNAM confirmed that the practices promoted by the MMBC project had
reduced the vulnerability of the region to such extreme climatic events.114

Project Level

New approaches to intersectoral work

203. The intersectoral nature of CONABIO made it possible for the MMBC to play a
role in facilitating the reorientation of public spending and as a mediator in the promotion
of municipal development plans. When dealing with challenges that require intersectoral
collaboration, the project design should involve public institutions which have an
intersectoral mandate in order to facilitate the cross sector efforts required by
environment, climate change and social issues.

Some projects might require more than one (independent) review as an opportunity
to promote required changes, and to support an Intensive Learning ICR

204. From September 2003 to April 2005, the project was rated Unsatisfactory. The
MTR that was carried out in January 2005 focused on the feasibility of achieving the
Global Environmental Objective. The MTR was instrumental in identifying key actions
to put the project back on track, but because there was no significant progress in
execution, it was not possible to produce a new indicator’s matrix to adjust to reality. A
partial cancellation and/or and extension of the project were considered at the time, but
the independent evaluation did not strongly recommend either course of action.

114
    In particular, four practices were highlighted for their contribution to reducing vulnerability: variety of crops (including native
species/varieties and traditional multiproduct plots); variety of spaces (corridors incorporating conservation and production areas in a
landscape management approach); hillside management (reducing vulnerability with integrated watershed management techniques);
and conversion to silvopastoral systems (improving yields and quality while restoring tropical forest areas that had been turned into
pastures).



                                                                  72
205. Notwithstanding, the Bank team should have taken advantage of the opportunity
to restructure the project at that time. When an opportunity to improve project design is
missed, the team should consider conducting an additional external evaluation to
realistically evaluate design or implementation flaws and inadequacies that can be
corrected. Though it may be bureaucratic, such changes can help realign project
objectives, indicators and activities to on-the-ground implementation realities and
significantly improve performance. It also allows project design to incorporate to-date
lessons learned. At project closure, an Intensive Learning ICR can also help to highlight
important lessons and experiences, particularly from project participants. For this ICR,
the team requested FAO/CP resources to embark in an Intensive Learning ICR (BP
13.55); however, they were not available. Instead, CONABIO offered to conduct some of
the recommended consultation-survey activities on their own, which rendered useful
information for this report.

                                      Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
Survey I. Evaluation of the Sustainable Rural Development Program CBMM-
CONABIO-SAGARPA in the region of Marqués de Comillas, Chiapas PDRS-MC

1.      Of the four participating states, Chiapas is the one with the highest potential for the
implementation of the corridor strategies. Within Chiapas where the Sierra Madre del Sur and
Selva Maya Zoque Corridors meet,the Marqués de Comillas municipality is key both for social
and ecological reasons.

2.       During preparation, the social situation in this area (adjacent to the Montes Azules
Biosphere Reserve and the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala, the largest rainforest reserves
in the northern hemisphere) required special provisions in the PAD115. During the
implementation, the Chajul Biological Research Station in Montes Azules became the meeting
point for training and knowledge sharing activities promoted by the MMBC. This area also
became the laboratory for collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of
Agriculture in order to concentrate efforts and resources and to develop demonstration areas for
the strategic lines of the MMBC.

3.      Since 2008, the Sustainable Rural Development Programme (PDRS-MC) has been
executed by the MMBC. The PDRS-MC seeks to integrate the conservation of natural resources,
especially tropical rainforests, with improved production and social development for local
populations. It is an initiative to give continuity to the efforts being made in Mexico and Chiapas
to achieve environmental, productive and social sustainable rural development. The PDRS-MC is
carried out in a coordinated manner by SAGARPA, MMBC, CONABIO, SEMARNAT and the
Chiapas state government.

4.       With funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID),
the Interdisciplinary Center for Biodiversity and Environment (CEIBA) carried out an evaluation
of the first implementation cycle of the PDRS-MC in September 2009. The study includes
interviews, a socioeconomic survey and workshops with ejidatarios, municipal and ejido
authorities, government officials and researchers.

5.      The importance of the Marqués de Comillas region as part of MMBC has to do with its
geographical role in connecting two important protected areas—Montes Azules Biosphere
Reserve and Selva Maya (Guatemala). In this region, increasing livestock and “slash and burn”
corn production is leading to deforestation with a loss of 40% to 50% of forest area. Despite the
depletion of these natural resources and capital, 85% of the population is in food poverty.116
According to the National Agrarian Registry (RAN) ejido participants in the project own 79,606
ha; but according to the ejidatarios it is 72.851 ha. Of this, 8% is designated for community use,
34% for corn production, and the rest for farmland, fallows and meadows.

6.   During FY2008, PDRS-MC implemented in Chiapas Corridors had a budget of
MXN$26,500,000 divided into three components: a) MXN$6,800,000to team of technicians; b)

    PAD, page 27: Considering the special conditions of the focal area La Cojolita (high level of social conflicts and land tenure
problems), the IPDP specifies that during the first year of project implementation there will be additional consultation activities
carried out in this focal area. The activities will involve participatory planning to adapt the global strategic lines of the IPDP to the
particular conditions of the area. The conclusion of these activities will be a condition for the application of investment resources in La
Cojolita.

    The National Council responsible for the evaluation of social policy in Mexico (Coneval) distinguishes three levels of poverty:
Nutritional (Income), Capacities, and Assets. See: http://www.coneval.gob.mx/contenido/med_pobreza/3967.pdf



                                                                   92
MXN$13,100,000 for sustainable use of natural resources for primary production (productive
restoration), and c) MXN$6, 600,000 for the acquisition of productive assets (equipment).

Results of the component of Sustainable Use of Natural Resources for the Primary
Production (Productive Reconversion)

8.     1802 Productive restoration subprojects were supported in 2,212 ha by 1802
beneficiaries in 29 communities from four municipalities including:

     •   173 to reorient the widespread agricultural and livestock activities that cause
         deterioration of forestcover in the area of Marqués de Comillas;

     •   920 for backyard improvement;

     •   420 for milpa settling;

     •   68 for acahuales enrichment, introduction of fodder trees and pasture land subdivision;

     •   205 for renovation of pastures and pastureland improvement and restoration of riverside.

Results of the Productive Assets component

9.     23 subprojects associated with productive chains were financed through the
productive assets component including:
   • 10 aquaculture;
   • 2 ecotourism;
   • 1 for housing livestock;
   • 5 Environmental Management Units of Wildlife (UMA);
   • 3 greenhouses;


                                                93
      •   1 organic agriculture.

10.       The beneficiaries included 285 people: 77 women and 208 men.
11.       Training

      •   59 community producers (26 women and 33 men) on technical skills, capacity
          building and use of tools;
      •   952 workshops in ejidos (117 men and 775 women) on environmental issues and
          natural resource management;
      •   55 young people (21 women and 32 men) participated in the youth network for
          the conservation and sustainable management;
      •   Centro-GEO (GIS, mapping and data collection service for the project) generated
          a GIS for the region. (See GIS website www.cbmm.gob.mx .)

12.       Progress of PDRS-MC as of 2008, and next steps

a) Sustainable productive restoration. The survey showed that 85% of the beneficiaries
of the PDRS-MC are not burning the brushwood in their fields. The geographical
baseline established by the PDRS-MC will be used to make comparisons to measure
restoration over time.

b) Encourage changes in attitude toward the sustainable use of biological resource
potential available to the region. 67 people (5.19%) are involved in the acahuales
enrichment, out of a total 1290 participants. The low percentage of participation is due to
the many limitations associated with timber, including the overexploitation of the
rainforest and the fact that there is a lack of forestry organizations to help land owners
better use their rainforest resources. As a result, the PDRS is increasing farmer awareness
on sustainable use of their natural resources in order to incorporate them into the timber
resource use scheme.

c) Provide tools to reorganize the management of the territory based on the status of
the environment, and the requirements for sustainable production and development
of infrastructure and services. This is an activity that has not been carried out yet and is
scheduled for the second stage which will generate useful land use tools and practices for
the ejidos and their inhabitants.

d) Promote productive chains to ensure livelihoods and ensure participation in
markets, especially those that recognize the environmental value of products.
The next step is to support producers in entering markets, establishing long-term business
relationships and meeting standards for quality and quantity that markets will demand.
Obstacles that these projects will have to overcome include: remoteness from major
markets, lack of entrepreneurial skills, lack of knowledge about the behavior of markets
and few organizational capabilities of the producers. To meet this goal, the next stage of
the PDRS-MC will require a focus on overcoming these obstacles and the integration of
(participation among) those businesses already developing under production chain
models.


                                            94
e) Orient public investment to support synergies between increased efficiency in
primary production activities (agriculture) and the containment of natural resource
degradation processes.
1802 subprojects were cofinanced by the landowners in order to improve natural resource
management. Design of subprojects for the restoration of riversides will need to
incorporate economic incentives so that they result in tangible benefits for landowners in
the medium term.

f) Increase the efficiency of local institutional management to strengthen the
municipalities, ejidos and economic organizations.
In the area where the PDRS-MC operates, ejidatarios have little experience organizing
economic groups. As a result, the MMBC team has provided continuous training to
strengthen human and social capital, and thus local institutional management
(municipalities and ejidos).

13.    80% of the beneficiaries reported in the survey that during 2008 they participated
more in MMBC meetings as opposed to meetings with other governmental programs.

Survey II. Evaluation of the Economic and Social Impact of Mexico Mesoamerican
Biological Corridor in the Peninsula and Chiapas

14.     In September 2009, the MMBC team used GEF resources to conduct a survey in
order to determine the impact of the project from 2005–2009, specifically focusing on the
subprojects granted to communities located in the focal areas of the five corridors.

15.     From a total of 215 subprojects117 (8 persons by subproject) 209 surveys were
conducted in 29 villages of the five corridors: 105 surveys in Chiapas in 13 communities
(both Selva Maya Zoque and Sierra Madre del Sur Corridors), and 104 surveys in 16
communities in the focal areas of the Yucatan Peninsula (Campeche, Yucatan and
Quintana Roo). The basic indicators chosen to measure the progress of the MMBC focus
on ecology, improvement in the quality of life and strengthening of local community
capacities.

16.          The summary of the findings are:

        •    Of the total beneficiaries of these projects, 34% are men and 66% women,
             indicating strong participation of women. Resources for the subprojects began to
             flow in 2007 and have a wide variety of subjects that are detailed in Annex III.
        •
             86% said they know what the MMBC does: “it promotes the conservation of
             natural resources.”

        •    96% said the support they have received has served to preserve the forest and/or
             rainforest.
117
      Includes MMBC subprojects and proyects coordinated with SAGARPA for Marqués de Comillas.



                                                              95
      •   40% of the surveyed population said that they receive the minimum wage, which
          at the most is MXN$51.95 per day; 14% receive up to two times the minimum
          wage; and only 25% earn more than that, while the remaining 21% includes
          housewives who participated in the project without pay or those who did not
          answer the question.

      •   90% of respondents said that both the production and marketing of their products
          have improved since the introduction of the corridor subprojects.

      •   90% said that since the MMBC began working in their community they have
          higher incomes, have improved their quality of life and have more training and
          communication with others working in similar activities.

17.       Quotes from government officials and external technicians

      •   SAGARPA: “Commitment was made from producers”.

      •   SEMARNAT: “Community self-management and coordination with federal and
          state agencies has been strengthened”.

      •   CONANP: “From a perspective of conservation and development, the MMBC is
          one of the best programs. While the NPAs are representative; they have an island
          effect for genetic viability, so this project is essential as a tool for development”.

      •   CONAFOR: “The project has had a positive effect because it helps people's
          awareness, especially in waste management.”118

      •   SEMARNAT: “It [the MMBC project] has become provided important
          groundwork and documentation support, allowing different government
          institutions and NGOs to be connected to important resources made available
          through workshops and studies”.

18.       Quintana Roo

      •   Executive Director of Consorcio Chiclero, of Quintana Roo “The Corridor is a
          tool that enhances organizational initiatives and economic aspects of community
          forestry. Its contribution is not only financial, but it is an element that connects
          the regional level and the social alliance of forest communities on a common
          principle: sustainable management and forest economics”.

      •   National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples. “The actions of
          the Corridor and the benefits it has brought are more visible, particularly for

    Although waste management is not usually considered in agroecology approaches, the MMBC and the CONAFOR recognized the
relevance of reducing waste, reusing and disposing appropriately in the integrated management of watersheds. This also was
considered relevant by communities and governments in the Yucatan Peninsula.

Information analysis

Impact of MMBC resources

19.     MMBC activities have included two phases of intervention. During the initial
stage of preparation, efforts where focused on carrying out studies and consultancies. The
second stage was characterized by subproject implementation, which consolidated
Corridor work in the reorientation of public program investments into a new
conservation, restoration and management of biodiversity model.

20.     Socioeconomically, MMBC impacts are supporting production processes and
products to enter alternative market channels and markets for environmental services.
Those markets that are targeted take into consideration environmental sustainability,
gender equity and the value of cultural origin of the products that the communities offer.
Progress made along these lines in tourism services, cacao products, coffee, honey, gum,
pepper, copal, vegetables and handicraft production demonstrate the Corridor’s relevance
and its potential for even greater achievements in its next stage of implementation

21.     Another outstanding aspect that the survey reveals is the strengthening of social
capital including: strengthening the capacity of design, management, evaluation and
monitoring of productive projects, mediation and resolution of land conflicts (especially
in Chiapas and particularly in the Lacandona community), and the consolidation of
producer networks.

     Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

El Prestatario considera que el proyecto del Corredor Biológico Mesoamericano
México (CBMM) fue la plataforma desde la cual es posible hablar actualmente en
México de una política nacional de corredores biológicos. El proyecto cimentó esta
política. Es por ello que el resultado global es altamente exitoso.

Se reconoce que durante la primera etapa el proyecto tuvo un arranque difícil, debido
a errores de diseño, por ser un concepto nuevo y por inexperiencia. Con el refuerzo
de la Coordinación y del equipo técnico en una segunda etapa, el Corredor cumplió
con la totalidad de los objetivos y metas planteadas en el proyecto, como fue
monitoreado de acuerdo a los indicadores establecidos tanto en las enmiendas al
convenio de donación como en los acuerdos con el Banco Mundial formalizados en las
ayudas memoria.

El Prestatario está satisfecho con el proyecto ya que, además de la experiencia que
se forjó en el camino, ha innovado en mecanismos que promueven la conservación
del entorno natural en zonas críticas de biodiversidad a la par de brindar a la
población local alternativas importantes de desarrollo económico.

Actualmente, el concepto de corredor biológico es mejor comprendido en un país en
el que hace 10 años no existía un mecanismo transversal de esta naturaleza. El
donativo GEF desarrolló la base con la cual se seguirá trabajando en corredores
biológicos en México durante muchos años. Es un proyecto que logró instaurarse en
el país y es parte ahora de la agenda ambiental a nivel nacional.

A continuación se describe lo que el proyecto ha realizado a nivel nacional y la
importancia que tiene en la actualidad.

Casi diez años de actividades en uno de los proyectos ambientales más novedosos e
importantes del continente, por su pertinencia, integralidad regional y por conciliar la
conservación de la biodiversidad con su uso y manejo sustentable,                es un
acontecimiento del que México debe estar satisfecho: El Corredor Biológico
Mesoamericano México ha trabajado junto con siete países centroamericanos,
para unir ecosistemas naturales en un esfuerzo por preservar el 10 por ciento de
las especies de plantas y animales conocidas, y propiciar, al mismo tiempo, mejores
oportunidades y calidad de vida para los legítimos dueños de esos espacios del
sureste de México.

El trabajo se ha enfocado en favorecer la conectividad entre zonas conservadas -
mediante esquemas federales, estatales, municipales y privados- y las zonas en las
que los recursos naturales son manejados y usados, principalmente por población
rural e indígena que habita en cientos de localidades alrededor de esas áreas
protegidas.

El mecanismo fue con una apuesta diferente a las aplicadas hasta hace un decenio
en el país: contribuir a la conservación de la biodiversidad a través del
aprovechamiento sustentable de los recursos naturales en el trópico húmedo
mexicano.



                                           99
A esta distancia del camino se puede afirmar que dicha apuesta se logró con buenos
resultados. Con su estrategia, el Corredor ha brindado acompañamiento técnico,
capacitación y financiamiento a organizaciones en más de 600 comunidades rurales
e indígenas asentadas en Campeche, Chiapas, Quintana Roo y Yucatán, con la
finalidad de favorecer su desarrollo económico a través del uso sustentable de su
entorno.

Esto ha permitido a miles de productores cafetaleros, apícolas, forestales, chicleros,
ganaderos, agrícolas y otros utilizar, por ejemplo, abonos orgánicos, bancos
vegetales de proteínas, cercas vivas, estufas ahorradoras de leña, manuales de
observación de aves y en general producir conservando, lo cual los ha llevado, entre
otras cosas, a obtener certificados y sellos orgánicos y por lo mismo a ampliar las
posibilidades de comercialización de sus productos, o promover servicios turísticos
“amigables” con el entorno.

El aprendizaje ha sido en ambos sentidos: durante el acompañamiento técnico y a
través del desarrollo de planes participativos y estudios diversos, se han podido
conocer las formas tradicionales en las que las organizaciones rurales e indígenas
aprovechan conservando, como en el caso de los chicleros, con lo cual se han
desarrollado modelos de aprovechamiento sustentable que incluyen estas formas
tradicionales y que pueden ser replicados en otras zonas.

El CBMM ha podido ir mejorando poco a poco sus propuestas, incorporando
experiencias, aprendiendo de los errores cometidos en el camino y adaptando su
trabajo a las necesidades detectadas en su zona de acción.

En todo este proceso, la conectividad biológica se ha visto favorecida con un
impacto importante a favor de la biodiversidad en el territorio del trópico húmedo
mexicano, y se han creado redes de monitoreo que permiten un avance en el
conocimiento del entorno, lo que ha permitido a otras instituciones conocer la
problemática local y de esta manera reorientar sus políticas públicas hacia criterios
ambientales.

Los corredores biológicos han mostrado ser herramientas útiles de manejo durable
del territorio para la conservación de la biodiversidad en México, y sobre todo, que
es posible conciliar el cuidado de la naturaleza con un beneficio económico sensato y
sustentable para sus pobladores.

El trabajo desarrollado muestra que los conectores biológicos, aunque no sean
estrictamente una extensión del hábitat natural de las especies y exista en ellos
población humana, permiten la supervivencia de ecosistemas de valor mundial y de
especies bandera, como el caso de jaguar. Se ha mostrado que los corredores
funcionan como espacios para la transmisión de material genético de un lugar a
otro.

Se ha concluido la etapa en la que el proyecto operó con financiamiento del GEF-
Banco Mundial y se inicia ahora una nueva etapa en la que los logros alcanzados y
las lecciones que han derivado de todo el proceso permiten vislumbrar la
continuidad de las acciones, mediante una política nacional de corredores biológicos,


                                         100
con el ánimo de seguir contribuyendo a los objetivos plantedos desde el año 2000.

El Gobierno Federal otorga a esta región una atención prioritaria, en el marco de
las acciones de cooperación Sur-Sur, del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo, y en
congruencia con el esfuerzo por hacer frente a los retos que impone una economía
mundial cada día más globalizada.

Ante la crisis económica que vive el mundo, las zonas rurales se perfilan como
verdaderas oportunidades para el desarrollo, en las cuales se pueden impulsar
proyectos de perspectiva ambiental. Es ahí donde se insertan las actividades de los
corredores biológicos y donde una política nacional encaminada en este sentido
encontrará un terreno fértil para ayudar a sostener políticas anticíclicas, que apoyen
sustantivamente a los pobladores de las zonas vulnerables con acciones concretas
para mejorar su economía.

Los corredores biológicos son sobre todo espacios territoriales de consenso y
armonización de políticas públicas, en los que pueden converger estrategias,
programas e instrumentos de política pública social, económica y ambiental, y que
consolidan una verdadera transversalidad.

Los retos de estabilizar la cobertura de los ecosistemas remanentes, incluso aumentando
su superficie, restaurar las áreas críticas deterioradas y reconvertir las prácticas
productivas hacia el manejo sustentable, deben enfrentarse con instrumentos de política
ambiental que incentiven estas actividades para que representen una alternativa
económica viable para la población y se puedan multiplicar en otras regiones del país.

Desde su creación, el Corredor ha desarrollado y puesto en marcha una serie de
modelos en busca de una mejor conectividad en los ecosistemas del trópico húmedo
mexicano, que permitan conservar el entorno natural y a la vez coadyuvar a una
mejora en la calidad de vida de la población local.

Estos modelos han sido probados y rediseñados con base en los resultados y
probados nuevamente con el fin de tener las mejores herramientas para el logro de
objetivos. A esta distancia del camino, se puede afirmar que muchos de estos
modelos son replicables en otras regiones del país, lo cual puede llevar a un
mejorado manejo durable del territorio. Ello, con el fin de crear corredores biológicos
entre fragmentos conservados, como espacios en los cuales la conservación de la
biodiversidad será una alternativa para el desarrollo sustentable y el bienestar
social.

El camino por recorrer aún es vasto, pero se puede afirmar con toda certeza que
los modelos que ha desarrollado el CBMM en apenas dos lustros abren la puerta
para replicar esta experiencia con muchas posibilidades de éxito en otros espacios
del país y que por ello es necesario ampliar esta experiencia como una auténtica
política de índole nacional. de los productores campesinos

Existen seis indicadores básicos en los que se puede vislumbrar el trabajo realizado
por el Corredor, algunos de ellos previstos en el PAD y otros alcanzados
adicionalmente. A continuación se enumeran:




                                          101
a)     Mejoramiento de la conectividad

La conectividad se ha fomentado mediante acciones que promueven la
estabilización de la cobertura de ecosistemas remanentes (mecanismos de
conservación diversos como ordenamientos, reservas comunitarias,          etc.),
promoviendo el manejo sustentable en áreas pobladas y restaurando áreas críticas
deterioradas.

En este sentido, se ha puesto mucho énfasis en la planeación participativa. Ejemplo
de ello han sido los trabajos relacionados al ordenamiento territorial en Península de
Yucatán: a) Propuesta e implementación de planes piloto de buen manejo apícola,
vinculados a una propuesta de ordenamiento apícola y monitoreo de la calidad de
miel en las áreas focales del CBMM en el estado de Quintana Roo y sus áreas de
influencia; b) Convenio (Con Cinvestav) para la realización del «Programa de
Ordenamiento Ecológico del Territorio del Estado de Yucatán. Etapa 3 de las Fases de
Caracterización y Diagnóstico»; c) Ordenamiento ecológico territorial e identificación
de proyectos prioritarios de manejo sustentable en las comunidades de X-Hazil y
Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo; y d) Creación de bases para el ordenamiento
ecológico regional participativo y fortalecimiento de líneas de acción detonante en el
área focal de La Montaña, Campeche.

También la formulación de cuatro planes municipales participativos en Chiapas:
Coapilla, Solosuchiapa, Escuintla y Siltepec, para la integración de criterios de
conservación de la biodiversidad.

El CBMM plantea como uno de los indicadores clave de conectividad y sustentabilidad
ambiental el estado de las poblaciones de especies indicadoras específicas. Para el
mantenimiento de la conectividad del paisaje, las especies indicadoras recomendadas
son aquellas que muestran una mayor sensibilidad a la fragmentación de su hábitat:
vertebrados de gran tamaño corporal, amplios requerimientos de espacio y
densidades poblacionales bajas. Para la biota mesoamericana, las especies que
mejor representan este conjunto de características pertenecen al grupo de los
mamíferos.

Por ello, se realizaron varios trabajos de monitoreo de este grupo biológico en el
área de trabajo del CBMM, sobre todo en el estado de Chiapas, que ponen en
evidencia el papel del Corredor en términos de mantenimiento de la biodiversidad por
medio de la presencia, aún esporádica, de la mastofauna, así como para asociar
y empoderar a la población local en el monitoreo de algunas especies claves de
mamíferos como indicadores del bienestar del ecosistema.

Se diseñaron sistemas de monitoreo adoptando una visión sistémica a diferentes
escalas en el tiempo y en el espacio, en algunos casos con trampeo fotográfico, y
se capacitó a la población local en el sistema de monitoreo sobre las actividades
susceptibles de afectar la calidad del medio, en particular de los suelos.

Los resultados del muestreo de mamíferos mayores constituyen una línea base, de
manera que la información recabada en muestreos futuros permita detectar cambios
en el sistema e identificar acciones pertinentes para mitigarlos o facilitarlos. Es una
evidencia más de que los corredores biológicos favorecen la supervivencia de especies


                                         102
emblemáticas.

De manera paralela, se efectúan una serie de acciones para capacitar a
organizaciones y comunidades locales en la observación y monitoreo de aves, sobre
todo en espacios en los que se promueve el ecoturismo, que además de representar un
ingreso adicional para estos centros, se convierte en una actividad de monitoreo de la
conectividad de ecosistemas locales.

b)     Impacto en reversión de la tasa de deforestación.

La cobertura forestal es el primer factor asociado a la condición de un hábitat natural.
La deforestación no sólo causa detrimento de la biodiversidad, sino que afecta la
calidad de los recursos hídricos, incrementa la erosión de suelos, aumenta los riesgos
de inundaciones y actúa en detrimento de los servicios ambientales.

Por ello, uno de los enfoques principales del trabajo del CBMM es precisamente el de
evitar la pérdida de la cobertura forestal en las áreas de conectividad, mediante
estrategias diversas.

La acción central en este tenor ha sido la promoción de actividades rurales distintas
a la agricultura como alternativa de desarrollo económico local, que incluyen
principalmente a la apicultura, el ecoturismo y el cultivo de café de sombra,
atenuando con ello la presión sobre los recursos forestales y fortaleciendo los
incentivos para su conservación.

Esta serie de herramientas, sumadas a la elaboración de la Guía de Campo de
Buenas Prácticas Forestales y una serie de criterios y tipologías de productores,
han permitido orientar la gestión de los apoyos del CBMM en regiones forestales y
evitar que éstos tuvieran resultados negativos.

Esto ha ayudado a garantizar que los apoyos realmente se traduzcan en impactos
positivos y contribuyan a la sustentabilidad. Además ha permitido inducir cambios o
robustecer a las propias organizaciones sociales así como a las políticas públicas que
afectan al sector forestal para orientarlo hacia la sustentabilidad.

Las evidencias del impacto de estas acciones se han ido manifestando en diversas
localidades en las que la preservación de la cobertura forestal se ha convertido en
una actividad cotidiana de la mano con el desarrollo de actividades económicas
alternativas.

c)      Impacto en acciones de adaptación al Cambio Climático

Con el generalizado aumento de las temperaturas y las alteraciones en los ciclos de
lluvias, aún con reservas naturales, los territorios fragmentados no permitirán a las
especies movilizarse hacia lugares con condiciones climáticas más parecidas a las de
sus hábitats naturales y muchas de ellas, que se enfrentan ya a otros problemas por la
afectación humana de sus hábitats, no podrán adaptarse, provocando la pérdida hacia
el final del siglo de numerosas especies. Tanto plantas como animales contribuyen al




                                          103
funcionamiento de los ecosistemas que proveen al hombre con diversos servicios
ambientales, y su pérdida provocará al mismo tiempo un colapso de estos ecosistemas.

Es mediante los corredores biológicos que las especies contarán con esos pasajes
para moverse de un lugar a otro y encontrar zonas con condiciones climáticas
similares a las de sus hábitats originales. Hará el espacio territorial mucho más
permeable a las migraciones de especies y facilitará su adaptación a las nuevas
condiciones inducidas por el cambio climático.

El CBMM participa en el Programa Especial de Cambio Climático (PECC) para ampliar
e interconectar los remanentes de vegetación natural, incluyendo aquellos en Áreas
Naturales Protegidas (ANP), para mejorar sus posibilidades de adaptación al cambio
climático y de desplazamiento de especies y zonas ecológicas.

Las metas específicas acordadas formalmente con Sagarpa en el primer convenio que
compromete a la Secretaría encargada del desarrollo rural con la conservación de la
biodiversidad y que desarrolla actualmente el CBMM se orientan a destinar 25,000
hectáreas anuales, que actualmente se dedican a la producción primaria, al manejo
sustentable, y a reducir el fuego como práctica agropecuaria en al menos el 30 por
ciento de la superficie atendida al 2012.

Asimismo participa en el esfuerzo Semarnat-Conafor-INE-Conabio para que el
20% de la superficie reforestada a 2012 (es decir, 80 mil de las 400 mil
hectáreas a reforestar), interconecte remanentes de vegetación natural en zonas
de prioridad identificadas por las autoridades ambientales.

El trabajo en materia de adaptación al cambio climático es una de las principales
aportaciones del CBMM al país, que permitirá hacer frente de una mejor manera a los
retos que comienzan ya a vislumbrarse de este fenómeno causado por el hombre.

d)     Impacto en reorientación de las políticas públicas

Uno de los impactos principales del trabajo del CBMM ha sido sin duda lograr que muchos
de los lineamientos y requisitos de los programas públicos de inversión federal en
trópico húmedo mexicano incluyan criterios ambientales.

Este ha sido un paso decisivo en un país en el que ciertos proyectos de corte
conservacionista se contravenían con los principios de otros programas públicos de
índole económica, provocando una dualidad de criterios que terminaban por afectar
seriamente a la biodiversidad en los ecosistemas más importantes del sureste.

Adicionalmente, el Corredor ha logrado que otras instituciones que normalmente no
invertían o invertían poco en acciones ambientales orienten su gasto hacia proyectos
de sustentabilidad ambiental.

El trabajo se ha llevado de la mano con instituciones como Sagarpa, el Instituto Nacional de
las Mujeres (Inmujeres), la Comisión para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas
(CDI), Sedesol, Conafor, etc.




                                            104
e)     Mejoramiento en el nivel de vida de la población local

Muchas comunidades han mejorado sus ingresos directos a través de la realización de
actividades alternativas a las tradicionales como la apicultura, cultivo de hortalizas
orgánicas, artesanías diversas, café de sombra, ecoturismo, etc., todas ellas con
valor agregado al ser producidas en condiciones de sustentabilidad, y que en
muchísimos casos cuentan ya con certificación nacional e internacional, lo cual les ha
permitido insertar sus productos en mercados internacionales.

Se han realizado trabajos que han permitido a diversas localidades acceder a
estufas ahorradoras de leña, capacitación sobre disposición de residuos sólidos,
mejoras a la infraestructura y equipo en lugares de trabajo, etc., que han
permitido a la población local mejorar sus condiciones de vivienda y trabajo, y por
consiguiente de salud.

Otro aporte esencial ha sido el de la reinserción de localidades en extrema pobreza a
la dinámica económica de su municipio, a través de la participación de sus productos
de valor agregado en las economías locales, nacionales e internacionales a precios
más justos; su capacidad de participar en procesos de planeación municipal; y la
posibilidad de tener capacitación regular para organizarse legalmente y
producir sustentablemente.

Todo esto nos habla de comunidades que se insertan mejor en las economías
locales, con mejores herramientas para tomar decisiones comunitarias y con
productos mucho más competitivos, es decir, con mayor bienestar.

f)     Fortalecimiento de capacidades de las comunidades locales

El mejoramiento de vida de los pobladores de las comunidades en las que trabaja el
CBMM va de la mano con el fortalecimiento de las capacidades locales.

Este ha sido uno de los principales esfuerzos realizados por el Corredor desde su
creación bajo el principio de que a mejores capacidades, las organizaciones
comunitarias podrán insertarse mejor a la lógica del mercado y mejorar de
manera consecuente sus productos e ingresos.

El objetivo fundamental es que a los productores les llegue dinero directo para
invertir en rubros que no son objeto de crédito o financiamiento en otras instituciones,
como para la adquisición de activos productivos en cafeticultura, apicultura,
establecimiento de UMA, producción de hortalizas orgánicas en invernadero,
reconversión productiva, etc; o financiamiento en proyectos que deben justificar que existe
una contraparte, o para que otras instituciones que no financiaban planes de este tipo
reorienten sus inversiones hacia proyectos productivos sustentables.

Esta meta se ha alcanzado mediante la realización de innumerables talleres y eventos,
acompañamiento técnico así como mediante la provisión directa de recursos para el
mejoramiento de infraestructura y equipo en proyectos turísticos y productivos
promovidos directamente por las comunidades.

Como resultado, numerosas organizaciones locales se han constituido legalmente y sus
productos son reconocidos ya a nivel nacional e internacional.

   Annex 10. Original Description of Project Sites – Corridors and Focal Areas

1.      The MMBC project promoted conservation of natural resources and biodiversity
in 5 corridors and 16 focal areas.

The Corridors

                                       Box 1: Terminology used

Corridor: a mosaic of land patches under various land-uses situated in between protected areas. Corridors
generate global biodiversity benefits through three main mechanisms: (i) by serving as habitats with various
degrees of importance for specific types of biodiversity; (ii) by allowing the flow of genes, individuals, and
species among protected areas; and (iii) by maintaining ecological processes over large landscapes. Corridors
are mainly identified on the basis of type, quality and quantity of vegetation cover or other ecological criteria.
Corridors are the project’s broad planning tool; however, in recognition of their large territorial extension, and
of the variable degree of ecological and biological integrity within them, priority or focal areas have been
identified for the purposes of project design and implementation.

The two focal zones, Xpujil–Zohlaguna (focal zone 1) and Montaña (focal zone 2), are the contact point with
the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, which is part of the forest stand of the Sian Ka’an–Calakmul Corridor.
Primary production predominates in both focal areas and is greatly determined by the area’s relationship with
the forest and the use of its biodiversity. Even though both focal areas are located in the same zone, they
represent different realities: focal area 1, with its 31 ejidos and a population of 10,464, is an area characterized
by recent immigration (of mestizos resettled from different parts of the country); focal area 2, with its seven
ejidos and a population of 2,613, is predominantly an indigenous Maya area. In both focal areas, the ejido is
the central system for land tenure and for natural resource management. There are two types of ejidos that
predominate in the region: (i) forestry ejidos with large extensions of which 12 ejidos (of the 38 total) cover
80% of the forest stand; (ii) twenty-six ejidos with less than 5,000 ha each, which are mostly used for
agriculture and livestock activities. Between the two focal areas, the farmers have formally assigned
approximately 215,000 has for common use for forest-based activities; taken together, the ejido extensions
(both forest-based and agricultural use) help to maintain a large forest stand since the individual agricultural
plots assigned to each farmer continue to an important extent under forest cover.

Although forests cover large areas of the Sian Ka’an-Calakmul Corridor, forest-based activities alone do not
allow ejidatarios to earn an income above the minimum wage due to the lack of organization in the production
(leading to overuse) and marketing of timber. In reality, the income provided by beekeeping and honey
production is currently the most stable monetary income in both focal areas. Possibilities exist for timber and
non timber forest products, as well as for the sustainable use of fauna, honey, archeological and natural areas
ecotourism and other environmental services. In general, the region produces primary materials that are
processed in other parts of the country or abroad. State and federal institutions, along with NGOs, have
invested programs in this region with goals to improve the use of natural resources for local processing and
production and to promote reforestation. However, there has not been sufficient alignment of policies from the
various levels of government to ensure long-term success of such initiatives.

The Chiapas corridors have distinct geographic characteristics: one of them runs the length of the Sierra Madre
del Sur with degraded forests and a population that is primarily mestizo. The other is located in the Selva Maya
Zoque with a much more diverse and less degraded swath of highland and lowland forests and farmlands. This
second corridor is also more socially complex: approximately three-quarters of the landowners are either
Mayan or Zoque (indigenous groups), and politically the communities are more divided. It is important to note
that in Mexico indigenous communities frequently use a semi-collective, or “social,” land tenure structure
(either in the form of “communal lands” or “ejidos”). In the Selva Maya Zoque Corridor, there are small rural
landholders (having less than 10 hectares), both indigenous and mestizo, who may form associations to create
similar semi-collective forms of natural resource management. In the Sierra Madre del Sur Corridor, large
private landholdings also coexist with abovementioned forms of social land tenure. Population growth in
general is approximately 4.5% annually and in the area of Ixcan it may be as much as double that.
Economically, Chiapas is classified among the four Mexican states suffering extreme poverty. The rural
poor—and virtually the entire population of the corridors—are “milperos,” a few sell corn and beans although
much of the population is (nearly) self-sufficient in at least the staple food of corn. The traditional slash-and-
burn production system still prevails in this region. Forest lands and non-timber forest products (e.g., fauna,
mushrooms, edible and medicinal plants) are declining due to deforestation that results from various causes,
from commercial harvesting to little investment in sustainable forest management practices. Despite such
strong deforestation pressures, rural populations—especially the original indigenous areas—still retain
specialized knowledge of local flora and fauna representing an opportunity to develop sustainable use
alternatives.
In general, one observes processes of forest degradation in the corridor regions with wood-gathering occupying
more woman-hours and hunting sharply declining in importance; increased erosion and the impoverishment of
soils with declining production, income, and consumption levels; increasing water pollution and health
problems. Development policies and programs targeting the marginalized poor have tended to change
constantly. For example, the opening of national forest lands to farmers without lands and the promotion of
extensive cattle ranching have escalated deforestation in these regions. Coffee production, a relatively benign
product environmentally-speaking, now faces strong fluctuations in price. Rural migration has increased, with
most heading to cities and to the United States. Even with the above scenarios, the majority of the actors
involved in the processes above clearly perceive the environmental degradation problems that are quickly
worsening and those steps needed to counter it: (i) a greater importance on sustainable use and production
systems; (ii) application of specialized indigenous cultural knowledge; and (iii) strengthening of social
organizational capacity.

The Sian Ka’an-Calakmul Corridor is a critical area connecting the northern and southern blocks of the
Calakmul Biosphere Reserve as well as the Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve. In this area, there have been strong
changes in forest cover. Currently, there are four settlements with considerable forest cover to form two
connectors: one on the west side of the Reserve and another on the east side. The area between the two
connectors has suffered severe deforestation. Among the causes of deforestation are: (i) chili cultivation, for
which farmers cut and burn the highland forests; (ii) indiscriminate use of insecticides, which has affected
apiculture; and (iii) excessive extraction of wood from large forested areas, leading to the creation of forest
fragments. Contributing to exacerbation of these trends includes: (i) the existing pattern of colonization of
small ejidos; (ii) government programs that favor the production of chili and the use of insecticides; and (iii)
the lack of policies that could help guide sustainable soil use by considering ecological principles. Challenges
that lay ahead in order to combat these trends and causes: (i) small forest areas are not an attractive economic
alternative; (ii) impoverished forests (from which timber has been excessively extracted) are no longer
attractive for conservation; and (iii) the internal organization of the ejido is not adequate to manage the forest
effectively while also complying with market requirements and demands.

Among the possible actions that favor sustainability and conservation are the diversification and intensification
of production systems in order to reduce pressures on forests. Such opportunities are found in agroforestry and
sustainable agricultural practices. Large ejidos with important forest resources have applicable forest
management experience as well as experience in management of fauna. There are also archealogical sites with
great potential which could contribute to tourism as an additional source of income. However, the reorientation
of government policies is still important, especially regarding: (i) the production of chili, particularly when it
comes to the property rights of ejidos; (ii) the adaptation to local circumstances of programs targeting milpa
production; and (iii) activities that directly foster environmental protection.

Even with the challenges described above, the natural resources of Quintana Roo—in its forested areas, in its
aquatic ecosystems, as well as in its agricultural areas—are still in a state where biological diversity can be
conserved and recovered to ensure the survival and continuity of important species. Nevertheless, future
planning and use of natural resources require serious consideration of the impacts of productive activities on
biodiversity conservation. This in turn implies the need to involve all social actors who are in a position to
make decisions about the use of natural resources, especially governmental agencies. The sample of ejidos
studied indicates that their land has been demarcated and there are no internal conflicts. In the traditional
Mayan communities, there is a strong tendency to maintain the collective use of land, while the immigrant
communities favor division of ejido lands into individual parcels. The older ejidos have an average of 500 has
of land per family, in contrast to ejidos formed in the 1980s which average 40 to 50 has per family. There are
also landless people in immigrant communities, often known as pobladores and repobladores and who usually
work as laborers on the farms of the larger landholders. There are great opportunities for biodiversity
conservation and sustainable use of natural resources in the area of the Sian Ka’an-Calakmul Corridor.

The northern coast of Yucatan is a socially, economically and ecologically complex region. It has a population
of approximately 60,000 people, who make use of the multiple coastal ecosystems. The diversity of local users
live in the coastal areas permanently, seasonally or otherwise irregularly providing a mix of common and
contradictory resource use interests; they utilize resources and ecosystems differently, based on schemes of
responsibilities and rights acquired by tradition and formal right. The Yucatan coast is currently, and will
continue to be, an essential region for the state’s economy, mainly for the implementation of future plans and
programs such as eco-tourism and traditional tourism. Currently, the greatest and most important source of
income for the majority of these coastal populations comes from fishing in rivers and the use of marine
resources, marshes, lagoons, and other reservoirs (e.g., shrimp, crustaceans, mollusks and some fish). The
population of the northern coast of Yucatan is primarily mestizo. In the coastal ports, new sociocultural
dimensions emerge, since part of the population is composed of farmers who immigrated after the 70s and who
practice agrarian traditions mixed with a fisheries culture with specific patterns of space appropriation
mediated by the technology of the last three decades (e.g., outboard motors on ships, synthetic materials for
fishing, compasses, telescopes, etc.). One of the principal challenges here is to slow fishing in rivers, to
promote offshore fishing and to implement and strengthen legislation for the fishing sector. Reorganizing the
fishing sector and implementing programs for natural protected areas is one of the most difficult challenges for
conservation and protection of coastal natural resources and ecosystems.




The Focal Areas

Box 2- Terminology used

Focal Area: is the area in which actual project activities are targeted, and where progress and impact
indicators will be monitored. The basic building blocks of a focal area are land tenure units (ejidos,
communities, private properties); therefore, the boundaries of a focal area results from the boundaries of the
land tenure units constituting it.

Transition Area: areas situated inside a corridor, which are adjacent to focal areas, or encompass them. Even
though transition areas will not be the target of specific investments, it is expected that some of the project
activities, such as planning at the corridor level or investment for sustainable use at the focal area level, will
generate ecological benefits spilling over to transition areas. The project will furthermore support
mainstreaming of biodiversity concerns into rural development programs undertaken in the biological
corridors, through improved program design and execution. By replication and extension to other locations in
Mexico and elsewhere, the project can generate benefits well beyond the focal areas targeted by the project.

2.      It was decided to concentrate project efforts on smaller—“focal”—areas within the broad
areas of the corridors. The focal areas were selected based on the opportunities and immediate
needs of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The selection process also took into
account aspects of social organization and information available. For example, in terrestrial
corridors, the areas selected have important forest vegetation cover, which presents an
opportunity to maintain and restore connectivity between NPAs.

3.      The various studies conducted during project design highlighted the biodiversity threats
and opportunities in each of the focal areas and root causes. In all of the corridors it was apparent
that there are multiple threats to biodiversity. However, the relative importance of each threat
varied from one corridor to another. The global calculation that was carried out indicated that
training in the three levels of government (municipal, state, national), particularly institutional
coordination at the regional level, is vital for biodiversity conservation.

4.      The MMBC covers a total of approximately 6.8 million hectares of land and 448,798
hectares of sea surface, equaling 25% of Campeche, 37% of Chiapas, 31% of Quintana Roo and
26% of Yucatan and connecting the habitats of 23 protected areas (2.86 million hectares).
