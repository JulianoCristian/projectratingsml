TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Project Summary
Borrower:            The Republic of Togo
Amount:              US$2.2 million
Terms:               Standard IDA
Project              The proposed project would finance two advisers in the
Description:        Ministry of Planning for a three-year period each (72 man-
months at an estimated cost of US$9,400 per man-month
including contingencies, travel, housing and other al-
lowances): a senior economist who would advise the
Minister on general economic and public finance questions
and help prepare the Fourth Plan (1981-85) and a senior
project adviser, who would advise the Minister on the
composition of major new investments and ways of improving
the economic and financial viability of existing large
projects. In addition, the project would provide for
short-term consultants (up to a total of 130 man-months at.
an estimated cost of US$10,000 per man-month including
t:ravel, housing and other allowances) to carry7 out specific
project-related and macroeconomic studies; two junior
Togolese economists attached to the senior advisers,
support staff, office equipment and supplies.
Benefits would accrue to Togo over the long-tenr as the
advice provided under the project helps to promote sounder
investment and public finance policies.  This technical
assistance wouild be particularly timely over the next
three years, as the Governmlent has recently introduced an
austerity program covering the allocation of domestic
resources and a restructuring of external comnit:ments.
TI'he project would remain risky, even assuming that highly
qualified and adaptable personnel can be found, due to the
very nature ol- an advisory project.  The Government is
keenly aware of the needs the project is desi:.gned to help
meet.  The strong appeal Tnade to the Association for help
i.s an iidication of t:he Government's commitmenlt to i:he
project at the highest level.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Togo for the equivalent of US$2.2
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a technical assistance project
in Togo.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       The most recent economic report on Togo, Report No. 458a-TO "Current
Economic Situation and Prospects of Togo" was issued on December 30, 1974.
An economic mission visited Togo in December, 1978 and its findinigs are
incorporated below and in Annex I which contains basic country data.
Economic Performance
3.       Over the 1972-78 period, the macroeconomic aggregates present a
picture of good growth, high investment, and rising debt. Real growth in
1972-78 is estimated at 5 percent per annum. Beginning in 1975, phosphate
profits were channeled into public investment, with gross domestic investment
averaging a high 31 percent of GDP over 1975-77, up from 20 percent in the
early 1970s, Rising public investment was therefore partially financed
by borrowing, which raised the debt service ratio from 6 percent in 1972
to 17 percent in 1978. Higher imports of capital and consumer goods have been
reflected in a widening resource gap, estimated at 27 percent of GDP in 1978.
The per capita GDP is estimated at US$300 in 1977 for a population of 2.35
million growing at a rate of 2.7 percent annually.
4.       Phosphate exports have provided the major stimulus to recent economic
growth in Togo, following the quadrupling of the world market price in early
1974 and the nationalization of the mines in the saiue year. Since then,
prices have stabilized at around $30 per ton, and this price combined with
increased output raised average phosphate revenues during 1974-77 to US$93
million per year or about 16 percent of GDP.  In 1977 phosphate sales amounted
to abotiL 40 percent of the country's merchandise exports.  The increased
phosphate revenues have provided substantial new public iacome, shaped the
Togolese balance of payments and public finance picture over the past four
years, and broadly influenced Government's investment plans and expect.ations.
5.       Despite these developments agriculture remains the largest sector in
the economy employing 75 percent of the working population and accounting for



- 2 -
23 percent of GDP. It is mainly made up of small farmers growing a combina-
tion of foodcrops for subsistence and cotton, cocoa, coffee, or groundnuts
for sale.  Rainfall is considerably less than in the Ivory Coast or Nigeria,
limiting the range of feasible crops. The major agricultural e-xports are
cocoa and coffee, which provide about 30 percent of exports. These two crops
contributed heavily to Government revenues through the official marketing
agency due to high world prices and relatively low producer prices. The
volume of cocoa and coffee produced has, however, fallen sharply since the
early 1970s, coincidi.ng with a decline in real producer prices. Output of
other agricultural produ-cts (mainly foodcrops and cotton) has grown moderately.
Foodcrop production has generally kept up with rural population growth, with
the exception of drought years in 1976 and 1977; rainfall conditions were good
in 1978, and foodcrop storage capacity is presently fully utilized.
6.       The rise of heavy industry is one of the striking aspects of this
small country.  Mining and beneficiation of phosphate rock was the first such
operation, now employing about 2,000 people. A 1.2 million-ton annual capacity
cement clinker plant (CIMAO) is under construction, with equity participation
by Ghana and the Ivory Coast as well as Togo, and financing from the Bank and
several other aid agencies. Production should start before the end of 1979.
However some of Togo's other heavy industrial investments appear less
promising. The Government-owned Lome oil refinery became operational in
October 1977, with an annual capacity of one million tons per year, but was
soon shut down for some time due to financial problems. A 20,000 ton steel
mill, based on imported scrap to produce reinforcing rod, has recently been
completed.
7.       Growth in the t:ertiary sector, accounting for 46 percent. of GDP
at market prices in 1977, has largely been linked to trade, to substantial
infrastructujre investmenits and industrial growth, and to the expansion of
the public payroll.  The latter grew from 17,300 in 1973 to 37,600 in 1978
including 14,000 in education and an army of 5,400 men.  Transport activity
has expanded witlh construction of a modern port at Lome in 1968, financed by
the Federal Republic of Germany. The nation's major international road links
are almost completely paved and have enabled increased transit trade principally
to tUpper Volta and Niger. I'he construction sector is flourishing due to urban
building and civil works projects.
Public Finance Developments
8.       Prior to the 1974 phosphate boom, Togo's financial policies were
generally prudent and its public investmenits modest in scale, in harmony with
the smallness and openness of the economy and its dependence on a few primary
commodities for foreign exchange earniings and Government revenues. Public
expenditure was below 15 percent of GDP, the budget deficit was very small,
and the Government held substantial reserves in the form of deposits with the
banking system and net foreign assets. Foreign indebtedness was low because
by far the largest part of foreign resources was extended to the Government in
the form of grants or concessionary loans.



-3-
9.        However, public expenditures greatly accelerated beginning in 1976,
in response to phosphate revenues which tripled public receipts from 1973 to
1977. Current plus extrabudgetary expenditures expanded fourfold over the
same period, with extrabudgetary spending reaching 40 percent of current
spending levels, and a budget deficit equivalent to 6 percent of GDP devel-
oped. Extrabudgetary items included some spending for investment projects and
military equipment purchases. Among current expenditures, public debt pay-
ments rose rapidly as did the cost of the largest ministries (education,
defense, and health) due mainly to sharp increases in the number of civil
servants.
10.       The Government also used readily available credit from foreign
private banks and suppliers to finance new projects. Committed public debt
rose from US$120 million at end-1973 to reach US$680 million by end-1977
(including US$160 million of CIMAO debt jointly guaranteed by the Ivory Coast,
Ghana and Togo). For the first time, substantial arrears to both domestic and
foreign suppliers began to accumulate and the Government borrowed from the
Central Bank and drew down its foreign reserves. Arrears on public debt
amounted to about US$125 million in April 1979.
11.       This situation led to a request by the Togolese for IMF assistance
and the negotiation, in April 1979, of a standby agreement in the third credit
tranche for SDRs 15 million.  The program extends to December 1980, and during
this period it is expected that an extended facility will be agreed upon to
take effect in 1981. The performance criteria and other conditions generally
restrict new borrowings on hard terms; provide for a substantial reduction
in payments arrears; impose ceilings on net banking credit; cnd call for
reduced current and capital spending and the *elimination of extrabudgetary
expenditures. Relief from certain external private debt is currently being
sought by the I'ogolese Government.
12.      T'he Government is committed to carrying out this program and rectify-
ing the current financial problems.  It announced an austerity program along
these general lines in November 1978. Bank estimates indicate that much of
the spending cutbacks can be absorbed in the ongoing investment program and
that, despite the conlstraint on the recurrent expenditures, iLt will probably
not be necessary to lay off any civil servants. Fiscal restraint would then
permit real increases in current expenditures starting in 1981 and contribute
to a greater domestic share of capital expenditures in the 1980s.  However, debt
service will constitute a heavy burden consuming 33 percent of Government
revenues in 1985 and 26 percent in 1990, even assuming that the mix of new
loan commitments is from more concessionary sources.
*          13.        To provide necessary foreign inflows, concessionary lending will
have to increase substantially:  loan commitments from bilateral and mullti-
lateratl institutions will have to amount to about 60 percent of new conmmit-
ments on average over 1978-85 coapared with roughly 40 percent in 1971--75
and 5( percent in 1976-77.  This level of aid should be obt:ainable given the
traditional support Togo enjoys from Germany, France, and multilateral sources
and the agreement now reached with the IMF.  At the same time a large per-
centage of loceil cost financing will be necessary, particularly on projects
with a relatively low foreign exchange component.



-4-
Development Planning
14.       The 1976-80 Development Plan was prepared during the phosphate boom
and does not provide a clear view of development priorities. The objectives
expressed for the long-term, while asserting that both equity and growth will
be pursued, basically emphasize growth through development of the modern
sector: an 8 percent annual real growth rate is to be achieved, largely
financed by domestic savings. The Plan focusses on mechanization of agricul-
ture, water supply, agro-industrial complexes, tourism, import-substitlution,
minerals and the necessary infrastructure. The actual allocation of 1976-77
public debt commitments emphasize the modern sector with, for instance, hotels
accounting for 15 percent of committed debt in 1976-77.  Many recent investments
do not address income distribution objectives, and rely on the "trickle down"
effect to reach the urban and rural poor.  Only 2 percent of 1976-77 debt
commitments were in support of human resources. Health facilities and water
supply remain inadequate.
Economic Prospects
15.       The Government has begun to reformulate its development strategy.
In agriculture greater emphasis is being placed on integrated rural develop-
ment and on improving the use of the resources allocated to this sector. In
mining a less precipitous approach is being taken towards the extension of
both the phosphate and CIMAO activities than has characterized some earlier
decisions on the industrial sector. A significant development is the recog-
nition by the Government of the need to strengthen its planning capacity at
the macro level and its capacity to evaluate the econc,mic viability of pro-
jects. This is discussed in more detail in paragraphs 23-28 below.
16.       The macro-economic outlook, based on an analysis of sectoral
constraints and potential, is for real GDP growth of 4-5 percent per year
over the 1978-90 period. Present very high growth raltes (8 percent per year
over 1976-78) will taper off as investment declines from the unsustainable
30 percent of GDP recordecl in 1976-78 to about 17 percent of GDP during the
1980s.  Thle ICOR is projected to decline in the late 1980s as the investment
program becomes more efficient.  A sharply declining resource gap, fueLed
by rising exports, should Lead to higher domestic savings. The balance of
payments projections indicate a shortage of foreign exchange (essentia.Lly a
shortage of budgetary resources available) in the early 1980s due to the
heavy debt service from earlier projects and the inevitable lag between large
investments planned for a phosphoric acid project and a second phase of CIMAO,
and the resulting exports. The Bank's projections assume this gap will be
filled by a combination of short-term funds, debt relief, IMF resources, and
increased borrowing from the West African Monetary Union's central bank.  The
net result would be a diminishing deficit on current account and increasing
reserves. These projections do not include any output or exports from the
oil refinery or the steel mill, since neither is currently operational although
the oil refinery is due to reopen shortly.  It is possible that higher pet-
roleum product prices and advantageous terms on Nigerian crude could result in
additional foreign exchange and public revenuLe inflows from the oil refinery.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
17.      To date the Bank Group has extended seven credits to Togo amounting
to US$57.7 million and two loans totalling US$53.0 million for the CIMAO
regional clinker project (a loan of US$3.5 million to Togo and one of US$49.5
million to CIMAO). Four of the credits were for highway construction, main-
tenance and feeder roads and three for agricultural projects. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations in Togo, as well as
notes on the execution of the projects.
18.      The Highway Maintenance Project, the Bank Group's first lending
operation in Togo, was satisfactorily completed in November 1973. The
Second Highway Project evolved from preinvestment studies financed under
the first project and provided for the construction or upgrading of three
highways and the continuation of the maintenance program. This project is
now virtually completed, although, due to inflation, the scope of the road
construction component had to be reduced in 1976.  The Third Highway Project
has as its main objective, the improvement of two important roads serving
mainly agricultural areas and linking the site of the CIMAO plant, Tabligbo,
with the port of Aneho, and to continue building up an efficient road main-
tenance service. Today, most of the country's major road links are paved
and adequately maintained. The Bank's future operations in the sector will,
therefore, aim at improving rural roads through the creation of an efficient
institutional framework and training of maintenance personnel.
19.       Agriculture is the main focus of the Bank Group's activities.  The
first agricultural project for which a credit was approved in 1974, covers
part of a long-range program for the development of the Plateau Region's
coffee and cocoa potential. The second agricultural credit, approved in
June 1976, provides financing for a rural development project in the Maritime
Region geared primar:ily to increasing foodcrop production and to providing
support services and rural infrastructure for 20,000 farm families.  The third
and most recent agricultural credit, which was approved by the Board in
October, 1977 supports a 5-year program to increase cotton and foodcrop
production by introducing improved cotton growing techniques and encouraging
cropp:ing patterns in which foodcrops would benefit from the residual effects
of fertilizers applied to cotton. The primary objective of the Association
in the agricult:ural sector is to improve farm incomes and increase the output
of foodcrops by small farmers, as well as developing the production of export
crops like coffee and cocoa.  In this connection a rural development project
in the Bassar region is being prepared. It would intensify the integrated
rural development approach begun under the cotton project. A follow-up
coffee/cocoa project in the Plateau Region will shortly be presented to the
Board
20.      Togo is the host to the CIMAO project, one of the :Largest regional
industrial ventures so far undertaken in West Africa.  Implementatiorn of
this US$284 million clinker project, financed by the Bank and seven other
official aid agencies, is proceeding satisfactorily. The Bank Group Ls
also assisting the preparation of a phosphoric acid project.



- 6 -
21.      A first education project has been appraised.  It emphasizes teacher
training at the primary level, upgrading and expansion of middle level agri-
cultural staff training and rural artisan training. Also, based on the
findings of a recent Bank-WHO Cooperative Program mission to Togo, an urban
water supply project for Lome is expected to be identified.
22.      Present Bank Group disbursements account for about 12 percent of
Togo's disbursed and outstanding public debt (including CIMAO) as of early
1979). Service payments to the Bank Group are about 2 percent of total debt
service and will remain below 5 percent over the medium term.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
23.       Some of the more recent developments discussed in Part I of this
report underline the absence of an adequate investment planning and monitor-
ing system. The Ministry of Planning has not hitherto been able to exercise
adequate influence on investment decisions and their implementation. Some of
the projects proposals were reviewed only superficially while many important
investment decisions were made with total disregard for the Plan and with-
out consultation witth the Planning Ministry. An unusually large proportion
of the projects suffered cost overruns.
24.       The implications of investment decisions on public finances and on
the balance of payments were never carefully analyzed., As a result over the
last five years public investment reached 30 percent of GDP, a level in large
part fuelled by the willingness of private ba[nks to provide financirng. Al-
though the consequences of such an ambitious program on the budget and on
the country's balance of payments were severe, there has been no attempt to
undertake an interim review of the current Plan, and it is now too late for
such a review to have any major impact during the current Plan period.
25.       In short there is a critical gap at present in Togo's planning
process, one that is recognized by the Government. The Ministry of Planning
is a relatively small organization with only a few prcofessionally qualified
and experienced staff. Yet the Ministry has an important role to play in
the nation's economic. management not least because the Minister, who has been
in his present position since 1974, is a senior member of the Government. In
the context, for example, of the recently announced austerity program, the
Ministry is inadequately equipped to consolidate the impact of all expendi-
tures, define policies capable of dealirng with the present situation and make
recommendations on priorities for the next Plan (1981-85).
26.       This is the background against which the Government made the
request for Bank technical assistance. This request was initiated by the
Minister of Planning, with the support of the Head of State. The move is
timnel]y in the sense that Togo is going through a financial crisis and it
demonstrates the Government's determination to ensure that, in the longer
run, the lessons that may be learned from the current experience, may be put
to good effect.  The project that has been put together in response to the



- 7 -
request is designed to be small enough (two advisers each for three years) so
that constant access to the Minister of Planning and other senior officials
can be developed, and flexible enough (130 man/years of short-term consult-
ancies) to enable the Minister to pursue certain issues in more depth
on ad hoc basis. The Association plans to remain in close contact with
the Minister in the execution of this technical assistance program thereby
backing up the advisory services with the full range of the Association's
experience and expertise in these matters.
27.       The Togolese Government already receives substantial technical
assistance, mostly project-related, some of which is financed under IDA
credits. There is in addition an expatriate adviser in the Ministry of
Planning's Division of Industry and Commerce. Two technical assistance
projects firnanced by UNDP and EDF are also currently underway. Under the UNDP
project an expert is being attached for 27 months to the Directorate General
of Planning and Development of the Ministry. His major tasks comprise the
preparation of a methodology to establish a regional planning system to be
used in the Fourth Plan, and the training of Togolese economists in regional
planning. UNDP funds for Togo are fully committed and there are no plans to
expand this program. The EDF program is helping to build up the Bureau of
Project Studies in the Ministry of Planning, by providing an expert for two
years from the French consulting firm SEDES. He is supported by about seven
man-months of short-term experts. The object is to train Togolese in the
review of projects, both by carrying out actual project analysis and through
classroom instruction.
28.       While these various programs are important they do not meet the
need for the policy-related advice that the two senior advisers would be
expected to offer at the ministerial level. Furthermore the advisers would
be expected to strengthen the Minister of Planning's coordinating flnctions,
helping to ensure a proper flow of information between the ministries concerned
with economic management. The additional short-term consultancies would play
a part in improving t-he data base for important decisions at the ministerial
level.  The pedagogical thrust of the existing technical assistance would not
overlap with that of the advisers to be financed under the proposed credit.
However the Miinister of Planning has indicated that he would like the advisers
to assist in the trainirng effort. The details of such assistance have been
discussed with Mlinistry officials and would be finally agreed upon when the
advisers take up their positions.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.      The proposed project was appraised last December and is sunmarized at
the beginning of this report. Annex III contains supplementary project data.
There will be n1o Staff Appraisal Report. Negotiations were held in Lome,
Togo, from May 15 to 16, 1979 with representatives from the Ministry of
Planning led by Mr. Koudjolou Dogo, Minister of Planning, Industrial D)evelop-
ment and AdTainistrative Reform.

30.       The project would provide two senior advisers to the Ministry of
Planning for a three-year period each (a total of 72 man-months). These
advisers would be supported with up to 130 man-months of consultant services
for comprehensive studies and for selected short-term assignments. The senior
economic adviser would be a development economist with graduate degree in
economiLs ai.d substantial experience with economic issues and policies at the
national and international level and familiarity with planning procedures.  In
addition to helping design the Fourth Plan (1981-85), he would focus on the
country's current and medium-term public finance problems and deal with such
issues as external debt, the control of current expenditures and the link
between the Plan and the budget. He would also analyze investment strategies,
their impact on the economy and their financial implications. The senior
project adviser would be a project economist by training with experience in
business administration. He would review the proposals for major new invest-
ments and the possibilities of improving the economic and financial viability
of ongoing projects. His task would be to help develop Togo's natural re-
sources and industry under the best possible conditions, including helping to
obtain external financing on the most appropriate terms.
31.       The Association has received assurances that these advisers would
obtain full support from the staff of the different Ministries concerned
in the management of the economy and the technical assistants provided under
the UNDP and EDF programs. The work of the advisers and consultants would
include on-the-job training as they would collaborate closely with the staff
of other Ministries. In addition, the senior advisers would organise seminars
and training programs on such topics as project analysis and public finance.
The ef'fective use of the advisers and consultants would be closely monitored
by the Association.  An organization chart of the Ministry of Planning (Annex
IV to this report) indicates the positioning of these two advisers.  The terms
of reference of both experts (Annex V) are acceptable to the Association.
Their background, experience and terms of employment would be satisfactory to
the Association (Section 3.02(a) (i? and (ii) of Credit Agreement:).
32.       The consultant services for studies and selected short-term assign-
ments would mainly be used to assist the two senior advisers in carrying out
their tasks. For example a new household budget survey is needed (the last
one dates back to 1964) to supply basic data for the formulation of new
development policies in the context of preparing the Fourth Plan.  Consultant
services would also be used in project preparation, including the proposed
phosphoric acid project and possibly the second stage of CIMAO. The cost of
the household budget survey and of these major project studies are preli-
minarily estimated at US$500,000 and US$200,000 respectively. Thlese tasks
are likely to be carried, out by consultinig firms.  In addition, the project
adviser, in attemptirLg to iraprove the viability of ongoing projects (oil
refinery, steel mill, Lome thermal power station and several large hote:Ls now
under construction), would require the use of consultants to focus on particular
aspects of these projects. A total of about :20 man-months (US$200,0)00) has
been allocated for these reviews.
33.       Short-term technical assistance is needed in a number of other
areas. One of them concerns agricultural pricing. The Association has
recently completed an analysis of cash crop production incentives, leading to



- 9 -
recommendations on methodologies in setting cash crop prices. Conflicting
objectives such as increased farmer incomes from cocoa, coffee and cotton
and the need to maximize public revenues and the goal of food self-
sufficiency versus export crop production should be better balanced. The
Association's report was submitted to the Government last December, but cash
crop prices require periodic review. About ten man-months of short-term
consultants to be financed under this project (US$100,000) would be used to
help develop the capacity to analyse agricultural prices. Overall, the
consultants would be used for high priority studies, in accordance with
criteria agreed upon between the Government and the Association (Schedule 2(c)
(2) of Credit Agreement), in support of current and long-term economic manage-
ment at the discretion of the Minister of Planning. However, the Government
would seek prior approval from the Association for all short term consultancy
contracts equivalent to US$50,000 or more (Section 3.02 (a)(iii) of Credit
Agreement).
34.      Each of the senior advisers would also be assisted by a Togolese
economist, secretaries and other support services as needed (Section 3.02 (b)
of Credit Agreement). The cost of these salaries and support services would
be included in the project.
Project Costs and Financing
35.      The total project cost net of taxes is estimated at US$2.4 million,
including a foreign exchange component of about 73 percent. Price contingen-
cies have been included at 8 percent per year for the short-term consult-
ants, support staff, equipment and supplies. The proposed IDA credit of
US$2.2 million would finance the total foreign exchange component and the
local costs of the long-term advisers and consultants, or about 92 percent of
total project costs. The balance, US$200,000 of local costs, would be paid by
the Government.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.      The two senior advisers would be recruited by the Government with the
help of the Association. The entire cost of the advisers, including salaries,
housing and other allowances, travel and cost of recruitment, would be
financed out of the proceeds of the credit (72 man-months of US$9,400/man-
months, including contingencies, travel, housing and other allowances). The
short-term consultants (130 man-months of US$10,000/man-month, including
travel, housing and other allowances) would be selected in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines for consultants' contracts. Equipment and office
supplies would be procured according to the Borrower's local procedures which
are satisfactory to the Association.
37.      The IDA funds would be disbursed against:
(i) 100 percent of the total cost of the two senior advisers
and the short-term consultants (US$2.0 million); and
(ii) 100 percent of the total cost of office supplies and equipment
(US$20,000).
US$180,000 would remain unallocated.

Benefits and Risks
38.       Benefits would accrue to Togo over the long-term as the advice
provided under the project would help to promote sounder investment and public
finance policies.  This technical assistance would be particularly timely
over the next three years, as the Government has introduced an austerity
program covering the allocation of domestic resources and a restructuring
of external commitments. The project would remain risky, even assuming
that highly qualified and adaptable personnel can be found, due to the very
nature of an advisory project. The Government is keenly aware of the needs
the project is designed to help meet. The strong appeal made to the Asso-
ciation for help is an indication of the Government's commitment to the
project at the highest level.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Togo
and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
40.      Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are listed in Section III of Annex III.
41.      I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C. Projects in Execution*
Credit No. 450            Second Highway Project; US$8.7 Million (Credit of
December 28, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979;
Effectiveness Date: April 19. 1974
The project originally provided for the construction of one section
of the main south-north road axis (Blitta-Sokode) and two secondary roads
(Sokode-Kambola and Agou-Notse). Due to inflation, the scope of the road
construction had to be reduced. The Agou-Notse road, the least priority
stretch of the three roads to be constructed under the project, was dropped
and subsequently included in the Third Highway Project. The project is now
completed and the undisbursed balance (about IJS$500,000) will be used to
finance studies for future road rehabilitation.
Credit No. 503            Cocoa/Coffee Development Project; US$6 Million Credit
of August 6. 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: March 12. 1975
This project provides for the rehabilitation, planting and mainte-
nance of 4,000 ha of cocoa and 4,400 of coffee in the Plateau Region. While
the coffee component is well on schedule, cocoa is lagging behind, mainly
due to lack of incentive for farmers to uproot old trees for replanting of new
ones. The Government is aware of the problem and has in principle agreed to
increase compensation payments for uprooting old trees and credits to farmers.
The project's overall replanting targets (cocoa and coffee combined) are being
met on schedule.
Credit No. 638            Maritime Region Rural Development Project; US$9.5
Million Credit of June 16. 1976; Closing Date:
December '31, 1981; Effectiveness Date: October 26,
1976
The purpose of the project is to improve and diversify production
of upland crops (maize, cassava, groundnuts, cowpeas and cotton); develop
lowland rainfed rice and vegetables; rehabilitate irrigation facilities for
existing vegetable production; renovate smallholder coconut plantings; and
provide the necessary support services and infrastructure for abcout 20,000
farm families. Foodcrop plantings are on target, while rice and cotton
targets are behind schedule, mainly due to uneven rainfall. The related
shortfalls in farmers revenues have delayed repayment of about 80 percent
of the credits farmers received in 1977.
*   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of the projects in execution and, in particular, to
report any problems which are being encountered and the action being
taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the
understanding that t'hey do not. purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 1235 WAF          CIMAO Regional Clinker Project; US$60 MLllion 1/
Loan No. 1296 TO           Loans of June 28, 1976; Closing Date:  December 31,
1980; Effectiveness Date: April 17, 1978.
The project is designed to produce 1.2 million tons of clilker for
delivery to cement grinding stations in Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. The
project consists of (i) the industrial complex, comprising quarry, clinker
plant and related workshops, at Tabligbo, about 65 km northeast of Lome, and
(ii) related infrastructure components comprising a power link, a rail/port
terminal at Lome, a rail link and a township for CIMAO personnel. Execution
of the industrial -omplex is about 6 months behind schedule, due to delays in
civil works, incre -ing the cost of the project to the limits of available
financing.  CommercLll production of clinker is expected to start in January
1980.
Credit No. 693             Third Highway Project; US$10 Million Credit of
April 1, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981;
Effectiveness Date: September 13, 1977
The project provides for the reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo
road (45 km), the construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km), the provision
of technical assistance for improving transport planning and road maintenance
and preinvestment studies for a follow-up project. Project execution has
started satisfactorily with construction of the Agou-Notse road 65 percent
and Aneho-Tabligbo 12 percent completed. But recently contractors stopped
work due to delays in Government's counterpart payments.  This situation is
expected to be resolved with an allocation to the project of an additional $2.0
million from the EEC Special. Actioni Fund. This woulcd increase total external
financing to about 90 percent of project cost.
Credit No. 741             Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas; US$14
Million Credit of October 5. 1977; ClosinRgDate:
June 30, 1982; Effectiveness Date:  March 1I 1978
The project aims at increatsing cotton production from 7,000 tons to
34,000 tons and foodcrops grown in rotation with cott:on from 40,000 tons to
57,000 tons of maize and sorghum at: full development. The credit became
effective on March 17, 1978 and physical targets for 1978 project execution
have been met.
Credit No. 810             Feeder Roads Prolect; US$5.8 million Credit of
June 28, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Effectiveness Date: March 2,. 1979
Procurement is under way.
1/  Amount of US$60 million covers the loans to CIMA0 of US$49.5 million
and to the three member states (Togo, Ivory Coast: and Ghana) of US$3.5
million each.
