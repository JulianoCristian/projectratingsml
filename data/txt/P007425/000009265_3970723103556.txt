PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Jamaica Fourth
Highway Project, for which a loan in the amount of US$16.0 million was
approved by the Executive Directors on June 21, 1979.  The loan is 96%
disbursed and, except for about US$0.3 million which is not committed, the
remaining funds are expected to be disbursed by June 30, 1984.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, LAC Information Center, the Appraisal Report,
staff supervision reports, consultants' final reports and a Project
Completion Report prepared by the Borrower.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for couments; however, none were received.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1740-JM)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was successful in achieving its main objective of
helping to arrest the deterioration of the road network. Because of severe
financial constraints, the project was revised in late 1980 on the basis of:
(a) reducing project-financed periodic maintenance levels, where feasible, to
maximize the total length of roads which would receive some form of periodic
maintenance within available funding; and (b) making the equipment
procurement program consistent with the revised civil works component of the
project (para 3.02).
The revised ptoject was completed satisfactorily in October 1983,
at a cost in line with appraisal estimates. The ex-post economic evaluation
of the project confirms the merit of the investment (para 5.03).
The quality of works performed under the project was generally
good, except in the case of reseal works. The lower quality of the reseals
is attributed to shortfalls in both the quantity and quality of aggregate
material as a result of the quarry industry's poor management and aged
crushing plants (para 3.09).
The achievements of the technical assistance component of the
project were limited. Efforts to make full use of the Borrower's Road
Maintenance Programing System (ROMGRAM) and Road Maintenance Costing System
(RMCS) were hindered by the low level of budgeted funds and the poor quality
of the input data (paras 3.24 and 3.25). Operations of the Hire Funding
Scheme were improved through the introduction of stores management
procedures, but improvements in the accounting system were short-lived
because the local counterpart trained under the project left his job at the
Ministry (para 3.28). Lack of qualified staff, caused by low civil service
salaries, affected all elements of the project.
The Project Completion Report concludes that:
(a) most of the project success is attributable to careful project
preparation, which included a detailed program of maintenance
activities to be carried out on specific road sections (para 8.02);
(b) the problem of inadequate civil service salaries should be dealt on
a countrywide basis and not in the framework of individual project
lending (para 8.02).
(c) the project had an important catalytic role, since it enabled
identification of the main problems upon which the follow-on Road
Maintenance Project should focus (para 8.01).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Jamaica's land transport system is well developed and consists of
about 12,000 miles of road, a 200-mile long Government-run railway system and
a few miles of private railroad. The main non-urban network, which is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Construction, totals about 2,900 miles, of
which more than two-thirds are paved. The remainder of the island's roads
total some 9,100 miles, of which 8,200 miles are administered by Parish
Councils and about 900 miles of urban-type roads in the Kingston Metropolitan
area are administered by the Kingston and St. Andrews Council. Bauxite-
related exports are carried mainly on the railroads, with all other internal
freight and practically all passenger traffic handled by road transport.
1.02      The Government's strategy in the road subsector is to preserve,
rather than to expand, the existing extensive infrastructure, recognizing
that, because of the severe economic problems that the country faced in the
last decade, maintenance efforts were inadequate to arrest the deterioration
of the road network. Bank involvement in the subsector during the last few
years has been geared toward reducing the road maintenance backlog
(para 1.03).
1.03      The Bank's First and Third Highway Projects (Loan 408-JM,
US$5.5 million, April 1965; and Loan 1032-JM, US$13.5 million, July 1974 1/)
aided in upgrading some of the more heavily traveled and congested primary
road sections. The Second Highway Project (Loan 899-JM, US$9.3 million, June
1973)2/, the Fourth Highway Project, subject of this report (Loan 1740-JM,
US$16.0 million, June 1979) and the ongoing Highway Maintenance Project (Loan
2293-JM, US$15.0 million, April 1983) addressed road maintenance problems
through a program of road resealing and strengthening and by improving the
maintenance organization.
1.04      This completion report is based on information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, Bank's Record Center, LAC Information Center,
project appraisal and supervision reports, the Borrower's Project Completion
Report and reports prepared by the consultants involved in project execution
and supervision.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      In late 1977, the Government and the Bank agreed to the financing,
under Loan 899-JM, of a study for the development of a four-year road
maintenance program. The study was undertaken by the UK consultants who were
assisting the Government in the implementation of the Second Highway Project,
and it was completed in late 1978. The consultants' findings and
recommendations provided the basis for the formulation of the Government's
road maintenance program for the fiscal five-year period 1979-1984. The
project was designed to cover the non-recurrent expenditures of the first two
years of the maintenance program and to strengthen the capability of the
Ministry of Construction (MOC) to carry out road maintenance operations3/.
2.02      The project was appraised in November 1978, and an Issues Paper was
circulated on January 9, 1979. A Decision Memorandum was issued on
January 30, 1979, which dealt mainly with the approval of US$440,000 in
retroactive financing of preparatory works and consultancy services for works
supervision; the adequate staffing of the Maintenance Department as a
condition for loan effectiveness; and the financial problems of the Jamaican
Railway Corporation tJRC) (para 6.02).
2.03      Negotiations were conducted in Washington from May 7 to May 14,
1979, and a loan amounting to US$16.0 million was approved by the Executive
Directors on June 21, 1979.
2.04      The approved project elements and their estimated costs as given in
the appraisal report, were as follows:

2.05      The project was expected to be completed by August 1982, and the
Loan Closing Date was set at March 31, 1983.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Startup Period
3.01      The project experienced substantial delays almost from the start.
Preparatory works progressed at a very slow pace because of severe floods in
June and September of 1979, shortages of reliable equipment and delays in
assigning County Engineers. Most of the other project elenents also started
about three months behind appraisal schedule, mainly because of difficulties
in hiring local counterparts to the UK consultants who had been retained to
provide technical assistance under the project.
B. Reassessment of the Project
3.02      In early 1980, when some road surface resealing was about to start,
it became evident that the five-year road maintenance program could not be
implemented as planned. Because of severe fiscal constraints and the need to
divert substantial resources to repair roads damaged during the floods, the
1979/1980 road maintenance budget (net of emergency funds) provided only
about 50% of the amount agreed at loan negotiations. Furthermore, Government
officials indicated that substantial shortfalls from the agreed figures were
likely to occur in the following years. Although assurances were given that
project works would be funded adequately, the Bank decided that the five-year
maintenance program had to be considered in its totality and that it would be
inadvisable to proceed with the agreed schedule of project financed capital
expenditures when the recurrent elements of road maintenance could not keep
pace. For these reasons, the scope and timing of the project were reassessed
in late 1980 (MAP IBRD 16083(PCR)) on the basis of: (a) reducing
project-financed periodic maintenance levels, where feasible, to maximize the
total length of roads which would receive some form of periodic maintenance
within available funding; and (b) making the equipment procurement program
consistent with the revised civil works component of the project. The major
changes in the size and scope of the project were:
(a) reduction of project asphaltic overlay from 76 miles to about
27 miles;
(b) reduction of project asphaltic sealing and resealing works
from 259 miles to 242 miles;



(c) reduction of asphaltic sealing on mix miles to about two miles
of tertiary gravel roads; and
(d) addition of a new category, 'rehabilitation," which would
restore the pavement and basic drainage facilities on about
2MO miles of important secondary and link roads which had
deteriorated to a condition for which routine maintenance was
no longer effective.'
Because the weak state of the local construction Industry had by then become
evident (para 3.12), it was also agreed that the use of force account,
originally envisaged only for preparatory works, could he extended to minor
workshop additions if bids were not responsive, to resealing works on up to
50 miles of roads and to rehabilitation works. The Loan Agreement was
amended accordingly on March 16, 1981.
C. Execution of the Revised Project
(i) Civil Works
(a) Preparatory Works
3.03      Execution of the preparatory works was the responsibility of the
Maintenance Directorate in MOC. As mentioned, progress on the preparatory
works was slow during the initial stage of project implementation because of
unfavorable weather conditions and shortages of both Government and privately
owned plant and equipment4/. Lack of cement, erratic supplies of bitumen,
and labor unrest during the election period of October 1980 also contributed
to the slow pace of works. Productivity increased substantially during 1981
and 1982, mainly because an increase in the official MOC rates for hiring
equipment from contractors improved the plant availability situation, and the
distribution to the parishes of the new plant and equipment purchased under
the loan eased the constraints. The p 'paratory works were often expanded to
take into account the deterioration of the roads during the period between
the expected and actual commencement of the reseal and overlay programs as
well as the damages caused by Hurricane Allen.
4/   During nost of the project implementation period, the Jamaican
Government substantially curtailed the availability of foreign
exchange. This policy resulted in a serious shortage of spare parts and
other inputs necessary for project implementation.



3.04      The quality of supervision of preparatory works was satisfactory
during the initial stages, with five County Engineer, available5/ and few
contracts in progress. This supervision deteriorated as the wo hkload on the
County Engineers built up, and they had less time to attend to the more
technical aspects of the preparatory works. Lack of adequate supervision was
evident in many parishes; work organization suffered from deficiencies which
caused the need for substantial remedial works at the time of sealing. With
the increased involvement of the Area Superintendents, the supervision of
works improved.
3.05      Total cost of the preparatory works for about 262 miles of roads
was USS6.16 million (the appraisal estimated an expenditure of USS6.8 million
on these works). The average cost per mile of preparatory works for overlay,
reseal and seal w2s US$23,000. The average cost per mile of preparatory
worka for the resealing works increased from about US$18,800 during the
initial implementation period to about US$21,500 during the final stages.
Because of the many changes in the overlay program, a reliable estimate of
the average cost per mile of the preparatory works for overlay could not be
made.
(b) Rnad Resealing and Sealing
3.06      Resealing of ahout 159 miles of roads was carried out by contract
through locjil competitive bidding, in four phases6/ between March 1980 and
June 1983.  The works were completed about six months later than estimated
during the project reassessment. In addition, 64.5 miles were resealed, and
about two miles of unpaved roads were sealed by force account. The quality
of the works vnried from fair to good. Generally, the lower quality is
attributable to problems with surfacing aggregates (para 3.09) and inadequate
qualitv control (para 3.10).
3.07      Efficiency in the contract tender and award procedures improved
substantialLy as the resealing program progressed.  For the last phase of
implementation, these procedures, including the tender period of 30 days,
were cnmp: !ted tn ten weeks, compared with the four to five months that the
same proci,s' took In earlier phases. Also, as the project advanced, the

number of tenders that had to be rejected because of non-compliance with the
conditions of tendering was noticeably reduced, and the accuracy of the
tendering improved. Additionally, there was an increase in the capacity of
the local construction industry during the implementation period (11 firms
were prequalified for the first phase of resealing and 19 for the last
phase), probably due, in part, to the increased confidence of the local firms
in MOC's capability in contract administration. The increased participation
in bidding also contributed to greater competitiveness, reflected in the
relatively stable contract prices. No foreign firms participated in the
local bidding.
3.08      The contractors' performance varied considerably with regard to
work organization, quality of works performed and compliance with time
schedules. In many cases, because of poor quality of work and/or problems
with aggregate materials, substantial remedial works had to be carried out.
The quality of works performed by force account varied from parish to parish.
3.09      The main problem affecting the project resealing works concerned
the quality and quantity of the supply of good clean aggregates graded in
accordance with specifications. In the earlier phases, contractors had to
rely on only one quarry, which provided material of variable quality and was
able to charge monopolistic prices. Three other existing quarries could not
meet specifications. The situation improved slightly in 1981 with the
opening of two gravel crushing plants on the island. An additional plant
opened in 1982. The UK consultants reviewed the problem of the quarry
industry critically during the preparation of the ongoing Highway Maintenance
Project. They concluded that the sporadic shortfalls in both the quantity
and quality of aggregate material resulted from the industry's poor
management and the aged crushing plants. The Government agreed to implement
the consultants' recommendations of making foreign exchange available to the
industry for plant renewal and spare parts for maintenance.
3.10      As in the case of the preparatory works, the quality of the
resealing program was also affected by insufficient supervision, especially
after the departure of the consultant's County Engineers in late 1981 and
early 1982. The remaining County Engineers did not have sufficient personnel
for field supervision, and quality control declined. The general problem of
inadequate staffing affected all elements of the project.
3.11      The final cost of the resealing program (excluding preparatory
works) was US$5.02 million, or about US$22,500 per mile, as compared to the
US$19,000 per mile expected at appraisal.
(c) Asphaltic Overlay
3.12      Asphaltic overlay of about 37 miles of roads was completed in late
1983. The appraisal estimated that about 76 miles of roads were going to be
treated with asphaltic concrete overlay by mid-1981. Because past experience



- 8 -
indicated that foreign contractors were not interested in undertaking works
in Jamaica, it was agreed during loan negotiations that contracts for overlay
works would be awarded through local competitive bidding7/. However, during
the initial stages of the project, the contracting industry was extremely
weak, and its response to the bidding invitation was below that expected at
appraisal. Only two firms operating in the eastern part of Jamaica were
interested in the works and the Bank agreed that MOC should award the
contracts based on negotiations. Since one of the firms was involved in the
construction of major roads under the Third Highway Project, the commencement
of the overlay works was delayed by about eight months.
3.13      In the reassessmert of the project in late 1980, the lack of
capacity of the contracting industry was taken into consideration and the
overlay program was substantially reduced. The contracting industry
experienced an upturn in 1982, and a review of project costs indicated
sufficient funds to add a further 37 miles to the overlay program. In the
last phase of the program (about 13 miles completed in October 1983), the
Bank agreed to contracts being let through local competitive bidding because
their small size would not attract foreign firms8/.
3.14      The quality of overlay works was good and the supervision was
satisfactory. Total cost of this project element was US$3.21 million, about
US$87,000 per mile (excluding preparatory works), vis-a-vis the US$79,000
estimated at appraisal. In general, the effectiveness of contract
negotiations in 1981 and 1982, and the competitiveness of th:e tenders in
1983, resulted in reasonable unit prices. The 1983 unit costs were only 38%
greater than the 1978 unit costs used for the feasibility study, while the
domestic inflation rate for the 1978-1983 period was about 100%.
Cd) Rehabilitation Works
3.15      This new category of works was introduced into the project as a
result of the 1980 reassessment. With an initial allocation of US$2.4
million from savings derived from the reduction of other civil works
components, the rehabilitation works were intended for the restoration of
pavement and associated drainage facilities on selected road sections which
had deteriorated badly because of the lack of routine maintenance. Funds
were allocated to each county on the basis of the length of roads in the
county that had not received any form of periodic maintenance under the last
7/   Severe labor problems in Jamaica durinrg the second half of the 1970s
constituted one reason for the lack of interest of foreign firms; the
distribution of works throughout the island and the resulting small size
of the contracts constituted another.
8/   For the ongoing Highway Maintenance Project, international competitive
bidding procedures are being applied. Several foreign firms responded
to prequalification invitations.



Bank financed maintenance programs 9J. The list of road sections to be
improved was based on a ranking provided by a Modified Viability Index (a
somewhat crude first year rate of return) and adjusted by a subjective
Utilization Index. The latter was derived from a point system giving
different weights to the functions and utilization of the road.
3.16      The bulk of the rehabilitation works was executed between August
1981 and March 1983. Because of fund limitations, the parishes concentrated
their efforts upon improving road surfaces (i.e., reconstruction of the
carriage way, rehabilitative patching) which accounted for 95% of the work
carried out. Replacement of culverts and associated drainage works accounted
for the remaining 5%. These works were carried out by force account on 268
miles of roads at a total cost of US$2.85 million, i.e., about US$10,500 per
mile.
(ii) Procurement of Road Maintenance Equipment
3.17      The project included funds to replace, over a two-year period,
about 210 units of MOC's road maintenance equipment which were obsolete or
beyond repair. Most of the equipment procurement was completed by the end of
1981, about one year later than the appraisal schedule. The delay was mainly
caused by the need to review and define the equipment required for the
reassessed maintenance program. Problems to obtain the required import
licenses and retendering of some bids for which price quotations had expired
also caused delays in equipment procurement. Total cost of the equipment
acquisition program was about US$2.9 million, 14% below the appraisal
estimate. The equipment purchased under the project is listed in Table 1.
(iii) Overhaul of Road Maintenance Equipment
3.18      Concurrently with the acquisition of new equipment, a program for
rehabilitating out-of-service equipment was also included in the project.
Identification, screening and selection of equ4pment and vehicles were
carried out with the assistance of consultants. Because of the late arrival
of the expatriate Stores Manager and the high priority given to new equipment
procurement by the Mechanical Engineer and his counterpart, the program
started about six months behind schedule.
3.19      When the program got under way, a detailed assessment revealed
that, because of the condition of many of the units, rehabilita.ion was
uneconomical. The main reason was the continuous loss of parts through
cannibalization of the units earmarked for rehabilitation. This problem
persisted in spite of the security measures implemented under the workshop
improvement program (para 3.21).

- 10 -
3.20      Progress in rehabilitating the units that remained in the program
was far slower than scheduled. Constraints included the lack of strong
commitment to the program by shop supervisors and shortages of qualified
mechanics. The main causes for delay, however, were the weakness of the
middle management of the Directorate of Mechanical Services (DEMS) and the
extremely low productivity in the workshops. The latter factor is especially
evident in the Kingston workshop, which, because of its location and
overstaffing for political reasons, is inefficient. Since labor unrest and
violence are not without precedent in the workshop, a politically acceptable
solution for increasing its productivity remains difficult. These problems
were examined in depth by the consultants in the context of the operation of
the Hire Funding Scheme for equipment management. Their conclusions are
presented in paragraph 3.29.
3.21      The program was completed in 1983 with the overhauling of 109
units, vis-a-vis the 313 envisaged at appraisal. Under the loan, spare
parts, workshop tools and minor workshop improvements were financed.  The
latter included measures to improve security in the workshops. Total cost of
these project elements was US$0.71 million for spare parts and US$0.64
million for physical improvements of the workshops.
(iv) Technical Assistance and Training
3.22      The same UK consultants who assisted HOC in project preparation
were retained to provide the Ministry with technical assistance for the
implementation of the Five-Year Road Maintenance Program. In particular, the
consultants assisted HOC in: (a) the preparation and evaluation of bids for
the civil works; (b) the supervision of preparatory and surfacing works;
(c) the efforts to reestablish the Road Maintenance Programing and Costing
Systems (ROMGRAM and RMCS) as useful tools for efficient maintenance
operations, and (d) the improvement of the operations of the Hire Funding
Scheme.
(a) The ROMGRAM and RMCS System
3.23      During 1974 and 1975, the Directorate of Maintenance in MOC
introduced three inter-related systems for routine maintenance management:
the Annual Allocation System, the Road Maintenance Programing System
(ROMGRAM) and the Road Maintenance Works Costing System (RMCS). The first
two systems were developed to calculate the annual funding necessary for
routine maintenance and to program and schedule routine road maintenance
activities for each road control section; RMCS was to enable the Directorate
of Maintenance to cost routine maintenance operations and provide an
effective tool for expenditure control. These systems were never fully
operational; the following paragraphs discuss the efforts under the project
to make full use of them.



- 11 -
3.24      The ROMGRAM system was primarily designed to provide a reasonably
even spread of funds for the maintenance of the road network. However, since
routine maintenance budgets were very limited during the last decade, the
diffusion of funds over the extensive network resulted in a tendency to
concentrate maintenance efforts upon simple labor-based operations such as
grass cutting or drainage cleaning. Recognizing that such practice does not
address the problem of pavement deterioration, the consultants modified the
system by improving the linkage between conditions prevailing in each road
section and criteria for allocation of funds. Based on surveys, a pilot
scheme was carried out on all control sections in the county of Surrey with a
view toward revising road control section allocations. Because of the
encouraging results, it was decided to extend the survey to all parishes.
However, this task was not completed. Surveys were carried out in Middlesex
and partially in Cornwall, but the additional workload throwa upon the
Ministry's County Engineers with the departure, in 1981, of the consultant
staff filling these positions, prevented any further progress. Still, in the
consultants' opinion, the system, if appropriately adjusted, could be useful
for programing maintenance operations. The major shortcoming in the planning
process is not inherent in the system itself, but is a consequence of the low
level of budgeted funds and the unpredictable manner in which those funds are
released (para 6.01).
3.25      Attempts at reestablishing RMCS were less satisfactory than those
for ROMGRAM, and the future viability of the system is still in question.
Although the consultants made considerable efforts to train field staff to
provide input data, the accuracy of this information remained at such a low
level that the final output was virtually useless. Furthermore, since the
data processing took about three to four months, the exercise was ineffective
as a management tool.   While MOC acknowledges that the operation of the
system had no tangible benefits, it claims that the exercise was useful since
it induced field staff to accept the need for systematic data collection on
maintenance operations. However, it will remain the task of the newly
established Road Planning Unit (para 6.02) to decide if the system needs
further revision or if it should be replaced by a new one based on different
sources of information.
(b) The Hire Funding Scheme
3.26      In early 1976, MOC introduced a Hire Funding Scheme with the
objective of obtaining funds for repair, maintenance, and renewal of
equipment by charging rental rates to the users of the fleet. By 1978, when
the project was under preparation, progress on the implementation of the
scheme had been limited to such an extent that even the most basic accounting
procedures were not being carried out.
3.27      As a step toward furthering the development of the scheme, the
project included technical assistance comprising:



- 12 -
(a)  a Mechanical Eng.neer to help with the implementation of the
physical aims of the project (i.e., improvements of buildings and
purchase of new plant and vehicles) and to generally assist the
Director of DEMS;
(b) a Stores Manager to reorganize the stores, introduce appropriate
stores management systems and oversee stores building improvements;
and
(c) an Accountant to establish the required accounting procedures.
3.28      Execution of this technical assistance started at various dates
during the last half of 1979 and was completed by mid-1981 with varying
results. The Mechanical Engineer helped in the process of new equipment
procurement and contributed to the achievements under the equipment overhaul
program. Substantial improvements in stores management resulted from the
introduction of new documentation for the control of incoming and outgoing
materials through a new Stores Record Control System and the setting up of a
local purchasing office. However, the problem of inadequate staffing limited
these achievements. In particular, by the end of the consultants' duties in
January 1981, the position of Chief Superintendent of stores was still
vacant. The consultants' contract was extended for seven months, but a
suitable counterpart was appointed only in August 1981 and could receive only
one month of training. It is to the credit of the systems introduced, the
training carried out and the Chief Superintendent of stores himself that the
improvements in the stores organization were maintained after the
consultants' departure. However, achievements in implementing sound
accounting procedures were short-lived since the counterpart trained under
the technical assistance left the Ministry.
3.29      The progress described in the preceding paragraphs was not
sufficient to make the scheme fully operational. Because of its close
organizational relation with DEMSIO/, the scheme was affected by the
latter's weaknesses. Furthermore,the lack of experienced staff necessary to
operate the scheme as a quasi-private entity precluded the possibility of any
substantial progress. During preparation of the ongoing Highway Maintenance
Project, the consultants reviewed the scheme's operations. They concluded
that the future viability of the scheme required its reestablishment as an
independent legal body separated physically and organizationally from DEMS.
The Government agreed to implement the consultants' recommendations. Loan
2293-JM provides technical assistance for that purpose.
3.30      A training program, largely for personnel of the Directorate of
Maintenance, was implemented under the project with the support of MOC's
Training Unit and the technical assistance consultants. The program, which
10/ The Director of DEMS was the General Manager of the Scheme.



- 13 -
was limited in scope and budget, included formal training sessions for
superintendents and work overseers and seminars for DM personnel on road
maintenance technology and road maintenance management systems. Under the
equipment-related element of the program, in addition to the formal
mechanical apprenticeship training courses, short courses were conducted for
equipment operators and mechanics by manufacturers' representatives.
Overseas training was also financed under the project for three senior
workshop staff in the UK and for 11 engineering staff and plant operators and
six accountants in the USA.
3.31      In early 1982, the consultants' functions were extended to include
the preparation of a feasibility study for the 1983-1985 Road Improvement and
Maintenance Program (RIMP III). The study, completed in 1983, served as the
basis for the preparation of the ongoing Highway Maintenance Project. Loan
funds allocated for this study amounted to US$190,000.
3.32      The total cost of the technical assistance and training provided
under the project by the UK consultants amounted to US$1.90 million, about
24% above appraisal estimate, or 12% if the cost of the feasibility study for
the 1983-1985 Road Improvement and Maintenance Program, not envisaged at
appraisal, is excluded.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison of appraisal estimates and final costs is shown in
Table 2. However, because of the changes in project size and scope, it is
more meaningful to see the difference between the expected and actual cost
per mile of the civil works, in US$ equivalent, as shown on the following
tabulation:
Appraisal I/    Actual           %
Estimate         Costs       Difference
(US$ per mile)
Preparatory Works       20,000         23,000          15.0
Seal and Reseal         19,000         22,500          18.0
Overlay                 79,000         86,000          14.7
1/ Including contingencies.
The appraisal estimates of costs of civil works were realistic, considering
that, during the project implementation period, the compounded local
inflation rate was about 100%, quite above the international inflation rate,
while the exchange rate remained constant.



- 14 -
4.02      The total cost of technical assistance under the project was
US$2.46 million, about 60% above appraisal estimate, of which 12% was due,
principally, to: (a) inadequate allowances during appraisal for salary
increases over the previous agreement with the UK consultant under the Second
Highway Project; (b) to the underestimation of the cost of reimbursable items
such as new vehicles, office equipment and training aides; and (c) to the
extension of the consultant services. The rest of the increase was due to
the reallocation of loan funds to the technical assistance category to
finance items not originally included in the project, such as:
(a)   the Road Improvement and Maintenance Program III Feasibility Study,
US$190,000;
tb)   the Rural Roads Improvement Program prefeasibility study to assess
the merit of the Government's program to improve tertiary roads in
depressed areas, US$60,000;
c)   a Kingston Urban Transportation Study,11/ US$235,000; and
d)   the Non-Urban Transport Study, financed by both Loan 1032-JM and
the subject Loan, US$80,000 (para 6.02).
4.03      The allocation of funds was revised once, as shown in the following
table, to increase the funds in the technical assistance category.

4.04      As shown in the following tabulation, disbursement lagged behind
appraisal estimates from the start, mainly because of initial delays in mnst
project components. As of May 1, 1984, about USS630,000 were still
undisbursed, of which about 50% are uncommitted and will be cancelled.
11/ This study was used in the preparation of the recently approved Urban
Transport Project (Loan P3730-JM, March 1984, US$16.0 million).

V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The road maintenance works were justified at the time of appraisal
on the basis of savings in vehicle operating costs derived from improved road
surfaces. The original methodology, developed by the UJK consultants during
project preparation, was based on a simple deterioration model which related
surface roughness to the age of the pavement (RIMP II model). The final
output was a First Year Rate of Return (FYRR), simply a ratio of the first
year benefits to the capital cost of improving each road section. During the
preparation of the ongoing Highway Maintenance Project in 1982, the
methodology was improved substantially to include the experience gained under
the subject project. The new model (RIMP III) still estimates road
deterioration on the basis of a roughness-versus-age relationship, but
also introduces five categories of roads to explain changes in roughness not
related to age. The model, fully computerized, uses the percentage patching
required before the project begins as a measure of the original state of the
road and calculates the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return
(IRR) for each subproject, over a ten-year period.
5.02      Three different methods of analysis were used to carry out the
ex-post economic evaluation of the road maintenance civil works executed
under the project12/.
(a) RIMP III Computerized Deterioration Model
The first method made use of the 1982 RIMP III computerized
evaluation model giving the IRR and FYRR. However, one of the
components needed to operate this model was the percentage patching
required before the project. This component was known fully for
only six of the 38 roads studied; it is indicated with varying
degrees of confidence in 21 cases, and it could not be used in 11
cases;
12/ These civil works included 38 roads comprising 134 subsections.



- 16 -
(b) RIMP II Computerized Deterioration Model
The second method also made use of the 1982 RIMP III model, but
pavement deterioration was replaced by the RIMP II pavement
deterioration model to give the same indicators of NPV, IRR, and
FYRR; and
(c) Manual Calculation Using RIMP II Deterioration Model
Finally, about eight subprojects were reevaluated using the 1978
appraisal methodology and 1978 vehicle operating costs (VOC).
Except where explicitly stated, the ex-post evaluation was carried out using
actual economic costs13/, 1982 VOCs (Table 3) and Average Annual Daily
Traffic (AADT) estimated from 1982 surveys. The summary results are
presented in Table 4.
5.03      The results of the economic reevaluation confirm that investments
in road improvements under the project were fully justified. Using the 1978
deterioration model, 1Q82 traffic levels and 1982 VOCs, 37 out of the 38 road
improvements are shown to have expected economic rates of return above 12%,
many with estimated returns far above 50%. The 1982 deterioration model
gives lower returns, mainly because the "with project" roughnesses are set
higher under the RIMP III method than under the RIMP II version. The ranking
of projects remains virtually unchanged when the RIMP III model is applied.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      The Borrower's performance with respect to project implementation
was mixed. The Borrower was reasonably expeditious in addressing the day to
day problems of completing the civil works and equipment procurement included
in the project. However, the Borrower's achievements in relation to the
broader issues that the project intended to address fell short of Bank
expectations, in particular:
(a) Funding of maintenance operations reached only 40% of the level
agreed during appraisal, and the project had to be revised to
reduce the extent of the more costly overlay. The problem of
inadequate levels of funding is aggravated by the fact that funds
approved for a given fiscal year are released in an uneven manner,
disturbing the execution of planned activities. In general,
inadequate allocations of funds for the maintenance of the main
road network were the result of the Government's efforts to curtail
public outlays in all sectors. Poor planning and investment
priorities given on the basis of other than economic considerations
13/ Financial costs are presented in Annex 2, and the calculation of indices
to transform them into economic costs appear in Annex 3.



- 17 -
are also underlying causes of insufficient fundingL4;* The
reformulated project, however, was always properly funded.
(b)  Achievements in the area of road maintenance management, including
the reestablishment of the Hire Funding Scheme, were quite
limited. Although the Government seems committed to the
improvement of road maintenance operations, its intentions are
being translated into action very slowly.   The lack of agility in
the decision making process of the Ministry seems to be caused by
both an institutional inertia and the inefficiency inherent in an
excessive concentration of authority. The latter is mostly the
result of a serious shortage of personnel in mid-level positions in
MOC with the required qualifications. Therefore, HOC management
cannot delegate responsibilities and, occupied with the day-to-day
operation of the Ministry, postpones those decisions that do not
seem to have immediate hearing upon their activities or that
require the preparation and/or analysis of information for which
MOC does not have the necessary capability. The core of the
problem, uncompetitive civil service salaries, affects all
Ministries and is being addressed on a countrywide basis. As
committed under the Second Structiral Adjustment Loan (Loan
2315-JM), the Government is implementing a program of gradual
salary increases to benefit civil servants occupying professional
and technical positions. This measure is expected to improve HOC's
capability to strengthen its operations.
6.02      The following paragraphs discuss the Borrower's efforts to comply
with the Loan Agreement:
Section 4.03(a) obligated the Borrower to complete a study of its railway
system to identify the most economically viable transport system, and to
furnish to the Bank the findings and recommendations thereof for its comments
not later than October 31, 1980.
The Non-Urban Transport Study, carried out by Canadian consultants with
financing provided by Loan 1032-JM and the subject loan, included the
identification of measures needed to reduce the heavy burden caused by the
14/ MOC's 1983/84 budget provided J$ 25.8 million for a Rural Roads
Improvement Program aimed at arresting deterioration of tertiary roads
and increasing employment in depressed areas. Since the program was not
based on any economic analysis and the level of investment appeared high
in light of present allocations for maintenance of the main road
network, loan funds were provided for a pre-feasibility study. During
negotiations for Loan 2293-JM, the Bank and the Government agreed on the
economic criteria to be used for selecting subprojects to be included in
the Program. The size of the program was later substantially reduced.

deficit of JRC. The study, completed in 1982, gives several recommendations
to rationalize railway operations, including the closing of tneconomic
lines. As a followup to the study, JRC, with Bank financing under the
Technical Assistance Loan (Loan 2106-JM), engaged a financial expert who
reviewed the railway's financial management and pricing policies. The
Government is committed, under the Second Structural Adjustment Loan (Loan
2315-JM), to adopt a satisfactory financial plan including tariff increases
and closure of unecon...iic lines.
Section 4.06: "the Borrower shall cause the Transport Planning Unit of its
Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport (MPUT), acting jointly
with HOC and other agencies of the Borrower to: (a) prepare,
furnish to the Bank and commence, by November 30, 1979, the
execution of a plan of action, satisfactory to the Bank, to achieve
adequate permanent staffing of the said unit by June 30,
19380 ..........
Loan 1032-JM included US$120,000 for technical assistance in transport
planning to a Planning Unit that the Government intended to create. In 1977,
after about a delay of two years, the unit was established in MPUT and
started functioning on an ad hoc basis, with a staff comprising three or four
persons.  The staffing plan called for in the agreement was never prepared,
and, in early 1980, the Ministry formally notified the Bank that operation of
the unit had to be discontinued because of the financial situation of the
country. As an alternative use of funds, MPUT and the Bank agreed to use the
US$120,000 from Loan 1032-JM, as well as US$80,000 from Loan 1740-JM, to
finance the Non-Urban Transport Study. Because of the Limitations on public
investments in recent years, the lack of intermodal planning has not led to
any serious misallocation of resources. However, the Government recognizes
the need to improve its planning capabilities, and, to that end, a Road
Planning Unit has recently been established in MOC to plan and coordinate all
road construction and maintenance programs undertaken by that Ministry.
6.03      Section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement obligated the Borrower to:
(a) use the ROMGRAM system for planning and scheduling road maintenance works
and for budget preparation; (b) review the use of the DICS system and
thereafter develop and maintain a reporting system which can provide control
and planning data to MOC; and (c) establish a Fund into which all proceeds
generated by the Hire Funding Scheme would be paid and provide to the Fund
the necessary foreign exchange required for the purchase of spare parts and
replacement equipment. Efforts to comply with these obligations were
discussed in Chapter Ill.
6.04 Section 4.05: "the Borrower: (a) shall take all action necessary to
cause the dimensions and weights of vehicles using its Main Roads
to be kept within the limits provided by its laws and regulations;
and (b) shalL carry out a program satisfactory to the Bank to



- 19 -
enforce such laws and regulations and take all necessary measures
with a view toward ensuring that such laws and regulations shall,
where necessary, be revised accordingly."
The Government formulated, in late 1978, an Axle Load Program which included
changes in its existing regulations. The program was scheduled to be
completed in three phases during 1979-1982. There has been considerable
delay in the implementation of the program; legislative action related to
axle load limits and enforcement of axle load control measures was approved
by the Cabinet only in early 1982. Several other elements of the program
such as the purchase of additional weigh bridges and load meters, increase in
patrol strength, and carrying out of a road haulage study, have not yet been
implemented. During the negotiations of the ongoing Highway Maintenance
Project, assurances were obtained from the Government that it would continue
the implementation of its 1978 Axle Load Control Program.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank contributed significantly to project identification and
provided direct assistance to MOC in project preparation through financing
under Loan 899-JM. The project addressed priority needs in the road
subsector. Probably the only shortcoming in an otherwise well prepared
project was the overestimation of the capability of the local construction
industry. The industry was adversely affected by the Government's policy of
rationing foreign exchange, and it is not evident that such policy could have
been foreseen at appraisal.
7.02      The Bank showed the necessary flexibility when changes in the
financial constraints required changes in the size and scope of the project.
The Bank played an important role in redesigning the project, taking also
into consideration the limitations of the construction industry that by then
had become evident.
7.03      Although Bank staff, in the course of project supervision, noted
quality deficiencies, particularly regarding resealing works, requests for
tighter control resulted only in marginal improvements since basic elemeLts
to better quality, such as proper aggregate, equipment in good condition, and
adequate supervision, were not readily available. Those deficiencies,
however, have been addressed under the ongoing Highway Maintenance Project,
through the Government's commitment to assistance to the quarry and
contracting industry, training, and the engagement of three engineers for
field supervision.
7.04      The Bank has drawn the attention of MOC to several key issues,
even though timely decisions were not always forthcoming as a consequence.



- 20 -
Such is the case of the slow progress in the reestablishment of the Hire
Funding Scheme and the implementation of the Axle Weight Control Program,
which are being addressed in the subsequent Road Maintenance Project. In
addition, the Bank had an accive participation in the efforts toward
rationalizing investments in the subsector. When the Government included
substantial funds in its Public Investment Program for a Rural Road
Improvement Program, the Bank allocated loan funds to evaluate its possible
merits and agreed with the Government on subproject selection criteria based
upon an economic rationale.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The Fourth Highway Project was successful in meeting its main
objective of helping to arrest the deterioration of the main road network in
Jamaica. Although improvements in related MOC organizational matters have
only partially been achieved, the project had an important catalytic role
since, during its execution, it was possible to identify the main problems
upon which the follow-on Road Maintenance Project should focus.
8.02      The major lesson which can be learned concerns project concept and
design. Most of the project success is attributable to careful project
preparation, which included a detailed program of periodic maintenance
activities to be carried out on specific road sections, but with enough
flexibility to adapt the program to changing circumstances.
8.03      A second lesson which can be learned concerns the difficulty in
achieving improvements in the road maintenance organization when
uncompetitive civil service salaries hamper the adequate staffing of
Government agencies. This problem lies outside the authority of a single
ministry such as MOC, but has been the core problem wnich limited the impact
of the project. Although provisions exist in the system to top-up salaries
of key personnel 15/, this does not represent a long-term solution and
cannot he considered as a substitute for proper financial and non-financial
career incentives. This is a matter best dealt with in a country context,
and not in the framework of individual project lending. In the case of
Jamaica, the Government has recognized the shortcomings inherent in a
non-competitive public salary structure and is adopting measures to address
the issue.
15/ They are currently being used to increase salaries of key staff involved
in the implementation of the ongoing Road Maintenance Project.
