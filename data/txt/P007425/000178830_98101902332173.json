     prevent further deterioration of the 3,000 mile road network\n            under MOW responsibility. It aims to do this through\n            improving the standards of road and equipment maintenance\n            operations and management. The project includes the\n            following principal components: asphaltic concrete overlay\n            of about 76 miles of primary and main secondary roads;\n            asphaltic resealing of about 253 miles of arterial,\n            secondary and tertiary roads; equipment replacement and\n            overhaul; and about 150 man-months of technical assistance\n            to aid the MOW in the implementation of its maintenance\n            program and the Ministry of Public Utilities and\n            Transportation (MPUT) in a study of the viability of the\n            railway system. Major project benefits include vehicle\n            operating cost savings through improved road conditions and\n            reduction in annual maintenance costs. There are about 200\n            miles of resealing of tertiary roads that are principally\n            farm-to-market roads, within the 253 miles of asphaltic\n            resealing included in the project. Small farmers who use\n            these roads will benefit from the reduced cost of\n            transporting agricultural produce to market and bringing in\n            supplies. It is estimated that the direct incremental\n            employment generation of the project would entail about\n            1,600 jobs."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
