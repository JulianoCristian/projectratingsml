The Bank's performance was\n            somewhat unsatisfactory in the identification phase,\n            satisfactory in the preparation and appraisal phases, and\n            highly successful during the three years of implementation.\n            The Borrower's performance was satisfactory in project\n            identification, preparation, appraisal, and covenant\n            compliance. The Borrower's performance during project\n            implementation was also satisfactory although there were\n            some weaknesses in project coordination. All initially\n            planned studies were completed and procedures for allocating\n            available funds for investment and maintenance in line with\n            economic criteria were developed. The key lesson learned\n            from the implementation of the project are: In order to\n            ensure the quality of studies and the efficiency of\n            training, activities must take place within a comprehensive\n            manpower development strategy, and trained staff must be\n            evaluated through an agreed upon mechanism."}, "docdt": "1997-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
