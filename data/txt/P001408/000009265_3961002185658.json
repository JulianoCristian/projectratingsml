Infrastructure Engineering Project is to increase the\n            economic benefits derived from infrastructure investments in\n            the roads, urban water and sewerage, and public buildings\n            sectors.  The project will comprise of the following\n            components: (1) the roads component, which will strengthen\n            the capacity to plan, construct and maintain Lesotho's\n            road network; (2) the water and sewerage component, which\n            will reinforce the ability to meet customer demand for water\n            and sewerage services, particularly in the Maseru urban\n            area; (3) the public buildings component, which will develop\n            the capacity to maintain public buildings by developing\n            maintenance assessment, engineering studies for\n            rehabilitation, and restoration of selected public\n            buildings.  In addition to these three components, the\n            project will provide technical assistance for project\n            management and accounting."}, "docdt": "1992-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
