                         The project is implemented by the Project Management Unit (PMU) established by the School Education Department (SED) of Balochistan. The project got off to a slow start due to
                         some initial problems in setting up of a project account and finalization of staffing at PMU, but project activities are now on track and the PMU team is finalizing key administrative and
                         procurement tasks to begin implementation of construction, rehabilitation of schools and capacity building of PTSMCs linked to these schools. Additionally, the baseline survey of 578
                         shelter less schools in the 12 districts has been successfully completed, the government is now prioritizing the first cohort of schools to be constructed based on the established
                         criteria of enrollment and functionality.

                         Disbursements are expected to pick after the finalization of key procurements of the design and supervision construction firm and the capacity building firm.
