                         wider sector). District Focal Persons (DFPs) have been notified in each district to assist the PGEB Project Management Unit (PMU) in day to day implementation processes, data
                         collection, reporting and coordination between the schools, district education office, PTSMCs, community and the consultancy firms. This arrangement ensures that a member of

                         Progress towards the achievement of the PDO is assessed to be moderately satisfactory based on implementation progress thus far but a detailed assessment of the outcome
                         indicators will be done once this data is available. A Third Party Validation (TPV) Firm is planned to be hired through the World Bank MDTF Secretariat to monitor project progress to
                         support the task team's supervision work.
