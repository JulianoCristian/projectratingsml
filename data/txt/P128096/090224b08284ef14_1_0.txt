                         Department and Project Management Unit (PMU) for the new schools in 12 districts, candidates degrees were also verified through proper channels, however the selected teachers
                         have not initiated their teaching tasks in the new schools. Although recruitment of teachers is finalized, their placement in new schools is delayed. This is creating apprehension
                         amongst the recruited teachers as well as in the communities. This issue needs to be resolved urgently to ensure timely completion of Component C activities agreed under the
