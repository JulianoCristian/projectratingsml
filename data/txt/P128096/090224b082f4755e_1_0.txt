Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The overall progress in meeting the project development objective and implementation progress is rated as Satisfactory, the Government has
 made steady progress to finalize all activities under the project. Active dialogue with communities has been done to resolve issues at some selected
 school sites. However, a few sites have had to be abandoned before completion. The rating for both the PDO and implementation progress were
 upgraded to highly satisfactory and satisfactory, as government has been able to significantly improve the pace of project progress and finalize the
 teacher recruitment for the new schools, thereby significantly improving the enrollment in schools. Monitoring of existing schools and an oversight by the
 school management comittees has increased children's participation in existing schools.
 The success of the test based teacher recruitment has resulted in a province wide adoption of testing for teacher recruitment, this is a very important
 reform to ensure entry of qualified teachers in the system on merit.
 The PMU has successfully monitored the construction activities and uploaded the progress on its website for wider sharing.

               It was expected that 2 teachers per school would be hired under component C (150 schools). However the teacher recruitment target
               remains slightly below the agreed final target. This is because of a) 7 schools out of 150 not becoming functional because of community
               conflict or security issues. Some schools only have a single teacher at this time as some teachers could not join due to personal reasons.
               However, all 143 schools have at least 1 teacher at the minimum.

               Although the schools became functional late in the life of the project due to delays in teacher recruitment, however these schools have been
               very well received by communities that had reportedly been submitting a demand for schools to the Education department for the past many
               years.

               A system was established to monitor the schools using a combination of PMU staff at the provincial level and district education offices.
               Additionally, the firm providing design and supervision support for construction related activities conducted regular visits to school sites. A
               website is maintained by the project and school progress is uploaded on the website.
