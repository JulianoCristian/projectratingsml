will contribute to the Government's growth\n            promoting fiscal program, while external resources will\n            reinforce the country's foreign reserve position, and\n            underpin nominal exchange rate stability. Disbursements will\n            be on the basis of satisfactory progress in the public\n            sector management program, measured by actions improving the\n            Government's institutional capacity, and incentives to\n            deliver quality public services, as well as on the continued\n            sound overall macroeconomic management. While the project\n            will contribute in maintaining a stronger financial position\n            to face economic, and political shocks, the continuing\n            uncertainty in the Middle East could risk implementation of\n            programs as described above. However, Jordan's past\n            record demonstrates its strong, and sound economic, and\n            political performance which far outweighs those risks.\n            Moreover, the inherent long-term and comprehensive nature of\n            public sector reforms, entails a slow implementation, whose\n            fragmentation may jeopardize its coherency. Nonetheless, the\n            appointment of an inter-ministerial steering committee, and\n            the continued dialogue with the Bank, as well as other\n            external partners, suggests the latter risk is manageable."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
