satisfactory;\n            sustainability is likely. The overall performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower are graded satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included the following: 1) Programmatic lending\n            serves as a useful vehicle for economy-wide reforms. This\n            instrument is particularly advantageous in structuring\n            complex dialogue dealing with the whole government (and\n            therefore across sectors), and in encouraging meaningful and\n            precise progress over a well-defined time frame. Overcoming\n            roadblocks, however, requires a frank and lucid evaluation\n            of the Bank-country relationship-specifically, expectations\n            of the durability and outcomes of the reform beyond the\n            years considered under the program. 2) It is essential to\n            develop monitoring and evaluation capacity-for evaluating\n            both the progress of policies and programs underpinning the\n            entire reform program. 3) A major part of the\n            Government's analytical work (and Bank's Economic\n            and Sector work) should focus on developing a\n            performance-oriented budgeting system with a view to\n            improving the efficiency of public expenditure management.\n            4) Public Sector Reform Loans (PSRLs) are being implemented\n            by several ministries and agencies, and requires overall\n            coordination and monitoring. Here, coordination does not\n            mean \"command and control,\" rather ensuring\n            long-term complementarity among the various components of\n            the program. In this context, there is a need for creating a\n            working group under the present inter-ministerial\n            coordinating committee. This working group should be\n            concerned with more than just monitoring and reporting; it\n            should assure that the content of the various measures are\n            aligned from the outset. Lastly, this working group should\n            also be instrumental in setting up a process that allows the\n            sharing and exchange of information and ideas. 5) For the\n            program to achieve a substantive institutional development\n            impact, it is important to interlink the various components\n            of the program. To date, most of the progress has been\n            achieved through pursuing parallel tracks. Now the reform\n            program needs to focus on integrating the various elements\n            (e.g., costing of government services, simplifying\n            procedures, establishing a judicial information network). 6)\n            PSRLs require a shift from an approach that focuses mostly\n            on lending toward one that emphasizes policy dialogue\n            underpinned by economic and sector work."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
