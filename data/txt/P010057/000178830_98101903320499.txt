vi.       Transport coordination is still in the early stages of develor,piicr
but the probiems are understood and the appropriate Government agencies; hav-e
been established to deal with them. Highway Loan No. 578-PAK dated Decemb_ .
20, 1968 rakes provision for the financing of the foreign exchange cost oI
a transpor-t coordination study in West Pakistan. So far there has been
little progress in selecting suitable consultants for the purpose. The Balk
is concerned by this lack of progress and is maintaining close liaison wit.
the Government to accelerate appointments. An important aspect of transper-
coordination for PMR is the identification and quantification of uneconomic
services so as to make the best use of investment and to determine future
policies and services in conjunction with the Government. To this end., and
to ensure the close exchange of information with the Government, PWR i,
strengthening its Railway Planning Cell set up as a requirement of the
previous Bank loan (496-PAK).
vii.      The financial position of PWR has declined slightly in recent,
years but it still operates at a profit; in 1967/68 the return on net fixef
assets is estimated to have been about 6.1%. PWR will continue to maintair
a satisfactory operating ratio of about 82, improving to 80 at the conclusi:tr
of the Project, and will generate sufficient funds to meet its debt service
and working capital requirements.
viii.     Accounting procedures relating to fixed assets and foreign loans
are not in accordance with modern practice. A conmdittee is to be appointed
by the Government to examine these procedures and to make recommendations.
ix.       PWR is comDetent. with the assistance of consultants to be finance"'
under the proposed loan, to carry out the Project, which is scheduled for
completion by mid-1972.  All Bank-financed items would be nrocured thnrugh
international competitive bidding.
x.        Savings from track improvements (comprising 35% of the total
Project cost) and from line 1 annni+'y works (rinrn1inc, ), o' the cost? are
conservatively estimated to yield economic rates of return of 9% and 20%

SU414ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report. appraises a project for financing the foreian
exchange requirements of high priority items in the Pakistan Western
Rj1iw,qvIs (PWP) T.hirA WTve a P     (10A[%/I A  1°40/7A)) for wth4  a
Bank loan of USt 14.5 million equivalent is proposed.
ii.       All forms of transport, from camel train to jet aircraft, are
represented in Ile-St pawds+ar. -d although road- 4tr=Isport is iceig
the railways are still the principal means of mechanized land transport,
pk-+i----ary ;n   . se.rrs,S Vthe- 1heav V  %fi V corridor bjeuween TV-Test IPacL-st'ans
only port of Karachi and its economic heartland centered in Lahore. This
route of 750 m,les is ideally suited for long hal rail operaion, and -the
development of an efficient, coordinated transport system for West Pakistan
requires that PW4 be supportied in. im-proving its vperaton5 particularl_
over this route.
iii.      The proposed Project will enable PWR to carry out works and
c.utWOLuiO  studies that are urgently required for the improvement of its
efficiency. The Project provides principally for track renewal and
strengthening and for line capacity works (signalling, telecommunications,
additional crossing stations, increasing crossing loop lengths and
remodelling and enlarging yards) which are necessary for improvIng operations
on the main Karachi/Lahore line. The Project also provides for consult:Lng
services to improve management and traffic operations and to continue the
modernization of MR's accounting system.
iv.       The estimated cost of the Project is Rs 118.1 million (US$ 24.8
mivllion equivalent) with a foreign exchange content of US$ 14.5 million
equivalent (58%) which the proposed loan would finance. PIJ's Third Five-
Year Plan (1965/66 - 1969/70), of which the Project is part, is estimated
to cost Rs 1,h03 miLllion (US$ 295 million equivalent) with a total foreLgn
exchange composition of Rs 725 million (US$ 152 million equivalent). Total
Bank Group financing towards this Plan would amount to some US$ 55.0 mi:Llion
(Credit 57-PAK, Loan 496-PAK, the proposed loan and a small carryover from
previous lending), the balance of US$ 97.0 million of foreign exchange being
found from bilateral sources, principally USAID, UK and the Federal Republic
of Germany.
v.        Altogether five Bank loans and one DA credit, totalling US$ :107.75
million, have been made for PWR. Performance has generally been satisfactory,
although progress in planning and operation under the last Loan No. 496.-PAK
for US$ 13.5 million equivalent, made in 1967, has been slow. Other Bank
Group lending for the transport sector in West Pakistan has included two
credits and one loan for highways (US$ 53 million), two loans for Karachi
Port (US$ 32 million), and a credit for the purchase of commercial vehicles
(US$ 25 million).



PAKISTAN WESTERN RAILWAY
APPRAINAL OF NrhTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1. D   CTRCDUCTION
1.01    The Government of Pakistan and Pakistan Western Railway (PW,UR) have
asked the Bank for a loan of US$ 1h.5 million equivalent to finance part of
the foreign exchange requirements of the remaining items in PWR's Third Five-
Year Plan (1965/66-69/70).
1.02    The Government has received to date five Bank loans and one IDA credit
to assist ini the rehabilitation of equipment and the development of railway
services. The first three loans (all made in the 1950's) were joint loans
for Pakistan Eastern and Western Railways, of which PWR's share was about,
US$ 51 million equivalent. The fourth loan, for US9$ 18.25 million equivalent
(No. 320-PAK), was made in 1962 for PWR exclusively, following the division
of the railway into two separate provincial administrations.  These four loans
have been fully disbursed. In 196L the Government received for PWR an IDA
credit (No. 57-PAK) of US$ 25 million eauivalent. which is also fully
disbursed.  In May 1967 a further loan (No. 496-PAK) of US$ 13.5 million
ecuivalent ras made.
].Mf    Prerions Rank/MA finanned nroiects have generallv been satisfactorilv
completed. The project under Loan 496-PAK is under way but progress has been
slow in  ertain planning an.d operational qqnsPrts which are discussed in this
report (para. 4.04).
1.04    Other loans/credits for the transport sector in West Pakistan have
4tnc-uded thr.ee for high, ays, two for Karachi Port, a  one "or +-he p
of comrierc ial vehicles.
2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01    The Province of West Pakistan covers a land area of about 310,000'
square milees, oer    a h- J tim4-es that of France. IT consists manly of' a
flat plain stretching from the foothills of the Himalayas in the northeast to
ILth AaiLcU.LnL1 Sea in the souinvweste. Thle ,1in.L& iLrAbitJe aLrAs are a arach4 i
and in the center and north of the Province. It is crossed by five great
rivers, the DIdus, 11helum, Chenab, LayV ard SutleJ which, after their
confluence, flow as the Indus southwestwards to the sea. These rivers
occasionally overfilow their banks and the floOws ca-use beriOUS interruptions
to transport.
2.02    The Province has a population of about 58 million people, 75% of
whom live in rural areas.  Some 5>0 of the 13.5 million urban dwellers live
in the five principal cities of Rawalpindi, Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore and
Lyallpur. The population is beMlieved to be increasing at the rate of 2.6
to 3.0% per year; the increase in urban areas is at an above-average rate
because of migration from the countryside.

The main industries are centered in or around Karachi, Hyderabad, Multan.,
~allp  ni Laoeadu.,piecto              extiles, c.,rt sugar, ce,c:
fertilizers and leather goods.
2.04      Average alnual income per head in West Pakistan was estimated
au aout Usp 122 in J  u1g/QQ.  Gross national product is 3hcrea3ing at a
rate of 4.7% per year but  in view of the population increase, the growth
in GPiur per head is between i.5 to 2% per year.  Tne economic si uation in
Pakistan has been reviewed extensively in recent Bank reports -.
B. The Transport Sector
2.05      A'll transport modes, ranging from camel train to jet aircraft,
are represented in West Pakistan. The main traffic flows serve the thickily
populated area in the northeast centered on Lahore. This area generates
flows southw,est to the port and industrial area of Karachi some 700 miles
away; west bo the industrial and agricultural areas around Lyallpur,
Sargodha, and Khushab; and northwest to the administrative centers in
Rawalpindi and Islamabad, and to Peshawar and the Afghan border beyond.
All these main routes are served by rail, road, and air transport.
2.06      PWR is Government-owned and operated, and constitutes one of the
largest and most important organizations in the Province. For many years the
railways provided the main means of mechanized transport; recently an
increasing proportion of transport has been carried by road, and railway
traffic has shown little overall growth.
2.07      Transport by road is provided by a wide variety of means.  Animnal-
drawn traffic is widely used, particularly in agricultural areas.  Motorized
transport has doubled in the last ten years.  Bus services are provided
both by private and by Government-owuned firms: the carriage of goods is
almost entirely in private hands. The overall condition of the road system
is poor; the length is about 30,000 miles of which about 10,000 miles are
paved and about 8,000 miles shingle or brick surfaced. Motorized traffic
as a whole is growing at about 10% a year. but buses at only 3% Der year.
The growth of the bus fleet is probably inhibited by the control of fare.s
and the restrictive 1incensin npolinv (.e nrrn- I-08)_ High ut.i-7zt.ion
o Jr .t s9  - - - E- ,_ _-
rates are achieved, sometimes in association with over-loading and inadequate
regard for safety=
2.08      West Pakistan is served by onre major port, Karachi- which hanrdles
the bulk of its foreign trade. The total of imports and exports has grown
fromiT 5.8 millon tonrs in 1963/641  to 8.7 m4114ion tons in. 1967/68A  The port
is heavily used with a berth occupancy factor of 125% (which is possible by
double banVing of ships).    - Each of the 19 deep-water be-ths handles an
average 306,000 tons of dry cargo per year.  Karachi Port is efficiently

from 198,000 in 1962/63 to about 324,000 in 1966/67, an average annual gro!itth
rate of 13.l%o  Load factors and efficiency are high by any standard. Ptl-
operates profitably.
3. TRANSPORT COORDINATION
3,01      The provision of transport services in West Pakistan is controlled
partly by market forces and partly by Governmental decisions.   The inf:Luence
of Government is exercised through:
(i) allocation of investments,
(ii) control of rates and fares,
(iii) regulation of operations,
(iv) taxation policies, and
(v) import policies.
(i) Allocation of Investments
3.02      Decisions on allocation of investment funds to transport are made
at two levels. Central and Provi nnial- Control by the Central Government
is exercised through (a) the Planning Commission which has to approve
nroieots i n the Fivp-Ypqr Plan, and (b) the National Economic Council which
must also give administrative approval to the implementation of any scheme

the Trans:port Planning Cell which was set up in 1967 to supply it with the

been made on railway than on road studies.
(ii) Control of Rates and Fares
3.04      The Provincial Government controls maximum railway tariffs and
all fares on buses. Freight rates for road transport are determined by
competition. Rail freight rates are designed to cover costs directly
related to the movement of traffic with the maxima fixed by "'what the tra.r.:i.
will bear".  However, some traffic (for example, fertilizer and export chr,-,eo
ore) is carried at rates which may not cover direct costs. FWR tariffs are
inflexible.  Neither freight rates nor passenger fares take account of th-
considerable variations in demand that occur between main and branch li.n.s
and between different seasons of the year.



(iii) Regulation of Operations
3.o5      YWR provides various defense and social services at rates
which are unrPinunerativP.  The dpeline in the finannial position of PWR
(para. 6.08) has emphasized the necessity of clarifying its obligations.
3.06      The functions of the PWR Board are set out in President's Order

explained that while it is the Board's responsibility to "act on business
the Board to act otherwise. It was therefore agreed that PWR would not

statements of PWR. It was further agreed that the Board should be concerned
Ci)   maint ainig and expandling patLicular railway ser-vIcub
to the extent that the revenues generated by them
meet at least their avoidable costs, and
(ii)  charging rates and fares designed to maximize the use
of the railway system subject to the total revenue
earned being sufficient to meet the expenses specified
in paragraph 6.22,
3.07      The Central Government is concerned that the autonomous agencies
in Pakistanis transport and communications sector be given "adequate
authority over day-to-day operations and that the Government's authority
be limited to a few well defined areas such as approval of the projects and
investment programs, 1he need for Government subsidies and the appointment
of top management". y     Assurances were obtained from the Government that
AIR will be given effective authority to carry out its functions and that
Government authority will be limited to matters of general policy such -as
quoted above.
3.08      There is no regulation of the movement of goods by truck, but the
movement of passengers by bus is subject to route permits issued by the
Ministry of Transport. One of the conditions of Highway Loan 578-PAK
(para. 3.11) was that the bus licensing system would be examined by
consultants. So far the Government has appointed a commission to examile
the permit system and has announced that in the meantime no new permits
are to be issued. The Bank has reaffirmed to the Central Government that
the appointment of the commission does not relieve it of the obligation to
have the subJect studied by consultants.

By and large, tax payments by road users substantially exceed the expendi1tnrx
on the road system, and wo-lOd exceed it eveU ifVal a'   I-med items (including
fuel) were priced at a reasonable "shadow" exchange rate. While railwazys
pay tax on fuel, their tax payments are more than compensated for by the
favorable rates (h%-5%) at which they are allowed to borrow from the
Government (Annex 1). The question of taxation policies for road and rail
transport was one of the items included for examination in the transport
coordination study to be carried out under Hignway Loan 578PoAK (see patra.
3.11).
(v)  Import Policies
3.10      The Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Central Government is
responsib:Le for determining the exchange rate at which any type of import
can be purchased.  The most favorable rate is the official one of Rs 4.76
to the US$. The least favorable requires the purchase of "bonus vouchers"
on the open market at a price that results in an effective exchange rate
of Rs 12-L3 to the US$. Prior to July 1, 1968 railway equipment was
imported at the official rate while motor vehicles and spare parts were
obtainable only by the purchase of bonus vouchers for the full requirementsO
Since July 1, 1968 PWR, in common with other statutory bodies, has been
required to purchase its foreign exchange at the "cash cum bonus" rate
which is equivalent to Rs 8-9 = US$ 1 (para. 6.18). This question was
also included for examination in the transport coordination study.
Transport Coordination Study
3.11      A consistent policy of transport coordination has not yet been
developed in Pakistan. The Central Government is concerned about the
situation,L/ and allocated funds out of its 1968/69 budget for a detailed
transnort coordination studv to review the existine transport policies in
both Provinces. The Bank made provision in Highway Loan 578-PAK of
Decpmber 1968 for financing the foreign exchange nosts of the West Pa1dLstan
study but there has been little progress so far in selecting suitable
consff tat1s. +he 1Rmm¶ n k hams e.-rnrrewssn c eat t.hp lack of nprogress adul

4. PAKISTAN WtSTERN RAriwAY
A. Organization and Management
4.01      MIR is administered as a Department of the West Pakistan Provincial
Go-vernmrent anrd is headed by a four-man Board. The Chairman of the Board is,
ex-officio, a Secretary to the West Pakistan Government; he is formally
responsible to the Provincial Minister of Communications, Roads and Works,
but cannot be overruled except by reference to the Governor of the Province.
The Chairman can overrule the other Board members except that on financial
matters the finance member can ask for reference to the Finance Minister.
Tne Chairman must be appointed from the Board members who are railway
officers (normally of long service) representing the operating and engineering
departments of PwR. The Central Government retains powers to issue directions
to the Provincial Government on policy and other matters and, in particular,
regarding defense traffic and closures of railway lines. A Railway Comris-
sioner at the Central Government has liaison and inspection functions.
L.02      The Board, and particularly the Vice Chairman, directs the day-to-
day operations. There are two advisory committees, representing railway
users, one at Karachi and one at Lahore. The Provincial Government approves
the revenue and capital budgets, the appointment of senior officers, salary
scales and maximum tariff levels. It also finances capital expenditures on
additions included in PWm's investment program (para. 6.02).
4.03      The Board and management of PNiR are experienced and conscientious
and keep up to date in many technical fields. The Board recognizes, however,
that changes are also taking place in the field of management and that
benefits could accrue at many levels of PMR's operations through the
application of new management techniques. PWR has accordingly asked the
Bank to finance the appointment of management consultants, and provision
for this purpose is included in the proposed loan (Annex 2).
4.04      As agreed under Loan 496-PAK, a Railway Planning Cell has been
set up to assist the Board in investment. policies and transnort coordinationO
However (1) the staffing has been weak in number and quality, (2) the program
of studies has been nrooressing slowly, (3) the Board has not been maki-ng
full use of the Cell, and (4) the liaison with the Provincial Government has
not heen effective. PWR is now taking st-eps to strengt-hen the Railw.any
Planning Cell so as to improve its liaison with the Provincial Government
PIanning and nevelopment Dnepartment and to make it more effective for fore-
casting, assessing uneconomic services, and preparing investment plans.
B. Railway Property
4.05      PAR consists of 5383 route miles, 88% broad gauge (1.676 m; 5965"J)
an"d the rest narrow gauges (e  Ma      m.d Tabl  1)  T   r-4 .ance is
good and track material standards (detailed in Annex 5) are reasonable for
the present and future gross t-onnages and axle loads carried. There is a
continuing program of renewing and improving the track and bridges; this
program is genera±Ly well planned but there are current excess stocks of



- 7 -
m.aterial which PMr has underta-en to reduce through a revised relaying
program and closer annual reviews. During negotiations PWR also undertook
that on branch lirnes where future operations may not be justified (para&.14,i`)
expenditure would be kept to a bare mininmim consistent with safety.
4.06      Details of the present locomotive fleet are given in Tables 2,
3 and 4. Locomotives are well maintained. The stock of passenger coaches
and freight wagons has increased markedly during the last 5 years. Provisi-on
of new un:Lts is, however, now related only to replacements which is reasona'1o
in view of the operational and traffic situations (sections 4D and E).
Coaches and wagons are well maintained.
4.07     lNo detailed maintenance costs are kept by PWR for locomotives
and rolling stock, only average figures. Greater detail is required for
traffic costing and management purposes and it has been agreed that these
should be developed by PWR.
C. Manpower and Wages
4.08      PN4R had 135,000 employees on June 30, 1968, 1,600 less than a
year before but about 9,000 more than in 1963 and about 21,000 more than
in 1955. The present figure is equivalent to 25 men per route mile which
is high. The totals include staff employed on manufacturing and developmexit
activities and, if these are excluded, the total at mid-1968 reduces to
about 128,000 which is still high. The number of traffic units (ton miles
plus pass-miles)  per emDloyee in 1967/68 was 83,o0o0  a decline from three
years earlier when it was 36,000; both figures are low but comparable Ewith
some other railways in Asia and Africa (India, 98_,000! CGvlon. 68000!; East
Africa, 79,000; Sudan, 70,000). The Board is now applying a policy of
reducing its staff bv limiting replacements.
L.09      Wages and salarv scales (related to those of the Government) are
low and thus, in spite of the large staff total, wages and salaries repreFcr!w
a reasonatble level of L66% of operating expenses (includinmg depreciation).
There are two registered and recognized railway labor unions. Industrial
courts deal with disnputes i n a satisfactory manner.
D. Operations
4I.1      nperating and rolling Stock stavistics for t4he yeairs /    to

u ring the last quarter of 196l/o6  wagon miles per day per wagon in fleet
averaged 37.8 while the hours per day per diesel locomotive available
averaged l,>9.
4.13      Freight trains are operated as and when possible between passenger
trains which are given preference, although in 1967/68 freight provided 5La
of FWR revenue.   The poor overall performance of freight trains is
reflected in the system performance figures: the slow average speed
(8.2 mph for steam and 11.3 mph for diesel traction), the declining wagon
turn round. time, and the poor performance with freight diesel locomotives
(127 miles per day - Table 7). The improvement of freight operations is
of particular importance on the heaviest used portion of the system, the
758 mile long main line Karachi/Lahore which is well suited to railway
operations (Annex 3). In future FWR should be increasingly concerned with
freight operations and with long distance bulk traffic in particular,
because passenger traffic (with an average journey of about 50 miles) is
likely to divert increasingly to road transport with the improvement of
highways and bus services.
4.14      FWR is aware that there is a problem and has decided as part of
an integrated plan (1) that no additional passenger services should be
provided on. the heavily used routes; (2) that a new mechanical marshalling
yard should be built at Samasata on the main line between Karachi and Lahore;
(3) that marshallins reauirements for Lahore should receive intensive
departmental study; and (4) that provision should be included in the Fourth
Five-Year Plan (1970/71-197h/7q) for a new marshaTling vard at Karachi.
PWR recognizes that these proposals in themselves do not go far enough and
that thyv mniit hp Pynminr-d and din1+. wit+h i-n +.ha rern+.yt+. nf onnprt.innq qs

position after the delivery in 1969/70 of the additional units (65 diesel
and 29 electric) aiready financed is given in Annex 4 which shows that,
taking traffic at the 1967/68 level, and assuming that diesel locomotive
miles per day on freight trains were improved by 5W0 (which given other
related improvements should be feasible), it should be possible, without
Duying more locomotives, to eliminate all steam units from main and branch
line traction and to retain steam only for shunting and departmental duties.
During negotiations it was agreed that pari passu with other operation.al
studies PIR would carry out and complete by not later than June 30, 1570,
a comprehensive study of the possibilities and future timing of eliminatJsi.
steam tra.ction in two stages, (1) passenger and freight services and (2)
shunting and departmental services.
E. Traf'ic Trends
4.17      During the First Five-Year Plan (1955/56-1959/60) traffic on.
HER increased substantially, pass--miles and freight ton miles at average
annual rates of 6.1% and 7.5% respectively. During the Second Five-Year
Plan (1960/61-1964/65) the annual growth rates fell to 2.3% and 5.3%
respectively; and for the period of the Third Five-Year Plan (1965/66-
1969/70) to date, both passenger and freight traffics have remained
virtually stable at about 6.3 billion pass -miles and about 4.9 billion
ton miles. Brief particulars are given below (see Table 5 for additional
details f'or the years 1958/59-1967/68):

4.!o      The recent 'levelling in hraibsic growvh has been due in   4 4rt
the declining freight service and operating performance (paras. 4.13 and
4.14) and in part to changes in the pattern of transportation in 1Wesv
Pakistan. Road transport competition has grown for passengers and for
freight despite licensing restriction on the former. Tne length of the
PWR average! passenger journey has remained static at about 50 miles since
1958 although considerable improvements have been made to the longer
distance seirvices. The average length of freight haul has increased from
271 miles in 1955/56 to 336 miles in 196b/65, and 346 miles in 1967/68,
as a result of the loss of short haul traffic to road transport. Road
transport has also been increasing its share of long haul traffic,
particularly carrying freight where quick delivery is required, for example
on the trunk route from Karachi to Multan (petroleum products) and from
Karachi to Lahore (general goods). Principal commodities carried by PER
are given in Table 8, which shows the recent decline of petroleum products
and iron and steel (including machinery). A petroleum pipeline from Karachi
to Multan is at present being studied and its effect on PWR's traffic could
be considerable if built. Stone and ballast have also declined considerably
but this is due to the completion of some of the Indus Basin works.
4.19      PWR is now carrying out (in accordance with a directive of the
Provincial Government) annual reviews of traffic estimates. According to
the latest forecasts PWR anticipates annual growth rates of about 2.5%
for nasseneer traffin and 3=5%~ for freight traffic.  These estimates
reflect the growth of the Pakistan economr and are acceptable as a basis
for planning over the nex+ five years provided that measures for planning
and operational improvements to relieve congestion, particularly on the
main +.wik route betTJee Karachi      T hr-ore ar  i mnl j m1nted as a matter

5.o8      Workshop equipment is required to continue the rehabilitation of
old workshops and depots and for the extension of the local manufacture of
spares resulting in savings in cost, time and foreign exchange.
5.09      The consulting services are (a) to improve management, (b) to mi-
prove traffic, operations, and (c) to continue the modernization of the ac--
counting system (para. 6.04).  Draft outline terms of reference for (a) and
(b) were agreed during negotiations and are given in Annex 2.   Annex 6 gives
information about the accounting consultancy services.
C. Executiorn of the Project and Procurement
5.10      PWR is comr)etent to carry out the project.  Cost estimates are
reasonable and a contingency allowance of about L> has been added to cover
possible variation in prices of world steel, the main component of the pro-
ject, due to increasing labor costs in industrialized countries. Local cost
estimates are based on experience of recent similar work carried out by
PWR; althoughi wage rates have been stable for five years, a contingency
allowance of 10% has been added to local cost figures to cover possible
wage increases during the period of the project.
5.11      A1L foreimn exchange project items will be procured through inter-
national oomnetitive bidding in accordance with the procedures of the Banlc.
The main itens would be track and bridge material: about 13.000 tons of
rail, 450,000 timber sleepers, point and crossing sets, material for con-
crete sleeners. track comnonents. 1,600 tons fabricated bridge steelwork.

Disbursement of loan funds will cover the c.i.f. cost of imported materials
and equipment by P411 for the items to be inciuded in the allocation oI pro-
ceeds.  Disbursements are expected to be completed by end 1972.
5.14      If there are any savings on the Bank financed items of the Prcject,,
it is proposed that they be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of
additional but similar Project items, subject to review and agreement with
the Bank at the time and, where applicable, to the recommendations of the
consultants to help PWR improve its performance.
6. FINANCES AND EARNINGS
A. Accounts
6.01      The Railway's accounts are those of a Government department and.
as now constituted, show the origin and use of public funds. The capital
and operating budgets are submitted to the Provincial legislature for ap-
proval.
6.02      The terms on which development funds are made available to PWR
are summarized below:
(a) Additional Capital Investment
(N)  Tloal currency funds are orovided bv Government and
added to P!R capital-at-charge.
(ii)  Government obtains foreign loans which are added to
FIR capital-atcharge as and ubhen repavments of the
loans are made by Government. Prior to repayment or
these loar.s PTJP rtiml- rss annnl21  to f-.+ lrP-rrrmnt t.e
full cost of interest charges on the loai's.  RJR .s
n.o requrerl to repay these loans.

(iii) Interest on capital-at-charge is payable by FWR to
the Government at         i p.a. on capital provided up to
June 30, 1965 and at 55' p.a. on capital provided
thereafter.
(b) Capital Expenditure on Replacements
Funds required for expenditure on replacements are
found 'oy PWR from annual appropriations of its re-
venues to Depreciation Reserve F.n.d (DRF). These
-appropriations are to cover:
(i)   the local currency cost of replacements and
(ii) repayments of foreign loans for replacements.
6.03      All proposals for capital expenditure (whether for additions or
for replarements)  - submitted to Govem-ent fo r autho0rLzatlor..  The present
practice is for Government to provide all funds for additions and PI'R finances
the cost of replacements. ThI.e drawing of a disti-nction betvween the t'wUO c:las-
ses of expenditure is considered to be unnecessary and should be replaced by
a '.~-'~* procedure 1   .m .. s req. ire' ` is   to use up its owi-i ava`iable ±Ur U
and then to draw on Govermnent for the balance of its requirements. The
whole question of accounting for capital expenditures, depreciation and
foreign loans requires examination and Govermment has agreed to appoint a
corm.ttee for this purpose. lTle cori-uiGttee J-ill report its findings to the
Province and to the Bank not later than June 1970.
6.o4      PWR's present accounting system is being developed along more com-
merciaI iines. A major program of modernization of accounting procedures
commenced in iiay 1965 with the aid of USAID-financed consultants, ivIessrs.
Booz Alien & Hamilton International. 'lThe quality of the work done is good,
but progress has been slower than ex.pected. Annex 6 gives a summary of thze
work done to date and that proposed for the future.  Proposals now submitted
by the present consultants cover (1) completing the accounts modernization,
(2) introducing computerization and (3) improving the fixed assets account-
ing and budgeting, at a total foreign exchnange cost of US-$ 400,000.  USAID
funds are expected to be available for (1), and provision of US$ 200,000 is
included in the proposed loan for (2) and (3). Further USAID funds may be-
come available for purposes (2) and (3) and the provision in the Bank loan
is subject to partial or total cancellation if other funds are forthcoming.
B. Rates and Fares
6.05      The structure of rates and fares on PIR has been described in the
Appraisal Report on the Eighth Railway Project (TO-587a) dated May 10, 19657
(see Annex 7). Since then (in May 1968) freight rates were raised by about
10% and passenger fares by 5i.
6.o6      F-JR has shown an increasing interest in costing, and has produced
figures showinR the various elements of handling and transportation costs
for different commodities which have been used in quoting special rates and
in revising tariffs.  An attempt was also made by RJR to allocate total costs
between passenger and freight services. This exercise suggested that passen-



- 16 -
ger services were not. producing slaf'fi ri ent net operating revenue, and it
was on this basis that fares were increased in IMiay 1968. It is expected
that the engragemern.t (in Ja,nuary 1969) of aon e-x,er  ---r4 A-l d   t'ae COJor;
bo Plan will lead to the adoption of improved criteria in PWR's approach to
costng nvdl the f.L     n rates a-.' f ares.

period are s,rnarized as follows:

6.o8      As a result of increased traffic and tariff adjustments, operat-
ing revenues rose by 27%, an average annual increase of 5.4hf. ODerating
expenses (excluding depreciation)rose by 36%, an average annual increase o-
6.8a.  This resulted in a deterioration of the working ratio (i.e. opera;ing
expenses excluding depreciation as a percentage of gross revenue)l/ from
67.6% in 1962/63 to 71.59 in 1967/68. Over 50va of the increase, in oneratijng
expense is attributable to higher fuel costs (Rs 61.0 million).  Personnel
costs continiued to grroTi at an average rate of about. 4 5 per annum. However,
after making allowance for the increased fuel tax, the cost of carrying -the
additional trafficj and saving  from further dieselization, operating ex-
Penses (exc:Luding depreciation) appear to have been well controlled, with an

For 1967/68, provLsion under (b) was not made, on grounds that the contri-
bution under (2) weil iL in the foreseable' fi+-ii,K b  m,,ore +hMn suffic:ie.nt
to cover demands made on the fund for replacements.
6.11     As a result of the negotiations for Bank Loan 496-PAK, dated
Mnv 26(. 1'367, 'PIR agreed -o unde-4-ae a study to deAe.,4e whether it would
be feasibLe to revalue its fixed assets on the basis of current replacement
-osts, alOe pr pose of the study was to ascertain, whether the deprec-iaio..
currently charg-.d against revenue is adequate. PWR's conclusion following
the  -ia- -4  suj was that an accurate revaluation was not feasible UlIt,
at the req7uest of the Bank, PWR has made an estimated revaluation of its
WQUU* assit   Ths revalu ati on needs zt be revied andu refined.  r>Vn has
undertaken to complete this revision by December 31, 1969 with a view to
establishLing by a daue to be agreed with the Bank (a) an adequate annual
charge in its accounts for depreciation based on current replacement costs
anXd (b) an adecquat'e annual rate of return on the current value of its :ixed
assets in use as determined from time to time.
6.12     The operating ratio  in 1962/63 was 80.0 and after rising progres-
sively to 84.1 in 1966/57, decreased to 82.4 in 1967/e6- due to the change in
depreciation po icy referred to in paragraph 6.10. On this new basis the
ratio Of o2-4 in Iy6ot/o can be considered as ccnforming reasonably with the
obligation of PWR, under Loan 496-PAK, to maintain a ratio of "about 8(3%1"
6.13    1While earnings from passenger traffic during the past two years have
been very close to the forecast used in 1966/67 for the appraisal of
Loan 496-PAK, freight traffic and revenues have been well below the forecast.
Simultaneously, operating expenses have exceeded the estimates. As a result,
net income after appropriations for 1967/68 was Rs 34.0 million less than
forecast. Although the earning position of PWR has deteriorated, its
operations were still profitable.
D. Present Financial Position
6.14     The ba,ance sheet, as shown in RJ's books, reflects the method
used in providin g development funds, as explained in paragraph 6.02; fixed
assets are shown at their cost of original acqtuisition, all replacements
being charged to DRF. Table 12 restates the balance sheet on June 30,1967 by



incluulng unr.der fLI Jed assets thLe hIstorical cost of all fed assets in
use.  The restated balance sheet also shows capital provided by the Govern-
rnent foreija looas and PWILlRs own resourc.,s.  a Anexes A and T to Table 12
show the method adopted to arrive at the estimated historical cost of fixed
assets in use and annex C to Table 12 reconstructs in saLu-iar-y £onn the DR-I'
account over the entire period since partition.
6.15      The accounting system of WdR does not provide the data required
for the assessment of- a rate of return oan the net fixed assets in use at
either replacement cost or historical cost. This situation will continue
until thae revaluation of fixed assets referred to in paragraph 6.11 is complets,,
On the basis of the reconstructed balanca sheet in Table 12 net fixed as-
sets have been stated at cost less approoriations to DRF and to Improvement
Fund which gives a net figure of Rs 1,807 million on June 30, 1967.    Net
operating revenues in 1967/68 at Rs 109. million are equivalent to a return
of 6.1' on the net fixed assets so calculated.
E.  Future Earnings 1963/69 - 1972/73
6.16      I'able 13 gives the forecast operating revenues and expenses for
the period 1968/69-1972/73; it also shows the forecast allocation of net
operating revenues.  The forecasts are summarized below:

cost levels.  The projections are -therefore based on any rise in costs toLD
ofLset by additional revenues to be obtained inter alia Dy tariff adjust-
ments.  Provision is made for increased cost of materials to overtake arrears
in maintenance oI track and rolling stock. Also provision is made ior the
higher cost of ilnports resulting froml thae Government's decision that all
statutory bodies including FWR are henceforth to obtain their foreign ex-
change at a "cash cum bonus" rate equivalent to about Rs 8-9 = US:; 1 (para..
3.10).
0.19      Depreciation allowance, as a percentage of gross operating revenuies,
is expected to increase progressively from 10.8% in 1968/69 to 12.7,a in
1972j73. P-llR has agreed that in future the charge for depreciation will be
adjusted as rmlay be necessary so as to insure that it is not less than 12% of
gross operating reveniue.
6.20      iWR has undertaken to maintain an operating ratio not higher t,han
82,%, reducing to 30, on canpletion of the project.
6.21      The forecast income accounts show that a substantial increase
in internally generated funds (about Rs 60 million) will be required by
1972/73 to meet the anticipated higler level of appropriations as set out
below:

7.02      The current investment program of PfiR wias conceived in 1963/6hL, at
the close oi the successful Second Five-Year Plan which saw a steady increase
in rai-Lway traffic and the achievement of many development targets in other
fields. The Third Plan was more ambitious than the Second, and the targetEs
for the rail.ways were chosen on the assumption that freight ton miles and
passenger miles would show annual increases of 5.53, and 3.3, respectively.
In the event, the growth of railway traffic did not materialize as expected.
but the railway investment program has reraained basical-ly in its original.
form (except for reductions in locomotives and rolling stock) and is
being re-evaluated to meet current needs and the requi.rements for the
Fourth Plan period (1970/71 - 1974/75). The proposed loan provides for
financing the foreign exchange costs of those iteins remaining in the Third
Plan progranm (track renewal, line capacity improvements and workshop equip--
ment) wrhich will be required under any reasorable future program. ProvisioU
is also made for consultancy services to improve the planning and operation-
al capacity of FIR anLd to continue the modernization of the accountin. sys--

The savings ander (La), (b) and (c) above may be expected to yield a rate

The available data do not enable thle benefits under (d) to be quantified.
However, since these are likely to be significant, it can be concluded
that the above rate is substantially understated and therefore the proposed
improvement is economically justified.
7.04      Line Capaciy ILmprovements (US:) 10.79 million equivalent; 43% cf
total Project cost): Trie inprovement of signalling, telecommunications and
marshalling yards, the lengthening of crossing loops, and the strengthening
of bridges are intended to increase the utilization of equipment and to re-
duce the capital requirements for locomotives and rolling stoclc.  The 50`
increase in freight locomotive utilization referred to in paragraph 4p.16 wou:ld
reduce the requirements for main line diesels by 76 units which, at
US$'t 220,000 each, would save capita:L investments of US:-> 17 million.  Improved
wagon utilization could reduce the turn round time from 11.2 days to the
8.5 days aclhieved in 1959/60 and reduce the requirements for new wagons by
about 8,000, -thus (at Rs 20,000 each) saving the equivalent of a furthier
US$ 32 million.  These capital savings of US'. 49 million and the associated
savings in maintenance and operating costs are achievable wJithin the next
five to eighit years, and it is conservatively estimated that 51J of these
savinRs would result from the line capacity improvements included in thiAs
Project. On these assumptions the economic rate of return would be of tha
order of 20%.

8. RECOI'INDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Governments of
Palistan and the Province of West Pakistan and FYR on the following impo:rt,nt
points:
(a) that PWR will not provide any service at an avoid- (paras. 3.06
able financial loss except at Government request    and .15)
(b) that management, operational and accounting         (paras. 1-.03
consultants will be employed                        and )4.l4)
(c) that a committee will be appointed to examine
and report on accounting procedures                (nara. 6.03)
8.02      The Project is technicallv sound, should improve F-M?'s finances,
and be of economic benefit. It provides a suitable basis for a Banc l.oan of
US$ 14.5 mi:Llion equivalent to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan with a torm.
of 25 years including 3½ years of grace.  The proceeds would be relent to the
Province of W,est PakLstan on the same terms and conditions as th1ose appJ.ing
to the proposed Bank loan and made available to WR through the Province on
the same terms and conditions, e-xcept thant portion of the loan for new
additions which, in accordance with statutory provisions will, on redemption
by the Province, be added to FWRIo capita'.

PAKISTAN wEU'STERN RAILWAYS
Taxes and Subsidies
1.        The bulk of taxes paid by     PWR are on furnace oil and high
speed diesel oil. While the totals paid rose in financial terms from
Rs 96 million in 1963/64 to Rs 110 million in 1967/68, their economic
effect wa.s less as the fuel was imported at the nominal exchange rate
of Rs 4.762 to the US$. On the assumption that an exchange rate of
1.75 times the official one 1/ should be applied to fuel irmports, the
"effective" tax paid rose from Rs 38.9 million in 1963/64 to Rs 46.8
million in 1967/68, as shown in the table on page 2 of this Arnex.
2.        The main economic subsidies given to  RJR have been (a) the
right to pay for imported purchases at the nominal exchange rate and
(b) the right to obtain capital from Government at interest rates of
% - 5%. Since July 1, 1968 imported purchases (except fuel oil) have
had to be paid for at an economic rate, so this subsidy has now ceased.
Its annual value in the period 1963/64 - 1967/68 ranged from Rs 93.5
million to Rs 307.() million, as shown in the table on page 2.
3.        l-t is difficult to quantify the value of cheap capital in
Pakistan, but had     PWR been required to pay 10% on its C1apital-
at charge", it would have had to pay since 1963/64 not less than Rs 100
million a year more than the interest char-es actualhy paid.
4.        I'hese figures indicate that while PNWR perforrms many valuable
services to Pakistan at low rates, its net tax contribution has not been
a positive one in recent years.
1/ This figure is used by the Planning Commission in some of its studieS.

Objectives
The purpose of the services is to improve the overall efficiency
of PmR' s operations under the direct supervision of the Railway Board.
Scope
(a) The experts shall conduct investigations in the depart-
ments of P`wR where, in the opinion of the Board,
operational, organizational, administrative and technical
improvements are necessary and can be achieved. The
experts will act together or individually, as instructed
by the Board.
(b) If in the course of their work the experts discern areas
where their advice is required, they will inform the
Board and request authorization to investigate.
(c) The experts shall report their findings to the Board
and make recommendations which will essentially provide
for ways and means to strengthen managerial control
over the activities involved. Copies of their reports
will be sent to the Bank by the Board who, at the same
time, will submit a note on the action they intend to take.

sound economic and financial principles,
the consultants shall examine the following aspects of P`UR s operations:
(1)  Improving facilities at Karachi (possibly a new mechanized
yard on the outskirts of the suburban area) to permit:
(a)  increased marshalling and reception of block loads
and block trains;
(b)  direct access of main line locomotives to the main
dispatch and reception yards;
(c)  oil tank loading by pipeline at the main marshalling
yard area.
(2)  Improving facilities at Lahore (especially to receive and
dispatch through block loads).
(3)  Removing the bottleneck created by the single track Kotri
bridge (a complete feasibility and engineering study wll
be required).
(4)  Improving the operational facilities at other stations and
depots between Karachi and Lahore.
(5)  Improving train control, signalling and telecommunication
equipment and methods of working (including the possibilities
of CTC operation between Karachi and Lahore).
(6)  Discontinuation of commercial services at small stations
on a system wide basis and a study of the economics of :Less
than car load (LCL) traffic.
(7)  In parallel with these items, other measures having a
bearing on overall system operations, in the longer tenr,
should be studied and decisions should be reached on:
(a) whether train loads and sneeds should be greater 7i
future and, if so, the cost and optimum timing of
chaneing (i)  to central couplers and (,i?  to improved
(possibly air) brakes;
(b) the possible use of containers, and

From Khanewal there is a single line for 1h6 miles to Raiwind -where there is
a double track again for the last 32 miles into Lahore.  The KhAnewr' AiLaho,De
section :Ls in the process of being electrified (under a UK loan/suppl-fers
credits) and work will be completed in the second ha' of 1969.   The
remainder of the route is operated largely by diesel with some steam
locomotives0  The single line section has tokeniess block train operation
while the double lines have standard block working between stations.
Crossing loop le:gths (about 2600 ft) on the single line are adequate for 72
four-wheel freight wagon trains; this is the present limit of load (about
2300 tons) with the existing loose couplers and vacuum braking.
2.     Train traffic is dense in and around Karachi and Lahore. At Karachi
there are daily some 100 suburban trains, 35 long distance passenger trains,
30 long distance freight trains and local operations. At Lahore there are
about 170 local and long distance passenger trains and 40 long distance
freight plus local freight train operations. Along the route the traffic
density is between 30 and 50 passenger trains and up to the same number
of freight trains per day depending upon locality and season. The operation
of passenger trains, including their timekeeping, is satisfactory but
freight trains are not operated with the same efficiency. All trains are
timetabled but in practice Driority is given to passenger services and
freight trains are often held at wayside stations for long periods until t-;e
opportunity occurs to work them forward between passenger trains and rail
cars.
3.     At Karachi, freight loading and offloading occur at various port,
goods yard and industrial areas over a main line length of about 30 miles;
in the main dispatch yards at the port and at Karachi City there is not
enough room to assemble freight trains into block loads for various
destinations, except for two full trains of taik wagons daily to Multan
(M7O miles from Karachi) and about two full train loads of general gcods
for Lahore. All other freight trains have to be marshalled en route
gpnerally at anmasata (500 miles from Karachi>   there the through loads

common with plain axle bearings and does require occasiornal en route
inspection, pending eventual substit-ution by initially more costly roller
bearings (only provided so far on   RJR oil tank wagons). Wagons found
sufferling from any mechanical or cargo defect have to be removed from the
train which adds to the yard occupation and train delays.   All the main
depot stations on the route are continuously full of freight trains ancL
wagons; at peak traffic periods congestion occurs which leads to trains
having to be held at adjacent wayside stations until room can be made
available at the depots; in turn this causes congestion along the line and
slows the whole of freight operations still further.
4.        In the case of passenger trains the provision of locomotives
(mostly diesel) is linked to the timetable operations; but for freight
trains their uncoordinated operation means that, when assembled, they often
have to wait at locomotive depot stations for the provision of power.
5D        For the future, operations require examination over the Karachi/
Lahore rourte as a whole, with all aspects and their interlinking being
considered, and draft outline terms of reference for consultants to help
PRJ in thiLs matter are given in ANNEX 2 preceding.

Notes on Items in Plan and Project
New Construction (In Plan)
1.        There are five main items:
(a) Karachi Circular Railway - A suburban line about 19 miles
long to serve c mUmu, le r- 4n industria  trffc -'I 4-c  abou  1.'l m. el-,
in the conge!sted port/city area remain to be completed.
(b) Kashmor - Kot Adu Railway - A new line 196 miles long on
4e -west 1_ar- 0f the li_usu  4 Io m ies rave been opened to traf.±o w-iu
the balance is under construction.   The line is intended for develop-
m-Lent and to provide alternative access To the east and north of thie
country.
(c) Hyderabad - PIirpurkhas section - This 41 mile length of
a branch line has been converted from meter gauge to broad gauge to
reduce trans shipment of traffic.
(di) Islamabad Spur - A short branch 6 miles long to serve
the new capital is under construction.
(e) Amruka - Wasawewala - A link line approved but not
started to give direct access from Lahore to an isolated southern sec-
tor of the country.
Locomotives and Rolling Stock (In Plan)
2.        Details of the present locomotive fleet are given in Tables
3, 4 and 5.   In 1967/68 there were 710 steam locomotives (mostly oil
fired) of which 623 were broad gauge.   These numbers have remained
practically unchanged over the past 10 years.    All steam locomotives
are over 20 years old with the majority 40 to 65 years old.    In 1967/68
there were also 337 diesel locomotives; of these 90% were under 15
years old.
3.        There are about 2100 passenger coaches (of which about 50% are
of wooden construction and 35 to 70 years old) and some 1200 other
coaching and special vehicles.   The number of passenger coaches has
increased 2L1 during the nast five vears.   New coaches are being Dro-
vided under West German supplier credits as well as a coach factory at
Rawalpindi;  it is to be opened in 1970 with a schedluled production of
150 steel coaches a year from 1972 onwards.
4.        The stock of freight wagons is about 37,000.    This is an
increase of about 17% in five years and 5e% in ten years.   Oi +the broad
gauge about 64% are less than 20 years old and only 17% are over 40 yearsc

About 93% are four-wheel wagons and the rest bogie stock.  R-, manu-
. . . . . s . . , . I t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~_         _   n   r An ,-
factures four-wheel wagons at Lahore where tnere is a capacity for 150U
units per year.  At the present time however the annual production rate
is about 350 four-wheel units and 155 bogie wagons. For the latter, thie
bogie frames are imported. The capacity of four-wheel covered wagons
is 22-23 tons and of bogie covered wagons 43 tons.  Under Loan 496-PAK
PWR undertook to make a stuldy of the increased use of bogie wagons. ThLis
has been slow in starting but is now in progress.
5.        The original proposals in the Third Five-Year Plan were for:
Replacements   Additions   Total
Diesel locomotives (B.G.)               60         47        107
Passenger coaches                       80        185        265

Freighit wagons                      1,000       6,306     7,306
6.        As a result of the recent traffic trends RTR has amended the
proposals:
(a)  65 diesel electric locomotives are to be supplied in 1969
under USA:o) (45 as replacements and 20 as additions). The balance of 42
is being deferred beyond the Thlird Five-Year Plan. 29 electric locomotives
are also being provided in 1969 under the electrification scheme Lahore!
Khanewal (see paragraph 7).
(b)  200 of the total number of coaches have been or are to be
supplied uinder Federal RPenihlibic of Giermmny credits_. P1ER hopes to negoti-

Electrification (in Plan)
7.        Electrification between Lahore and Khanewal (178 miles) includ-
ing the provision of 29 electric locomotirves (tot'aL cUVo  aO  X CU  Ion;
foreign exchange cost being met by aTK credit) is due for completion in
tne secondi half of l969y  Several assessments of the financial



and econ' inic case for t+his work havee been made. These sho,w that e-lec-
trificat.on offers subs'tantial financial gains to BR bout only a modest
gain to the country as a whole. A dAnailed feasa IWhli 4 4-- c, 4-  for -jhe

being carried ou4 by consultants (UTnried W-Kngdom do ilway Ad-vi sory  e
and R;R proposes putting forward the scheme for the Four-th. Five-Year PLan.
Track Renewals (In Project)
8.        The maini line Karachi/Lahore was laid with 90 lb/yd rail whi'Le
principa Iranich lines were provided with 75 i'b/yd rail and other branch
lines with 75 lb/yd and lighter material. The 90 lb/yd rail, Karachi/
TLahore, is bietween 30 and 60 years oid and in this time has carried
roughly 100 to 15() million gross tons of traffic, The present level of
003affic Ls between 6 and 9 million gross tons per annum. On the basis
of both total and annual gross tonnages and also of the physical condition
of the rail onl the main line (top flange wear, battered joints, metal
fatigue), replacement is necessary.  FRR has, therefore, been carrying
out a renewal program during the three Five-Year plans to date. The
standard adopted in relaying and improving the track for present and
future traffic is to provide on the main lines Karachi/lahore. Lahore/
Lalamusa (toward Rawalpindi) and Rohri/Sibi (towards Quetta) new 100 Ib
yd rail and increased sleeper density. Branch lines carrying traffic
between 1.5 and 5 million gross tons and lying wTithin the rough rectangle
Nultan/,tahore/Lalamusa/Kundian are being provided with 90 lb/yd rail
(mostly second hand released from the main line where the condition is
suitable; but maldng up shortages with new rail) sleepers at a density
of 2400 per mile and additional ballast. The lowest track standard is
second hand 75 lb/yd rail with a sleeper density of 2300 per mile which
is used on all other branch lines.
9.        There are certain branch and lin-Ak lines which, on present traf-
fic levels, may be of doubtful value to F,R. Insufficient data are yet
available to enable FUR to estimate minimum traffic levels for branch
line operation but experience elsewhere indicates that where the gross
freight traffic is below 400,000 tons per annum and the total gross
traffic, that is passenger plus freight, less than 800,000 tons per annum,
the railway should check on the viability of the line taking account of
the direct branch line traffic and its value as a feeder to the main line.
In some caLses, with reduction of operating and maintenance costs to an
absolute minimum, it is possible for a line to be viable,with traffic
down to 200,000 freight eross tons ner annum. PrelimLinary studies and
analysis of FR lines indicate that about 1000 route miles should be
examined as a first priority,  In the meantime no improvement work should
be carriecd out on such lines, only essential maintenance.

10.       According to WR's assessment, the situation on renewals of rail
Wnd sleepears is a94 fo" ows-:

Balance at end of Third Plan period                    1330      2990
11.       In the Second Plan period 934 track miles of rail were relaid,
or an average of 167 miles per annum. So far in the Third Plan period,
289 miles have been relaid (133 miles in 1965/66, 54 miles in 1966/67 and
102 miles in 1967/68). The program for 1968/69 and 1969/70 provides for
328 miles or 164 miles per annum, a return to the former rate of work.
12.       On the main line, 500 track miles have been relaid, 400 miles
(80 miles iper annun) in the Second Plan period, and 100 miles (33 miles
per annum) so far in the Third.  As a result of this slowdown in the Third
Plan periold 100 llb/yd rail has not been used at the rate originally
contemplated; one of the difficulties has been the rate of ballast supp'ly.
A total of 750 miles of rail has been supplied (650 miles by USAID and
100 miles under Credit 57-PAK) and after allowing for usage on turnouts,
etc., a balance of 200 miles remains in stock. PWR anticipates relaying
60 miles in 1968/69 and increasing to 90 miles in 1969/70, leaving a
balance of 50 miles. PWR has recuested that the proposed loan finance
the purchase of a further 50 miles to make a total of 100 miles available
for relayirp nlanned for 1970/71.
13.       To allocw ti m.e for calling bids and for delivery, funds for the
50 additional miles should be available about the end of 1969, and their
inCnIsion within th,e Prnient. neriodr can therefore be accented as reasonable,
subject to the rates of relaying being as forecast. No further funds

suitable second hand rail from the main line relaying (condition not good

enough except for use in minor sidings,yards, etc.).   Purchase of 40
miles under Loan 496-PAK has already been agreed upon.
15       For sleepers, 1659 miles (332 miles per annum) were renewed in
the Second Plan period; so far in the Third Plan period 388 miles have
been replaced (116 miles in 1965/66, 176 miles in 1966/67 and 196 miles
in 1967/68).  The slower rate latterly is said to have been due to delays
in the supplv of timber sleepers from overseas; on the other hand it is
reported tihat 379,,000 sleepers are now in stock. PWR plans to re-sleeper
56L miles in 1968/69 and 1969/70, an increased rate of 282 miles per aninu.
For this, P1R will. require about 1.4 million sleepers; allowing 0.6 millicn

main line renewals (plus other for signalling works) to be financed by
the proposed   wr ich is Iresoable subject to *,    e rat-e of Progrress
forecast being achieved.
16.       In the coming Fourth Five-Year Plan period, PER proposes to re-
new 770 miles of rail and 10143 miles of sleepers.  On this basis the tot..5
laid over the 15 years of the Second to Fourth Plans would be 2200 miles

in single and double lines (excluding sidings,yards etc.) these figures
wVouLd be equivalent to com,plete replacement of all rail (by new or secord
hand) on the system as it exists now at an average of 36 years and of
timber sleepers every 23 years approximately; on the basis of experience
with similar railways this is reasonable.
17.       To summarize, the gross tonnages being carried justify the
weights of rail and track standards being provided, wJhile the long term
average rates at wnich the work is being carried out are reasonable. There
is a need, however, to bring the planning up to date (i.e. do away wiith
the system of "throw forward" from one Plan period to another), to have
a five-year program reviewed annually, and to keep the supply of mater=ial3
more in line with the rate of works progress.
73ri2c Stre .thenini; (In Project)
18.       l'his wiork has been principally concerned with the rehabilitation
and improvement of bridges on the main line and important branch lines,
including the Sher Shah bridge over the River Chenab (financed by USAID)
to permit hLeavier loading, remove speed restrictions, and to allow com-
plete flexibility in the operation of the locomotive fleet. The remaining
program still to be financed mainly concerns bridges on branch lines, a'S,
is reasonable provided any branch lines of doubtful economic prospects
(e.g. Bostan/Fort Sandeman, Sibi/Khost) are not included until
their future retention has been decided upon.

over the Indus whnich requires fnr-ther feasDbility and engineering stdUy;
and (iv) the provision of better yard facilities at Samasata which,
having been designed in outline by British consultants, is the only
project ready to go forward.
20.       The balance of the oroposals concern the provision of additional
crossing stations, increasing loop capacities (principally on the Lahore/
Rawalpindi section), remodelling of yards, and providing other improved
facilitie s.
21.       There is a continuing program of improving signalling (automatic
block, tokenless block and token installations, improvements for through
running at stations, etc.) to increase line capacity, and this type of
work should continue where operationally required, particularly on the
main line Karachi/Lahore. Telecommunications are also being improved and
the provision of teleprinter equipment, reorganization of old telephone
circuits and exchanges, radio facilities between main centers, etc., .
should continue. One exception is the PWR proposal to provide VHF radic
equipment for communication betwieen stations and trains on the Karachi/
Kotri section; normal control and communication methods should be adequate
and the proposal should be re-examined during the overall Karachi/Lahore
exercise.
Workshops (Part in Project)
22.       The major items in the Plan are a factory for the local prcduc-
tion of concrete sleepers (at Sukkur) and a factory for the manufacture
of passenger coaches at Rawalpindi.
23.       The sleeper factorv has been completed and trial production of
sleepers has been carried out; full production (up to 200,000 sleeper's
per annum) is awaiting the arrival of snecial equipment for the lavirig
of heavy concrete sleepered track panels in the main line. The cost of
concrete3 sleepers plus fittings is put at Rs 70 each, the same as that
for imported Xalayan timber sleepers plus fastenings, while the average
life is estimated by PWR at 40 vears for the former as against 20 yeals
for the latter.

3.     Work completed comprises!
(a)  Staff Training. 500 classes were conducted for commercial,
transportation, stores and accounts departmnents.
(b)  Station Accounting.  New procedures were introduced at
475 out of a total of 1,023 stations.
(c)  Payroll Accounting. New payroll procedures were effective
for 58,600 of the 135,000 PWR employees.
(d)  Stores Accounting.  New procedures were installed at
principal depots and accounting centers.
4.     Progress with the installation of new procedures has not been at
the anticipated rate. Revised target dates are now being met and the
consultants report that installation can be substantially completed by
June 30, 1970.
5.     From the outset, it was understood that the new procedures would
be designed so as to simplify an eventual process of computerization.
In Yarch 1°68 PRB decided to plan for a computer program starting July 1,
1969. Some of PWR's considerations leading to this decision were:
(a)  Government's emphasis on early computerization by governmental
organizations; (b) the availability of a computer in Lahore which would
temporaril;y provide time for PNR; and (c) assistance by USAID in selection
and traininR of PWR personnel.

Rates and Fares Structure
(Extract from Appraisal Report TO-578a - May 1967)
1=        Since indenendence relatively modest increases have been made in
railway freight rates, with the pre-partition rate structure being retained
tintil revi sed in 196Lh  The revised rate structure provides for 12 classes;
the first group of six classes covers primary commodities and the second
aroln ronvrs high-valued traffic.   The revised rates are simple and are all.
inclusive - short distance, terminal and transshipment charges are no longer
1ev4 eA seanrntn1 y.  Freight rates have been related to load by devising four
weight groups for each class rate, providing an incentive to shippers to
offer goods irwagor. loads.   The ra+tps for coaching traffic. other than
passenger, were also revised with effect from July 1, 1964. During 1965
a large nurber of reduced rates for goods nd narrl traffic were auoted
and, in some cases, rebates were inatroduced for commodities moved for
eAWLJL V.

is their intention to reduce the n-ser o     passer,ger classes to
the next few years.
3.        in 1964, PWR introduced a tariff which took into account a study
of direct cperating costs; the lowest class rates refiect thse costs.      The
existing traffic costing organization, now merged into the 'Larger planning
cell, keeps costs and tariffs under constant review, with procedures being
refined in the light of experience.

of fixed assets in use on June 30, 1967 has been arrived at.
2. Loans for AdcLitions and Replacements
Loans received for capital investment have been dealt witl as follows:-
(a) In the published accounts loans for capital additions are credited
to Government current amount in the first instance. Repayments of
loans are made by Government and are reflected in an increase iLn
capital..at-charge and a corresponding reduction in current
account, In the restated balance sheet outstanding loans for'
additions have been shown as an addition to capital-at-charge,
(b) Loans for replacements are credited directly to Depreciation
Reserve Fund, repayments are made by PWR and debited to DRFo
Annex C is an approximate reconstruction of the DRF over the
period 19h7/48 to 1966/67 and shows how outstanding loans-
loans repaid and capital expenditure on replacements have been
dealt with in the restated balahne sheet.
3. DeDreciation Reserve Fmind
DRF is credited annually-with 1/30th of t-he balance of capital-at--charge.
This is required to meet the local currency cost of replacements plus repay-
ments of foreign exchange loans for replacemen.ts. This subject is dealt
with fully in the report. The balance of DRF appearing in the balance sheet
renresents the uinspent approp    tin-ns set asid4e for -epl-ments.  Chang9s

4. Improvement Fund
PWR a,llocates to this fund a fixed percentage of passenger revenue. The
nilrpose~ rcf', thio f  'd are to pay for unremanI.erative cappital works, to rLLetOE/
the cost cf users' amenities and to cover labor welfare works. Charges to
thi-s f,-,d .must bDe a,%,uth&orijzed4 in Itill Annual BuUdget,
5. Revenue Reser ve Tr"nd
This ±und is available - with Government authority - to draw on, fcr
example, to cover a deficit in net revenue.
6. Government Current Account
Almost the whole of this balance corresponds to the ouitstanding loans
for additions (Rs 228 million) which will be added to capital-at-cnarge
when repaid.
