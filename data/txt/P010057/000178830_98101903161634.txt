INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE PAKISTAN WESTERN RAILWAY
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan in an amount in various currencies equivalentto
US $14.5 million to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to cover the
estimated foreign exchange costs of high-priority items in Pakistan's
Third Five-Year Plan (1965-1970) with respect to Pakistan Western
Railway.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the ninth railway project
financed by Bank/IDA in Pakistan and the seventh operation with
Pakistan Western Railway (PWR).    The other two operations have been
with Pakistan Eastern Railway.   Five Bank loans amounting to $82.8
million have been made for PWR.    The first three loans (all made in
the 1950's) -were joint loans for Pakistan Eastern and Western Railways,
of iihich RJR's share was about $51 million equivalent.   The fourth
loan of $18.25 million was made in 1962 for PWR exclusively.    These
four loans have been fully disbursed, and the first one has been
repaid.   In 1967, RJI.R received a fifth loan for $13.5 million of
which approximately $9.8 million had been disbursed or committed
as of May 31, 1969.   In 1964, PWR received one IDA credit of $25
million which, except for $669,000 which was cancelled, has been
fully disbursed.
3.        In October, 1968, the Government of Pakistan applied to
the Bank for a loan of $14.5 million equivalent to cover the estimated
foreign exchange costs of specific items which were required during
the remainder of PFR's Third Five-Year Plan.    The project was appraised
by a mission -which visited Pakistan in November/December 1968.
4.        Negotiations with representatives of the Government of Pakistan,
the Provincial Government of West Pakistan, and Pakistan Western Railway,
were held in Washington from May 26 to June 3, 1969.    Mr. A. R. Bashir,
Economic Minister to the Embassy of Pakistan,and Mr. S. M. Afzal,
Commissioner, Ministry of Communications, represented the Government of
Pakistan.   Messrs. N. A. Qureishy, Chairman of West Pakistan Railway
Board, and Iquzaffar Hasan, Finance Member, West Pakistan Railway Board,
represented the Provincial Government and PWR.
5.        As at April 30, 1969, the Bank had made 28 loans to Pakistan
totalling about $592 million, of which 17 are fully disbursed.    The
Association had made 26 credits, totalling about $3h8.5 million, of which
six are fully disbursed.   The following is a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits to Pakistan -which have not been fullv disbursed as
at April 30, 1969:

6.         In addition to the above loans and credits a Bank loan of
$8 million was made to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited on 14ay 13,
1969 and an IDA credit of $30 million for a third Agricultural Develop-
ment Bank project is beingpresnted concurrently for your consideration.
7.         In various reports to you (P-438a, P-465, P-519) reference
was made to the slow rate of disbursement of IDA credits to Pakistan,
and in particular to the necessity of revising some projects in East
Pakistan.   Slow disbursements have been caused by a variety of diffi-
culties,   notably administrative shortcomings in the agencies charged
with carrying out the projects, lack of local funds, and poor
response to tendering.   For most of the ongoing projects the current
rate of disbursement is satisfactory.   In particular, there has been
a marked improvement in carrying out the Dacca/Chittagong water supply
projects (Credits 41 and 42-PAK). In some cases the situation is not
yet satisfactory.   For example, bids received for construction work
for the East Pakistan Highway Project (Credit 53-PAK) were unacceptable
and some further delay will be caused by the need for re-bidding.
Continuing, attention is being paid to these problems.
8.         IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling $28
million.   The outstanding commitment, net of repayments, cancellations
and sales of loans, is about $20.6 million.  IFCis presentljconsidering
applications for investments in textile machinery and fertilizer
production.   IFC operations in Pakistan are proceeding satisfactorily.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
9.         Borrower:              Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Beneficiary:           Pakistan Western Railway, through the
Province of W.Test Pakistan.
Amount:                US $14.5 million in various currencies.
Purpose:               To assist in financing the foreign
exchange costs of high priority items
in the remaining period of Pakistan's
Third Five-Year Plan with respect to
Pakistan Western Railway.
Amortization:          25-years including 31½-years of grace.
Repayment in semi-annual installments
beginning February 15, 1973 and ending
August 15, 1994.
Interest Rate:         61e; per annum.
Commitment Charge:     3/4 of 1% per annum.



PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       The project is more fully described in the attached Appraisal
Report entitled "Appraisal of Ninth Railway Project (Pakistan Western
Railway) Pakistan" (PTR-20a),dated June 12, 1969.    The project will
enable Pakistan Western Railway to finance the following high priority
items: (1) Renewal and improvement of track and bridges; (2) Rehabilit-
ation and improvement of workshops; (3) Increase of line capacity by
modernizing signal and telecommunication equipment and by remodelling
yards and crossing stations; and (4) Consulting services to assist FWR
in management, operations and accounting.
11.       The total estimated cost of the project is PRs. 118.1 million
with a foreign exchange component of PRs. 69.0 million (equivalent to
US $14.5 million).   The proposed $14.5 million loan will cover
approximately 58% of the project.   All contracts proposed for Bank
financing, other than the employment of consultants, are to be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding.
12.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be re-lent by the
Government of Pakistan to the Province of West Pakistan on the same
terms and conditions as those between the Central Government and the
Bank, except that the Government would bear the foreign exchange
risk. The terms on which the Province would make the funds avail-
able to PWR would follow the system in Pakistan for financing the
railway's capital expenditures.   Funds provided to finance additions
to railway assets become part of the Government's investment in the
railway (capital-at-charge) not subject to amortization but subject to
annual statutory interest payments presently set at 5%.    Funds used
for replacements are treated as indebtedness of FWR to the Government
which (except for the exchange risk) will be on the same terms and
conditions as those extended to the Borrower by the Bank.
13.       PWR is a department of the Provincial Government of West
Pakistan, headed by a four-man Railway Board.    PR's management is
conscientious and experienced and recognises the need to keep up to
date with the latest railway management techniques.    The proposed
loan would provide for the employment of management consultants for
this purpose.
14.       PWR's financial situation, while still sound, has been
subject to growing strain.   Operating expenses, affected by increases
in personnel and fuel costs, have been rising at a somewhat higher rate
than operating revenue. PWR and the Province have agreed during
negotiations to maintain an operating ratio of between 8C0 and 82%
and to cover from internally generated resources: debt service
requirements, adequate working capital, and adequate liquid reserves
to meet accruing liabilities and future contingencies. PRR has further
agreed to revise and complete the revaluation of its fixed assets with
a view to establishing by a date to be agreed with the Bank an adequate
charge for depreciation based on current replacement costs and an
adequate rate of return on fixed assets.



- 6 -
15.       Operating efficiency has tended to decline in recent yaars,
and the proposed loan providos for consultants to work with PWR on
specific operating problems, particularly relating to the Karachi-
Lahore main line.   RNR has strengthened its Railway Planning Cell
and intends to continue doing so.   The Province will establish a
competent committee to review NRH's pclicies and accounting practices
with respect to capital expenditures, depreciation and replacerment of
assets0   Under the proposed loan PWN wiUl also employ consultants
to modernize and improve its accounting procedures.
16.       In view of the need to improve transport coordination in
West Pakistan, Highway Loan 578-PAX (signed December 20, 1968)
provided for a Transport Coordination Study, for which consultants
were to be appointed by June 30, 1969.    Progress in the appointment
of consultants has been slow and in view of the recent disturbances
in Pakistan the Bank is considering a short extension of the deadline.
The Government of Pakistan has shown that it is willing to expedite
the appointment procedures and it is expected that consultants will
be appointed by September 30, 1969.
17.       The project consists of four components: (a) Track renewal
($8.7 million); (b) Line capacity improvements ($10.8 millicn);
(c) Plant and machinery for workshops ($2.9 million); and (d) Con-
sulting services ($1.2 milion), As stated in Part 7 of the Appraisal1
Report, it is not possible to quantify in all cases the economic
benefits to be obtained from these investments, although it is clear
that the overall project and the transport measures associated with it
will make an important contribution to transport efficiency and planning
in West Pakistan.   It has been possible to calculate an economic rate
of return of 20% for the investments under (b) above; and on the basis
of limited data, an economic rate of return for the investments under
(a) above of substantially more than 9%.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUEINTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       Copies of the following documents are being distributed to
the Bxecutive Directors separately:
(i)    the draft Loan Agreement between the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and the Bank;
(ii)   the draft Project Agreement between the Bank
and the Province of M§est Pakistan;
(iii)  the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4iiil) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank; and
(iv)   the text of a Resolution approving this lean.



19.       The following features of the draft Loan and Project
Agreements are of particular interest:
(i)    Section 2.04 of the draft Loan Agreement provides for
the total or partial cancellation of the funds alloc-
ated to the financing of consultants to carry out
Part IV (d) of the project, should external aid be
obtained for the purpose, from other sources;
(ii)   Section 2.07(b) of the draft Project Agreement
provides that services operated at a loss will only
be furnished by PWR upon request from the Borrower
or from the Province of West Pakistan;
(iii) Section 2.09 of the draft Project Agreement provides
for the revision and completion of the evaluation of
RJR's fixed assets by December 31, 1969 (see para-
graph 14 above);
(iv)   The covenant referred to in paragraph 14 above is
set out in Section 2.10 of the draft Project
Agreement.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       A Report on the Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Pakistan (SA-4a), dated April 18, 1969, has been distributed to
the Executive Directors.   On May 19 and 20, 1969, the Twelfth
Meeting of the Pakistan Consortium was held in Paris and a summary
of the discussion on economic performance and policy is presented
below to supplement the recent economic report.
21.       The recent disturbances in Pakistan were brought to an
end by the introduction of Martial Law before the cost to the economy
could become substantial. The major direct effect was a loss of
industrial production which is estimated at only 1 or 2%, an insig-
nificant amount in relation to GNP.   Other sectors were hardly
affected.   In particular, the wheat harvest is now estimated at 6.8
million tons, a new record, and total agricultural growth will be
about 5% in the current year, despite serious flood damage in East
Pakistan.   Indications are that growth in GNP will exceed 5% and
in exports will approach 10c, bringing performance during the year
close to Third Plan targets.
22.       However, accommodation to sizeable wages increases, which
are being granted to offset past declines in real wages, will be an
important feature of economic developments in 1969/70.   The non-
agricultural wage bill is estimated to rise by lC% (Rs. 600 million),
of which Rs. 350-400 million will be in the public sector and the
remainder in the private sector.   These wage increases have already
begun to aggravate the difficulties of the public sector in
mobilizing domestic resources to sustain an expanding development
program.



- 8 -
230       Implementation of the public sector development prograin in
1968/69 is now estimated at Rs. 4,800 million, Rs. 200 million below
the estimate in the recent economic report and in real terms below the
outlays of the previous year.   However, the Government recognizes
that a large amount of additional local resources needs to be mobilized
in order to sustain the pace of economic development in the face of
increased social needs.   The Government assured members of the
Consortium that a substantial effort in this area would be made in the
forthcoming 1969/70 budget, estimated to yield additional resources
on the order of Rs. 1 billion ($210 million), primarily through new
taxation.   Specific measures could not be disclosed before the
budgetwas presented, but it was stated that they would be in line with
necessary changes identified in the Bank economic report.    In
particular, progress would be made in mobilizing more resources from
agriculture: the support price for wheat has already been reduced and
an adjustment of the support price for rice is being considered; the
domestic prices of agricultural machinery will be increased; and other
measures to mobilize rural savings will be announced in the budget.
Such measures would allow public development outlays to be increased
by 12W.6 over this year's level.  Moreover, an additional allocation
of Rs. 400 million would be made for outlays in the social sectors, in
particular education.   The family planning program would receive the
full amount allocated in the Plan, despite the need to keep total
development outlays substantially below Plan targets.
24.       Pakistan's request for $500 million in new pledges was well
below the level endorsed by the Consortium in previous years as being
appropriate to the country's needs and was scaled to the likely
availability of assistance.   Pledges and indications made during the
meeting nearly fulfill the requested amount; however, some of these
are subject to parliamentary and other approvals before resources
can actually be made available to Pakistan.   The need for half the
request ($250 million) to be in the form of non-project assistance
was endorsed by the Consortium and pledges of this form of aid
indicate progress in meeting this recognized need.
25.       The terms of aid for Pakistan were extensively discussed
during the course of the meeting. Pakistants decision to limit future
borrowing to an amount that, on the terms offered, could be accommodated
within a debt service ratio not substantially in excess of 20%, was
considered a welcome move towards protecting the country's ability to
service its external debt obligations. However, it was also recognized
that in order to provide the net inflow of resources required to sustain
adequate economic growth, a substantially larger amount of foreign
assistance than over the past few years needs to be provided on con-
cessional terms. In some cases, improvements in terms were announced
with new pledges, and it was agreed to pursue the objective of more
appropriate terms by further consultation during the course of the year.
Pakistan's external debt position has become more difficult largely as
a result of heavy borrowing on hard terms to supplement inadequate
amounts of soft assistance.   Wbile there is an urgent need now to
bring the terms of assistance into line with the country's economic
situation and prospects, Pakistan remains a blend country with the
ability to continue borrowing limited amounts on conventional terms,
and I consider Pakistan is creditworthy for the amount of the lcan
recommended.

26.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECO4IRThDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
