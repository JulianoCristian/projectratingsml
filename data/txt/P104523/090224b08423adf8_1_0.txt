F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

A. Increase preventative action, and reduce misconception of cross border and mobile
populations, refugees, IDPs, returnees and surrounding host communities concerning
HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and mitigation in selected sites in the IGAD member states;
and
B. Establish a common and sustainable regional approach to supporting these populations in
the IGAD member states.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

PDO indicator(s):

The following is critical to take into consideration when reading or interpreting the datasheet:

(a) The baselines and targets for PDO indicator 1, 4, 6, 7 are those of UNHCR populations
    only. The baselines and targets in the datasheet are those used in the ISRs since 2010, but
    cover UNHCR populations only (about 1/3rd of the project target population). Only
    baselines and targets for indicators 2, and 3 reflect hotspot AND UNHCR data. No
    baselines were used in ISRs prior to 2010, a key weakness of the project.
(b) The “actual values achieved” of PDO indicators 1,4,6,7 in the datasheet reflect hotspot
    data only, which were erroneously compared with the UNHCR baselines and targets.
    These indicator values do not include data from the UNHCR camp populations, as survey
    data from UNHCR camp populations was not obtained, and the end-line Behavioral
    Surveillance Survey (BSS) for UNHCR refugee camps never completed. Equally, hotspot
    BSS data for Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti was never included/collected. Only the values
    for indicators 2 and 3 reflect both hotspot AND UNHCR data.
(c) The “actual values achieved” for PDO 1, 4, 6 and 7 used in the datasheet are those
    computed for this ICR from the end-line BSS hotspot survey, which became available
    only after project closing. The end-line BSS survey of hotspot populations was designed
    to inform the actual values achieved. Because this was delayed and data only became
    available after project closing, the ISRs had used interim routine estimative administrative
    hot-spot data (provided by IGAD). Because the hotspot BSS data has now become
    available, this data was used instead as intended.
(d) BSS hotspot end-line data was aggregated (into male/female) for this ICR to correspond
    with the baseline and target aggregation. The BSS end-line reported outcomes in a
    disaggregated manner for Female Sex workers, Truckers and Youth (Male and Female).
    This is also how it was reported in the ISRs using routine administrative data (which made
    comparisons with baselines and targets unclear). To enable comparison to the baselines
    and targets for this ICR, the data was aggregated into male/female, where females
    encompass all sex workers and female youth, and males all truckers and male youth.
(e) A more realistic indication on the achievement of indicators 1, 4, 6, and 7 (albeit, again,
    for hotspot populations only) is found in section 3.2 of this ICR, which analyzed the 2012
    BSS hotspot baselines and targets that were separately obtained for this ICR, and never
    included in the ISRs, and compares this against achievements reported in the 2015 BSS
    hot-spot end-line (which became available after project end).
(f) The reported progress on indicators 1, 4, 6 and 7 in the datasheet and section 3.2
    accordingly differs. Section 3.2 shows that when using the correct baselines and targets
    reveals that the actual progress on these indicators was actually worse than those presented
    in the datasheet below.

Comments (incl. %   NOT ACHIEVED: The above data compares UNHCR population

                    with actual values representing hot-spot populations only. This
                    reflects the monitoring of this indicator as reflected in all the ISRs
                    and following AF. Actual values were computed for this ICR from
                    the Behavior Surveillance Survey results, which became available
                    only after project end (and were never used in the ISRs). Refer to the
                    notes above the table on the problematic nature of the data
                    presented here.

                    As shown in greater detail in Annex 10, according to this
                    problematic and incomplete comparison, roughly half of the targets
                    were achieved for hot spot populations. Data to assess whether the
                    UNHCR population targets were achieved, as well as on beneficiary
                    populations in Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti was never collected.
                    According to this, the indicator could be classified as “partially
                    achieved”.

                    When actual hotspot population values are compared with correct
                    hotspot baselines and targets (erroneously never done in ISRs and
                    for project reporting), as highlighted in section 3.2 of this report and
                    further detailed in a comparative analysis in Annex 11, actual
                    achievement of targets is a lot lower. With the above in mind thus,
                    the indicator target was not achieved.

                   appeared as a PDO indicator without formal restructuring in ISR2, in
                   2008. It was eventually formalized during the Additional Financing
                   in 2013. It replaced another PDO indicator in the PAD: Percentage
                   of target population reached with community based HIV prevention
                   programs in targeted areas. The last ISR lists the actual value
                   achieved as 109,523 for 31 March, 2014, far surpassing the target.
                   Subsequent data obtained by IGAD for June 2015 lists the final
                   value as 112,287 (as shown also in 3.2.1 of this report). This is
                   reflected above, and according to this, the target was achieved.

                      only after project end (and were never used in the ISRs). Refer to the

                      presented here.

                      As shown in greater detail in Annex 10, according to this
                      problematic and incomplete comparison, the majority of the targets
                      were achieved for hot spot populations. Data to assess whether the
                      UNHCR population targets were achieved, as well as on beneficiary
                      populations in Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti was never collected.
                      According to this, the indicator could be deemed partially achieved.

                   When actual hotspot population values are compared with correct
                   hotspot baselines and targets (erroneously never done in ISRs and
                   for project reporting), as highlighted in section 3.2 of this report and
                   further detailed in a comparative analysis in Annex 11, none of the
                   populations achieved the targets. With the above in mind thus, the
                   indicator target was not achieved.

project was changed five times from December 2011 to June, 2012, to October, 2012,
to December 2012, to March 2013, and to May 2013. The second phase of the project,
funded through the Additional Financing became effective on May 31, 2013, with a

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of project appraisal in 2007, cross border and mobile populations
(CBMPs) as well as internally displaced Persons (IDPs) in the Horn of Africa
were in urgent need of support. Mobility and migration of populations across
Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan, Kenya and Uganda (defined as countries of the
Horn) was a common occurrence. In cross-border areas in the Horn, transport
workers (i.e. truckers) Community Sex Workers (CSWs) and other cross border and
mobile populations (CBMPs) passed through and often interacted at so called “ hot
spots”, whilst refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) resided along the
borders and hotspots, including in refugee camps (managed largely by UNHCR). Due
to the disruption of social norms and the political and economic instability associated
with mobility, these populations often faced food shortages, physical and
psychological insecurity and abuse, extreme poverty, poor hygiene, lack of education,
and other hardships.

HIV infections in the region were severe, and mobile populations were
considered a catalyst to the wider HIV/AIDS problem whilst particularly
challenging to reach. Countries in the Horn of Africa were severely impacted by the
HIV/AIDS epidemic and were at different stages of addressing the epidemic. The
UNAIDS Epidemic update in 2006 estimated the prevalence levels (age 15-49) for the
Horn of Africa countries to be: Djibouti (3.1 percent); Eritrea (2.4 percent); Ethiopia
(3.5 percent); Kenya (6.1 percent); Somalia (0.9 percent); Sudan (1.6 percent); and
Uganda (6.7 percent). The movement of vulnerable populations was considered to be
a catalyst to the HIV/AIDS crisis, and reaching them an additional challenge,
requiring programs that specifically target the cross border and mobile populations
(CBMPs) in a comprehensive and collaborative manner. Mobile populations were
rarely supported by national HIV/AIDS programs.

This project was designed to be implemented at the regional, national and local
level to target HIV/AIDS services to CBMPs at selected hot spots and refugee
camps. The target countries for the project were Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, Uganda,
Ethiopia and Sudan (which eventually split into Sudan and South Sudan). The inter-
governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)1 was selected as the primary
regional implementing partner for the project, coordinating and managing activities
through the secretariat (based in Djibouti), and a Project Facilitation Office (PFO)
located in Uganda. To implement the project, IGAD would transfer funding and work
through National Aids Commissions (NACs), and UN bodies (UNHCR for refugee
sites, and UNAIDS for Somalia), who in turn would sub-contract specific services to
an array of local implementing NGOs and CSOs to deliver HIV/AIDS related
services.


1
  IGAD was a Regional Economic Commission in the framework of the New Partnership for African
Development (NEPAD), created in 1996 superseding the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and
Development (IGADD) which was established in 1986. In 2005, IGAD’s Health and Social
Development Section (HESAD) was established as part of the IGAD structure based upon
recommendations of Ministers of Health in the IGAD member states, and supported by the African
Union.

                                               1
The rationale for the Bank to support IGAD countries in the Horn of Africa was
high. The project, financed first through the regional window of the Africa Catalytic
Growth Fund (ACFG) Trust Fund, (and subsequently with a grant from CIDA as
Additional Financing), sought to facilitate the delivery of needed services to supply a
multi-country public good. The rationale rested on the benefits of (a) supporting a
regional body and cooperation among nations in a sub-region; (b) strengthening the
capacity of the regional body to address a public good in a sustainable way (in this
case HIV/AIDS for cross border and mobile populations); and (c) strengthening or
building mechanisms/forums for policy sharing, advocacy and surveillance in a
regional grouping. IGAD had already successfully implemented a World Bank
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant with the World Bank in the amount of
US$495,000 which included a regional mapping assessment of existing local
implementing partners, refugee sites and hot spots. This project was to build on this
initiative.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) defined two interrelated project
development objectives (paragraph 23), which were to: A) Increase preventative
action, and reduce misconception of cross border and mobile populations, refugees,
IDPs, returnees and surrounding host communities concerning HIV/AIDS prevention,
treatment and mitigation in selected sites in the IGAD member States (excluding
Eritrea). B) Establish a common and sustainable regional approach to supporting
these populations in the IGAD member states2. The original PDO indicators and the
intermediary indicators are listed in Annex 12, tables 1 and 2 below, respectively. As
is discussed throughout this report, the original indicators were informally changed in
ISRs (without restructuring) and did not include baseline or target values, until the
end of 2010, more than two years into the project.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

There were no changes in the two PDO’s, however informal adjustments were
made to the PDO indicators throughout the course of the project until 2013.
Table 1 (in Annex 12) shows that a first small change to the PDO indicators was
made during ISR2 in April 2008, when a new indicator on STIs was included, and
several others were dropped, or rather never reported on and/or changed without
explanation in the ISR. More changes were made to the indicators by ISR 5 in
October 2010, with the PDO indicator on condom use split into two alternative
indicators. Changes were made without restructuring, so the results matrix in the ISRs
was amended without formal authority for doing so. In 2013, additional small tweaks



2
  The PDO description in the GA is almost identical to that in the PAD, with only a very small
variation: (i) increase preventative action in relation to and reduce misconception of refugees,
Internally Displaced Persons, returnees, surrounding host communities, and cross-border and mobile
populations concerning HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and mitigation in selected sites in the
territory of the Member States; and (ii) establish a common and sustainable regional approach to
supporting these populations in the territory of the Member States.


                                                 2
were made to the indicators, this time formally and in line with the processing of the
Additional Financing (starting the final phase of the project).

Adjustments were also made to the intermediary indicators without any formal
approval until the AF in 2013. Aside from a number of changes in the intermediary
indicators first reflected in ISR (2) and (5), several others were simply not reported on
(i.e. dropped in the ISRs) including six indicators listed to report progress on
component 3 (management and M&E). As with the PDO indicators, the revision and
adoption of intermediary indicators was only formalized with the processing of the
Additional Financing in 2013. The AF finally revised indicators formally, whilst also
adding two new standard indicators related to access to a wider package of HNP
services and one with a gender dimension. Table 2 (in Annex 12) shows that all in
all, only 8 intermediary indicators were kept, following the initial ambitious 14 listed
in the PAD (it was more than halved).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries are defined in the PDO as follows: a) cross border and
mobile populations and IDPs, and b) people living in the vicinity of a hot spot.
The first are those referred to as cross-border and mobile populations (CBMP) who
frequent so called “hot spots” because transmission of HIV has a high probability in
these. They include a) individuals who regularly cross borders including truck drivers,
sex workers, nomads, and commodity traders and laborers, and (b) refugees and
internally displaced persons (IDPs) in UNHCR camps which are usually close to
borders. The second group is composed of people who live in the vicinity of a hot
spot (the surrounding host communities), and interact in many ways with the CBMP
at the hot spots. The PAD listed the total populations frequenting hot spots and in
UNHCR camps as close to 2.2 million, and an additional 4.6 million in the host
communities. The number of sites which are home to these populations and targeted
by this project, are detailed below in table 1.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project development objectives and related indicators were expected to be
achieved through the implementation of activities organized into three
components:

Component 1: Support to Refugees, IDPs, Returnees, Surrounding Host
Communities and Cross-border and Mobile Populations. This component
included two subcomponents: sub-component 1(a) was to be implemented by
UNHCR (contracted through a subsidiary agreement) and focused on providing a full
range of services, including preventive, treatment and support services on HIV/AIDS
to refugees, IDPs, returnees in camps primarily through the provision of relevant
goods and services. Activities were to be closely monitored and evaluated using a
regional M&E framework as well as behavioral and biological surveillance surveys.
Sub-component 1 (b) was to be implemented by national Implementing Partners
(National HIV/AIDS Commissions- NACs)3, through the delivery of HIV/AIDS
services by NGOs and local health facilities targeting CBMPs in hotspots, as well as
the surrounding host populations. The regional mapping assessment conducted by
IGAD (through IDF funding) had identified relevant NGOs and health facilities in the
hot spots that would be supported/funded.

Component 2: Cross-border collaboration on the Health Sector Response to
HIV/AIDS. This component sought to (i) provide a forum for interaction among
IGAD member states, facilitating information sharing and potential harmonization of
policies and procedures related to HIV/AIDS; (ii) develop mechanisms for continuity
of services across borders including referral systems for CBMPs in the selected
treatment sites; and (iii) develop and adopt a regional strategy for improved HIV, STI
prevention, treatment and care services directed to cross-border and mobile
populations. This was to be achieved principally by funding: (i) periodic technical
review meetings, study tours, and training programs; (ii) a review and development of
existing protocols and materials on selected topics (including referral mechanisms),
that could be adopted by the IGAD country health authorities; and (iii) developing a
comprehensive 5-Year Regional HIV and STI Strategic Plan focused on the regional
dimensions of HIV and STI epidemic control that would cover both the service
delivery and communication aspects.

Component 3: Project Management, Coordination, Capacity Building and
Monitoring and Evaluation. This component was to focus on three main sub-
components, namely (i) management and coordination through support for the overall
facilitation program and the establishment of the Program Facilitation Office
(PFO);4(ii) capacity building by supporting IGAD and national HIV/AIDS authorities
to fulfill their roles as the facilitating organizations for the regional partnership for
IRAPP; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in line with the development of a
regional M&E framework to monitor CBMPs.

  Given the lack of a government in Somalia, UNAIDS was eventually contracted, instead of providing
funding through a NAC

    The IGAD Member States determined in May 2007 that the PFO will be located in Uganda.

                                                 4
1.6 Revised Components

The project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

Several level two restructurings were processed to prolong the project closing
dates and an Additional Financing was processed in 2013. The original closing
date of the project, funded under the original Grant from the Africa Catalytic Trust
Fund was December 2011. Subsequently, there were five amendments to the closing
date, through level 2 restructurings, which extended the implementation period of the
original project until May 31, 2013. An Additional Financing of US$7.622 million
provided by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), was processed
and became effective on May 31, 2013. The AF ensured continuity and a modest
scale up of the project scope. Its original closing date of December 31, 2014 was
subsequently extended to June 30, 2015. In large part, these small extensions reflected
the delayed processing of the Additional Financing (discussed throughout the report),
to ensure implementation continuity (and continued salary funding of the project
team) in the meantime.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project preparation and design was a swift yet inclusive process. The Project
Appraisal Document for IRAPP was prepared expeditiously, and project preparation
was touted as having been achieved in record time when compared with World Bank
averages. The swift preparation period was partly linked to the donors needs and
related processing timeline for the grant. Project appraisal nevertheless included
considerable consultations with IGAD and the member states at separate and joint
meetings to ensure understanding of the project, ownership and commitment by all
stakeholders. Examples include: (i) a meeting in March 2007 among all IGAD
member states, that forged an agreement to implement the project on the basis of a
partnership among countries with facilitation by IGAD; and (ii) an M&E Technical
working group meeting on May 6-7, 2007 with M&E experts from the IGAD states,
discussed and agreed on key performance indicators, updated the IGAD regional
mapping assessment, and jointly reviewed the draft work plans for refugee and IDP
areas.

The rationale for supporting targeting CBMPs with HIV/AIDS services was
based on a needs assessment. The immediate precursor for this project was the
World Bank’s Institutional Development Fund Grant to IGAD in 2004/2005 which
undertook a regional mapping assessment of cross border HIV/AIDS interventions
and local implementing partners. The assessment identified an absence of HIV/AIDS
counseling and testing services at sampled border locations across Horn of Africa
countries. This provided a strong rationale for the project, justified the regional
approach, and guided project design.




                                           5
Project design drew on the experience and lessons learned from several multi-
country HIV/AIDS projects in the region. The Bank had experience in preparing
regional multi-country HIV/AIDS projects, including the Great Lakes Initiative on
HIV/AIDS Support Project (GLIA)5, the Abidjan-Lagos HIV/AIDS Transport
Corridor Project, the African Regional Capacity Building Network for HIV/AIDS
Prevention, Care, and Treatment (ARCAN), and the Treatment Acceleration Project
(TAP). The IRAPP project drew on critical lessons learned from these projects (if also
historical hindsight recognizes that many of these projects were subsequently not
reviewed well by IEG), including the need for a strong project facilitation office
(PFO) answerable to IGAD management.6 The project’s design also included a role
for UNHCR in project implementation in the refugee camps in the IGAD region,
which was modeled on the GLIA experience.

Despite drawing on past experience, the implementation arrangement design was
extremely ambitious and complex. Implementation arrangements involved
numerous implementers at various levels, including IGAD (with project management
split between Djibouti and Kampala), the NACs, UN Agencies (in Somalia and at
refugee sites), local implementing partners (NGOs) and health centers. As shown
throughout this ICR, the project would struggle with the limited capacity of many of
the implementers (particularly IGAD, the NACs and many IPs), lack of adherence to
reporting needs (financial and otherwise), and inefficiencies in the fund flow. Another
issue was the large number of clinics and public health centers that were ultimately
equipped to provide relevant preventative services under the project. As the
discussion on outcomes will show, many were too far away from critical border
hotspots and thus out of reach of CBMPs, whilst those that were closer were far away
from facilities offering follow up services (for example ART).

A significant shortcoming in the project’s design was related to its PDO(s) and
results indicators. The project settled on two PDOs, rather than one, and the first
PDO was complex and somewhat awkwardly phrased. As described in paragraph 3.2,
PDO 1 it can be separated into two main objectives. The description of the PDOs in
the main text, moreover, did not match the wording of the PDOs in the results matrix
of the PAD (in Annex 3). Another issue seems to have been the choice of, and sheer
number of, indicators selected to monitor the project. Many of those listed in the PAD
would not be reported on or changed without authority (in the ISRs) until the
Additional Financing in 2013, reflecting key issues with the original selection of
indicators. Another core shortcoming which impacted implementation was the lack of
baseline, target and actual value data provided for monitoring purposes. The first ISR
which included baseline and target values (albeit only for UNHCR populations) was
in October 2010, almost two years into the project. As discussed in the M&E section,
this was a result of delays in developing a regional M&E monitoring framework, and
the reliance on complex behavioral surveys to inform several PDO indicators.

The design did anticipate nine sources of risk and mitigation measures, however
some important ones were not sufficiently spelled out. Adequately identified risks
in the PAD related to the possible deterioration of political relations among IGAD
states, withdrawal of member states from IGAD for political reasons, duplication of
efforts, uncertain relations between refugees in camps and the surrounding
communities, the fragility of member states resulting in major population
displacements, inadequate support provided under the national AIDS programs from
member states, weak capacity of IGAD to manage the project including M&E, and
capacity constraints related to fiduciary management. Envisaged mitigation measures
were vague, and included the usual measures to ensure solid supervision and capacity
building. However, the multitude of risks related to complex multi-country
implementation arrangements with a multitude of partners (including potential issues
with contracting UNHCR and UNAIDS) were not fully identified and spelled out.
Whilst M&E was mentioned, the specific risks related to the difficulties of monitoring
CBMPs, including the reliance on a regional monitoring framework and surveys for
the collection of data (not yet developed), were not sufficiently highlighted.

A QER in December 2007 picked up on some of the design limitations, however
many recommendations were not addressed. A Quality at Entry Learning Review
prepared by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) acknowledged a number of positive
aspects to IRAPP’s design such as the use of a multi-donor trust fund for a regional
operation. However, it suggested a number of improvements, including strengthening
the clarity and consistence of the PDO (i.e. for example clarifying what was intended
by the inclusion of “treatment” in the PDO and the absence of any mention of
“treatment” in the results matrix, but the inclusion of “care” in the matrix which was
not mentioned in the PDO), inadequate arrangements for a baseline survey that was
likely to hamper M&E efforts, and the need to understand better the target
populations.

While the project was approved (June 28, 2007) and became effective (Sep 24,
2007) in a timely manner, overall the project was not ready for implementation,
and important constraints that would negatively impact early and subsequent
implementation (discussed below) were not anticipated and given due recognition.

2.2 Implementation

The project was implemented between 2007 and 2015 in two phases. A first phase
from effectiveness in September 2007 to November 2012, financed by an IDA grant
of US$ 14,508,000 from the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF) and 2) from the
effectiveness of Additional Financing in May 2013 to the end of the project in June
30, 2015, financed by a Grant from CIDA (Canada) in the amount of US$ 7,622,380.
From its first original closing date of December 2011, the project extended its closing
date five times, largely to make up for a slow initial start to implementation and
subsequent delays with disbursement. Following initial challenges discussed below,
implementation improved somewhat following a Mid Term Review (MTR) in
December 2010 but particularly only during the second and final phase of the project,
during implementation of the Additional Financing.




                                           7
Following effectiveness, the project was plagued by implementation delays for
more than a year, linked to the delays with signing of various contractual
agreements. It was not until about a year after project effectiveness in 2007 that all
member states (except for the three regions in Somalia) had signed implementation
agreements with IGAD. The separate agreements with three regional administrations
in the former Somalia (Somaliland, Puntland and South-Central Somalia) took even
longer. Furthermore, it took several months to agree on the location of the Project
facilitation office (PFO), eventually agreed to be located in Kampala. The signing of
the contract between UNHCR and IGAD for the implementation of the refugee camp
sub-component was also delayed because UNHCR procurement guidelines were not
acceptable to the World Bank. It took a year to resolve this matter through a World
Bank Managing Director’s waiver approved on September 10, 2008.7

With the contractual agreements in place, implementation progress until 2010
was generally slow linked to variations in capacity and implementation
arrangements. Due to severe capacity constraints in IGAD (the PFO) and the NACs,
implementation in Kenya and Uganda did not start a year after the other member
states. In Somalia, early implementation was also problematic: different to the other
countries who implemented through the NACs, between 2008 and 2011 UNAIDS
took responsibility for the implementation of programs in three regional
administrations in Somalia, given the lack of a government there. Rather than funding
local IPs directly, Somalia UNAIDS and Nairobi UNAIDS set up contractual
arrangements with WHO to counter their own weak capacity. Implementation was
slow and administrative costs high, resulting in funding shortfalls for local IPs and
activities on the ground.

A Supervision Quality Enhancement Review (QER) launched in October 2009
highlighted a number of challenges that impacted early implementation. The
supervision QER launched because of slow implementation progress, noted the need
for 1) stepped up PFO support towards fostering cross border relations at hot spot
sites which had languished, 2) strengthening financial and project management at
central and national level which was hampering the timely transfer of funds and
implementation at all levels, and 3) an urgent need to review the M&E framework,
still without baselines and targets with the project unable to report implementation
progress. The QER also noted an overall severe delay with on the ground
implementation and suggested postponing the planned MTR from March 2010 to
December 2010.

Challenges and recommendations were further identified and elaborated on in
the MTR in December 2010. It noted the need to further address implementation
bottlenecks including the need to: 1) review the inefficient system of disbursing
against annual work programs of the MOH and consider instead a system to fund
bottom up, targeted annual work programs of the NACs; 2) reconsider the working
arrangements and MOUs between IGAD, UNAIDS and UNHCR in lieu of slow

  In the absence of a standard agreement (contract) form for Borrowers to use when contracting
UNHCR under Bank- financed projects, the original project sought a waiver on three procurement
policy issues: (a) Bank policy to impose sanctions in the event of fraud and corruption; (b) Bank right
to inspect and audit accounts of UNCHR or its agents; and (c) Policy to require application of Bank
procurement rules and selection of consultants under the agreement with UNHCR. MD waiver was
obtained on September 10, 2008 for an envisaged contract of US$5 million.

                                                   8
    disbursements and challenges of obtaining regular reports and financial inefficiencies;
    3) improve the performance of the NACs vis a vis FM, M&E and implementation
    support, by stepping up Technical support provided to them by the PFO; and 4)
    improve the performance of local IPs by establishing a system of technical support
    provided by the NACs. The MTR also noted the need to urgently address the M&E
    data needs, including the BSS baselines in selected hotspots of IGAD member states
    which had still not been completed.

    By addressing some of the bottlenecks outlined above, implementation during
    the period 2010-2012 picked up, however several challenges remained. The
    December 2010 MTR made note that within a year, much of the capacity building
    recommendations of the QER had been addressed. The ISR on October 2010 was the
    first that included relevant baselines and targets for M&E, although the PDO indicator
    baselines and targets reflected those of the UNHCR target populations only (rather
    than UNHCR + hotspot populations). There were some signs that IPs, with the
    support from the project, were finally providing services and cross border activity
    and coordination efforts were more visible. The May 2011 ISR (6) noted that the
    biggest improvement in disbursement and implementation had come about by
    addressing the MTR recommendation to disburse directly against bottom up NAC
    work programs (rather than annual MOH work programs which required an added
    level of approval and lacked targeting and local knowledge). At the same time, key
    challenges remained:

   Local Implementation Partners (IPs) were multiple in number hence difficult to
    oversee. They had varying degrees of capacity and many were considered not to be
    performing well. The Bank’s requirement for the IPs to deliver Statement of Expenses
    (SOEs) moreover resulted in frequent disbursement delays due to the sheer multitude
    of implementing actors.

   Capacity constraints and high turnovers at the NACs was a key challenge. Turnover
    negated any capacity building efforts provided by the PFO. Transfers to the local IPs
    continued to be often delayed, reporting to the PFO was not always adequate, and
    support to the local IPs not always sufficient.

   The experience with the UN agencies was difficult. The MOU with UNAIDS was
    binding, so the agency continued to be funded without delivering much impact, with
    their MOU still intact until the Additional Financing in 2013. The relationship with
    UNHCR was also challenging, with the PFO frequently noting the lack of adequate
    reporting and accounting for their work.

   The Quality of Data used for the M&E monitoring was questionable. Although the
    ISR in October 2010 first populated the indicator fields with data, BSS survey data (to
    track most PDO level indicators) was still not included and the quality of institutional
    data provided remained largely questionable (see discussion on M&E). The data
    quality issues thus made it difficult to assess implementation progress.

A number of financial management and reporting problems surfaced in 2011,
which ultimately resulted in the delayed processing of the Additional Financing
until 20138. CIDA had expressed early interest in providing Additional Financing to
the project upon closing, however a number of critical bottlenecks prevented this
financing from being processed speedily. An audit report in 2011 had identified that
substantial sums advanced to Djibouti, UNAIDs/Somalia and other member states had
not been accounted for (see detailed discussion in FM section). As a result, the Bank
made the effectiveness of the AF conditional on the relevant parties to submit
outstanding audit reports (eventually achieved by May 2013), and disbursement (by
IGAD) conditional on relevant parties accounting for their expenses (resulting in first
AF disbursements to countries commencing only in early 2014). By November 2012,
the project had fully disbursed its funds, the AF was still not processed, and until
early 2014 (when the AF began disbursing), IGAD and the NACs and IPs were
funding their operational and program costs out of their own pocket ensuring
continuity in implementation, with the understanding that this would be retroactively
financed once the AF became effective. UNHCR also experienced a halt in
disbursement (although also continued to implement using own resources), largely
because the amendment of the renewed but strengthened agreement between IGAD
and UNHCR was also delayed, concluding only in March 2014 (with transfers
occurring as late as June 2014).

Implementation of the AF, between early 2014 and 2015 largely proceeded
without any major difficulties. The AF was designed to continue the existing
program, scale up interventions in a number of new hot spots, and help disseminate
the regional strategy for improved HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care of
services directed at migrant populations. Support provided moreover was broadened
beyond solely HIV/AIDS, including reproductive health services and a strengthened
focus on gender issues. Implementation of the AF was also spearheaded by a new
TTL leading the project from the Bank side, and a new coordinator and team in the
PFO demonstrating renewed commitment and proactivity. The MOU with UNAIDS
in Somalia was not renewed, and IGAD (the PFO) instead took on the challenge of
providing direct support to the local IPs in Somalia. The original policy waiver
obtained for IGAD to enter into an agreement with UNHCR was replaced with a new
waiver that emphasized reporting and accountability (albeit this ended up having
limited impact). Non-performing local IPs were weeded out by the PFO, financial and
M&E reporting became more regular, and the capacity of the NACs improved, owing
to stepped up capacity building efforts at all levels.

The biggest remaining issue pertained to the results framework and project
reporting, discussed in detail in the subsequent section.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The initial choice of a large number of PDO and PDI indicators was problematic
and led to continued revisions and the formal adoption of changes with the

given the MU IP rating of the project.

Additional Financing in 2013. Changes to indicators in the ISRs were done
throughout the first phase of the project without authority and restructuring, until a
final set of indicators were only formalized with the processing of AF in May 2013.
The original and published PAD listed five KPIs for PDO 1, two KPIs for PDO2, and
14 intermediary indicators. As shown in the early sections of the ICR, a combination
of dropping and revising key indicators on April 2008 (ISR2), October 2010 (ISR5),
and May 2013 (AF effectiveness) ultimately led to a simplified and tightened results
framework largely considered appropriate for assessing the two PDOs: six KPIs for
PDO1, one KPI for PDO2, and eight intermediary indicators.

While the formal revision of the original indicators was notable, dropping all of
the indicators related to project management and M&E is questionable. Keeping
such indicators and tracking these could have continually alerted the task team on
weaknesses in this area. All intermediary indicators designed to capture achievements
related to component 3 were dropped at the beginning of project reporting (in ISR2).
They included two indicators related to project coordination and management, two
indicators related to capacity building of NGOs and IGAD member states in M&E,
and four indicators developed specifically to assess progress towards a regional M&E
and regional surveillance system. Maintaining some such indicators could have
targeted the focus on important capacity building activities, clearly needed at all
levels during project implementation.

Many of the baselines for PDO1 level indicators were included in the ISRs two
years into the project, and erroneously covered UNHCR populations only. It
should have covered both hotspots AND UNHCR populations. With the exception of
two indicators (PCMTCT and STI), baseline, target and “actual values” for most of
the KPIs for PDO1 for hotspots and refugee populations were dependent on data
obtained from complex behavioral surveillance surveys (BSS). Due to delays in
carrying out these surveys, and in subsequent data analysis, the BSS data for UNHCR
populations was completed only in 2009, whilst the BSS data for hotspots even later
in 2011/2. ISR (5) in 2010 was the first to use the UNHCR BSS baselines and targets,
which detrimentally would remain the sole baselines and targets until the end of the
project. Indeed, whilst the delay in obtaining the BSS baseline data meant that no
baselines were ever established for 2007 (the start of the project), an oversight also
meant that the 2009 UNHCR BSS baselines and targets were never updated to include
the Hotspot Baseline BSS, which became available in 2012.

Furthermore, BSS end-line data collection was never carried out for Ethiopia,
and neither baseline nor end-line BSS data was collected for Djibouti and
Somalia. It is not clear from discussions with the project team of why this data was
not collected for the three countries, but the general contention was that it was a
combination of political difficulties, capacity and funding constraints that prevented
the BSS from being completed. Furthermore, the UNHCR data baselines in the ISR
reporting template did not include baselines or targets for Somalia, Ethiopia, and
Djibouti, rendering reporting on those largely ignored.

The “actual values” of PDO indicators 1, 5,6, 7 reported in ISRs from 2010
onwards (with the exception of Somalia and Djibouti) were derived from routine
administrative data. An end-line BSS for UNHCR populations intended to inform
several of the PDO indicators (in the final ISRs) was never carried out and the end-

                                          11
line BSS hot-spot data intended to inform most of the PDO1 KPI indicators became
available only in August 2015, after project end. From 2010 onwards thus, routine
administrative data from UNHCR and country HMIS systems was used to report
actuals for most of the KPI indicators (alongside informing the intermediary
indicators) in the ISRs. This data was erroneously contrasted with UNHCR
population baseline and target data in the ISRs, resulting in the reporting of skewed
(and more favorable) results.

The quality of administrative data that was used for reporting both the KPI and
intermediary indicators was questionable, particularly until 2012 when a
regional M&E framework was finalized. A regional M&E framework was
envisioned to be the basis for many of the results chain indicators for IRAAP,
particularly many of the intermediary indicators. Without an agreed regional M&E
framework CBMP indicators were not introduced into national M&E frameworks.
This regional framework was not prepared until August 2012 and endorsed only in
October 2012 as it was dependent on the development of a regional HIV/AIDS
strategy which was delayed. In the interim, i.e. until 2012, the administrative data
reported in the ISRs was from routine program monitoring, existing HIV databases,
supervision and auditing data, but questions remained about the relevance and
veracity of the data collected. Administrative data (submitted in routine quarterly
reports by the NACs/MOH and UNHCR, which were reported in ISRs only after
2012 (4 years into the project), drew on national HMIS systems adapted to the new
regional M&E framework, and considered to be more reliable.

The problems with M&E and project reporting were the result of capacity
limitations and errors at all levels. At the outset, the first issue was the complex
results framework, which was dependent on significant levels of capacity to collect
data from numerous target populations, sites and countries. The role of the PFO was
to ensure the BSSs were carried out in good time, and to support the NACs and
UNHCR in their efforts to collect administrative data from the IPs, and then analyze
this data to be used for routine project monitoring (particularly in the absence of the
BSS). The initial delays in obtaining such data can partly be attributed to capacity
limitations by the PFO, which was not adequately staffed to coordinate activities,
follow up with UNHCR as well as the numerous IPs, and handle monitoring and
analysis of considerable amounts of data. The lack of baseline, target and value data
two years into the project (until ISR 5, 2010) resulted in the downgrading of the
project to Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Efforts to pay greater attention to M& E issues following the MTR at the end of 2010,
the completion of the baseline UNCHR BSS in 2009 and the Hotspot baseline BSS in
2012, the adoption of the regional results framework in 2012, and the appointment of
a new M&E expert at the PFO level in 2012 were notable, however little could be
done by the PFO (or the Bank) to verify data submitted by the numerous
implementing partners. UNHCR moreover often reported its administrative data with
delay, and the end-line BSS was never completed. Discussions with UNHCR reveal
that the organization did not deem it feasible to track separate indicators for a
relatively small investment in their overall portfolio. On the Bank side, project
reporting was skewed (towards the positive) by the fact that hotspot population data
was used to report “actuals” values of PDO indicators 1, 4, 6, 7 in the ISRs, and this


                                           12
was compared with the baselines that represented UNHCR populations only (which
were never updated).

Considering that IRAPP was viewed as a pilot project, and there is strong
interest in Cross Border and Mobile populations globally, dissemination of
material beyond the region and the member states was limited. Learning and
research from regional studies funded under the project, including HIV/AIDS among
pastoralists, HIV/AIDS along the main transport corridors, and a study on the gender
dimension of HIV/AIDS were notable but their dissemination was limited. The
project did publish and present key findings in a number of regional conferences,
including the different International Conferences on HIV/AIDS and STIs in Africa,
and organized the IRAPP 1st International Conference on CBMPs and Pastoralists in
IGAD Member States. However, there were few efforts to reach audiences beyond the
immediate stakeholders and region, and only few advocacy and communication
activities were organized to promote utilization of M&E data at the country or
regional level. In part, the limited dissemination of these studies, including some of
the BSSs can be attributed to quality concerns expressed by the TTLs (some of the
samples in BSS surveys for example were extremely small and not always
representative).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards:

The project was classified as category B and medical waste management plans
for each target country were disclosed, however in Sudan and Somalia with
delay. During appraisal, Sudan and Somalia did not have medical waste management
plans but Sudan had a plan under development and it should have been disclosed prior
to effectiveness. By the time of the Mid-Term Review in 2010, Sudan and Somalia
were still not in compliance. To resolve the problem, Health Care Waste
Management Plans (HCMPs) were prepared for all individual project sites in Sudan
and Somalia and financed under the project.

Financial management and disbursement:

IGAD struggled with financial management and procurement capacity
throughout the first phase of the project. Although IGAD’s (i.e. the Djibouti
office) financial management capacity was found to be satisfactory during appraisal in
2007, the October 2009 supervision QER noted a lack of robust financial management
capacity at the PFO level (the Kampala office), which led to delays in payments to the
state NACs, and as a result delays in payments to the IPs. Financial management
capacity was subsequently strengthened as noted in a financial management review by
the Bank in June 2011, however an audit in August 2011 for the calendar year 2010
found continuing issues including a late annual work plan for 2010, and weak control
over payments and commercial bank reconciliations at the PFO. The project did not at
any time recruit a procurement specialist or contract such services (raised often by the
Bank), instead preferring to rely on the existing capacity in IGAD. A post
procurement report in October 2011 moreover noted that the PFO in Kampala was not
complying with requirements to send to IGAD headquarters in Djibouti the
supporting documents for procurement of activities at PFO level.

                                          13
Financial management capacity was equally problematic on the side of the NACs
during the first phase of the project. NACs were not reporting FM on time, IFR
quality when submitted was weak, and they were not sending out regular audit
reports. Training on FM to NACs was provided but generally the issue was high staff
turnover so training effects were negated. In the audit report for the period ending
December 31, 2011, the auditors expressed qualified opinion on the project financial
statements: i) US$535,769 advanced to Somalia- UNAIDS and US$ 250, 469
advanced to Djibouti were unaccounted for; (ii) project activities in South Sudan were
not audited; and (iii) US$300,315 relating to advances to other member states had not
been accounted for at the time of the audit. In addition, the audit report for UNHCR
for the year ending December 31, 2011 had not been submitted to the Bank.

By the end of the first phase of the project in 2012, some FM challenges persisted
but were proactively addressed as conditions for processing the AF. In November
2012, the project was fully disbursed and the Bank launched a financial management
assessment to determine whether IGAD had effective and acceptable financial
management in place to manage the proposed Additional Financing (AF) from the
Canadian Trust Fund. The assessment noted progress made to address the financial
issues by IGAD, but also revealed risks that needed to be mitigated prior to the
proposed Additional Financing, especially the management of advances and follow up
of accountability reports from implementing entities. Accordingly, the processing of
the AF was made dependent on a number of effectiveness and disbursement
conditions: IGAD submits overdue audited reports for UNAIDS Somalia by April 30,
2013 and South Sudan by June 30, 2013; and IGAD halts disbursement to entities that
have not properly and fully accounted for Bank funds entrusted to them.

Countries took longer than expected to meet the effectiveness and disbursement
conditions, delaying effectiveness of the AF to May 2013, and disbursement to
early 2014. Audit reports were eventually submitted, including the submission of
remaining audit reports from relevant countries, which led to the effectiveness of the
Additional Financing on May 2013. Disbursement, however, continued to be delayed
further. Under the new grant, and tied to the AF, unless countries accounted for 70%
of the previous grant, no new grant was provided. This did cause a further delay in the
transfer of funds to several national and thus local IPs: the disbursement conditions
were only met in December 2013, and the first installment of funds to member
countries was not made before early 2014. The amendment of the agreement between
IGAD and UNHCR was also delayed and concluded only in March 2014 and the
process of transferring funds to UNHCR only commenced by June 2014.

There was evidence that FM capacity both at the level of IGAD and the NACs
improved with the Additional Financing until the end of the project. By April
2013, the ISR noted that the PFO was adequately staffed, not just with program staff
but also fiduciary staff including an internal auditor (albeit a Procurement specialist
solely for the project was never recruited) and was considered of sufficient capacity to
manage the project during the AF period. Intensified FM support missions were
carried out (once a quarter visit to each country including the IPs) and IGAD prepared
regular annual action plans and reported periodically to Bank management. At the
level of the NACs, problems were resolved with recruitment of designated
accountants in South Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti. In addition, accounts technicians
were recruited on a short term basis to support the NACs and IPs to document and

                                          14
submit expenditures reports in a timely manner. This included increased collaboration
and contact between the PFO and the NACs. The audit report of January-December
2013 expressed a clean audit opinion on the project’s financial statements confirming
improved FM arrangements.

One issue that caused delays in disbursements throughout, even during the AF
period, was the intricate nature of reimbursing against SOEs. The standard Bank
system of requiring comprehensive statements of expenditures (SOEs) from
implementing partners (IPs) and their sub-contractors as well as the delivery of
burdensome progress reports before the disbursements for expenditures could be
approved, was considered problematic by many. Under these circumstances, many IPs
financed contracted activities from their own resources, and where this was not
possible, activities were substantially delayed because implementation often took
place in the year following the year in which they were planned. These problems were
aired by all member states at the IRAPP Annual Review Meeting in October 2012.
Client requests for Reporting based on forecasting (a reposts based disbursement
system) was denied by the Bank. This was largely done because the experience with
the NACs had generally not been good and the Bank FM experts advised against it.

Finally, despite the challenges encountered, the disbursement profile illustrated
in Section H (I) of the datasheet overall seems to be relatively steady. This can be
largely explained by the large block disbursement transfers made to the UN agencies
(UNAIDS and UNHCR), as well as the numerous project extensions.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The project triggered Bank, government and donor attention to transient
populations and refugees, and the importance of cross border collaboration and
targeting for HIV/AIDS capture. The next phase of support needs to build on the
lessons learned from this project, and expand support beyond services linked to
HIV/AIDS towards more comprehensive care. The Bank is supportive of continued
attention paid to transient populations and refugees in the Horn of Africa. On the post
completion operation, the Bank’s discussions under the Horn Africa Initiative in the
Social Protection unit seem to be taking a slightly different direction, and the Bank is
not very likely to pick up some of the project activities. The Global Fund on the other
hand is exploring ways to provide some funding for IGAD to sustain some of the
activities previously financed under the project. In the meantime, the Bank team will
continue to engage Governments in the region and elsewhere on the economic and
social importance of supporting transient and refugee populations in Africa and
beyond.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Whereas a split evaluation prior to the AF and after the AF was considered, the
review team eventually decided that this would not be an accurate or helpful
representation of the project, for the following reasons: 1) the AF occurred near the
very end of the project; 2) the AF funding was largely spent on activities that were
carried out prior to the AF becoming effective (as retroactive reimbursements); and 3)
the indicators in the AF were all used prior to the AF (without formal authorization)
and only formalized in the AF.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: The overall relevance rating is substantial.

The relevance of the objectives:

The PDOs were and remain relevant to the Bank’s priorities and development
objectives including progressing towards the twin goals of the World Bank group,
and contribute to 1) ending extreme poverty and 2) promoting shared prosperity of the
bottom 40%. The PDOs moreover are in alignment with the basic objectives of the
PRSPs and CPSs of the IGAD countries which include a focus on addressing health
issues and reaching the poor. Conflict and economic factors continue to increase the
number of transient and refugee populations that need support. HIV/AIDS is no
longer the threat within IGAD member states and among CBMPs as it once was and
services today generally should focus on those beyond HIV/AIDS. At the same time,
HIV/AIDs services should be specifically targeted towards hotspots such as border
crossings where truck drivers spread the disease in the region through use of sex
workers. IRAPP’s second objective, namely to “Establish a common and sustainable
regional approach to supporting these populations in the IGAD member states”also
remains relevant. As a regional program IRAPP has stimulated close collaboration on
many sensitive and important regional public health issues and has therefore remained
relevant to the public health policies of all IGAD member states.

The relevance of the design:

Despite some design issues, notably related to the results framework, the project
design generally focused on a number of practices that continue to be relevant today,
which include i) drawing on global expertise and an existing evidence base to develop
technical interventions; ii) drawing on local capacity to identify and address the needs
of transient populations (through the use of local IPs); iii) drawing on regional and
political commitment and planning and embedding the project within a regional
implementing partner; and iv) making use of existing institutions at various levels
(albeit the relevance of some could be questioned – see below). The regional element
under PDO2 largely remains relevant, including the fora, strategies and tools to
support standardization and harmonization for CBMPs support (albeit beyond
HIV/AIDS) remains relevant. M&E design, however, was ambitious and encountered
challenges in monitoring results and achievements. The project team did refine and
shorten the long list of indicators envisaged originally in the PAD to monitor project
progress, albeit without formal authority until the processing of the Additional
Financing in the latter phase of the project.

The relevance of implementation:

Whereas some of the implementation remains relevant, other elements could be
re-considered in future projects. Community based organizations, local IPs (CSOs),
and district health authorities continue to be relevant actors serving the needs of the
project’s target populations. UNHCR and UNAIDS both remain relevant partners
given their comparative advantage on refugees and HIV/AIDs services, respectively,
although their working relationship with IGAD was not always clear straightforward.
Despite the continued relevance of implementation, future projects could nevertheless

                                          16
consider a number of questions including, for example: 1) how to better position
NACs given their capacity constraints, limited mandate on HIV treatment (i.e. ART),
and lack of authority vis a vis the MOH and actual implementers being the DHOs; 2)
whether a strategy to fund UN agencies, given their large overhead costs and
dependence on IPs to deliver services (and reporting challenges), is absolutely
necessary depending on country context; 3) whether implementation arrangements
could be simplified- in Kenya for example, funds were transferred from Bank to
IGAD- MOF- MOH-NACs-DHO - IPs (creating costly overheads and inefficiencies),
and fewer but larger local IPs could be contracted in target sites; and 4) how best to
develop, maintain and ensure appropriate M&E systems to adequately capture project
impact.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Project efficacy is rated Substantial

Overall, the achievements of the IRAPP need to be viewed in light of the difficult
socio-political context in which the operation was executed, its ambitious goals in
light of modest institutional capacities, and its relatively meagre resources
(US$23million) for a regional project covering six countries.

Overall, Efficacy is rated as Substantial, as justified in table 2: PDO 1 can
generally be separated into two main objectives a) Increase Preventative Action
concerning HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and mitigation in selected sites in the
IGAD member States and b) Reduce misconceptions (concerning HIV/AIDS
prevention, treatment and mitigation) of cross border and mobile populations,
refugees, IDPs, returnees and surrounding host communities. Table 2 assigns the
relevant indicators to the different PDO objectives, and shows that part (a) was
generally achieved (even exceeded) and is rated as substantial, whereas part (b) was
generally not achieved and is rated as modest. A meaningful assessment of PDO1 (b)
achievements is constrained by incomplete data (see box 1 below). PDO2 indicator
targets were achieved, and can be rated as substantial.

       3.2.1 Evidence on the Achievements of PDO1 	Increase preventative action,
and reduce misconception of cross border and mobile populations, refugees, IDPs,
returnees and surrounding host communities concerning HIV/AIDS prevention,
treatment and mitigation in selected sites in the IGAD member States. According to
the wording, PDO 1 can be split into two objectives, assessed separately below: a)

                                              17
increase preventive action (in target sites), and b) reduce misconceptions (of target
populations).

        Part a) Increase Preventative Action concerning HIV/AIDS prevention,
treatment and mitigation in selected sites in the IGAD member States. As summarized
in table 2 above, 2 related PDO indicators as well as 5 IO indicators were achieved or
surpassed, and one partly achieved. This renders the achievement of this outcome
substantial.

The project largely succeeded in significantly scaling up the capacity for
preventive action in the selected project target sites. As detailed in Annex 2
(output per component), IRAPP supported IPs and health centers to deliver relevant
services to target populations in a) UNHCR sites, and b) hotspot sites. Within the 48
sites that were supported, IIRAP equipped health facilities to provide VCT in 93
facilities, STI services in 97 facilities, PMTCT in 69 and ART in 34 facilities. In
addition, through its local implementing partners, the project supported an extensive
network of local support groups, associations and educators to deliver services. The
increase in preventive action in target sites was largely captured by the intermediary
indicators, with the datasheet showing that these indicators were achieved.

Data suggests that the number of clients who received treatment for STI
(sexually transmitted Infections) in the hot spots and UNHCR sites combined
also grew significantly during the course of the project. Institutional data from the
providers suggests that since the onset of the IRAPP, a total 112,287 clients have
received STIs services, surpassing the project target of 65,021clients. The PDO
indicator (3) on this was surpassed.

The percentage of HIV/AIDS positive pregnant women who were referred for
ART to reduce the risk of mother to child transmission (PCMT) also improved
in the hotspot and UNHCR sites and met its target. This was largely reflected in
the achievement of PDO indicator 2. Institutional data collected from the providers
suggest that the number of pregnant women attending IRAPP supported health centers
and testing for HIV increased steadily until 2014. Out of the total number of pregnant
women who tested for HIV, 1.3% in 2015 found HIV in their blood; all of whom
were referred and received ART for the prevention of the transmission of the virus
(meeting the indicator target of 100% referred). Notable too is that the trend of HIV
among pregnant women in the IRAPP supported sites was reduced from 2.6% in 2011
to 1.3% in Jun 2015 (Figure 3).

There are some indications of innovative approaches carried out by the
implementers to ensure adherence of target populations to ART. Adherence (not
tracked under this project) is a critical element of preventive action. VCT sites
supported under the project were often far away from sites offering ART, so
individuals who tested positive likely faced time consuming challenges to access
treatment. This was on top of possible logistical challenges for mobile populations to
ensure adherence to ART and replenish ARV drugs, all of which is important for
preventing the spread of the virus. The project and PFO did not collect data on
adherence to ART however some isolated information on adherence to ART is
available for Nimule (South Sudan) in 2012 (table 3). Here, implementing Partners
and Ministry of Health staff were diligent in maintaining some records on adherence,
with the positive outcomes attributed to the specific actions of local IPs supported
under the project. The local IP at Nimule for example introduced mobile phones to
contact and remind clients; organized and supported outreach services to remote areas
to replenish/refill drug supply; distributed food to clients on ARV to support
recommended nutrition regimes; social workers conducted home visits for continued
counseling and psychosocial support; and community awareness raising campaigns
were conducted through FM radio talk shows.

Finally, the project substantially increased the number of people with access to a
basic package of health, nutrition or reproductive health services (although the target
was not quite achieved), increasing coverage from 7,500,000 to 10,400,000 people,
and raised the number of sites mainstreaming gender into the HIV/AIDS programs
from 0 – 48.



                                                                                 19
        Part b) Reduce misconceptions (concerning HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment
and mitigation) of cross border and mobile populations, refugees, IDPs, returnees
and surrounding host communities. As summarized in Table 2 above, none of the
related 4 PDO indicators were achieved, rendering the achievement of this outcome
modest.

The efforts and strategies to reduce misconceptions around HIV/AIDS and the
change of behaviors under the project were notable. The project funded the
promotion and distribution of a substantial number of condoms through the peer
educators, associations, and PLWHAs. Safer sex practices including correct and
consistent use of male and female condoms have been promoted at both health facility
and community outreach intervention in all IRAPP sites. IRAPP’s Project Facilitation
Office (PFO) worked with Member States and UNHCR to ensure availability and
accessibility to condoms by all the target population at hot spots. Since the onset of
IRAPP, a total of 16,545,983 condoms were distributed to the target population in the
project sites, which surpassed the intermediary indicator target by 100%.

Despite such efforts, measurable results of these efforts were largely
disappointing, as reflected also in the four PDO indicators. This can generally be
linked to the fact that 1) changing behaviors is historically challenging; 2) measuring
(and tracking) a change of behaviors and knowledge on transient populations is even
more challenging as the cohort changes continually; and 3) the lack of data collected
for UNHCR populations (see Box 1 on the challenges linked to the PDO relevant
indicators), and the short timeframe between the baseline and end-line, misses out a
larger proportion of the target population from being adequately assessed. All of the
“reduce misconception” related indicators were PDO indicators, none of which were
achieved.

Box 1: Limitations to Assessing achievement of indicators relevant to PDO1(b)
      The data from the datasheet in this ICR for PDO1 indicators 1, 4, 6, 7 was not
       used to determine indicator progress. As discussed in the M& E section of this
       ICR, and in the preamble to the datasheet (and comment boxes), baselines and targets
       reported on in ISRs erroneously reflected UNHCR populations only, whereas actual
       values reported were for hot-spot data only (hence not comparable). The below
       computes progress on these indicators by comparing the 2012 BSS hotspot baselines
       (which existed but were never used for ISR reporting) with the end-line BSS hotspot
       data (which was provided after project end), as depicted in detail also in Annex 11.
      For PDO indicators 1, 4, 6 and 7, only progress on hot-spot populations can be
       reported, meaning truckers, sex workers and youth (male and female). It is not
       possible to assess impact of the project on UNHCR populations (refugees etc) for
       these indicators, given the lack of survey data provided for those populations.
      The achievement of targets for PDO indicators 1, 4, 6, and 7 for Ethiopia,
       Somalia and Djibouti cannot be determined. The BSS for hotspots for both these
       countries was never completed.
      The actual value data for PDO indicator 1, 4, 6 and 7 is disaggregated into the
       different individual target types as analyzed in the BSS and reported in the
       ISRs. In the datasheet of this ICR, this data was aggregated into female/male, in
       order to match the aggregated baseline and target categorizations used throughout
       project monitoring in the ISRs.

                                           20
       Reported progress on PDO indicators 1, 4, 6 and 7 does not reflect the entire
        project duration. The baseline BSS data for hotspot populations for the majority of
        PDO indicators is from 2011 (published 2012), and the end-line BSS hotspot data is
        from August 2015 (one month after project end).
       Given the specific target populations (by country and type of individual) it is not
        possible to find or use any secondary data to fill the data gaps of the project. As
        such, the extent to which progress on outputs and outcomes can be reported on is
        limited and incomplete.  

With the exception of (North) Sudan, knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and
misconception has generally improved in the hotspots, however not a single
target was achieved. BSS data in Figure 6 shows that the Percentage of refugees and
IDPs targeted aged 15 to 49 who both correctly identify three ways of preventing the
sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions about HIV
transmission has improved for some but not all countries/population groups. Of the
data available, all categories showed improvements with the exception of FSW,
Truckers and all youth in Sudan, as well as Male youth in South Sudan and perhaps
surprisingly Female Youth in Kenya (See Annex 11). Not a single country achieved
its target for any of its population categories. Once again, the lack of data from
Ethiopia, and UNHCR sites prevents painting a full picture on achievements.

Despite some isolated exceptions for some categories in Uganda, there was very
little increase in the percentage of males and females undergoing voluntary
counselling and testing in the hot spots and targets were generally not achieved.
VCT is a fundamental entry point for prevention, care, and treatment and support
services for HIV infection. As detailed in Annex 11, using BSS hotspot data for the 4

countries where data is available, the only improvements during the duration of the
project are with Uganda Sex workers and Youth (both Female and Male), Truckers in
North Sudan and Female Youth in Kenya. Of all categories, the only target that was
achieved was for female Youth in Uganda. Whereas 57% were undergoing VCT at
baseline, at end-line 81% were, surpassing the target of 77%.

With some very isolated exceptions, condom use with non-regular partners has
significantly worsened in all countries at hotspots, and none of the targets were
achieved. Figure 4 below shows condom use at last sex with a non-regular partner
among men and women aged 15-49 in target areas. As detailed in Annex 11, this has
generally worsened with time, with the exception of South Sudan Truckers, and
Kenya Sex-workers, where this improved by 1 percent. In all other countries amongst
all categories condom use worsened, including from 60% at baseline, to 30% at end-
line for Sudan Female Sex Workers, far below the target of 80% the project hoped to
achieve. No data was available for Ethiopia and for UNHCR sites to provide a
complete picture.

With some exceptions, generally condom use at last sex with transactional
partners among men and women 15-49 in hotspots has improved, however
targets have not been met. Improvements were evident in all countries and
categories, except Male Youth in Uganda, Sudan and Kenya, and Sex-workers and
female youth in South Sudan (Annex 11). Only one category achieved the desired
target: South Sudanese truckers increased their condom use with transactional
partners from 65% at baseline to 83% at end-line, which is significantly above the
target of 79%. Again, no data was available for Ethiopia and for UNHCR sites to
provide a complete picture.

        3.2.2 Evidence and Achievements of PDO2 : Establish a common and
sustainable regional approach to supporting these populations in IGAD member
states. As summarized in table 2 above, one related PDO indicator and two related IO
indicators were achieved, rendering the achievement of this outcome substantial.

As detailed in Annex 2, to achieve PDO2, the project funded and facilitated a
significant number of cross border consultations, meetings and workshops. IRAPP,
moreover, served successfully as a platform for regional capacity building and
collaboration among the respective member states and specifically among the NACs
and Ministries of Health, to jointly address HIV and other issues of common interest.
IRAPP also funded several analytical papers designed to broaden regional knowledge
of CBMPs, although the quality of these studies is variable.

The development of a regional strategy for improved HIV/AIDS/STI prevention,
treatment and care services directed to cross-border and mobile populations,
refugees and IDPs was achieved in October 2012. Today the strategy is guiding
member countries in addressing HIV and AIDS in the region building on lessons
learnt so far in implementing regional HIV and AIDS responses. The strategy
adequately achieved the aim of i) identifying critical regional level priorities that
IGAD member countries should address collaboratively; ii) identifying harmonized
and appropriate HIV service provision to the populations that move from country to
country and are highly vulnerable to HIV infection and contribute significantly to new
infections in the countries they interact with; iii) acting as a tool to leverage national
level resources to provide HIV services to cross border and mobile populations; and
(iv) strengthening regional and country level mechanisms for effective planning,
implementation and monitoring and evaluation of HIV services provided to cross
border and mobile populations. The strategy was developed, printed and distributed to
all NACs and MOH of IGAD Member States, including the Regional/Provincial and
District Health Offices.

In addition, seven harmonized protocols were developed and adopted by all
states. The PFO led the process for harmonizing protocols in the region with
emphasis on supporting countries with expertise and resources to implement the
harmonized policies and protocols at all cross border and hotspot sites. The project
target to develop harmonized protocols on VCT, PMTCT, TB, STIs, ART, OIs and
PEP was achieved by 2010. In total, seven draft harmonized protocols were
developed, printed twice and distributed to all health facilities at the selected hotspots
supported by IRAPP. Relevant manuals, wall charts and standardized referral charts
have also been developed, printed twice and distributed. Health personnel at hot spots
were trained on the harmonized protocols, forty three health facilities across the
Member States implemented the harmonized protocol, while 44 health facilities used
the IRAPP’s referral chart (see discussion below); which in both cases surpassed the
target at the end of the project period, 30th June 2015 (Figure 7).

Harmonized cross border referral strategies were developed for the benefit of
CBMPs, although the efficacy of this has yet to be monitored. A cross border
referral system was developed which meant that those who had been tested HIV
positive and had agreed to commence a pre-ART could continue this protocol and
advance to the follow-up ART protocol with the appropriate drugs and in any IGAD
participating country other than where the pre-ART was started. This was an

                                            24
important step because any break in the pre-ART and ART treatment would make
patients more susceptible to HIV infections in future. While the principles of the
referral system were developed and patients received record cards and referrals to
cross border clinics, there was no monitoring of the efficacy of the referral
arrangements to make possible an evaluation of the extent to which the system was
successful, irrespective of its clinical impact.

While it is evident that PDO2 (PDI 5) was met, perhaps one question is whether
the common regional approach to CBMPs is sustainable. The regional
collaboration and cross border activities and harmonization efforts were coordinated
and funded by the PFO through the project, which is not being renewed. Whilst a
regional strategy and protocols are in place, the funding constraints make it
questionable of how they can be regularly updated, in the absence of one coordinating
institution pushing this agenda.

The role of other funders

The activities designed to reach the PDOs benefited from the contributions of
governments, and contributions from the various IPs and UN Partners. All of
them contributed their own funding to deliver relevant services that were supported
under the project. The project provided funding to existing structures, agencies and
organizations whose mandate include the provision of support towards HIV/AIDS
services including CBMPs (albeit their focus on CBMPs was strengthened under the
project).
3.3 Efficiency

Rating: The efficiency of the project is considered Modest.
The efficiency analysis of the project aims to determine whether there was an optimal
use of project funds in the delivery of the expected outputs/outcomes, i.e. the degree
to which the project maximized its outputs/outcomes with the available resources. It is
important to note that, there was no economic analysis done during appraisal of the
project. Further, the interventions were multiple and individually on very small scale.
Furthermore, as explained in the previous sections, the project’s M+E experienced
many shortcomings particularly in capturing disaggregated cost and output/outcome

                                               25
data and therefore making a quantitative analysis difficult. This analysis, provided in
greater detail in the Annex of this report, is therefore more qualitative.

Economic Rationale of the Project as Stated in the PAD was strong: The rationale
for public funding of the project depended on its re-distributional considerations, to
reach CBMPs in order to contain the HIV/AIDS epidemic and avert the threat it posed
to the region’s economic growth, development and poverty alleviation efforts.

Potential public and private benefits were significant and the returns on
investment could have well been significant. The private benefits of the project are
accrued by citizens who have been able to identify infections and take action to
control the effects of AIDS and remain in the work force and generate incomes. For
example if 5 percent of the estimated number of all males aged 15-49 in all the hot
spots (9,690) were to continue living and earning the average annual per capita
income in the IGAD region (about $1,200 per year) instead of dying and earning no
income then those males would generate an income of about $11.6 million per year.
Over 20 years the present value of the income earned would be $136 million. This is
well above the present value of IRAPP’s cost and does not even take account of the
value to children of having an income-earning father in the household rather than a
father who was deceased. Of course, the percentage of males who stay alive instead
of dying is only an estimate. It needs to be verified by a sound M&E system.

A second set of private benefits of being HIV-free is the reduced cost to families of
the burden of children born with HIV together with the prospects that uninfected
children have for opportunities to mature into productive members of the workforce.

Public benefits are accrued through the reduction of the cost of public health
programs that would be necessary if HIV/AIDS spreads across borders and places
increased pressures on existing public health services. While all these net benefits are
real, estimating their value is difficult and speculative because there are no data on
average incomes of the population with and without HIV/AIDS.

The achievement of improved collaboration among NACs with respect to HIV/AIDS
during this project’s implementation will assist in fostering better relations in other
areas of potential intra-regional collaboration. The efficiency of this project can be
assessed in terms of its benefits for relations between countries. Improved trust
resulting from enhanced collaboration among countries on HIV/AIDS issues will
have secondary benefits in terms of improved relations on other matters such
migration, river basin management, food security, intra-regional trade, political
cohesion and security issues.

The Cost Effectiveness of the Key Interventions tends to be substantial,
according to the literature and experience from elsewhere (see Table 2 in Annex
3) While it is not possible to provide project specific results on cost effectiveness due
to M+E shortcomings under the project, it can be deemed that overall interventions
were cost effective particularly those targeting female sex workers because HIV
prevalence amongst sex workers and their clients is commonly 10 – 20 fold higher
than amongst the general population. With high rates of client change, the potential
for onward transmission of HIV from an infected sex worker to other clients or


                                           26
partners may be more than 100 times greater than from other people living with HIV9.
In addition, sex workers who have other STIs (especially ulcerative STIs such as
herpes simplex virus [HSV] – 2 and chancroid) are more likely to transmit HIV,
particularly in settings where men are uncircumcised. Together, these factors may
contribute to a differential in HIV transmission potential of more than 1000 times
compared with lower-risk populations.

At the same time, a number of issues negatively affected efficiency of the project.
Despite an extremely ambitious project design, the grant allocated to it was
comparatively small (USD 23 million) making it difficult to achieve efficiency gains
using a regional level approach. Secondly, implementation was done by many
implementing partners- at regional, international and national, sub-national and local
levels, and since the grant was small, the activities they implemented were not to
scale and again efficiency gains were lost. Further, due to bureaucratic obstacles and
coordination problems amongst the IGAD member states, implementation of a
number of activities was slow, and the project had to be extended numerous times for
lack of disbursement.

A particularly important efficiency measure is the percentage of project funds
used, and how this was used. As is shown in table 4, even though the eventual
utilization was at 94%, the absorption and utilization of the funds was skewed more
towards project management expenditures with core project activities less well
funded; especially the IGAD led activities of harmonizing and standardizing
approaches and sharing information and lessons learned at only a dismal 10%.
Expenditure on activities targeting CBMPs was ultimately only half the original
budget. The below table compares the original budget with the utilized budget to
derive an indication of the general pattern of project funds absorption and utilization.

On a positive note, the project used existing institutions to deliver services, and
bore only a small part of the service delivery costs. The project relied on UNHCR
to reach the refugee populations and the National AIDS Commissions together with
the Implementing Partners at the local level to reach the various cross boarder and
mobile population groups in the hot spots. Under the arrangement and especially for
the hot spots, the project bore only a small part of the service delivery costs leaving
the national governments and IPs to bear the larger portion of the costs. For example,
the project did not purchase ARVs, test kits etc. Because of this arrangement, the IPs
as reported in the August 2013 aide memoire were able to continue project
implementation and still meet and surpass cumulative targets as well as the key
intermediate outcome targets for the year without receiving project disbursements
from IGAD during financial year 2012/13 owing to the delay with processing the AF.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Living with HIV/AIDS leads to poverty because it saps human energy and makes
remunerative work difficult. As a result, those with AIDS are typically poor such
as female sex workers. If untreated moreover, HIV/AIDS causes death which has a
devastating impact on family welfare and in particular on the surviving children.
Through its various programs IRAPP has played a role in reducing the probability of
HIV infection and death from AIDS among CBMP and surrounding populations. It
has also fostered the establishment of PLHIV support groups in communities to
alleviate the impact of AIDS and assisted them with the provision of food and other
support. The capacities built and interventions supported under the project are likely
to have an impact on poverty reduction and social development way into the future.

Furthermore, towards the end of the project with the Additional Financing, the
project provided increased support to gender related aspects, in particular on
gender related violence, which is a common problem among CBMP groups.

                                          28
According to the Sept 2014 Aide Memoire, the project mainstreamed reproductive
health and gender activities throughout its supported interventions, and increased
family planning uptake for PLWHA. With funding from the Additional Financing, a
comprehensive package of SGBV prevention services was being delivered to the
communities and HIV Post Exposure Prophylaxis was successfully integrated into the
package of services delivered to survivors of SGBV at the project sites (supported by
the project).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project built capacity at regional level, national level and sub-national level
to reach CBMPs. At regional level, the project significantly strengthened IGAD to
manage a substantial regional program with its member states. IGAD in turn
strengthened the capacity of the NACs to manage the implementation of the program,
which in turn supported the capacity building of local IPs and health center staff. The
PFO arranged for a number of successful workshops and training aimed at capacity
building in the states. The NACS worked closely with the district health authorities to
contract and supervise the local NGOs and CSOs to deliver services. Similarly,
UNHCR supported local service providers in delivering services.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project benefited CBMPs beyond the provision of preventative HIV/AIDS
services. The scope of the project was expanded beyond the narrow focus on
HIV/AIDS services, towards the provision of reproductive health and services related
to gender violence. The Additional Financing made this angle more explicit. More
broadly the project addressed economic and sexual vulnerability of CBMPs including
refugees and returnees, using HIV programs as an entry point. Gender mainstreaming
in HIV/AIDS has long been recognized by IRAPP as a logical response to the impact
of HIV/AIDS on health of women in the region. Establishment of support groups and
PLWHA associations promoted solidarity and contributed to building social capital in
some of the vulnerable groups. Beneficiaries of these activities included orphans and
vulnerable children, women who engaged in sex work, and PLWHA. The IRAPP
PFO worked with National AIDS Commissions across IGAD member countries to
target economic empowerment interventions at cross border and mobile populations,
prioritizing PLHIV among sex workers, host communities and communities living at
hotspot areas. The purpose was to empower these target populations economically
through raising their incomes and thus assuring their livelihoods.

The project also facilitated diplomatic correspondence across barriers, and
facilitated the leveraging of additional resources for IGAD. The project brought
together officials from countries/entities which had tense diplomatic and political
relations. They rallied together in the fight against a major public health threat and
united in implementing IRAPP. Another outcome is that IGAD was able to leverage
additional resources because of the Bank project. IGAD leveraged additional funding
support from GIZ, UNFPA and IPOM which thus indirectly contributed to the
observed outcomes of the project.




                                          29
Finally, with the communique of IGAD and decision of the Ministers of Health of
IGAD member states, the visa fee for CBMPs accessing free treatment at cross border
health facilities has been lifted.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The beneficiary surveys were the end-line BSS surveys, which were conducted at
selected hotspots in each of the target countries, with the exception of Ethiopia.
The end-line BSS for the hotspots (with the exception of Ethiopia) was completed at
the end of 2014 in selected sites and findings were disseminated to selected
individuals in the various country Ministries. A BSS end-line in the UNHCR sites
was never completed. One regional meeting was also held, as organized by IGAD for
the consultant who prepared the end-line BSS to share the findings. The findings are
largely reflected in the above discussed project outcome section and show variations
in impact of project activities on the CBMPs surveyed.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

A principal risk to the development outcomes is linked to the lack of continued
funding towards the objectives. There are real prospects that the IRAPP model of
joint responsibility shared between a gradually increasing member state role along
with a gradually declining IGAD/UNHCR role in combination with a constant highly
skilled, small and efficient PFO to provide facilitation and advisory services can be
sustainable. This, however, requires continued funding which to date has not been
identified.

Even with funding, conditions for sustainability and achievement of the
development objectives would be dependent on a number of other factors, many
of which are currently not guaranteed. This includes ensuring that effective
institutions such as state or private health facilities are more thoroughly engaged,
relationships between member states remain positive, and the threat of escalating
conflict in some of the target countries is not realized (South Sudan, Somalia,etc.). In
addition, monitoring and evaluation challenges related to assessing the outcomes of
interventions provided to CBMPs would also need to be addressed, and continued
funding for cross border activities and services would have to be assured. Because
none of these factors can be guaranteed at this point, the risk to the sustained
outcomes is rated as significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

   (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The Bank team was comprised of staff with a range of operational experience,
nutrition technical expertise and country specific knowledge. The Bank made
strenuous efforts to ensure that this project was well prepared though a Quality at

                                           30
Entry Review (QER) of an early draft of the project document and a Regional
Operations Committee (ROC) review, approving the final design. The Bank’s
appraisal team ensured the project design took into account lessons from previous
projects, devoting considerable effort to fine tuning the project modalities in the light
of experience with similar regional projects supported by the Bank. The project
appraisal team moreover had done a good job supporting the various member states
by facilitating their negotiations with IGAD on the project’s objectives and content.
Without that effort the project might never have been submitted by IGAD.
A number of issues nevertheless are evident which would have significant
repercussions in subsequent implementation. Despite the attention to its
preparation, and the various consultative meetings, the complexity of project design,
choice of a large number of implementers and their capacity constraints, and the
potential efficiency implications related to that could have been more prominently
foreseen and flagged. Moreover, the results framework was weak because key
indicators were not well chosen and baselines were not agreed upon and selected. The
reliance on complex baseline surveys for the monitoring of many of the PDO
indicators should have raised a red flag. At the QER and final (ROC) review the
project team was commended but doubts were expressed by some members about the
quality of the results framework. The issue however was not addressed by the project
team and not further followed up on by Bank management. A supervision QAG
assessment shortly after approval was generally satisfied with the project’s relevance
and design at entry, however did express concerns over the lack of clarity of the PDO
and inadequacy of baselines that would hamper M&E. Again, there was little follow
up on these issues.

Another shortcoming was the failure to notice or flag at the ROC or before that
agreements between member states and IGAD, and UNHCR and the World
Bank were required before IRAPP’s operations in a country could start. As noted
already, completing these agreements took over a year, significantly delaying
implementation. It would have been more efficient if at least the details of the various
agreements (including exceptions to Bank policy) had been endorsed by all parties
before IRAPP was presented to the Board. The inevitable result was a seven months
delay in the effectiveness date and a longer delay before project activities could start.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Task Teams carried out supervision missions often jointly with regional and
country counterparts. The project was supervised during the tenure of two country
(Regional) Directors and three Task Team Leaders (the first two based in
Washington, the third in Uganda), responsible for the supervision of the project.
Through joint supervision missions often jointly carried out with IGAD, the PFO
country counterparts and partners and reliance on specialists based in the country
offices, the project team provided guidance and inputs to the Governments and
implementing partners, and maintained ongoing dialogue with external stakeholders.
At the same time, it is not clear whether supervision activity was sufficient. Between
FY10-13, almost no SPN budget was spent, surprising given the needs and large
numbers of countries to cover.


                                           31
Early issues and challenges with implementation were noted in the 2009
supervision QER and the 2010 MTR, however many issues were addressed too
late. Both reviews were important supervision instruments which identified key
bottlenecks to implementation and made appropriate recommendations many of
which were eventually followed up on, however perhaps much later than they should
have. The MTR itself was already close to three year into implementation. Moreover,
the supervision and quality assurance instruments failed to identify the informal
changes made to the indicators in ISRs throughout the first phase of the project.
Overall, the failure of the task team to speedily prevent and address critical capacity
weaknesses of the implementers, disbursement challenges, and financial management
weaknesses of the clients prior to 2012 was partly reflective of the quality of
supervision. The failure of the task team to address many of the M&E issues,
including roll out of the baseline and end-line surveys, as well as not to restructure
prior to the AF in 2013, was detrimental to implementation.

From 2012 onwards and with the processing of the AF, supervision improved,
key actions were taken. Following a challenging start, and some improvements
noted since 2010, there were intensive efforts to improve the quality of
implementation particularly from 2012 onwards. More regular supervision and
correspondence with the implementers by the task team (now based in Uganda)
ultimately corresponded with increased capacity of the implementation agencies,
financial management and M&E. Previous weaknesses in project coordination and
financial management capacity at the level of IGAD and the PFO were addressed by
ensuring recruitment of a solid coordinator and financial management staff. With
Additional Financing (AF), the task team ensured that the contract with UNAIDS in
Somalia was not renewed (instead it was agreed that the PFO itself would support
implementation), that a new MOU with UNHCR was developed to ensure greater
reporting accountability (whilst well intended, this would prove to have little impact),
and that financial management issues were finally addressed (through conditions
linked to the AF itself).

However, M&E issues and project reporting remained critically problematic
even after 2012 and with the AF. Indeed, whilst project results indicators were
further refined, and indicators finally formalized with the Additional Financing, the
baselines and targets of the PDO1 (b) indicators which erroneously only reflected the
UNHCR sites were carried over into the AF phase, with the new task team unaware of
this. As the datasheet to this ICR shows, the reporting on project outcomes would
have been (even) less favorable had the correct baselines and targets been used.
Furthermore, actual values for many of the PDO1 (b) outcome indicators had to be
reported using interim administrative data, since the task team together with IGAD
did not succeed in ensuring a timely finalization of the hotspot endline BSS (which
became available only one month after the end of the project – albeit not for Ethiopia
and Djibouti, nor for the UNHCR sites.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

With both quality at entry rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory and supervision as
Moderately Unsatisfactory, therefore the overall Bank performance rating is
Moderately Unsatisfactory taking into account the overall challenges prevalent,
particularly until AF (4-5 years into the project).

                                           32
5.2 Borrower Performance

    (a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government involvement and political commitment to the project was strong
despite early delays in formally endorsing the project. Original conditions of
effectiveness and dated covenants (including critical policy changes) were met in a
timely manner (aside from FM). A project steering committee of NAC focal points
ultimately formed, and whilst meetings were held infrequently, they resulted in clear
decisions and support activities (including the cross border meeting and workshop
activities related to PDO 2). This commitment and ownership continued throughout
the project life. At the same time, it took about a year for all governments to sign
agreements with IGAD to formally endorse and support IRAPP, reflecting the
difficulties in organizing themselves as a regional group.

The NACs, moreover, suffered from a number of capacity constraints that
affected implementation. Aside from meeting as representatives of the member
states in the steering committee, the NAC focal points (usually Directors) were
involved in coordinating the implementation of the project through the local
implementing partners, and attending supervision missions. A key issue was that
many of the NACs did not have the broad authority over the health sector (including
components such as ART provision) that the Ministry of Health had, many did not
have the authority to make financial commitments on behalf of the governments, and
not all of the NAC directors had the confidence of the ministers. In practice, their role
in implementation and supervision of activities was one of coordination, because
technical supervision responsibility of many activities such as the health response was
the mandate of the Ministries of Health. Provided only with limited funding under the
project moreover10, NAC capacity in general was weak, and efforts to strengthen this
capacity by the PFO and others were often negated by high levels of turnover. Issues
with M&E, Financial Management, audit compliance remained a key concern until
the AF became effective.
At the decentralized level, supervision of actual implementation was often the
role of the District Health Authorities who were not directly supported under the
project. It was ultimately their mandate to recruit and supervise the various local IPs
directly, and capacity here too varied. In most cases, the project was implemented and
coordinated by the DHOs, and the IRAPP work plans became integrated into most
DHOs work plans from 2010 onwards. District health Authorities were not provided
with additional incentives, funding or training to ensure that local IPs or health
centers within their catchment area, which varied in their performance, were
performing adequately and accordingly. The ISRs (and project implementation
arrangements) make little reference to district level capacity, despite their role in the
actual contracting and supervision of IPs in many countries. Within these constraints,
the DHOs in most cases were engaged and implemented activities as best as possible.


10
   NACs received very little funding under the project. NACs received around US$25,000 per year for
operating costs, with most of the funding they received earmarked for the contracting of IPs
(approximately 200,000 per year for IPs).

                                                33
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The IGAD successfully served as the regional agency charged with coordinating
the implementation of the project and engaging country counterparts. IGAD,
with its office in Djibouti, was the implementing agency for IRAPP but the day to day
management of project activities was the responsibility of the Project Facilitation
Office (PFO) located in Kampala.11 IGAD engaged the services of other agencies
with specific expertise, primarily the NACs and the UN agencies, and generally had
the confidence of the member states. The achievement of every single intermediary
indicator was notable, and ultimately reflected the improved commitment and
capacity of IGAD particularly in the latter half of the project.
A key difficulty and concern to IGAD’s performance was linked to the split
between the secretariat in Djibouti and the Project Coordination office in
Uganda. The distance between Djibouti and Kampala resulted in a less than perfect
environment for consultations between the two, despite the availability of modern
communication systems. In addition, the IGAD secretariat had many other
responsibilities and could not possibly provide close supervision of the PFO or of the
project. This was primarily a weakness in the design of the implementation
arrangement, rather than directly related to the performance of IGAD.
PFO performance and capacity was generally weak and only improved
particularly after the first phase of the project had been completed. The 2010
MTR identified key bottlenecks to implementation, M&E issues and lack of cross
border and supervision activities, just some of the issues attributed to capacity
weaknesses within the PFO and IGAD in general. One of the problems in the PFO
was an extremely high turnover of staff, with a total of three PFO managers
coordinating the project since its inception. A financial management assessment in
April 2012 (and ISR 8, June 2012) revealed serious internal working issues within the
PFO, noting serious staff turnover, management and leadership problems, affecting
staff morale and performance. Following this review, the PFO’s effectiveness
improved for the latter part of the project, attributed in part to the hiring of a new
project coordinator, M&E and other staff.
Several examples after 2012 highlighted the proactive nature of the PFO to
address key challenges linked to implementation more broadly. For one, IGAD
carried out a review of all of the local IPs being contracted, and slashed their numbers
under the additional financing based on their performance. Furthermore, by 2012,
some countries had not used their funding allocations, and there was no mechanism to
reallocate to better performing countries. Low performers in particular were Djibouti,
Puntland, Kenya. IGAD made the decision to bypass key layers. In all three countries,
IGAD took on and managed the hiring of IPs directly following the Additional
Financing arrangement, which sped up disbursement and implementation. IGAD was
one of the only regional institutions to provide support to the three territories of
Somalia, directly, and with full commitment, despite this not being reflected or
monitored in the PDO indicators.


11
     The location was a joint decision by the member governments after a delay of more than a year.

                                                    34
The performance of the local implementing partners varied but is reported to
have improved in the second phase of the project. Until 2010/12 a number of local
implementing partners were not delivering, and the NACs and PFO were struggling to
supervise them adequately. In 2012 a reenergized PFO weeded out the non-
performers and made numbers more manageable. In addition, the performance of
local IPs benefited from increased capacity at the level of IGAD and the PFO and
improved Bank leadership and supervision after 2012. In some countries such as
Uganda, they benefited from regular review meetings with district Health Officers
(charged to hire and supervise the IPs), regular supervision from the
Bank/government project team, as well as from the presence of partner organizations.

The experience with UN agencies contracted to coordinate project
implementation in hotspots in Somalia (before 2012) and the refugee camps was
challenging. In Somalia, the arrangement with UNAIDS until 2012 was problematic.
UNAIDS sub-contracted services to WHO, who in turn contracted the local IPs.
Accordingly, overheads were high and impact on the ground and reporting on
progress and impact was limited. With the AF, the UNAIDS contract was no longer
extended, and the IGAD and PFO took on to directly support the local IPs in the three
entities of Somalia. There were challenges with UNHCR too, although mainly on the
reporting front. Whilst UNHCR remains a solid partner with the comparative
advantage and capacity to support implementation of interventions for refugees, the
working relationship between IGAD and UNHCR was sometimes challenging, in
particular with regards to the provision of information needed for reporting and
accountability of funds. Despite a revised MOU to address these issues with the
Additional Financing, IGAD reported such challenges to the end. In discussions with
them, UNHCR generally felt that the amount provided to the organization was too
small to always justify separate reporting efforts beyond that of its overall program.
Moreover, they felt that the indicators they were expected to report on were at odds
with their own indicators, and the MOU could have been clearer in what was expected
from them.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Recognizing the complex implementation arrangements and challenges, eventual
corrective actions and improvements in the latter half of the project, both government
and implementing agency performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory, therefore
the overall rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Complex regional projects require particular support and scrutiny to ensure
quality at entry and subsequent implementation success. In the project design, due
attention should be given to the political economy of participating countries, with
sufficient follow up to determine the application of the recommendations made in the
Bank’s various review meetings and QERs, all of which contribute towards a
project’s quality at entry. Subsequently, sufficient supervision funds vis a vis needs
should be allocated to such regional projects (as reflected in the supervision fund
disbursements), to carefully monitor implementation and make corrective adjustments
when needed.


                                          35
Measuring behavioral change outcomes related to CBMPs interventions is
challenging and may not be advisable. Behavioral change is already challenging to
achieve, particularly in contexts deeply rooted in tradition and religion. Capturing
achievements from behavioral change efforts is even more challenging when the
nature of the targeted populations being targeted is transient. Despite this, four out of
the six PDO-1 indicators focused on behavioral change/knowledge and related
indicators. Instead, process indicators related to strengthening the inputs and services
needed for prevention may be a better way to assess progress. The project achieved
most of its intermediary process indicators, several of which could have been
considered as PDO indicators.

Careful reporting of appropriate baselines, targets and actual values, is critical
to monitor project progress and determine project success. Weaknesses in this
area, including the lack of or use of inappropriate baseline, target and value data were
a key limitation to adequately identifying early implementation problems, and
subsequently evaluating project achievements, rendering many PDO indicators not
achieved. The reliance on BSS for the majority of PDO level indicators (behavioral
change and uptake) resulted in large gaps of data for many years, and significant
difficulty in assessing project impact.

Implementation Arrangements should be kept as simple as possible. This is
particularly important in multi-country support operations. Too many implementers,
in this case, Bank- IGAD (PFO and Secretariat) -national implementers (NAC) -UN
bodies - a multitude of local IPs, can become problematic. A solution to simplify
implementation in Somalia, to have the PFO directly manage local IPs, proved an
efficient and cost effective solution.

Implementation agencies should be carefully selected to minimize problems. The
type and relevance of implementing partners should be carefully considered. The
project could have considered providing direct transfers and technical support to the
District Health Offices. NACs did not have the necessary mandate over some of the
HIV/AIDS and other related issues that the MOH has. UN agencies moreover may
not always be best positioned to deliver relevant services at low cost. And many
smaller, local implementing partners may be more capacity constrained than a few
larger ones.

Service delivery institutions invested into should be accessible to the population
being targeted. The health centers and clinics supported under the project in the
various hot spots were often too remote and far away from border crossings, thus
limiting access of CBMPs to services. Testing centers that were specifically built at
border crossings on the other hand were often too far from any follow up services
related to treatment. Innovative solutions, as pursued in some of the countries, are
required to address these shortcomings (moonlighting outreach sessions, or innovative
referral and patient monitoring solutions).

Future projects targeting CBMPs should consider targeting HIV/AIDS services
at select hot spots and broaden support strategies beyond HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS
services should be targeted specifically at a select number of highly frequented border
hot spots, where the combination of truckers and sex workers continue to fuel what
remains of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the Horn of Africa countries. The support for

                                           36
CBMP generally should be expanded beyond HIV/AIDS to include RMNCH and
health and social services.

Future projects with components on HIV/AIDS for CBMPs should not ignore
the importance of adherence when focusing on prevention: Projects should ensure
that education and testing efforts are also linked to ART treatment, which is one of
the biggest prevention measures possible. In this project, treatment and adherence was
not monitored and tracked, however it is fair to say that adherence to treatment is an
issue with mobile populations.

QERs, MTRs, and restructurings remain important quality assurance
instruments but follow up is needed to ensure recommendations are addressed:
These tools were key in identifying and addressing key implementation issues. The
effectiveness and disbursement conditions related to Financial Management tied to
the Additional Financing, delayed implementation but ensured adherence to sound
financial standards. At the same time, as already mentioned, concerted follow up is
needed to assess the extent to which the recommendations provided are being
implemented or changes adequately adhered to.

The use of a standard agreement (contract) for Borrowers when contracting UN
agencies under Bank Financed Projects is critical. Such an agreement will help
avoid the need to seek waivers, reduce contracting delays, and minimize performance
and reporting difficulties. As experienced in this project, Borrowers implementing
agencies can find it challenging to manage contracts with UN agencies and hold the
UN agencies accountable for delivery on the agreed upon services and the Bank needs
to consider this lesson when preparing a new project.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Support to Refugees, IDPs, Returnees, Surrounding Host
Communities and Cross-border and Mobile Populations. This component
included two subcomponents: sub-component 1(a) was implemented by UNHCR
(contracted through a subsidiary agreement) and focused on providing a full range of
services, including preventive, treatment and support services on HIV/AIDS to
refugees, IDPs, returnees in camps primarily through the provision of relevant goods
and services. Activities were monitored and evaluated using a regional M&E
framework (for PDI 2, 3 and intermediary indicators) as well as behavioral and
biological surveillance surveys (for PDO 1, 4, 6 and 7). Sub-component 1 (b) was
implemented by national Implementing Partners (National HIV/AIDS Commissions-
NACs)12, and district health authorities, through the delivery of HIV/AIDS services
by NGOs and local health facilities targeting CBMPs in hotspots, as well as the
surrounding host populations. The achievement of outcomes related to this component
are discussed in section 3.2. Further, the following outputs were achieved:

Under Component 1, IRAPP supported IPs and health centers to deliver
relevant services to target populations in a) UNHCR sites, and b) hotspot sites.
Whereas the original project supported 38 sites, with the AF in 2013/4, an additional
10 sites were added, bringing the total number of sites supported under the project to
48– 34 hot spots and the remaining 14 sites, refugee and internally displaced Persons
camps and IDPs (Figure 1).

Within the 48 sites, IRAPP equipped health facilities to provide VCT in 93
facilities, STI in 97 facilities, PMTCT in 69 and ART in 34 facilities (table 1).
With support from the project, the number of HIV testing and counseling sites
increased from 21 in 2009 to 93 in 2015 surpassing the set target of 80. As for STI
services, of a targeted 48 IRAPP supported sites, 90 HFs (health facilities) were
functioning and providing free STI treatment across all sites at the end of March
2015, i.e. more than 100% achievement of the IRAPP target, 80. Prevention of mother

coverage of PMTCT sites is in adequate. The trend of expansion of PMTCT sites (not
tracked as an intermediary indicator) is low compared to VCT and STI sites and
increased to 69 in 2015. The project funded rehabilitation/upgrading as well as
training activities for staff providing these services and harmonized various protocols
(under PDO2).

The upgrading of sites providing services was an achievement however many
were not within easy reach of the target population or facilities providing follow
up. Many of the public sector sites supported under the project were remote from
border areas, and difficult to access by the very people that were targeted. To address
this, in addition to local support groups carrying out outreach and moonlighting
activities (see footnote 13 below) IRAPP financed the construction of some VCT sites
centers near these points such as truck parking areas. IRAPP also financed the
construction of VCT centers in the vicinity of some hospitals convenient for the
CBMPs and the host communities (e.g. Malaba in Uganda on the border with Kenya).
Whilst such facilities provided greater access to the target population, they did not
come without challenges, as many of those remained far away from health centers
that offered treatment (ART services).

Through its local implementing partners, the project supported an extensive
network of local support groups, associations and educators to deliver services.
Important components of IRAPP’s core design were the formal and informal
autonomous support groups within the target groups and in the host communities.
Important among these groups were the peer educators from within communities who
advised their communities on HIV/AIDS issues and encouraged visits to HIV
Counseling Centers (HCTs)13, mothers’ support groups which promoted the
enrollment of pregnant women in Prevention of Mothers-to-Child Transmission
(PMTCT), truck drivers’ associations which provided counseling and support, NGOs
which provide advisory services and arranged support programs to assist people such
as female sex workers to find alternative sources of income, and People Living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) groups who provided support to others who are faced with
living with HIV and AIDS. The project tracked and met its intermediary targets in
supporting a large number of PLWHA associations in target areas, which increased
from 3 in 2009 to 56 in June 2015, exceeding the target of 4714.

13
   In some sites in Kenya and Uganda, trained peer educators addressed the distance between VCT sites and hotspots by
organizing outreach “moonlight counseling sessions” in truck queues and parking areas by peer educators at border hot spots
such as Malaba, Kenya or Uganda.
14
   The greater involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) contributes to the reduction of stigma and discrimination
and facilitates the involvement of the grass root population in HIV prevention, care, and treatment and support programs. IRAPP

                                                              40
Local groups and associations were also instrumental in educating the
community on condom use and were engaged in condom dissemination. The
project funded the promotion and distribution of a substantial number of condoms
through the peer educators, associations, and PLWHAs. Safer sex practices including
correct and consistent use of male and female condoms have been promoted at both
health facility and community outreach intervention in all IRAPP sites. IRAPP’s
Project Facilitation Office (PFO) worked with Member States and UNHCR to ensure
availability and accessibility to condom by all the target population at hot spots. Since
the onset of IRAPP, a total of 16,327,000 condoms were distributed to the target
population in the project sites, which surpassed the intermediary indicator target by
100%.

Component 2: Cross-border collaboration on the Health Sector Response to
HIV/AIDS. This component (i) provided a forum for interaction among IGAD
member states, facilitating information sharing and potential harmonization of
policies and procedures related to HIV/AIDS; (ii) developed mechanisms for
continuity of services across borders including referral systems for CBMPs in the
selected treatment sites; and (iii) developed and adopted a regional strategy for
improved HIV, STI prevention, treatment and care services directed to cross-border
and mobile populations. This was achieved principally by funding: (i) periodic
technical review meetings, study tours, and training programs; (ii) a review and
development of existing protocols and materials on selected topics (including referral
mechanisms), that could be adopted by the IGAD country health authorities; and (iii)
developing a comprehensive 5-Year Regional HIV and STI Strategic Plan focused on
the regional dimensions of HIV and STI epidemic control that would cover both the
service delivery and communication aspects.

Under this component, the project funded and facilitated a significant number of
cross border consultations, meetings and workshops to achieve development
objective 2, and establish a Common and Sustainable Regional Approach to
Supporting Mobile Populations in the IGAD States. While Cross border relations
were weak for many years during IRAPP’s early implementation, after the Quality at
Enhancement Review in 2009 which identified this weakness and recommended more
support from the PFO in fostering cross border relations, cross border consultations
aimed at harmonization, referral and other issues grew significantly. Numerous
workshops, training sessions and study programs were undertaken and coordinated by
the PFO to support IRAPP’s regional harmonization activities and capacity building
aims. Throughout the course of the project, a total of 51 cross-border meetings
(CBMs) were conducted which surpassed the target of 29 CBMs.

IRAPP served successfully as a platform for regional capacity building and
collaboration among the respective member states and specifically among the
NACs and Ministries of Health, to jointly address HIV and other issues of
common interest. The broader strategic collaboration resulted in the commitment of
the respective member states in terms of understanding the epidemic among CBMPs
through surveillance, supportive relationship among states, investments in strategic
programs to prevent further transmission of HIV, and mainstreaming of CBMP

supported establishment of PLWHA associations to increase their involvement in both health and community based HIV
prevention and control response.

programs within broader health programs to address the epidemic among CBMP. The
PFO ensured that the IRAPP platform was also used to expand its mandate beyond
HIV/AIDS to other health development priorities or common problems within the
region such as high maternal mortality, high fertility rates and non-communicable
diseases like cancer. Notably, cross border collaboration has enabled some countries
to address the waiving of immigration requirements for PLHIVs who cross borders
for care and treatment in adjacent member countries.

IRAPP also funded several analytical papers designed to broaden regional
knowledge of CBMPs. Three studies were undertaken to analyze HIV/AIDS
problems including on interstate transport corridors and stock routes, pastoralists, and
an assessment of HIV/AIDs from a gender lens. “The PFO planned the contracting of
studies on transport corridors, pastoralists and gender satisfactorily and used these to
support the implementations of the cross border program. Although they were
conducted in collaboration with the International Organization on Migration (IOM),
and presented at different occasions, some quality issues were identified which in part
restricted their further use, including more global dissemination efforts.

Component 3: Project Management, Coordination, Capacity Building and
Monitoring and Evaluation. This component focused on three main sub-
components, namely: (i) management and coordination through support for the
overall facilitation program and the establishment of the Program Facilitation Office
(PFO);15(ii) capacity building by supporting IGAD and national HIV/AIDS
authorities to fulfill their roles as the facilitating organizations for the regional
partnership for IRAPP; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in line with the
development of a regional M&E framework to monitor CBMPs. The Project fully
funded the salaries of the IGAD team under this component, and provided support
towards numerous training sessions on financial management, procurement and
project management, and provided funding for various consultancy contracts
(including to carry out the BSS surveys and some of the other studies) as indicated
throughout the write up of the ICR.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

IRAPP was designed as a complex project in a challenging socio-political
environment involving many countries, many implementing partners, and vulnerable
and hard to reach beneficiary population groups. It is important to note that, there was
no economic analysis done during appraisal of the project. Further, the interventions
were multiple and individually on very small scale. Furthermore, as explained in the
previous sections, the project’s M+E experienced many shortcomings particularly in
capturing disaggregated cost and output/outcome data and therefore making a
quantitative analysis difficult. This analysis is therefore more qualitative and assesses
(a) the economic rationale of the project as stated in the PAD, (b) the epidemiology
and cost effectiveness of key interventions, (c) analysis of implementation modalities,
(d) possible costs and benefits accruing from the project, and (e) the sustainability of
interventions.

Economic Rationale of the Project as Stated in the PAD

IRAPP was designed as a catalytic project and one of its main rationales was to
facilitate the delivery of HIV/AIDS services as a public good to targeted cross-border
and mobile populations, migrants, refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons
in order to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS and mitigate its impact at a regional level.
The countries in the Horn in Africa are among the poorest in the world with a per
capita income of less than USD 2,000, per capita expenditure on health of less than
USD 140, and health expenditure as a percentage of GDP of less than 10%16. The
countries in the Horn of Africa were greatly impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic,
and population mobility and migration, especially for highly vulnerable communities,
seen as the key drivers of the HIV epidemic in the region. Women and girls were
considered highly vulnerable and likely to be forced to submit to sexual abuse. The
rationale for public funding of the project depended on its re-distributional
considerations, to reach some of these vulnerable population groups in order to
contain the epidemic and avert the threat it posed to the region’s economic growth,
development and poverty alleviation efforts.

Epidemiology and Cost Effectiveness of the Key Interventions

The project deployed a range of HIV/AIDS interventions including Behavior change
communication, sex worker interventions, truck drivers interventions, male and
female condom promotion, control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), voluntary
counseling and testing, gender based violence interventions, prevention of mother-to-
child care and treatment. According to Table 2 with a summary of the findings of
HIV/AIDS cost effectiveness studies in Africa, these interventions are highly cost
effective. While it is not possible to provide project specific results on cost
effectiveness due to M+E shortcomings under the project, it can be deemed that
overall interventions were cost effective particularly those targeting female sex

workers because HIV prevalence amongst sex workers and their clients is commonly
10 – 20 fold higher than amongst the general population. With high rates of client
change, the potential for onward transmission of HIV from an infected sex worker to
other clients or partners may be more than 100 times greater than from other people
living with HIV17. In addition, sex workers who have other STIs (especially ulcerative
STIs such as herpes simplex virus [HSV] – 2 and chancroid and syphilis) are more
likely to transmit HIV, particularly in settings where men are uncircumcised.
Together, these factors may contribute to a differential in HIV transmission potential
of more than 1000 times compared with lower-risk populations.

Some reflections on cost-benefits

Private Net Benefits. The private benefits of the project are accrued by citizens who
have been able to identify infections and take action to control the effects of AIDS
and remain in the work force and generate incomes. For example if 5 percent of the
estimated number of all males aged 15-49 in all the hot spots (9,690) were to continue
living and earning the average annual per capita income in the IGAD region (about
$1,200 per year) instead of dying and earning no income then those males would
generate an income of about $11.6 million per year. Over 20 years the present value
of the income earned would be $136 million. This is well above the present value of
IRAPP’s cost and does not even take account of the value to children of having an
income-earning father in the household rather than a father who was deceased. Of
course, the percentage of males who stay alive instead of dying is only an estimate. It
needs to be verified by a sound M&E system.

A second set of private benefits of being HIV-free is the reduced cost to families of
the burden of children born with HIV together with the prospects that uninfected
children have for opportunities to mature into productive members of the workforce.

Public Net Benefits. Public benefits are accrued through the reduction of the cost of
public health programs that would be necessary if HIV/AIDS spreads across borders
and places increased pressures on existing public health services. While all these net
benefits are real, estimating their value is difficult and speculative because there are
no data on average incomes of the population with and without HIV/AIDS.

The achievement of improved collaboration among NACs with respect to HIV/AIDS
during this project’s implementation will assist in fostering better relations in other
areas of potential intra-regional collaboration. The efficiency of this project can be
assessed in terms of its benefits for relations between countries. Improved trust
resulting from enhanced collaboration among countries on HIV/AIDS issues will
have secondary benefits in terms of improved relations on other matters such
migration, river basin management, food security, intra-regional trade, political
cohesion and security issues.

The project in its implementation relied on using existing institutions to deliver
services. The project relied on UNHCR to reach the refugee populations and the
National AIDS Commissions/MOHs together with the Implementing Partners at the
local level to reach the various cross border and mobile population groups in the hot
spots. Under the arrangement and especially for the hot spots, the project bore only a
small part of the service delivery costs leaving the national governments and IPs to
bear the larger portion of the costs. For example, the project did not purchase ARVs,
test kits etc. Because of this arrangement, the IPs as reported in the August 2013 aide
memoire were able to continue project implementation and still meet and surpass
cumulative targets as well as the key intermediate outcome targets for the year
without receiving project disbursements from IGAD during financial year 2012/13
owing to the delay with processing the AF.

Analysis of Project Costs

This analysis compares the original budget with the utilized budget to derive an
indication of the general pattern of project funds absorption and utilization.

NB, USD 61,389 was cancelled from the original project grant.

Overall, costs for project management were high. As is shown in table 1 above, even
though the eventual utilization was at 94%, the absorption and utilization of the funds
was skewed more towards project management expenditures with core project
activities less well funded; especially the IGAD led activities of harmonizing and
standardizing approaches and sharing information and lessons learned at only a

dismal 10%. Expenditure on activities targeting CBMPs was ultimately only half the
original budget.

Project Sustainability

The IRAPP was designed to complement national multi-sectoral undertakings in
prevention, care, treatment and mitigation; however, long-term sustainability depends
on political commitments by member Governments. UNHCR already implements
HIV/AIDS programs in refugee sites and IDP camps with support from its traditional
funders and so the IRAPP supported interventions in the UNHCR supported sites will
be expected to continue without interruptions. For the CBMPs key hot spots, IRAPP
supported interventions to health units and NGOs was largely catalytic piggybacking
on already ongoing efforts/interventions and only enhancing these interventions.
Anecdotal evidence shows that these sites are still functional after project closure and
indeed they even remained functional during the gap-funding period when the
Additional Financing was being processed. Further, substantial investments in
infrastructure and human resources have been made and were left behind for the hot
spots and surrounding communities. These will hopefully promote sustainability of
the project interventions.

The main role of IGAD was to harmonize and standardize approaches by virtue of its
key role as a regional coordinating body e.g. harmonization of protocols and
guidelines for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support for mobile groups;
allowing CBMPs to get the same care and treatment in every country during their
movements; and building capacity through standardized training. This is a role that
could also be played by other existing international/regional organizations like
UNAIDS and WHO. Efforts could only be focused on promoting and encouraging
cross-border meetings, coordination and knowledge sharing.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results (End-line BSS Summary- HOTSPOTS
ONLY)
N/A

Sudan BSS

This is a follow up end-line BSS study to assess the impact of the HIV services target
cross border and mobile population in two selected sites in eastern Sudan (Hamediate and
PortSudan). This BSS survey showed that there are some variations in the results of the
study among the three target populations (FSWs, TDs and Youth) where some indicators
and behaviors has reduced and some still the same and other has not improved. This not
fully understood but could be due to cross border nature of the sites which with high
mobility and movement nature of the target population in this study.

Generally, the FSWs are younger than the TDs in both baseline and end-line studies
where most of FSWs are from the age group 18 to 24 years and the TDs are from the age
group 25 to 48 years. In the end-line study, the youth group female were 51% and males
were 49% and this made the study group almost equal in the representation of the two
sexes. Also, the difference in the age between the FSW and youth from one side and the
TDs from the other side most likely gives a room for the trans-generational sex to happen
among the study group.

In general, the FSWs and youth are living in the cross border sites with frequent
movements across borders. However, about 46% of FSWs and more than half of the two
groups spent more than month outside their community in the past year indicating the
high mobility and movement of the population in the cross border site. Among TDs, the
end-line study showed more mobility with less number of them who originally from the
community compared with baseline study (30% and 47%).

Comprehensive knowledge among the three study groups (FSWs, TDs, and Youth) is still
very low in the end-line study. The findings showed that the range of the comprehensive
knowledge is from 8% to 18%. While the results in the baseline study was not different
from these findings with range between 7% and 20%.The percentage of condom use is
higher in the baseline (84%) than the end-line study (66%) among FSWs and this show
draw back in the overall condom use which give negative impact for the interventions or
the interventions was interrupted for long period or there in new population in the area.

The HIV testing and counseling among the target groups remained high among the FSWs
and the TDs when we compared it with the youth. The average tested and counseling
among the FSWs and the TDs were more that 50% while among the youth was not more
than 20% in both baseline and end-line studies. Unfortunately, in the end-line study, there
is a reduction in all study groups who tested and received their results comparing with the
baseline study

Results-FSWS: At baseline, the FSWs had sexual intercourse with at least 21 casual
sexual partners in the period of 12 months preceding the study compared to 17 partners at
end-line. Transactional sex partners were reported by the lowest proportion of the FSWs
at both surveys with an average of 5 partners at baseline compared to 6 partners at end-
line in the 12 months preceding the survey. It was observed that 20% of the sex workers
did not use condoms with their transactional partners at baseline compared to a higher
proportion of 32% at end-line and 32% at both surveys did not consistently use condoms.
On average, the FSWs began engaging in commercial sex work at the age of 22 years at
baseline compared to 21 years at end-line. Further at baseline, 69% compared to 65% at
end-line reported consistent use of condoms with all commercial partners. Overall,
reasons cited at both surveys for non use of condoms include alcohol consumption,
familiarity with the client and offer for big pay check. The prevalence of STIs among the
FSWs was very high with 88% (baseline) and 92% at end-line having ever been infected.
At baseline, only 31% compared to 55% at end-line informed all their sexual partners
about the symptoms. FGD discussions at both surveys confirmed that the FSWs do not
share STI information with their clients as this would send them away.

Truckers: The highest proportion of truckers at both surveys reported that they work in
the transport sector at 44% (baseline) and 54% (end-line) respectively. Slightly over half
of the respondents (51%) at baseline compared to 58% at end-line were long distance
drivers with those making 1-3 overnight stops before reaching their destinations
accounting for the highest proportion at (38% - baseline) compared to 48% at end-line.
Findings from the FGDs at both surveys indicate that they stop to take a rest, check the
condition of the vehicle and as they rest, they also look for women to have sex with.
Findings indicate that higher proportions of truckers compared to those at end-line
engaged in sex with multiple partners including transactional and commercial partners.
Consistent use of condoms with these partners at both surveys was reported by a low
proportion of these truckers. Ever use of condoms was reported by only 69% of the
truckers at baseline compared to 74% at end-line.

Youth: Higher proportions of youth at baseline earned a regular income compared to
those at end-line. Further, higher proportions of youth at baseline at 95% of the youth
compared to 91% at end-line had knowledge about condoms, with 68% males and 59%
females at baseline compared to 65% males and 54% females at end-line reporting ever
used them. However, mean age at first sex for both males and females was higher at end-
line at 20 years compared to 16 years at baseline. There were reported cases of multiple
sexual partners and cross generation sexual relationships at both surveys with casual
partners who were much older for females while males had partners much younger than
them. Such youths reported alcohol consumption before sex with non-regular,
transactional and commercial sexual partners and non condom use with such partners.
Even those who reported condom use did not use them consistently.

A slightly higher proportion of youth at baseline compared to end-line of about 9 out of
every ten youths (both male and female) were aware of a place to get an HIV test. Some
70% male and 73% female (baseline) compared to 59% males and 64% females (end-
line) had ever tested for HIV. Moreover, higher proportions of youth at baseline (about 7
in every ten of the youths both male and female) compared to about six in every ten
youth at end-line knew where a person sick with HIV and AIDS could get treatment.

Discussion-FSWs: At both surveys, all the FSWs reported multiple sex partners, alcohol
consumption and some reported inconsistent condom use. Moreover, STI prevalence
among them was very high among them at 88% at baseline compared to 92% at end-line.
At both surveys, they further indicated that they do not share information on STIs with
their sex partners and even some went ahead and had sex without a condom before the
symptoms resolved.

Truckers: At both surveys, most of the truckers were long distance drivers and make
stop over along their journey not only to rest but also to have sex and thus most at both
surveys reported multiple sexual partners. Moreover, ever use of condoms was very low
at 59% (baseline) compared to 74% at end-line which translates to spreading of infections
to the general population given that most of them are married thus calling for strategies to
educate them on condom use, HCT and STI treatment.

Youth: Low proportions of both male and female earned a regular income at both
surveys hence placing them in a vulnerable situation where they can be exploited
sexually and be infected with HIV and other STIs. In addition, multiple sex partners, low
and inconsistent condom use together with cross generational relationships were reported
at both surveys which could be indicative of some economical dependence on one of the
parties given the low number of those earning regular income.

Female Sex Workers: Respondents in this category (77%) were mostly youthful (ages
18-29), with modest education (primary and secondary) (74%), without regular
wage(54%) and not married (95%). Comprehensive HIV knowledge rose from 70% at
baseline to 76% (p=0.2321). Accepting attitude towards PLHIV dropped by eighteen-
percentage point from 36% at baseline to 18% at endline (p=0.0009). Ever use of condom
remained high among FSWs at 94% compared to 95% at baseline (p=0.8454). Female
condom use is low (baseline- 47%, endline- 41%) and willingness to use it has
significantly dropped (baseline- 88%, endline- 65%, p=0.0002). The preferred places for
obtaining condoms by FSWs are bar/nightclubs/pool halls (45%), health facilities (43%)
and shops (30%). The preferred time is mainly at night (57%). There is a significant
decrease in the commercial sex encounters from 100% to 90% (p=0.0396) atendline.

There was a high prevalence of forced sex 12 months preceding the survey (baseline-
32%, endline-47%, p=0.4858). Very few FSWs seek assistance on sexual assault
(baseline 25%, endline- 21%, p=0.9092) making them vulnerable to HIV infection. Anal
sex was practiced by 20% of FSWs at endline compared with 17% at basline. Condom

                                            52
use during anal sex was 52% at endline compared to 62% at baseline. There was an
increase in FSWs seeking treatment for STI (baseline- 78%, endline- 86%), HIV testing
following STI (baseline- 60%, endline- 68%) and condom use during STI (baseline- 67%,
endline- 75%) and more FSWs were informing partners (baseline- 52%, endline- 67%)
about their STI status. Mass media is the most accessed source of information (baseline-
80%, enline- 87%), though FSWs access multiple sources of information. Nearly every
female sex worker (baseline/endline- 99%) knew a place for HIV testing and majority
(baselin- 86%, endline- 89%) had ever been tested of which most (baseline- 83%,
endline- 79%, p=0.4877) within the last 12 months. The testing was mainly done in
hospital (baseline-63%, endline- 54%, p=0.1892) and was largely client initiated
(baseline-72%, endline- 68%, p=0.4796). Nonetheless, only about half (baseline-56%,
endline- 54%, p=0.8204) shared the results with their partners.

Truck drivers:Most truckers (49%) were aged between 25 to 34 years. Truck drivers
spend most of their time away from their families and made between 1 to 5 times
overnight stops before reaching their destination (78%). Comprehensive HIV knowledge
among this group did drop slightly but the drop was not significant (baseline- 72%,
endline- 69%, p=0.4515). The percentage expressing accepting attitudes towards people
living with HIV remained low (baseline- 36%, endline- 33%, p=0.5592). Knowledge of
condoms among truck drivers is universal (100%) and there’s ease of access for those
who need them (baseline- 95%, endline- 92% in endline, p=0.1025). Yet, just about ¾
(76%) at endline and 85% at baseline have ever used. However, majority use condoms
for HIV protection (baseline- 97%, endline- 93%; p = 0.0221).

Truck drivers preferred to obtain condoms at night when there was less commercial
activity (baseline-58%, endline- 62%, p=0.5105). At endline, the most preferred places to
obtain condoms were shops (45%) and pharmacies (44%) compared to
bar/nightclubs/pool halls (51%) and shops at baseline (42%). Risky sexual practice
among truck drivers remained fairly high with about a third (31%) engaging in
commercial sex 12 months preceding the endline survey compared to 34% at baseline.
On average truck drivers have a mean of 4 commercial sexual relations per year. Slightly
more than half (56%) of those who had commercial sex had taken alcohol, while 62% of
them used a condom every time they had sex with FSWs compared with 58% at baseline.
Anal sex is practiced by 8% of truckers compared to 8% reported at baseline
(p=0.0366).Forced sexwas reported by 12% (baseline-7%, p=0.0366) of the truckers with
half having been forced by their regular partners while 41% by a non-family member.
About one in ten (9%) of truck drivers had suffered STI 12 months preceding the
assessment. Although treatment seeking is quite high (baseline-93% endline-89%,
p=0.6227), truck drivers continue to have sex with partners after confirming STI
symptoms (baseline-18%, endline-42%, p=0.04457). Nine out of ten (93%) of the truck
drivers were circumcised.

The principal source of HIV information for truck drivers was mass media (baseline-
87%, endline- 89%, p=0.3794). It was also the preferred source (baseline- 86%, endline-
83%, p=0.3306).Three quarters (75%) of truck drivers had ever tested for HIV compared
with 80% at endline (p=0.1261). Eight out of ten (80%) truck drivers had ever tested for
HIV at baseline compared to 75% at endline (p=0.1261). Of those who ever tested for

                                           53
HIV, two thirds took the test in the past 12 months (baseline-69%, endline-65%) and 72%
of those shared reuslts with their partners during both periods. All truck drivers (100%)
knew that HIV and AIDS treatment can be obtained from a public health facility
compared to 97% at baseline.

Youth: Majority of the youth had primary or secondary level of education (80). Only
45% of the youth were earning regular income compared to 28% at baseline. About half
(53%) of the youth reported to have been away from home for more than a month.
Comprehensive knowledge on HIV was quite low at58% among the male youth and 47%
among the females compared to 60% and 53% respectively at baseline. The youths who
expressedaccepting attitudes towardsPLWAs reduced significantly at endline with male
youths reducing from 36% to 24% (p=0.002) while females reduced from 32% to 22%
(p= 0.0048).

More males than females were able to obtain condoms whenever they need them
(baseline: males-80%, females- 60%; endline: males-83%, females- 65%. Only 12% male
and 10% female youth had used female condoms compared to 9% and 11% at baseline.
The most preferred time to obtain condoms by youth is at night (baseline: males- 35%,
females- 40%; endline: males- 56%, females- 59%). Most (65% of both males and
females) youth preferred obtaining condoms from health facility. The findings are
consistent with the baseline situation health facility preferred by a majority as the most
appropriate place to obtain condoms (females-68%, males- 74%). The proportion of
youth who reported having sex before age 15 was higher among males (28% at baseline
and endline) compared to females (14% at baseline and 12% at endline). Male sexual
debut was 15.5 at baseline and 15 years at endline, while that of female youth was 17
years for both periods. More male youths reported multiple partnerships with a
significant increase from 17% at baseline to 30% endline (p=0.0003), compared to 9% at
baseline and 12% at endline for female youth. The mean number of non-regular sexual
partners among male youths 12 months preceding the assessment was 4 at endline
compared to 3 at baseline, while that of female youth dropped from 8 to 2 during the
same period. Findings also show that male youth prefer casual relations with partners of
younger age (less than 10 years), while girls prefer partnerships less than 10 years older.

Condom use during casual sex remained low among both sexes (baseline: males-37%,
females- 39%; endline: males-36%, females-52%, Pvalue: males-0.9609, females-
0.3745). The percentage of male youth engaging in commercial sex significantly
increased from 5% at baseline to 16% at endline (p=0.0002). Likewise the percentage of
female youth engaging in commercial sex increased from 5% to 9%, though insignificant
(p=0.0959). More male and female youth took alcohol prior to casual sex compared to
baseline (Baseline: males- 25%, females- 29%; endline: males- 31%, females- 61%;
Pvalues: males- 0.6738, females- 0.0289). Overall, 6% of the youth had STI 12 months
preceding the survey, and majority sought treatment (84%). Only 44% (against 91% at
baseline, p=0.0123) of female youth performed a test for HIV when they had an STI
compared to 76% male youth (against 68% at baseline). More male youth compared to
female youth who had STI informed all their sexual partners about it (baseline: males-
33%, females- 67%; endline: males-30%, females-24%, Pvalue: males-0.8088, females-
0.0154). Cases of those youths having sex with their partners when they had STI

                                            54
symptoms also went up during endline (baseline: males-8%, females- 8%; endline:
males-14%, females-31%, Pvalue: males-0.5639, females- 0.0004). Most youth,both
male and female (baseline: males-86%, females- 86%; endline: males-86%, females-
89%), received information on HIV and AIDS in the period of 12 months preceding the
study.

The most preferred source of information was mass media with 88% male and 83%
female youth choosing it compared to 70% male and 64% female youth at baseline. A
third (34%) of female youth compared to 40% at baseline were pregnant in the previous 4
years and 95% went for ANC compared to 93% at basline. Two thirds (baseline-
65%,endline- 69%) of their partners received HIV testing in ANC. Half (50%) of male
youth and 46% of female youth were using a method to prevent unwanted pregnancy
compared to 56% and 49% at baseline respectively. The differences for the baseline and
endline are not significant (Pvalues: baseline- 0.1399, endline- 0.5572). The condom, at
80% and 35% was still the most popular method among the males and females but
reduced by five and three percentage points for both groups respectively, albeit the
reduction was insignificant (Pvalues: baseline- 0.2477, endline- 0.6115).

FSW: The results are a compilation of information obtained from a total of 268 female
sex workers. The mean age at first marriage was 19 years and 32% of the respondents
first got married when they were below the age of 17 years.

Only slightly over a half of the survey respondents had comprehensive knowledge on
HIV/AIDS. Overall, there was a non-significant (P=0.101) increase in the percentage of
FSWs with comprehensive HIV knowledge18, from 46% in 2012 to 58% in 2014.
There was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of FSW who; expressed
accepting attitudes towards PLWHA (from 38% in 2012 to 58% in 2014, p<0.001);
would buy fresh vegetables from a shop keeper with HIV (from 85% in 2012 to 95% in
2014, p=0.001); think that it should be kept a secret if a family member had HIV.

There was an increase in the percentage of FSW; who know that they can a get a condom
every time they need it (from 74% in 2012 to 86% in 2014); who have ever heard about
female sex condoms (from 81% in 2012 to 89% in 2014). Survey respondents who used a
female condom increased from 20% in 2012 to 24% in 2014.

The mean number of non-regular partners among FSW in the past 12 months decreased
from 34% in 2012 to 8% in 2014.There was a non significant increase in the percentage
of FSW; who took alcohol before having sex with non-regular partner (from 38% in 2012

  Comprehensive knowledge means knowing that consistent use of condom during sexual intercourse and having just one
uninfected partners can reduce the chance of getting the AIDS virus, knowing that a health looking person can have the
AIDS virus, and rejecting the two most common local misconceptions about transmission or prevention of the AIDS virus.

to 40% in 2014, p=0.731). FSW who consistently used condoms with all the non regular
partners significantly (p<0.001) increased from 26% in 2012 to 64% in 2014.

The survey showed that only 15% of the respondents reported to have had forced to have
sex. There was a non-significant (p=0.122) decrease in percentage of FSW who had
forced sex in the 12 months prior to the end-line BSS. The percentage of FSW who
sought for treatment after forced sex significant (p<0.001) increased from 11% in 2012 to
57% in 2014.

FSW who had anal sex with in 12 months prior to the survey significantly (P<0.001)
decreased from 24% in 2012 to 7% in 2014. There was a non-significant increase
(p=0.078) in the percentage of FSW who reported condom use at last sexual intercourse
with a man, from 61% in 2012 to 83% in 2014.

There was a non-significant increase (p=242) in the percentage of FSWs who had an STI
and sought treatment the last time a genital discharge/ ulcer/ sores (STI symptoms) were
experienced. There was a significant increase (p<0.001) in the percentage of FSW who
were tested for HIV when they developed STI symptoms, from 39% in 2012 to 65% in
2014. The percentage of survey respondents who used condoms until when the STI
resolved increased (p=0.008) from 75% in 2012 to 90% in 2014.

FSWs who received HIV/AIDS related information with in 12 months prior to the survey,
significantly (p<0.001) increased from 70% in 2012 to 83% in 2014. There was a
significant increase in the percentage of FSW who preferred to receive HIV/AIDS related
information from the following sources; mass media (from 66% in 2012 to75% in 2014,
p=0.001); health services (from 67% in 2012 to 88% in 2014, p<0.001), and from people
(from 44% in 2012 to 55% in 2014, p<0.001).

The survey showed a significant increase in the percentage of FSWs who; know of a
place where to go for HIV counselling and testing (from 86% in 2012 to 94% in 2014,
p=0.002), and those who have ever tested for HIV (from 69% in 2012 to 94% in 2014.
The percentage of FSW who received and shared their test results with their partners
increased from 44% in 2012 to 53% in 2014 (p=0.053).

The percentage of FSW who know where an HIV infected person can get treatment
increased from 74% in 2012 to 78% in 2014. Pregnant FSW who received an HIV test in
the ANC clinic increased from 86% in 2012 to 98% in 2104 (p=0.003). FSW who had
their partners tested for HIV in ANC increased from 68% in 2012 to 94% in 2014
(p<0.001).

Truckers: The survey included a total of 299 truck driver questionnaires. The majority
(71%) of truckers were long distance truck drivers. On average, the truckers said they
were away from home for 3-5 days a week (52%). About 1-5 stops are often made before
the truckers reach their destinations.




                                           56
Most of the truckers knew that using a condom correctly every time they have sex (84%),
staying faithful to one uninfected faithful sex partner (83%), and abstaining from sex
(88%) were effective HIV prevention methods. Comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge
significantly (p<0.001) increased from 53% in 2012 to 68% in 2014.

In both 2012 and 2014, all the survey participants had ever heard about condoms, and
98% of the survey respondents had ever used a male condom. There was an increase in
the percentage of truckers; who know that they can a get a condom every time they need
it (from 95% in 2012 to 98% in 2014); who have ever heard about female sex condoms
(from 72% in 2012 to 74% in 2014). Survey respondents who used a female condom
increased from 13% in 2012 to 22% in 2014.

The survey generally showed a non significant increase (p=0.013) in the percentage of
truckers who expressed accepting attitudes towards PLWHA (from 42% in 2012 to 52%
in 2014)

The mean number of non-regular partners in past 12 months was 5. There were no
significant age differences between truckers and their non-regular partners for the 2
survey rounds. There was a non significant (p==0.080) decline in the percentage of
truckers who consumed alcohol at last casual sex from 33% in 2012 to 23% in 2014.
Truckers who reported consistent condom use with all the non-regular partners increased
from 48% in 2012 to 68% in 2014 (p=0.002).

There was a non-significant increase (p=0.086) in the percentage of truckers who had an
STI and sought treatment the last time a genital discharge/ ulcer/ sores (STI symptoms)
were experienced. Truckers who disclosed their STI diagnosis to all their sexual partners
increased from 14% in 2012 to 33% in 2014 (p=0.386).

Excessive consumption of alcohol, unprotected sex, inconsistent and incorrect condom
use, lesbianism, homosexuality and multiple partners were the key behaviors perceived to
increase the risk of HIV and STI infection. When asked about the impact of alcohol
during sex, the truckers said that alcohol makes sex risky, rough, and hostile while others
are given confidence and communication becomes easy. They also felt that alcohol
makes sex exciting, enjoyable and fun. During the four weeks preceding the survey, 31%
of the respondents reported that they had taken alcohol at least once a week, 10%
reported every day, 4% reported at least once a month, and 55% reported that they did not
take any alcohol.

The survey showed a significant increase in the percentage of truckers who; know of a
place where to go for HIV counselling and testing (from 87% in 2012 to 90% in 2014,
p=0.245), and those who have ever tested for HIV (from 75% in 2012 to 84% in 2014
(p=0.006). The percentage of truckers who received and shared their test results with
their partners increased from 79% in 2012 to 82% in 2014 (p=0.453).

Youth: A total sample of 287males and 289 female youth (18-24 years) was included in
the survey.

                                            57
Knowledge of the individual HIV prevention methods was high, for example, 93% and
91% of the male and female youth respectively knew that HIV could be prevented by
staying faithful to one uninfected faithful sex partner. Comprehensive knowledge about
HIV prevention was higher among females than their male counterparts (58% vs 44%).
Overall, comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge increased by 16 percentage points for
males and 12 percentage points for females between 2012 and 2014..

The survey showed that almost all the respondents had ever heard of condoms (99%
among males and 97% among females). The most commonly known use of condoms was
HIV protection (98% among males and 97% among females) while the least mentioned
use was family planning (36% among males and 35% among females). Only 12% of the
youth had ever used a female condom, but more than 56% were willing to use them if
available.

Forty three percent of males and 47% of females expressed accepting attitudes towards
PLWHA. Ninety six per cent of the males and 95% of the females said they were willing
to care for a family member sick with AIDS in their own household. Accepting attitudes
among the female youth towards PLWHA increased by 15 percentage points between
2012 and 2014.

The survey showed more female youth (16%) who were engaged in multiple sexual
partnerships when compared with the male youth (7%). For both sexes, most of the youth
who were engaged in multiple sexual relationships were single and not married.

The mean number of non-regular sex partners was 1.9 for males and 1.5 for females.
Only 16% of the males and 18% females had taken alcohol before last casual sex. More
than 80% of the youth reported condom use during last casual sex but only 71% and 69%
for males and females respectively reported consistent condom use with all non-regular
partners. The percentage of youth who consumed alcohol at last casual sex increased
by23 and 19 percentage points for males and females respectively. The percentage of
youth who consistently used condoms at last casual sex increased by 29 and 31
percentage points for males and females respectively.

Ninety one per cent of the males and 94% of the females said they had had an STI and
sought treatment the last time genital discharge/ ulcer/ sores (STI symptoms) were
experienced. Comparison with the baseline BSS done in 2012 showed that the percentage
of the youth who developed an STI and sought treatment, increased by 4 and 9
percentage points for males and females respectively. More than half of the sampled
youth tested for HIV when they had had STI symptoms. Forty three per cent and 78% of
the respondents informed all their sexual partners when they developed STI symptoms.

Over 70% of the respondents had received information on HIV/AIDS in the past 12
months. The main sources of this information were mass media, health services and
people. Mass media was the most preferred source of HIV/AIDS information.



                                          58
The survey showed that 93 per cent of the male youth and 92% of the female youth knew
a place where an HIV test can be done. However, only 81% and 86% of the males and
females respectively had ever tested for HIV. Among those who had ever tested for HIV,
78% of the males and 76% of the females had tested in the past 12 months.

Comparison of baseline and end line BSS showed that the percentage of male youth who
tested for HIV increased by 5 percentage points. Female youth who shared their test
results with their partners increased from 62% in 2012 to 67% in 2014.

Introduction and Overview
IGAD’s Health and Social Development Section (HESAD) was established in 2005 as part of
the IGAD structure based upon recommendations of Ministers of Health in the IGAD
Member States. Consequently, HESAD received a World Bank Institutional Development
Fund (IDF) grant in the amount of US$495,000 which was successfully implemented in
partnership with all the IGAD Member States including the development partners. HESAD
developed the regional mapping assessment which uncovered high levels of mobility and
vulnerability. As a result, a regional approach was critical to providing complementary
support to ongoing country initiatives to address the HIV epidemic.

The region lacked institutions that had the breadth of knowledge, resource flexibility,
implementation experience in undertaking a multi-country sub-regional HIV/AIDS effort of
this dimension and scale. Accordingly, IGAD, based on these factors and the relationship
developed in the execution of the IDF grant, requested the Bank to assist it in initiating its
HIV/AIDS program addressing the regional dimension of HIV/AIDS, integrating national
and regional efforts. Following the implementation of the first grant (14.5 million USD)
completed at the end of May 2013, the DFATD (Canadian Fund with 7.6 million USD) was
implemented based on the same goals, objectives and components until 30th June 2015.

The program had two interrelated project development objectives i) to increase preventative
action, and reduce misconception of cross border and mobile populations, refugees, IDPs,
returnees and surrounding host communities concerning HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment
and mitigation in selected sites in the IGAD Member States; and ii) to establish a common
and sustainable regional approach to supporting these populations in the IGAD Member
States. These objectives were to be achieved through activities organized into three
components 1) Support to Refugees, IDPs, Returnees, Surrounding Host Communities and
Cross border and Mobile Populations; 2) Cross Border Collaboration on the health Sector
Response to HIV/AIDS, and 3) Project Management, Coordination, Capacity Building and
Monitoring and Evaluation.

IGAD placed high priority on substantial efforts in health physical infrastructure requiring a
large number of health workers. IGAD decided to increase basic health training to meet the
increasing demand for cross border and mobile populations (CBMPs), and to increase the
uptake of health services across the region, particularly hotspots as well as IDPs/Refugees in
selected sites. IGAD also planned to upgrade some health facilities and increase the
knowledge of primary health workers in peripheral areas; so it strongly supported
investments in the health care of general population and refugees and also surrounding host
and refugee communities. IGAD’s development policy emphasized inter-country
collaborations, sustainable services delivery and continuity of services across the borders.
Harmonization of treatment protocols as well as development of referral chart for smooth
movements of patients between health service points were fully addressed and developed.

Assessment of the outcome against the agreed objectives
The development outcome indicators for the project included five major indicators on top
of the Inter – country collaboration to show the outcome of the project implementation.

                                              61
In this regard, the project conducted both baseline and end-line behavioural surveillance
surveys in selected refugee and hot spots to measure the four outcome indicators by
setting targets following the baseline survey. On the other hand, the PMTCT outcome
indicator was found from the routine health service delivery reports. The baseline BSS
was conducted in both refugee and hot spots, while the end-line BSS conducted only at
the hot spots. Unfortunately, the end – line BSS for the refugees has not been conducted
due to the high cost incurred for the survey (150,000 to 200,000USD/site).

In general, the BSS conducted among key target groups, FSWs, truckers and youth (both
male and female) have shown some changes for VCT, comprehensive knowledge and
condom use at last sex and with the transactional sex following the end-line survey.
However, we have also observed that some of the indicators were found to be lower
compared to the end-line presented in table 1. The reason behind this may be complex as
the target groups were moving from place to place; it’s hard to provide regular
intervention programs. However, the finding is encouraging; and will help the program to
explore different strategies how to reach such kind of mobile population including
pastoralists in order to bring behavioural change. Based on the baseline and end-line
survey conducted at the IRAPP selected hot spots, the following findings are
summarized:

      The target for all outcome indicators, except PMTCT, found to be very high to
       achieve, to bring a change of 20% at the end of the project period;
      Significant improvement observed among FSWs in Uganda, youth in Uganda and
       Kenya, truckers in Sudan in terms of HIV counseling and testing in the last 12
       months; otherwise it was found low compared with the baseline findings;
      Regarding comprehensive knowledge, better improvement observed among FSWs
       in Kenya, Uganda South Sudan; truckers and Youth in Uganda and South Sudan.
       On the other hand, low results registered in Sudan among all target groups and
       that of Kenya for youth;
      In terms of condom use at last sex, the study found significant change among
       female youth in Sudan, increasing by 67%, otherwise the other findings observed
       among the FSWs, truckers and youth were either the same or insignificant
       reduction;
      The study registered improvement of condom use with transactional sex among
       FSWs, truckers and youth (male and female) in Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan and
       Sudan.

Inter-country collaboration and dialogue was established at both national and hot spot
levels involving coordinating and implementing bodies. Cross border meetings have been
held between Local Authorities and key providers of health and HIV services on either
side of the border in all hot spots. A total of 51 cross-border meetings (CBMs) conducted
which surpassed against the target, 29 CBMs. These meetings have helped to facilitate
harmonization of services, capacity building on either side of the border and using
information to improve service delivery and continuity across borders including referral
mechanism for CBMP. Some countries have formed Health Technical Working Groups
to address HIV among cross border and mobile populations and these groups have

                                            62
developed in-country collaboration guidelines on the basis of which cross border
meetings are held. IGAD and Member States developed and adopted its HIV regional
strategy to guide its efforts in addressing HIV and AIDS in the region building on lessons
learnt so far in implementing regional HIV and AIDS responses.

The achievements of the IRAPP must be viewed in light of the difficult socio-political
context in which the operation was executed, its ambitious goals in light of modest
institutional capacities, and its relatively meagre resources (US$23million) for a regional
project covering seven countries. Taking into consideration these various aspects, results
on the ground are relatively strong both in terms of expanded access to a full range of
HIV/AIDS services for the targeted populations (particularly CBMP and the surrounding
communities), and enhanced capacity of civil society organizations and the National
AIDS Commissions. Moreover, substantial investments in infrastructure and human
resources have been made and will be left behind for the hot spots and surrounding
communities. These achievements are largely tracked in the projects intermediary
indicators (not the PDO indicators), whose targets and objectives, both for PDO1 and
PDO 2, were largely met. One of the most important contributions of the project was the
production of Behavioural Surveillance Surveys and the Regional HIV Strategic Plan
which provided a stronger basis for planning future regional investments. While difficult
to quantify, the project played a catalytic role in supporting innovative approaches and
cross country sharing of experiences and good practices.

Key Challenges with Implementation

      The hotspots are all in remote areas where the buildings, equipment and other
       instruments are not available and if they were available, are of poor quality and
       condition. This hinders the provision of services with high quality; 
      High turnover of the staff at cross border sites and in implementing partners; 
      Limited comprehensive HIV services at cross border sites because of the
       difficulty encountered by some member states due to remoteness of these sites
       and some of these sites are not in the overall plan of the countries to establish
       treatment sites; 
      Weak M&E system due to involvement of many actors and levels in the process
       of reporting from the grassroots to local to district to regional to national and then
       to project level at the region office. Difficulty in getting regular NAC and other
       similar data to monitor the impact of the project where most of the sites are not
       included in the national surveys; 
      Limited fund and delay of disbursement leading to slow absorption of the overall
       project fund; 
      Variation in the capacity of the local IPs where most of them have good technical
       capacity in executing the planned activities timely. However, the financial
       capacity was very low and the project has failed to address delays in financial
       reporting of the IPs despite the high financial capacity at the project level. Also,
       finance officers in NACs were reluctant to focus on the project because they were
       busy with other big funds they have such as GF; 



                                             63
      The local IPs lack basic needs such as decent offices, competent staff, inadequate
       equipment and other means necessary for better implementation; 
      Challenges related to insecurity in Somalia and South Sudan, especially the recent
       eruption of the conflict in South Sudan; 
      Challenges related to South Sudan in addition to insecurity, low capacity of the
       staff at level of national program and local level, and lack of facilities; 
       Extension of service provision of HIV and other health services along the
       transport corridors. These corridors are busy with truck drivers and migrants and
       there is a huge need in certain stops where those population rest and hence the
       vulnerability for HIV is high; 
      Long interruption of the project implementation in Djibouti due to challenges in
       the country associated with accountability for funds received in the beginning of
       the project. This interruption has led to delay in implementation and during the
       additional financing, IGAD changed the implementation modality to deal directly
       with Djibouti in addition to Somalia.

   A. Challenges in program management

Obviously, there were many factors which delayed the implementation process. Initially,
IRAPP leaderships did not have the experience in dealing with a complex project such as
IRAPP as well as there was weak capacity in coordinating both technical and financial
teams of the project to provide strategic leadership. However, the current program
leadership came up with relatively different management style which contributed great
changes of the program implementation performance. In fact, he established a conductive
and friendly working environment and also excellent working relationships with the
member states. Other major challenges were delays in the signing of the agreements with
UNAIDS and UNHCR which also led to delays in implementation in refugees and
Somalia project sites.

   B. Challenges of working with UN agencies

UNHCR: there was a long delay in signing the first agreement with UNHCR in the
beginning of the project and that ended after one year from the launching of the project.
Many financial and audit reporting challenges were encountered with UNHCR before the
MTR and MOU revision was recommended and done after the MTR and the same
happened when implementing the additional financing. Despite that, the financial,
technical and audit reporting challenges continued. The challenge seemed to be at the
level of regional office and/or the Geneva level because most of the country offices report
monthly to the high level. Working with UNHCR is inefficient where the project has
incurred high overhead cost because of the long implementation process whereby
UNHCR received the funds and then sub-contracted NACs or other IPs to implement the
HIV and health activities for the refugees. Furthermore, UNHCR was not collaborative to
allow IGAD to supervise and monitor their activities on the ground, which created an
inconducive environment and mistrust.




                                            64
UNAIDS: UNAIDS was contracted to coordinate the project implementation in Somalia
because there were three entities. Many challenges were encountered during
implementation with financial and audit problems in addition to problems in the
implementation of project activities with the three entities. The issues led IGAD and
Somalia to decide to terminate the MOU with UNAIDS and IGAD hired an officer to
enhance the implementation of the project in Somalia in addition to Djibouti;

   C. Financial Challenges:

      Delay in rendition of accountabilities – low capacity, weak system, long reporting
       channel, absence of dedicated staff/lack of incentive;
      Low quality reports – low capacity, weak system, absence of dedicated staff/lack
       of incentive;
      Low absorption – weak capacity, long fund flow channel (e.g., Kenya),
       disbursement method (insufficient DA ceiling);
      Non-flexibility in reallocating resources within countries; 
      Successive no‐cost extension of the project. 

Lessons Learned and Recommendations

Key lessons learned are summarized below, broken down into generic lessons on regional
health investments, and those specifically related to Bank-funded operations.

Regional Health Investments
    A Regional program can complement and fill the gap for the national program in
      cross border sites for CBMPs. It can also provide services in areas which used to
      be the pure responsibility of each country separately. This was realized by
      building capacity and providing resources to address the needs of the vulnerable
      population in those areas;
    Regional integration has been enhanced through implementation of the project.
      The experience of the project could be replicated in similar other health and social
      programs and used as example for regional integration in other IGAD aspects
      such as trade leading to facilitation of economic exchange and growth among
      IGAD member states;
    The project has created linkages and forums that enhance collaboration between
      member states at all levels from the grassroots to national levels. The project also
      improved the cooperation and coordination across the borders between
      stakeholders from neighboring countries and that enhance service provision and
      ensure continuity of care across borders for the CBMPs and other vulnerable
      population;
    Capacity building of local stakeholders including public, private, NGOs and other
      IPs. Through provision of small funds to those IPs, they were able practically to
      build their capacity by implementing the project activities. In the beginning, the
      implementation was slow; however, with time the capacity improved and
      consequently the implementation of the project became faster and of better
      quality;

                                              65
   Working with UN agencies is inefficient and contributed to delays and difficulties
    in the process of implementation, in addition to challenges in their accountability
    for allocated funds to them; delays in their technical and financial reporting and
    inaccessibility of their supported sites for supervision of the project staff
   Regional investments can add value to national investments and maximize impact,
    especially for CBMPs who tend to be neglected. The main beneficiaries of this
    regional project---refugees and long distance truckers--- as well as the
    communities and individuals they interact with (e.g. commercial sex workers)
    were clearly the appropriate groups to target. Individual countries are faced with
    enormous challenges in addressing the rapidly evolving needs of refugees camped
    on their national territories, and may not have the incentives, capacity and
    resources to address their needs.
   Addressing both the needs of CBMPs and surrounding communities in an
    integrated manner avoids creation of distortions. Hotspots can serve as poles of
    development for the provision of health and related social services. The IRAPP
    Project demonstrated how a regional project can improve access to knowledge
    and services for populations in remote border areas which were lagging behind.
   Ensuring activities funded are well integrated into health district plans early on to
    promote synergies and to facilitate continuity. In project sites where the IRAPP
    activities were well integrated into health district or local government plans from
    the outset, this enhanced the chances of sustainability at project completion.
   Working with existing regional institutions and beefing up their capacity through
    an initial capacity building phase. The World Bank and other International
    Development Agencies such as CIDA can play a critical role in supporting
    Regional Economic Communities, particularly as the funding from bilateral
    donors is focused primarily on country programs.
   Developing a strong M&E Framework & a clear Results Chain. Four key lessons
    are noteworthy:
        o Establishing and institutionalizing a robust M&E system from the onset
             improves the documentation process, provides solid basis for review of
             progress, and motivates project stakeholders to achieve the set targets.
        o Conducting studies targeted at specific vulnerable groups, eg. Pastoralist,
             Transport Corridor and Gender assessments enhance understanding of the
             key drivers of the HIV epidemic and provide a sounder basis for planning
             future investments.
        o Conducting periodic surveys in the project sites would generate timely
             information that would be particularly useful to both regional and national
             levels.
        o Conducting baseline Behavioral Surveillance Survey (BSS) and followed
             after two years by the end-line study provided an evaluation for the
             behavioral change interventions and measurement and assessment for the
             impact
   Strengthen financial management is key for successful implementation of the
    project, whereas some lessons were learned from the difficulties encountered
    during implementation of this complex type of project. The following are some of
    these financial lessons:

                                         66
 Transferring funds to the IPs directly
 Hiring dedicated staff for the program
 Working through one/two strong IP rather than working through multiple
  and small IPs
 Handling procurement and implementation on behalf of the NACs/IPs
 Flexibility in reallocating resources within countries
 Minimize working through UNHCR

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The IRAPP Completion Report was found to be well articulated, detailed and reviewed all
the process the project went through from the preparatory phases, early stages of the project
challenges and support provided by World Bank, the MTR and the two phases of the project
implementation, 2007 – 2012 and 2013 until the recent end of project period.

The report has also pinpointed the complexity of the project coordinating the seven IGAD
Member States, the challenges working with several Implementing Partners as well as UN
agencies. The report has also mentioned the big challenges of the absence of baselines at
the beginning of the project implementation and the weaknesses of Monitoring and
Evaluation.

Despite all the challenges, the report has also revealed the fact that the project by providing
HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment to the key population, refugees and IDPs and the
host and surrounding communities, it has complemented the national response as well
averted the transmission of new HIV infections and sexually transmitted infections. In
addition, the report has also noted that with the meagre financial support at the IGAD cross-
border sites, the project in collaboration with the IGAD Member States has made visible
as well as possible to provide the HIV intervention program to the hard to reach population
at the cross-border as well as the refugees and Internally Displaced Persons.
