Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 As of June 2015, the project had supported a total of 48 sites - hot spots, refugee and Internally Displaced Persons camps (IDP). About 80 health
 facilities received project support to deliver various HIV/AIDS services including: behavior change communication (BCC), voluntary counseling and
 testing (VCT) services, elimination of mother to child transmission (EMTCT), anti-retroviral therapy and services for sexual and gender based violence
 (SGBV). 14 of the sites are refugee and IDP camps under UNHCR and the rest are CBMP sites under the National AIDS Councils (NACs) of the
 respective member states. VCT services are available in 93 health facilities, STI in 90 facilities, EMTCT in 69 facilities and anti-retroviral therapy (ART)
 in 33 facilities in the project sites. Last year, (a) condoms were distributed bringing the cumulative total to slightly over 16 million condoms, (b) over
 200,000 clients received VCT services, (c) about 36,000 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) were initiated on ART, and (d) 66,000 mothers out of
 76,000 ante natal care attendees tested for HIV and 83% of positive mothers were initiated on ART. There is increasing support towards PLWHA and
 orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) in project sites with 56 PLWHA associations currently active. The project will close as scheduled on June 30,
 2015.

 Overall Comments
 The behavioral surveillance data is presented by country, sex and population essentially because it is not possible to consolidate such data. In
 addition, there was need to monitor the various groups separately. The data above excludes the UNHCR behavioral sentinel surveillance data,
 which were unavailable at the time of preparing the ISR. The UNHCR findings are expected to be available during the ICR mission.
 The report refers to end target date of December 2014 as the surveys were conducted at the time. Secondly, most of the project information is
 reported on an annual basis.
