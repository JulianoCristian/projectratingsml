                                     Restructuring Paper

1. It is proposed that the closing date for the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) Regional HIV/AIDS Partnership Program (IRAPP) be extended from March 31,
2013 until May 31, 2013.

2. The project development objective (PDO) is to: (i) increase preventative action, and
reduce misconception of cross border and mobile populations, refugees, IDPs, returnees and
surrounding host communities concerning HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and mitigation
in selected sites in the IGAD member states; and (ii) establish a common and sustainable
regional approach to supporting these populations in the IGAD member states. The
activities currently financed under the Africa Catalytic Grant Fund (ACGF) will be scaled
up through a contribution of US$ 7.6 million from the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) that will be processed as Additional Financing (AF) during the extension
period. The CIDA funds are currently held in a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (TF071718) set up
to receive the donor’s contribution as per the Administrative Agreement dated June 30, 2011
between the Bank and CIDA.

3. The project objectives continue to be achievable and IGAD’s (Implementing Agency)
performance satisfactory. According to the last Implementation Status Report (March
2013), all the key ratings are Moderately Satisfactory. IGAD, the Recipient, has also
prepared an action plan acceptable to the Bank to implement project activities during the
extension period. As of November 31, 2012, 99.2 percent of the ACGF funds were
disbursed. The project remains in compliance with the ACGF Agreement and all legal
covenants set out in the Grant Agreement with exception of financial management
requirements.

4. The audit report for the period ending December 31, 2011 expressed qualified opinion on
the project financial statements regarding management of advances under the project.
Secondly, due to security reasons South Sudan could not participate in the 2011 audit
exercise, and the audit for Somalia could not be processed in a timely manner. To mitigate
the risks, IGAD has prepared an action plan acceptable to the Bank. Regarding Djibouti,
with a long standing unaccounted advance, the Bank and IGAD have agreed to halt further
disbursements/advances to Djibouti National AIDS Commission until the advance has been
satisfactorily accounted for. While acknowledging the security problems in both South
Sudan and Somalia, IGAD has agreed to ensure that future audits are undertaken in a timely
manner. The final audit report for Somalia is due for submission to the Bank. As for South
Sudan, the 2011 audit will be included in the 2012 audit exercise.

5. Considering that IGAD has prepared an acceptable plan and that the project team will
work closely with IGAD to address the actions agreed in the action plan, the team has
requested authorization in line with BP 10.02 Annex A for an exception from the Vice
President and Head of Network, OPCSVP and Vice President and Controller, CTRVP to

                                               4
proceed with negotiations for the Additional Financing of the IGAD Regional HIV/AIDS
Partnership Program. In light of the above, the project team is seeking to extend the closing
date of the parent project from March 31, 2013 to May 31, 2013 in order to process the
request for authorization of exception in accordance with BP 10.02 in relation to actions the
Bank takes in respect to noncompliance with financial management requirements and to
conclude negotiations for the Additional Financing.

6. This will be the fifth extension of the project. The first one was approved for six months
on December 23, 2011; the second for four months on June 27, 2012; the third for two
months on October 31, 2012; and the fourth for three months on December 28, 2012. Please
note RVP approval is not required as the cumulative extension (17 months) does not exceed
two years.

7. No legal clearance is required for this restructuring.

8. A request to extend the project closing date by the Implementing Agency (IGAD) is not
required. As noted above the need to extend the project closing date was occasioned by
delay to process the AF in a timely manner.
