Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Additional Financing (financed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, DFATD, Canada) became effective on May 31, 2013
 and is due to close on December 31, 2014.
 The project closing date is being extended from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015. The six month extension will permit completion of
 disbursements.
 A total of 48 sites - hot spots, refugee and Internally Displaced Persons camps (IDP), and about 80 health facilities receive project support to deliver
 various HIV/AIDS services including: behavior change communication (BCC), voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services, elimination of mother to
 child transmission (EMTCT), anti-retroviral therapy and services for sexual and gender based violence (SGBV). 14 of the sites are refugee and IDP
 camps under UNHCR and the rest are CBMP sites under the National AIDS Councils (NACs) of the respective member states. VCT services are
 available in 85 health facilities, STI in 89 facilities, EMTCT in 69 facilities and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in 33 facilities in the project sites. Last year,
 (a) a total of 4,137,000 condoms were distributed bringing the cumulative total to slightly over 13 million condoms, (b) over 200,000 clients received
 VCT services, (c) 17,000 clients were initiated on ART bringing the cumulative total of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) on ART to 36,000,
 and (d) 66,000 mothers out of 76,000 ante natal care attendees tested for HIV and 83% of positive mothers were initiated on ART. There is
 increasing support towards PLWHA and orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) in project sites with 51 PLWHA associations currently active.
