1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.       Niger i s c onsidered to be one of the p oorest c ountries on e arth, w ith a c hallenging
Sahelian environment i n which r ainfall is unpredictable a nd w eather shocks a re common.
Agriculture is a m ainstay of r ural livelihoods, p roviding the bul k o f employment, food, a nd
income. The second Private Irrigation Project (PIP2) was designed to advance the Government of
Niger's (GoN) agricultural sector growth objectives through: (i) intensification and diversification
of i rrigated pr oduction t o i mprove f ood s ecurity; ( ii) pr ivate s ector de velopment a nd
empowerment of farmers associations and other agricultural organizations; (iii) availability of
sustainable f inancial a rrangements i n r ural a reas; a nd ( iv) t he c reation of a pr oduction
environment that is environmentally sustainable and socially equitable.

2.       In formulating this operation, the GoN and the Bank jointly decided to emphasize on the
role of the private sector and to favor small-scale irrigation rather than large-scale schemes. PIP2
expands on the success of the Pilot Private Irrigation Project (PPIP), which began in 1996 and
ended in 2001. The project design of PIP2 took advantage of the success of PPIP in piloting
appropriate, often new irrigation technologies, and in working with the private sector and civil
societies at the local level. The project design is thus built on lessons learned in the first phase,
and on r ecommendations i n ne w B ank-supported a nalytical w ork. I t w as de cided that
development of small-scale irrigation and the promotion of better agricultural techniques should
be given top priority in Niger's harsh Sahelo-Saharan environment. The importance of irrigation
was underscored by documentation of unexploited irrigation potential and the fact that Niger has
sub-regional market access to Nigeria and neighboring countries, in particular for high value
crops such as onions.

3.       The project thus aimed to capitalize on Niger's comparative advantage in the production
of several irrigated crops. Building on the lessons learned from the pilot phase, this second phase
sought to develop improved low-cost technologies (mainly manual/motor pumps and tube wells
as well as various irrigation techniques), and disseminate them to smallholder farmers, along with
a supporting package of training, financial, and technical assistance.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

4.       The o verall goal of the Bank's C ountry A ssistance Strategy ( CAS) for N iger w as to
reduce the poverty head-count through economic growth. However, the large share of public
investment funds previously devoted to rural development had achieved meager results. Real per
capita agricultural GDP declined by about 2 percent between1966-96 and the number of food-
insecure households increased.

5.       The first pillar of the C AS hi ghlighted the ne ed t o c apitalize on sectoral sources o f
growth. Irrigated agricultural production was considered to be the most important and stable
source of growth for Niger, given the historical volatility of commodity prices, the precarious
situation of rainfed agriculture, and the existence of unexploited irrigation potential. Two other
CAS pillars were also considered when designing the project: human capital development (by
building capacity for farmer's groups), and exploitation of regional growth opportunities (through
promotion of exports of irrigated crops to meet the large sub-regional demand).

6.       At appraisal, t he G oN's long-term g oal for t he a gricultural sector w as t o promote
sustainable growth in order to meet the demands of an increasing population, while improving
food security, alleviating poverty, and increasing exports. Irrigation was widely believed to play a
central r ole i n achieving t his g oal. The G oN also announced p lans t o foster pr ivate s ector
participation and development, and to decentralize t he m anagement of w ater r esources by
transferring greater responsibilities to local communities. While the GoN took the important first

step by developing a strategy for water and irrigation, it lacked the financial means to implement
a nation-wide program.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.      The original PDO was "to increase production and profitability of high-value, irrigated
crops by private, smallholder farmers with simple, low-cost technologies." The key performance
indicators and indicators for project output, each with multiple sub-indicators, were as follows:

Table 1: Indicators at Appraisal
Key Performance Indicators                    Main Project Output Indicators
1. Yields i ncrease by 50% i n t he 1. At least 75 percent of farmers participating in the
project's intervention zones.                 project successfully adopt at l east one of t he new
                                              technologies promoted by the project.
2. P roduction i ncreases b y 50% i n t he 2. A t least 80 percent of the producer associations
project's intervention zones.                 involved in the project trained in administrative and
                                              financial management techniques.
3. F arm-level pr ofitability of i rrigated 3. At least 50 percent of the farmers involved in the
production increases by 35%.                  project trained in techniques of production, storage,
                                              and processing of irrigated crops.
                                              4. T he num ber of farmers w ho a re m embers of
                                              project-related micro-finance institutions triples.
                                              5. The participation of women in the project zones
                                              increases by 50 percent.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

8.      The PDO was not revised. Key Performance Indicators were similarly left unchanged.
The main Project Output Indicators remained (with the exception of the indicator measuring the
numbers of farmers participating in microfinance institutions, which was dropped after the mid-
term review). Several of the more than 30 sub-indicators to measure output were refined after the
mid-term review. This was to allow better measurement of the achievements, and to align more
closely w ith the r esults f ramework. Most o f these changes w ere small and occurred for the
Irrigation Investment and t he (new) Development of Irrigated Agriculture and Institutional
Capacity component. D ue to t heir specificity, s ome of t he sub-indicators did not ha ve good
baseline estimates and targets.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.      The primary beneficiaries were smallholder farmers, often organized in common interest
groups, and included female farmer associations. These smallholders typically either own or have
usufruct rights to very small amounts of land. Farms greater than 10 hectares were not eligible
under the project. The median farm size supported under the project was about 1.5 hectares. Other
project be neficiaries i ncluded local private service p roviders who supported irrigation
development ( local artisans), local umbrella organizations implementing t he pr oject, a nd
downstream participants in the agricultural supply-chain (transporters, processors, wholesalers,
and retailers).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.     The project had five components at the appraisal stage:
A. T he Advisory Services and Research Component (US$6.12 million) aimed to improve the
    productivity and profitability of smallholder farmers. It also aimed to disseminate successful
    technologies of the pilot phase, PPIP. The expected output was to develop, test, improve and
    disseminate simple, low-cost irrigation and production technologies for private farmers. This
    component h ad two s ub-components: ( i) participatory r esearch to d evelop and test ne w
    irrigation technologies, and (ii) advisory services to ensure that farmers have timely access to
    production and marketing advice.

B. T he Capacity Building Component ( US$2.32 million) a imed to e nsure that existing
    organizations of smallholder irrigators were strengthened and new organizations created, and
    that bot h, existing a nd ne w, w ere a ble t o take a dvantage of the new technologies. The
    capacity bui lding c omponent ha d t hree s ub-components: (i) s upport t o t he N igerien
    Association for the Promotion of Private Irrigation (ANPIP) to build institutional capacity
    and s trengthen i ts o utreach a t the l ocal level; (ii) s upport for g overnment's e fforts i n
    promoting private irrigation through policy reforms and decentralization of services; and (iii)
    pilot t esting of pr ivate management on s elected pe rimeters f rom t he N ational O ffice for
    Irrigated Perimeters (ONAHA).

C. T he Irrigation Investment Component (US$28.72 million) aimed to ensure that members of
    project-supported producer organizations and related stakeholders were able to address their
    irrigation investment needs through a matching grant facility, and had two sub-components.
    The Irrigation Investment Fund aimed to provide a demand-driven matching grant facility.
    The matching grant was disbursed to a special account and sub-accounts in branch offices,
    and eligible beneficiaries contributed to irrigation investment costs. The other sub-component
    aimed to provide support to Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs). It created a capacity-building
    fund to strengthen and develop MFIs and their umbrella organizations.

D. T he Environmental Protection Component (US$2.29 million) a imed to minimize a dverse
    environmental and social impacts that might result from expansion of smallholder irrigation,
    and t o c onserve a nd improve t he natural resource base. This c omponent ha d four c ore
    objectives: (i) to protect and maintain the irrigated perimeters and the sites where they are
    located; (ii) to protect the environment against potentially negative effects of the development
    and use of irrigated perimeters; (iii) to monitor aquifers against overuse and pollution; and
    (iv) t o train s takeholders on e nvironmental i mpact issues a nd i n techniques to m itigate
    environmental risks.

E. T he Project Management Component ( US$8.53 million) aimed t o e nsure that A NPIP's
    Project I mplementation U nit ( PIU) pr ovided de mand-driven a ssistance t o s mall f armers.
    Project m anagement was to b e c arried ou t by c ompetitively recruited pr ofessionals. The
    component also aimed to finance outreach and build capacity of project staff.

1.6 Revised Components (after restructuring)

11.     After the mid-term r eview i n December 2 005, i t w as decided t o merge the two
components Advisory Services and Research a nd Capacity Building i nto a new component
entitled Development of Irrigated Agriculture and Institutional Capacity (US$8.23 million at
closure). The new component covered the activities of the previous components and aimed to
strengthen linkages b etween p roject s takeholders a nd implementing ag encies. The new
component had four sub-components: (i) Advisory Services, (ii) Strengthening the Capacity of
                                                  -3-

Professional Organizations, (iii) Diffusion of Irrigation Technologies, and (iv) Externalization of
Water Management. The objectives assigned to this new component were in accordance with the
PDO and key indicators. Several sub-indicators measuring outputs for the original component
Irrigation Investment (US$28.2 a t closure) were r evised. T he other r emaining c omponents
Environmental Protection and Project Management were not changed. Responsibility for project
management was shifted from ANPIP to the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MDA) in
May 2007.

1.7 Other significant changes

12.       A restructuring approved at the Country Director's (CD) level to reflect these changes
was completed in December, 2007, with an associated amendment of the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) to record changes and reallocation of the credit proceeds among categories.
No changes were made to the objectives. Implementation of the changes was gradual. After the
mid-term review in December 2005, the first major change came in September 2006 with the
appointment of a new General Director of the PIU. ANPIP gave up responsibility for project
oversight in May 2007. The formal signature of the grant amendment by the GoN also triggered a
one-year extension of the project, which began in January 2008.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.       Project preparation and background analysis were sound. Project preparation benefitted
greatly from a serious assessment of the lessons learned under PPIP. The project made use of rich
analyses of previous investment operations in the rural sector and the reasons for their historically
disappointing performance. Lessons learned for project design included: (i) the need for a careful
assessment of successful small-scale irrigation techniques adaptable to Niger; (ii) the importance
of giving the private sector a substantial role in implementation at the national and local level;
(iii) th e b enefit o f s takeholder p articipation in implementation; ( iv) the need for a serious
approach to m onitoring a nd e valuation; a nd (v) a n emphasis on d ecentralized f inancial
management at the local level.

14.       The project design was simple with a clear PDO. The project did not have a formal
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) but benefitted from advice and review of senior sector staff.
The design paid close attention to an effectively measurable results framework. The objectives
and design remain highly relevant today. After initial reluctance to transfer project leadership to
ANPIP, the GoN fully backed the program. A working group from several ministries, major
stakeholders, and related donor-funded initiatives was established.

15.       In retrospect, the two key shortcomings of the risk assessment were (i) the failure to
assess more c arefully t he institutional c apacity of A NPIP to run a c omparatively l arge rural
investment operation, and ( ii) underestimation of risks a ssociated w ith the matching g rant
facility.1




1During project preparation it appears that the task team had been advised by ANPIP on the wide-ranging
implications of the matching grant mechanism. Also the European Commission (EC) issued a complaint to
MDA that PIP2 would crowd-out the disbursement of the credit component of a parallel but smaller
operation.

2.2 Implementation

16.                                   The p roject ha d t hree d istinct pha ses: ( i) t he pe riod be fore t he m id-term r eview of
December 2005, during w hich overly opt imistic ratings w ere made f or I P ( Implementation

during which there was a "leadership crisis;" and (iii) a final phase during which performance
progressively i mproved as r ecommendations from the m id-term r eview w ere i mplemented.
During the third phase, a one year project extension was approved.
After the mid-term review, both the GoN and the Bank lost confidence in ANPIP as a managerial
entity. Following a "leadership crisis," the association agreed to withdraw from PIP2 in May
2007, a nd the M DA took ov er s upervision of t he P IU. T he k ey c hanges s uggested and
progressively implemented after the mid-term review included: (a) merging of components 1 and
2 into one single c omponent; ( b) r efocusing t he pr oject's i mplementation on " irrigation
concentration z ones;" (c) r eadjusting t he p roject's r egional un its from 8 t o 5 t o improve

selection of the sub-projects; and (e) extension of the project for one year as suggested in the mid-
term review.

17.                                   Somewhat paradoxically, the uncertainty created at the national level did not negatively
affect the implementation of PIP2 at the field level. On the contrary, it had positive effects on
PIP2's performance as rationalization plans put project staff under significant pressure to deliver
the program's objectives. In sum, the project's changes ­ formalized relatively late in January
2008 after signature of the Grant Amendment by the Republic of Niger ­ were made both to
establish a new closing date and to regularize a progressively implemented restructuring process.
These measures contributed significantly to acceleration of disbursements and achievement of
development objectives. In fact, when the MDA took over, 93 percent of the IDA credit had been
disbursed. PIP2's implementation performance and disbursement trajectory are depicted in Figure
1 above.

18.                                   The main reason for the change was to address risks that were not properly identified at
the a ppraisal s tage. T he t wo main unde restimated r isks that l ed to de teriorated pr oject
performance were:

                                                                                                                                    -5-

A. The failure to conduct an institutional assessment of ANPIP. A t ap praisal, b ased on the
    positive experience under PPIP, i t w as a ssumed t hat A NPIP w ould have the capacity to
    successfully manage a complex and relatively large irrigation program. It was assumed that
    the transfer of implementation a rrangements t o a non-profit agency assured r eliability of
    financial op erations. I t w as also a ssumed that po litical interference c ould b e k ept t o a
    minimum. It w as a ssumed t hat MDA would have t he capacity for s upervision of k ey
    fiduciary aspects of the association. In retrospect, it is clear from supervision mission reports
    that the association struggled with project management and timely reporting on f inancial
    management and procurement, and may have suffered from political interference.

B. The failure to assess risks associated with the matching grant facility. The design of PIP2
    included a matching grant facility to provide funds to farmers for the purchase of small-scale
    irrigation equipment. The typical cost-shares were 80 percent from PIP2 and 20 percent from
    the farmers. In retrospect, the implementation arrangements caused (i) equity concerns in the
    sense that relatively better-off farmers tried to benefit disproportionately from the grant and
    in a few cases prepared fake applications, (ii) incentives for farmers to buy motorized pumps
    rather than m anual pum ps e ven i f their farming c onditions di d not r equire mechanized
    pumping, and (iii) crowding-out effects for other rural programs, with potential for distortions
    to the rural financial sector.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

19.     At closure, M&E was rated satisfactory.2 The M&E system started from a low base, but
gradually achieved very good performance. Its effectiveness in measuring the key performance
indicators and major output indicators was high. The design at appraisal stage carefully chose
indicators that are measurable and paid close attention to ensuring adequate resources. Because of
previous experience with unsuccessful rural operations, attention was paid to M&E at all stages
of supervision. International monitoring experts were regularly part of the supervision missions.
Aide-memoires p rovided r ich qu antitative a nd qualitative i nformation o n t he s tatus o f
performance and output indicators. M&E staff turn-over was minimal and assured continuity
even after restructuring of the project.

20.     Initially weaker M&E performance and the subsequent "leadership crisis" of the project
did no t r educe the reliability of t he system. T his i s be cause the p roject ha d g ood ba seline
indicators, which could be established with PPIP closure data. The monitoring unit of PIP2 also
made a research effort to reconcile baseline information from various other sources, leading to
some minor revisions. The M&E system generated three agricultural surveys (2005/6, 2006/7,
and 200 7/8) us ing c rop-cutting estimation t echniques. These surveys w here e xecuted with
technical s upport a nd i n cooperation with the N ational I nstitute f or A gricultural R esearch
(INRAN), and benefited from Bank supervision. The surveys came with technical documentation
and a small enumerator's manual. The M&E system also conducted a significant number of
quantitative and qualitative studies, using the generated data, other data sources, or observations
from field visits. Independent assessments of the different components and major aspects of the
project were made at the time of closure of PIP2. The analytical quality of the studies varies, but
they tend to provide useful information for monitoring purposes over the lifecycle of the project.
The M&E information was used by the task teams and was highly relevant for supervision. For
example, the decision to restructure was triggered by findings from the M&E system at that time.




2The M&E rating reported is from the last supervision mission end of 2008. The ICR does not provide
formal ratings for M&E.

                                                   -6-

21.     Overall, M&E has been strong. In the context of data scarcity and the harsh ecological
environment of Niger, the performance is considered remarkable. The information collected is of
wider relevance to the country. For example price data have been collected for three consecutive
years, whereas in Niger no official rural price data are available and the national Consumer Price
Index (CPI) is only representative for Niamey, the country's capital. One weak area has been the
analysis of social impacts of the project, where the information collected has not been f ully
exploited, and the techniques used to assess poverty, gender and social impacts are rudimentary.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

22.     Environmental safeguard policies. The project was classified as environmental category
B which requires a partial assessment. The overall compliance with environmental safeguards has
been s atisfactory throughout t he pr oject's life. The environmental pr otection component was
designed to address the recommendations of the Environmental Assessment. Issues identified by
the Environmental Assessment were addressed through sub-components from the environmental
protection component as follows:

·   Monitoring of Soil and Water Resources. The monitoring system covered the 8 regions of the
    country with 319 piezometers, 12 ponds with agro-ecological importance and 34 sites for the
    monitoring of soil and water quality. Analysis allowed t he identification of a number of
    fragile s ites w ith r egard t o t he a vailability of w ater. A n a ction pl an w as e laborated to
    attenuate this risk, but could not be financed.

·   Development of tools for environmental studies. This sub-component has been implemented
    since 200 4. The activities of this s ub-component started l ate but the performance w as
    classified as highly s atisfactory during s upervision. The operator e laborated a number of
    environmental manuals, guidelines and communications supports (kits and audiotapes) and
    conducted a large number of training and information campaigns that were useful to the
    different stakeholders and the project beneficiaries.

·   Protection of the production sites specially threatened by wind and hydraulic erosion. This
    sub-component was implemented directly by the project coordination unit. At the early stage
    of the project it was intended to be implemented through an environmental protection sub-
    project to be initiated by producers' organizations. However, one year after the project began,
    the num ber o f e nvironmental pr otection s ub-projects was s till low. A ne w s trategy was
    adopted and 17 NGOs selected to work as secondary operators for this sub-component.

23.      Social protection. One concern with regard to the project was limited access of the poor
or vulnerable groups (women and young adults) to project activities. At the appraisal phase, the
project did not quantify clearly the objectives with regard to social protection. Two periods can be
distinguished. During the period before the mid-term review mission, the social concerns of the
project were not contained in a specific component to facilitate the participation of the poorest
groups, w omen a nd y oung a dults. In the period after t he m id-term review, a special s ub-
component f or social protection was c reated unde r t he environmental and s ocial p rotection
component, and special attention was given to ensure better access of vulnerable groups to the
sub-projects. In addition, the project simplified procedures for the evaluation and approval of
small sub-projects starting with 35,000 FCFA (instead of 2 million FCFA) threshold.

24.      Procurement. Procurement was rated as unsatisfactory before the restructuring of the
project. The major procurement problems were (i) the failure to recruit private operators for the
advisory s ervices and research c omponent and (ii) pr ocurement de lays in the e nvironmental
protection component. After failure of the recruitment of the operator, it was decided that the
advisory services and research component should be implemented by the project coordination
unit. The pr ocurement problems w ere du e to the c apacity of the project s taff, the long
                                                    -7-

procurement process f or l arge c ontracts, a nd occasional interference of g overnment
administrators. After the mid-term review, regular project monitoring and the training of the
project procurement staff gradually brought procurement to a satisfactory level.

25.      Financial management. Financial management w as r ated unsatisfactory be fore t he
restructuring o f the p roject. These difficulties were d ue t o (i) the s ignificant d elays in t he
recruitment of qualified accounting and financial staff, (ii) the delay in the opening of the specific
bank accounts for the different regions where the project was implemented, and (iii) the serious
delay in the production of the financial monitoring reports from 2006 to 2007.3 A computerized
accounting and integrated financial management system was set up and assessed. The regular
monitoring of the project financial management allowed progressive improvement. The project
also developed an integrated accounting and financial management system, which is now used by
other Bank-financed projects in Niger.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

26.      Demand for PIP2-style irrigation investment and technologies exceed local supply. PIP2
identified a number of important sub-projects at the local level that could not be financed at
completion of PIP2. The Bank's Agro-Sylvo-Pastoral Exports and Markets Development Project
(PRODEX) ha s a component t o support i rrigation development. T he PRODEX irrigation
component aims to establish or rehabilitate 5,000 irrigated hectares, with a particular focus on the
regional market for onions. The scope of work will be based largely on existing PIP2 planning.
PRODEX w ill us e the same f inancial and administrative p rocedure de veloped under P IP2.
Through a n integrated a pproach (focusing on regional m arkets, supply c hains a nd i rrigation
development) PRODEX intends to mitigate some of the risks to sustainability of PIP2.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

27.      The pr oject's ob jectives a re h ighly relevant. The de velopment ob jectives of P IP2
designed in 2002 (increased production and profitability of high-value, irrigated crops by private
smallholder f armers w ith simple, low co st t echnologies) are v ery c onsistent w ith N iger's
priorities in 2009. PIP2's past objectives are also very consistent with the Bank's current CAS
and t he G oN's ov erall d evelopment pr iorities, w hich e mphasize a gricultural g rowth through
irrigation development and regional market potential for high value crops.

28.      High volatility of commodity prices in 2008-2009 shows the need to boost domestic
production to assure food security. Niger's high annual GDP growth rate of 9.5 percent in 2008
(projected growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for 2009 is only 3 percent) is largely
attributed to favorable rainfall. This highlights the potential of irrigation for economic growth in
Niger; unless unexploited irrigation potential is used, growth rates will drop significantly when
weather patterns become unfavorable. Global climate change may lead to less favorable rainfall
patterns in the Sahel. Small-scale irrigation is therefore a major priority today, as was the case at
appraisal.

29.      Major design features and implementation modalities (a simple design combined with
clearly stated PDO, measurable indicators and outputs, and strong M&E) remain highly relevant.
Donors in N iger are bu ilding on t he t echnologies, l ocal institutional set-up, a nd t he d esign

3Four quarterly reports for 2006 and the two first quarterly reports of 2007 were sent all together in one
batch on October 2007. Specific financial audits have been conducted to verify these reports, and did not
find major problems or mishandling.
                                                    -8-

on more focused intervention zones. While the nation-wide coverage assured high visibility and
political feasibility of the project, a geographical focus could have contributed to enhanced cost
effectiveness of the interventions. Ways to ensure a better matching grant mechanism and rural
market d evelopment s hould be reconsidered, as t hey were v iewed as w eaker asp ects of the
project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

30.       The achievement of the PDO can be evaluated based on t he performance of the key
development indicators. Based on a subset of the main commodities (onions, pepper, tomato and
rice), representing about 75 percent of total agricultural production in the project's intervention
zones and for which baseline, mid-term and closure data are available, the project more than
achieved its development objectives. The increases in productivity, production and profit realized
during the life of the project varied by commodity, but values at closure exceeded targets set at
appraisal. The exception is rice yields, which showed a somewhat less favorable performance
compared to mid-term targets, though they surpassed the appraisal targets.

31.       The successful achievement of the PDO stemmed from (i) creating 10,904 hectares of
consolidated and 5,491 hectares of new irrigated areas, (ii) contribution of the project to growth
in productivity, (iii) targets set conservatively at appraisal, and (iv) other factors such as reduced
environmental degradation and market development across the entire supply chain. Most of the
output targets were exceeded and can be attributed to PIP2 interventions. Other donors were
active in these areas, but very rarely had major investment initiatives that created attributable
effects on irrigation development in PIP2 intervention zones. Due to good data generated by the
M&E system a nd s upported by field supervision, and the c learly s tated and m easurable
objectives, evaluation of the achievement of the PDO is straightforward.4 Table 2 summarizes the
indicators.

3.3 Efficiency

4Before PIP2 the irrigated area in Niger was estimated at 80,000 hectares, which included 13,500 hectares of larger
irrigated schemes under ONAHA. During six years of implementation, PIP2 effectively increased the total irrigated
area in Niger by 7 percent and consolidated about 14 percent of the existing irrigated areas.

                                                          -9-

32.       As in the appraisal stage, financial and economic internal rates of return were computed
for an assumed project life cycle of 10 years (corresponding to the duration of two successive
equipment lifetimes for motor pumps and the estimated average duration of drills). The analysis
used f arm models w hich w ere fed w ith a verage price, i nput a nd output data f rom PIP2's
agricultural surveys. The resulting economic (ERR) and financial rates (FRR) of return for PIP2,
together with the corresponding net present values (NPV), are presented in Table 3.

33.       Even under conservative assumptions, ignoring the indirect, non-measurable benefits of
PIP2, the ICR internal rate of return and NPV are significantly higher than in the PAD (including
costs for capacity building and environmental protection). The project shows an excellent overall
economic rate of return of 27 percent, which is almost double the estimate at appraisal stage. The
financial rate of return has effectively doubled from 12 t o 24 percent. Both the financial and
economic NPVs are positive and significantly higher than at appraisal stage. An analysis at the
field level suggests that motor pumps are more profitable than manual pumps (Annex 3).

           Table 3: National Level: Summary of Economic and Financial Analysis
                                                     Baseline (PAD)              2008 (ICR)

34.       A sensitivity analysis suggests that the high rate of return can be explained by the (i)
favorable price environment, and (ii) exceeding targets for the key performance indicators, in
particular with respect to irrigation area, crop yields and corresponding production volumes. A
risk analysis assuming a reduction of yields (-5 percent), decreasing crop prices (-10 percent) and
increased input prices (5 percent) suggests that the probability that the ERR will be below 12
percent is unlikely. The most likely scenario is that the ERR will lie somewhere between 12 and
20 percent, with an expected overall probability of 53 percent. The economic viability of the
project thus appears robust against some deterioration of yields and against unfavorable price
movements. Average investment costs for small-scale irrigation in Niger appear reasonable. If the
cost attributions by component of the economic analysis are considered, the average investment
cost is US$2,043 per hectare.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

35.       Rating: Highly satisfactory. Overall project outcomes are rated as highly satisfactory.
The rating is based on high relevance, the overachievement of the Key Performance Indicators,
and an excellent overall economic rate of return. The economic returns appear robust against
unfavorable price movements. The supporting data are of good quality.5




5In an internal ex-post evaluation the overall development outcome of PPIP was rated highly satisfactory (World Bank,
2008c).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

36.      Three agricultural household surveys performed between 2005/6 and 2007/8 measured
impacts on beneficiaries. Women and young adults represented an average of 47 percent of the
total beneficiaries. Measured economic impacts of PIP2 yielded income increases: farmers could
benefit from r evenue 1.5 to 3 times t he a verage revenue i n N iger. W age-labor and self-
employment i ncome i s t ypically m uch hi gher t han t he N igerien g uaranteed minimum w age
(Annex 5). Social empowerment was enhanced by the cash-for-work approach. At the household
level, improvement in self-consumption averaged about 10 percent.

37.      Other i mpacts such as better access to land, increased savings, enhanced agricultural
investments, employment in off-farm activities, and better access to schooling for children are
reported, although these effects were not evaluated in much detail. PIP2 yielded benefits in terms
of food security and nutrition at the household level. At the national level, it was estimated that
incremental production of PIP2 met the demand of about 193,000 people or 24,000 families. The
project had a total annual output of about 375,000 tons of all products at closure, representing
48,000 tons of cereal equivalent. This improvement is quite significant in the context of a chronic
food deficit in Niger of an estimated 300,000 tons of cereal equivalent per year.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

38.      The project contributed significantly to the following areas of institutional strengthening:

·   Technology dissemination. T he p roject d eveloped s uccessful s mall-scale ir rigation
    technologies and practices, many of which are being replicated by NGO's, donors and local
    initiatives.

·   Development of local institutions. The pr oject also s upported t he e stablishment o f l ocal
    irrigation development institutions (and committees for natural resource management), which
    remain in place. The project helped to strengthen the local representation of ANPIP in Niger.
    The a ssociation is now represented with 236 local offices, 48 sub-regional office, and 8
    regional offices. The project supported the development and strengthened the capacity of a
    large number of local private input suppliers.

·    Water User Associations (WUA). The project launched a small pilot for outsourcing t he
    management of three larger public irrigation schemes. The project suspended the pilot due to
    difficulties in recruitment of private operators. Nevertheless, two WUA's appear to have been
    successfully established to manage the irrigation schemes. This experience has increased the
    knowledge needed to improve management of irrigation perimeters in the long-run.

·   Land tenure. The project f inanced a c apacity bui lding program for 103 l and t enure
    commissions from al l over t he co untry. T he commissions provided legal assistance to
    vulnerable groups on land tenure security. The commissions will continue to play this role
    after the end of the project. At this stage the assistance covers lease of land and not ownership
    for women and young adults.

·   Data generation, monitoring, and financial management. The p roject g enerated rural
    production, p rice and i ncome data t hat are of national relevance (beyond t he pr oject's
    intervention zones). The monitoring and evaluation system developed by PIP2 is widely seen
    as a be st pr actice e xample f or rural ope rations in Niger. The pr oject ha s de veloped an
                                                  -11-

    integrated accounting and financial management system, which is now used by other Bank-
    financed projects.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

39.      The two key unintended outcomes include (i) creation of excess demand for PIP2-type
financed small-scale irrigation activities, and (ii) significant institutional changes (sections 2.5
and 3.5b).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

40.      A workshop in November 2008 discussed the draft results of the borrower's ICR. Key
lessons learned include: (i) although t he m atching grant m odel e xhibited di fficulties i n
implementation, t he bo ttom-up s election pr ocess a ssociated w ith it is c onsidered a us eful
experience, (ii) the advisory management teams should be sustained, (iii) there is a need to further
strengthen the value chains and rural markets, and (iv) the water and soil management activities
should be strengthened in the future, and (v) the financial management procedures and technical
manuals are a success and are now widely used in Niger (Annex 6).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

41.      Rating: Substantial. The two major risks to the project's objectives are:

·   The limited durability of small-scale irrigation equipment. The 3.5 horsepower (hp) and 5hp
    motor pumps that are commonly used have an estimated average useful life of only 3 years.
    The manual treadle pumps produced locally are often of poor quality and need substantial
    maintenance. I n addition, w ells to pum p g roundwater r isk s anding up ov er t ime. T heir
    estimated average lifetime is only about 10 years. Private operators have been trained to
    repair wells and pumps, but in reality it appears difficult to get the repairs done in time.
    Operators' presence on the ground i s limited and t he viability of the s mall-scale private
    service industry for equipment repair after the closure of the project is untested. Income gains
    will a llow f armers to invest i n ne w e quipment, but the i nstitutional set-up a nd s kills
    developed for t he p rivate sector m ay erode. Additional risks ar e associated with
    environmental protection and a need for fencing in many areas of the project's intervention
    zones because of the harsh ecological environment in Niger.

·   The dependency on the matching grant mechanism to finance new irrigation investments. The
    micro-finance institutions had very low capacity and the focus on MFIs was dropped at mid-
    term. The project did not manage to improve their services and channel them to meet the
    demand of the farmers. As a consequence participants do not have a clear source of finance
    for maintenance of investments made under the pr oject. Furthermore, w omen and young
    adults' access to leased land under the project improved, but did not enhance their ownership
    of l and, a nd hence t hey di d not benefit from t he potential improved opt ions for finance
    associated with land ownership.

42.      The combination o f t hese t wo f actors su ggests substantial risk t hat the d evelopment
outcome may not be maintained. The economic analysis shows that if the project's lifespan falls
significantly below 10 years, the project will no longer be economically viable (Annex 3). The
project did support a number of activities mitigating these risks: (i) financing and training of local
artisans to manufacture and maintain equipment, (ii) financing a capacity building program for
MFIs, a nd ( iii) financing pi lot sub-projects related to inputs, agro-processing, s torage, a nd
commercialization to ensure that farmers would be able to cultivate and sell their crops. The
effectiveness of these measures in the long run is, however, untested.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

43.      Rating: Satisfactory. The pr oject de sign was ba sed on the s trategic a ssumption t hat
supporting agricultural growth in one of the poorest countries in the world would be possible
through small-scale irrigation with emphasis on private sector development. This strategy remains
highly relevant. The project was identified and designed closely with government and major
stakeholders. It benefitted from the PPIP and the Bank supported the government to develop an
irrigation strategy. The Project Preparation Facility (PPF) was adequately funded and experienced
Bank staff were assigned to the operation. During preparation, staff interacted closely with the
private sector stakeholders and the government. The project was well-designed, with in-depth
analysis of lessons learned from previous operations, and with a well-designed M&E framework.
The project d id no t ha ve a QER but was carefully pe er-reviewed by s enior technical staff.
Preparation was fast, as it took less than one year to complete appraisal.

44.      As with all projects, with the benefit of hindsight, one can say there are things that should
have been done differently: (i) an institutional assessment of ANPIP and measures to strengthen
the association, in particular with respect to fiduciary aspects, may have prevented the severe
crisis a t mid-term; (i i) a more c areful c onsideration o f alternatives to the m atching g rant
mechanism, and greater emphasis on sustainability in general, may have reduced the substantial
risk that exists to sustainability of the development outcomes; (iii) a more cautious assessment of
political pressures facing ANPIP, due to the high visibility and relevance of the project, may have
reduced later political interference. These risks were underestimated, but built on the positive
experience with ANPIP during the pilot phase of the project, and ultimately did not undermine
the achievement of development objectives. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is
therefore rated as satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

45.      Rating: Satisfactory. On average, supervision was regular and constructive, and showed
a high degree of proactivity during key milestone events of the project. The project Task Team
Leader (TTL) changed four times, and there were fluctuations in the level of commitment by the
teams: greater proactivity at early stages might h ave p revented t he p roblems d iscovered a nd
addressed at mid-term. The IP and DO ratings before the mid-term review were overly optimistic.

46.      A change of the TTL in 2004 improved the situation. Supervision, in particular through
local staff and at the time of the mid-term review in 2005, i mproved. The supervision teams
included i nternational e xpertise a nd w ere a ppreciated by t he c lient. T he t ask t eams ha d a n
excellent skills mix. M&E, safeguards and fiduciary aspects were taken seriously, and greatly
helped to proactively identify threats. The missions produced detailed aide-memoires that were
effective instruments for providing candid ratings. There was a high commitment by local staff
and clear communication from Bank management to the client. Supervision therefore contributed
significantly to the successful achievement of t he development objectives, particularly in the
latter part of the implementation period, and the Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

47.      Rating: Satisfactory. Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. The rating takes
into account fluctuations in proactivity of supervision and candidness of ratings, each of which
improved during the project's lifetime.


                                                 -13-

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

48.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. During pr eparation and ov er the e ntire pr oject's
lifecycle, the GoN showed high ownership and commitment to the successful achievement of the
development objectives. Overall macro-economic and sectoral policies were supportive. Major
stakeholders w ere generally i nvolved dur ing k ey stages of t he p roject, i n p articular during
appraisal, implementation, and the evaluation of PIP2's achievements. After appraisal, the GoN
facilitated implementation arrangements and the project started operating without delays. M&E
arrangements started from a low base, but improved significantly over time and were strong at the
time of closure. M&E also contributed considerably to informed decision-making, in particular
during the mid-term review. The coordination with donors and major stakeholders was excellent,
as t he g overnment g ave PIP2 a de f acto l ead role in implementing i ts i rrigation ag enda.
Government's funding contributions were adequate. The transition arrangements since closure of
the project in December 2008 have been timely.

49.      Key m anagement r esponsibilities for P IP2 ha d been de legated t o A NPIP. T he
government l acked capacity f or strong oversight of the association a nd proactivity t o e nsure
compliance with core fiduciary and management covenants (the association was responsible for
managing publ ic f unds). The G oN s truggled t o m anage t imely resolution o f t he m anagerial
difficulties that ANPIP experienced during 2006 a nd 2007. A fter 18 months, the government
finally succeeded in resolving the crisis, appointing a new national director for PIP2, and MDA
gradually took over the management of the PIU from the association. But to some extent this
development unde rmined t he ov erall l ogic of P IP2 and t he strategic approach chosen at the
inception: a lead role for the private sector in developing irrigation.

50.      In light of these s hortcomings, the government's performance i s rated as moderately
satisfactory. This rating acknowledges that the GoN effectively supported project preparation and
implementation, and at a late stage took on the role as implementing agency, which resulted in the
successful final achievement of the project's development objectives and (late) compliance with
fiduciary requirements.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

51.      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Assessing the implementation agency's performance is
difficult be cause o f the i nstitutional changes described earlier, a nd the distinction between
performance at t he na tional a nd local l evel. T he assessment takes into both technical
implementation and the capacity to manage public funds.

·   Institutional changes. From March 2002 to May 2007, the core implementing agency was
    ANPIP, which created a PIU for PIP2. From June 2007 until December 2008, MDA was de
    facto the supervising agency of the PIU. Staff at the management level changed, but other
    core s taff, such a s on M &E a nd safeguards, remained. The previous managers o f P IP2
    continued t o be o n s tand-by t o a dvise on technical i ssues and w ere helpful during the
    transition period.

·   Technical capacity and attribution of impact. The achievement of development objectives
    can b e largely attributed to th e te chnical a nd in particular th e lo cal im plementation
    competence o f A NPIP. A t t he l ocal l evel, P IP2 c ontinues t o be k nown a s t he " ANPIP
    project." Many local staff remained in place. The "leadership crisis" that originated at the
    national level paradoxically had positive effects at the local level, by creating pressure for
    local staff to deliver results.

·   Fiduciary and management aspects. One of the key areas where ANPIP failed to live up to
    expectations at appraisal stage was its capacity to comply with the Bank's fiduciary standards
    and assure the GoN on a continuing basis of its capacity to manage a comparatively large
    amounts of pub lic f unds. M anaging publ ic funds for a h ighly visible a nd strategically
    important project required transparency on f inancial and procurement issues. The political
    pressures militating against compliance with these responsibilities were underestimated. It
    also appears that, as a consequence of the original project design, ANPIP initially resisted
    stronger ov ersight of t he a ssociation. Though l ater a udits f ound no e vidence of
    mismanagement, ANPIP lacked proactivity in identifying and tackling fiduciary issues.

52.     Overall, t he i mplementing agency performance is therefore r ated as moderately
satisfactory. The rating is based on the fact that changes took place gradually. A new General
Director came on boa rd in 2006. B y May 2007, w hen ANPIP ceased to be the implementing
agency, 93 percent of the IDA credit was disbursed (though funds had not necessarily reached the
local level). Major strategic decisions that led to the achievement of development objectives in
December 2008 had been taken prior to that time. At the technical level, ANPIP showed a vision
for irrigation de velopment i n N iger. At the local level, i t m anaged t o s uccessfully engage
stakeholders and excelled in implementation on the ground. At the fiduciary level, ANPIP failed
to meet the expectations set at appraisal, it lacked proactivity, and it underestimated the pressures
arising from management of publ ic f unds (although later assessments f ound no evidence o f
misconduct).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

53.     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Based on the combination of the two ratings above,
overall Borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

·   Niger's Private Irrigation Promotion Project is a highly relevant example. The project's
    emphasis on cost-effective small-scale irrigation with full participation of the private sector
    remains valid and highly relevant for Niger. The project design and the technologies could be
    an important example for other countries facing much less severe constraints.

·   Capacity can be build at the local level even in harsh environments, benefitting other
    sectors. The project shows that a significant amount of capacity has been created at the local
    level, i n pa rticular by s etting up P rivate A dvisory S ervice G roups (GSC). Innovative
    technologies disseminated by the project serve as models for other donors, and some of the
    institutional arrangements will be adopted by other donors in the future. This suggests that
    Niger managed to create a useful institutional set-up on which it should build in the future.

·   Small-scale irrigation investments can be profitable. Irrigation investments under the project
    had an average cost of approximately US$2,000 per hectare. These investments can bring
    measurable improvements in farmers' welfare and achieve high economic rates of return,
    possibly above 20 percent.

·   High economic returns are associated with risks. The limited durability o f s mall-scale
    irrigation equipment coupled with dependence on t he matching grant, and the impact of a
    harsh ecological environment on investments made pose substantial risks to the sustainability
    of t he development outcome. If t he pr oject l ife falls significantly below 10 years, t he
    project's rate of return will fall below the target threshold. Ways to reduce risks could be to
    apply a subsidy system that is not project-specific but applies across projects' borders, and/or
    to design a matching grant system that includes credit or savings.

                                                 -15-

·   Outsourcing management of public funds to the private sector requires specific attention to
    transparency in fiduciary procedures. The project shows that additional responsibilities are
    created for the private sector when it manages projects that are highly visible and politically
    charged. Transparency in financial management and procurement is essential.

·   Success in a pilot is a foundation for subsequent success on a larger scale, but not a
    guarantee. The project greatly benefitted from the lessons learned during the pilot phase. It
    was assumed that the new project would automatically assure regularity and reliability of
    financial operations and transparency in administration, and this assumption turned out to be
    overly optimistic. A successful pilot still implies a need for careful design on a larger scale
    and close supervision.

·    A straightforward project design and candid supervision pay off. The project's preparation
    showed many i mportant i ngredients f or s uccess: cl ear and e ffectively measurable
    development objectives, a relatively simple project design, and a good results framework.
    Monitoring and evaluation greatly helped to inform decision-making.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

54.      The ICR mission team met with the current and previous Director General of PIP2 and
with ANPIP representatives. In the meetings it was communicated to the mission team that (i) the
institutional set-up at appraisal between the MDA, ANPIP and PIP2's PIU was perceived as
suboptimal, and (ii) the legal procedure that led to termination of the ANPIP's contract was not
well understood. No written communication was received.

(b) Cofinanciers

55.      Cofinancing through AFD was planned at appraisal stage but did not materialize during
implementation. No written communication was received.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

56.      The ICR mission team met with the EC in Niger to learn about the concerns expressed at
appraisal stage. No written communication was received.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

(a) Identification of Benefits

1.       The identification of benefits a nd und erlying a ssumptions a re c omparable with t he
economic analysis at appraisal stage. The analysis assesses the financial and economic returns,
and calculates corresponding net present values of PIP2 project investments at the global project
level. I t al so compares t he i nternal rates of return o f three co mmon sm all-scale irrigation
technology systems: manual pumps, 3.5hp motor pumps, and 5hp motor pumps. Table 4 gives the
irrigated areas and average yields for the global PIP2 project in comparison to the pre-project
situation: yields and irrigated land area increased significantly.

        * Yield data is lower than reported otherwise in this ICR because it was adjusted for crop-
        specific production and storage losses, which are significant in Niger.

2.       The returns from i rrigation a nd t echnology investments a re a ssumed to c ome f rom
increased yields and production increases at the farm level. Assumptions made in the economic
and f inancial analysis are quite c onservative, a nd do not take i nto account t he pos itive
externalities arising f rom low-cost i rrigation t echnology g eneration and dissemination. M ore
specifically:

·   Quantifiable benefits came from (i) increased yields in high value crops that are exported to
    West-African markets, (ii) improvement in agricultural intensity, and (iii) improvements of
    irrigated lands due to the rehabilitation, the diffusion of new irrigation technology (manual
    and m otor pum ps, Californian ne twork) a nd ( iii) other f actors, s uch a s the a ccess t o
    agricultural i nputs, t he e ffects of capacity bui lding focusing on a gricultural stakeholders
    (farmer's t raining in using the new technologies, k nowledge required for a gricultural
    intensification, quality, storage practices).

·   Non-quantified benefits came from increased non-monetary benefits at the household level,
    (i) helping to reduce rural poverty, (ii) benefits in terms of food security and nutrition at the
    household scale, (iii) e nvironmental protection due t o m onitoring of w ater resources,
    environment risk-management, technologies to observe the aquifer, sand dune prevention,
    and (iv) i nstitutional improvements. O ther i mportant indirect benefits ( v) pr ivate s ector
    activity and nonfarm employment generation, (vi) better access to schooling for children, and
    (vii) better provision of health care through improved incomes for vulnerable groups.

(b) Methodology and Data

3.       The farm models used in the analysis typify the average farm in the project regions,
producing one specific and relevant crop for the project (tomato, pepper, rice, cabbage and onion)
and operating on average 1 hectare of land. Benefits, net of loss, self-consumption and costs
incurred by t he farm, w ere c omputed from f arm budgets c ollected through P IP2 a gricultural
surveys. From the representative farm-model, the net benefits for 1 hectare were valued at the
total irrigated surface of each crop. The financial and economic analysis computed net cash flows
and average incremental incomes at the farm level. The crop-specific farm models were then
                                                    -22-

aggregated t o obt ain a g lobal incremental PIP2 be nefit, c omputed o n a yearly basis. Yearly
aggregated benefits of the 5 models of farms are finally related to total annual project costs.

4.       Farm models were also estimated to compute the net benefits from different irrigation
technologies (manual pumps, 0,48 hectare; motor pumps 3.5hp, 1.2 he ctare; motor pumps 5hp,
2.25 hectare). These farms models detailed t he investment c osts and pr oduction returns, a nd
allowed a cost-benefit analysis at farm level, with corresponding Financial Rates of Return (FRR)
and Economic Rate of Return (ERR).

5.       The a nalysis be nefitted f rom de tailed pr ice a nd ho usehold pr oduction da ta c ollected
between 2003 and 2008, and efforts to reconcile baseline information. The new data collected by
PIP2 was mainly through three rounds of agricultural household surveys. These were executed in
cooperation with the National Agronomic Institute of Niger. Financial prices were collected at the
farm gate and conversion factors were calculated to obtain economic prices. Some information
comes from de tailed socio-economic s tudies, and in a f ew i nstances, from obs ervations and
discussions during the ICR team field visit in March 2009.

(c) Results

6.       Similar to the appraisal stage, the internal rates of return were computed for an assumed
project life cycle of 10 years, corresponding to the duration of two successive equipment lifetimes
for motor pumps and the estimated average duration of the drills. The resulting ERR and FRR of
returns for PIP2, together with the corresponding net present values (NPV) are presented below:

7.       Even under conservative assumptions, the global ICR internal rate of return and NPV are
significantly higher than in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) (including costs for capacity
building and environmental protection). The project shows an excellent overall economic rate of
return of 27 percent, which is almost double than at the estimate at appraisal stage. The financial
rate of return has effectively doubled from 12 to 24 percent. Both financial and economic NPVs
are positive and significantly higher than at appraisal stage. This can be explained by two key
factors: (a) a favorable price environment, and (b) exceeding targets for the key performance
indicators, in particular with respect to irrigation area, crops yields and corresponding production
volumes.

8.       Internal rates of returns above 10 to 12 percent are typically considered as satisfactory for
an investment project, whereas rates of returns of more than 20 percent are commonly considered
as an excellent result. In the ICR economic returns also exceed financial returns, suggesting that
the project may have had other positive economy-wide effects that exceed the financial returns
received at the project level. 6


6The PAD reports the unusual finding of an FRR higher than ERR, which is not clearly explained.
Negative externalities, economic distortions, or difficulties to construct economic prices due to data
scarcity could play a role.

9.       Input and output costs for three different technology regimes at the farm level allow a
comparison of their relative average profitability. The corresponding rates of return are much
higher because they report average returns to investment site level (considering only productive
investments). Nevertheless, the results from this analysis show all selective technologies have
been cost-effective, with motor pumps having a slight advantage over manual pumps. Slightly
larger small-scale farm plots, typically needing a more powerful 5hp pump, tend to be more
profitable.

(d) Sensitivity Analysis

10.      A basic sensitivity analysis was performed by stressing the values of three key variables:
(i) input prices, (ii) yields for the five commodities analyzed, and (iii) assuming a total project life
of 15 years instead of 10 years. The results show that the project's profitability is sensitive to
domestic price fluctuations of major crops. A reduction of domestic prices by 20 percent alone
would bring down the economic rate of return to 17 percent, which is almost equivalent to the
estimate at appraisal stage.

                     Table 7: National Level: Results from Sensitivity Analysis
                                                           FRR                 ERR
          ICR baseline IRR                                       24%                   27%
            With a 20% decrease in crops prices                  12%                   14%
            With a 10% decrease in crop prices                   18%                   21%
            With a 5% increase in input prices                   24%                   27%
            With 15 years of the project life                    31%                   33%

11.      In the context of high global prices in 2007-2008, which were partially transmitted into
the dom estic m arket i n N iger ( with a verage annual CPI inflation be ing pushed to a bout 16
percent, and average annual food price growth of about 20 percent), the efficiency of the project
needs to be assessed carefully. The sensitivity analysis suggests that a factor contributing to high
efficiency has been favorable crop prices. However, even with an assumed 20 percent decrease in
crop prices the p roject w ould b e e conomically de sirable (both F RR and E RR a re above 12
percent threshold). The efficiency of the project is robust to a reduction in crop yields and an
increase of input prices.

12.      The project is also sensitive to the duration of irrigation technology. If project benefits
extend for 15 years (instead of 10 years assumed) the ERR would increase significantly. But if
the project's life cycle is less than 8 years, the ERR would fall below the 12 percent minimum
threshold, suggesting significant risks to maintain the development outcome. The figure below
shows a graphical representation of the relationship between project life and the ERR.

(e) Risk Analysis

13.       Several variables in the base sensitivity analysis are important, in particular prices7 . The
main risks analyzed are: price fluctuations for key crops (tomato, pepper, rice, cabbage, onions),
input prices (urea, NPK 15/15/15 fertilizer, pesticides) and yields (tomato, pepper, rice, cabbage,
onions). Table 8 below presents the original point values used in the ERR base case. It also shows
the distributions that were assumed for these values. Food price fluctuations are approximated by
analyzing price trends.

14.       Simple triangular distributions were used to represent uncertainty for the other variables.
The main focus is on price developments (a likely decline in output prices and increase in input
prices) and o n y ields ( a possible de cline i n y ields due t o t he d eterioration of the i rrigation
infrastructure and supporting advisory institutions). For example, in the triangular distributions it
is assumed that crop prices will decline by 10 percent, but in an extreme case they may decline by
25 percent, or increase by 5 percent. Substituting the distributions for the original point values has
the e ffect o f replacing t he original (most l ikely) values w ith the m ean v alues fo r t he n ew
distributions. It thus recalculates the base case ERR.

15.       Having s pecified the distributions, a s imulation w as r un us ing t he @RISK s oftware
package. Possible values for the variables were randomly sampled 1,000 times using a Monte
Carlo non-stratified technique. The assumption is that input and output prices are correlated with
a correlation factor of 0.5. The main output from the analysis is a cumulative distribution function
that plots the probability of the ERR. The figure 3 below summarizes the results.

7Since the project life assumption of 10 years is already conservative and tested above, it was not included
in the risk analysis.

16.     Based on the data and distributional assumptions, the expected ERR is about 16 percent.
The exercise shows that there is a 20 percent probability that the ERR will be below the 12
percent threshold. The probability that the ERR will be above 20 percent is about 27 percent. The
most likely scenario is that the ERR will lie somewhere between 12 and 20 percent, with an
expected overall probability of 53 percent. Under the assumptions presented above, this suggests
that the economic viability of the project should be robust in the face of some deterioration of
yields and unfavorable input or output price movements.

(f) Price Data

    In many low-income countries, collecting rural price data is a significant challenge, as no
    official rural price data exists. Niger is no different. For example, the National Consumer
    Price Index (CPI) is for Niamey only, and does not monitor rural areas. A specific effort was
    therefore made to (i) gather appropriate information and (ii) and derive economic prices for
    key exports and imports. The calculations use averaged price data as collected by PIP2's
    agricultural surveys and other documentation, summarized in the attached table. Price data
    are not disaggregated by geographical region or around the agricultural cropping cycle. The
    analysis is based on mid-point values, and therefore ignores the sometimes hefty price
    fluctuations during the cropping cycle. All costs and benefits were calculated in constant
    2008 prices.

17.     Onions are regionally tradable. The economic price of an exportable good is the free on
board (FOB) price (estimated at 98 FCFA/kg according to the data collected at Niamey's customs
office) minus the economic values of handling, transport (the transport costs were assumed for an
average distance of 100km and with a 20 tons truck) and distribution between the project and the
export point. A conversion factor of 1.0655 was calculated.

18.     Traded inputs are fertilizer, pesticides and gasoline for motor pumps, which are imported
for the project. The table 10 below shows the methodology to obtain the economic price at the
farm gate when using the FOB price of a traded input. The exchange rate premium is estimated at
10 percent. A conversion factor of 1.1365 was obtained for urea. Because better information is

(g) Main Assumptions of Analysis (other than outlined)

19.    The E RR/FRR c alculations at t he national level are ba sed on t he following main
assumptions:

    ·  It was assumed that the 5 commodities (onion, pepper, cabbage, rice and tomato) would
       significantly r epresent the production o f PIP2. I n 2008, the project g ave a t otal
       incremental production of 258,897 tons, with 200,000 tons due to the production of those
       5 commodities, which broadly means 80 percent of global PIP2 production.

    ·  Yield and irrigated areas for the baseline (2001/2) situation, and for 2005/6, 2006/7 and
       2007/8 were obtained from the agricultural surveys carried out throughout the project
       life. Other incremental irrigated crop areas were calculated by interpolation techniques or
       linear regressions where data was scarce.

    ·  In accordance with the estimates at appraisal, the total project costs were calculated as
       follows: 100 p ercent of component 2 c osts ( irrigation i nvestment), 5 0 pe rcent of
       component 1 costs (advisory services and capacity building), 10 percent of component 3
       costs ( environmental protection), and 1 0 pe rcent of c omponent 4 costs ( project
       management). Because the 5 commodities broadly represented 80 percent of PIP2 global
       incremental production, project costs are adjusted with a 0.8 factor.

20.    The ERR/FRR calculation at the field level is based on the following main assumptions:

    ·  Manual pumps: t he pum ping t echnology w as a cquired i n 2 003-5, a nd the c rop
       productivity progressively reached its optimum of profitability in 2005, with constant net
       benefits in 200 6, 200 7 a nd 2008. I n 2003 a nd 2 004, t he f armer ha d t o ( i) s witch
       traditional crops (sorghum a nd millet) for hi gh value c rops, and ( ii) install t he ne w
       irrigation equipment and optimize the new agricultural technologies. Estimated irrigation
       area is 0.48 hectare.

    ·  3.5hp pumps: the technology was acquired in 2003-5. The farmer bought a new motor
       pump and had to (i) switch millet and sorghum crops for high value crops, (ii) install the


                                              -28-

        new i rrigation t ool and o ptimize the new i rrigation t echnology. Estimated average
        irrigation area is 0.97 hectare.

    ·   5hp pumps: the additional technology was acquired in 2003-4. The farmer already had a
        motor pump with irrigation technologies. In 2003 and 2004, the farmer had to double the
        irrigated cropping area and e quip the i ncremental l and. I t w as a ssumed t he 2003
        incremental benefit would not be significant. The 2004-2007 benefits would follow the
        trend of onions yields improvement (as this crop is the most profitable of the model)
        given by the agricultural surveys. The additional investment under PIP2 enhanced the
        increase in the cropping area from 1.25 to 2.25 hectares.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

(a) Organization of the Stakeholder Workshop

1.      The following summary was based on comments from a larger workshop in November
2008. The workshop aimed to discuss the results of the borrowers draft ICR and distill lessons
learned. The I CR w orkshop, l ead b y th e S ecretary-General of the Ministry o f A gricultural
Development of N iger (MDA), involved m ajor project s takeholders, p articipants from t he
regions, participants from other ministries involved in PIP2 (Ministry of Economy and Finance,
Ministry of Hydraulics, Ministry of Environment), and the core task team members of the PIP2
implementation unit.

(b) Strengths and Weaknesses of Each Component

2.      Advisory Services, Research, and Capacity Building Component. The interrelationships
among the different ministries and the beneficiaries attending the workshop, showed the broad
reach of this first component. The discussion group highlighted the following strengths: (i) the
development of 29 A dvisory management c enters, regionally s ettled in 25 a reas, (ii) large
technology diffusion as 30,826 private operators benefited from small scale irrigation technology
and 16,359 ha of land were strengthened and equipped, (iii) a significant improvement in the net
benefits per hectare, (iv) the numerous capacity building programs strengthened the development
and t he implementation of i rrigation a mong t he s takeholders c ommunity - private operators,
water us er a ssociations, nonfarm entrepreneurs, input distributors, a dvisors, c ivil s ociety
members, (v) nonfarm enterprise development allowed the agricultural extension services like
crops p rocessing f acilities, w arehouses, i rrigation m aintenance. The g roup e mphasized
weaknesses including: the external water management, suspended due to the difficulties regarding
the recruitment of private operators. At the same time, Water User Association seems to have
been successfully established to take over the management of the irrigation schemes.

3.      Irrigation Investment Component. The ministries and PIP2 teams that participated in the
workshop r eported several r esults t o t hat component, w hich aimed t o address t he lack o f
financing in the irrigation sector. The group highlighted the following strengths: (i) a significant
increase in production and yields, (ii) the modernization of farms, (iii) a better access to inputs,
(iv) a better storage of outputs, (v) a significant improvement in beneficiary wages. Finally the
group highlighted that this component had positive social impact such as the (vi) employment of
recently graduated young adults and (vii) the improvement of local wages.

4.       Environmental and Social Protection Component. Stakeholders r eported several key
points for this component, which aimed to minimize adverse environmental and social impacts
from e xpansion of smallholder irrigation. The d iscussion g roup a ccentuated t he f ollowing
strengths: ( i) t he development of a m onitoring pl an of w ater and soil resources, (ii) the
development of a risk-management plan to protect the aquifer from hydrologic hazards, (iii) the
development of m ethodological tools t o pr omote g ood e nvironmental practices, (iv) the
development of capacity building programs focusing on environmental issues. Finally the ex-post
analysis group laid stress on the major importance of farmers' information and education to make
them accountable and responsible for the environmental impacts.

(c) Lessons Learned

5.      In general, the teams who attended t he w orkshop emphasized t he following pos itive
outcomes and lessons: (i) despite being critical of the matching grant model to finance irrigation,
the bottom-up approach process of selection is considered as a model in Niger;, (ii) the advisory
management teams have to be perpetuated; (iii) there is a need to further develop and organize the
value chains and markets; (iv) the water and soil management activities are one of the important

pillars o f P IP2 t hat w ould ne ed to be s trengthened i n the future; a nd (v) the project-fund
procedure and technical manuals are a success as they are now widely used in Niger. The teams
also stressed that a n umber of n on-core ac tivities o f the p roject h ave n evertheless shown
encouraging results. Those that could merit consideration for scale-up in the future include: (i) the
land-tenure security approach, (ii) the bottom-up structuring of the producers associations, (iii)
the input market development experience, (iv) the diffusion of low pressure irrigation systems,
(v) the pilot experience with the water user associations, (vi) the development of environment-
friendly technologies, and (vii) the project's monitoring and evaluation procedures.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


(a) Summary Borrower's ICR (from the executive summary)

Le Niger a adopté en janvier 2002, une stratégie de réduction de la pauvreté (SRP) dont l'objectif
est de réduire l'incidence globale de la pauvreté de 63% à moins de 50% en 2015. Dans cette
perspective, il a été élaboré en novembre 2003, u ne stratégie de développement rural (SDR),
sensée opérationnaliser la SRP dans le secteur rural. Le développement de l'irrigation occupe une
bonne place dans la SDR, car faisant partie des quatre (4) programmes sectoriels prioritaires.

Le Projet de Promotion de l'Irrigation privée Phase 2 (PIP2), qui entre dans le cadre de cette
stratégie, a commencé ses activités le 1er février 2003 pour une durée de 5 ans. Il s'inscrit dans
une stratégie qui vise à favoriser les initiatives des producteurs privés (individuels ou petites
entreprises) et les opérateurs connexes qui contribuent au développement de l'irrigation privée. A
l'instar de la phase pilote, le projet a privilégié le faire-faire qui a consisté à sous contracter avec
les bureaux d'études et les ONG pour réaliser les activités.

Le projet a couvert l'ensemble du territoire national mais principalement les zones favorables à
l'irrigation.

L'objectif de développement du PIP2 est d'augmenter la production et la rentabilité des cultures
irriguées à haute valeur ajoutée par les petits producteurs grâce à l'utilisation des technologies
simples et à faible coût.

Depuis la revue à mi-parcours du projet, intervenue du 30 novembre au 16 décembre 2005, les
composantes du pr ojet ont é té r amenées à qua tre d ont t rois c omposantes t echniques e t une
composante gestion à s avoir : Mise en v aleur et r enforcement d es capacités des a cteurs,
Financement de l 'Irrigation, Protection e nvironnementale e t s ociale e t G estion t echnique
administrative et financière.

Le rapport d'achèvement du PIP2 a été établi en valorisant les rapports issus des différents bilans
annuels, des études, évaluations et supervisions internes et externes réalisés tout au long des six
années (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 et 2008) écoulées.

En dépit d'un démarrage marqué par des hésitations et des changements d'option de stratégies
opérationnelles, notamment au niveau de la mise en valeur et le financement de l'irrigation, des
résultats importants ont été enregistrés dans les différentes composantes du Projet.

1. La composante « Mise en Valeur et Renforcement des Capacités des Acteurs »(MVRCA)
vise globalement la diffusion des équipements et des techniques de production, la conduite de
tests des techniques et des équipements d'irrigation et le renforcement des capacités des acteurs
pour une augmentation durable de la production et l'amélioration des revenus des irrigants par le
développement d'un conseil agricole de proximité spécifique et adapté au plan de la gestion
technique et économique.

Le développement des services d'appui conseil à la mise en valeur s'est reposé sur un dispositif
comprenant 29 GSC sélectionnés, implantés dans 25 zones de concentration retenues à travers 68
Unités d'Appui Conseil (UAC).

La démonstration et la diffusion de thèmes techniques et variétés améliorées éprouvés par la
recherche et appropriés par les irrigants à travers un mécanisme d'appui conseil aux promoteurs
sont des signes d'efficacité de la composante. Des technologies et techniques performantes ont
été vulgarisées, diffusées et adoptées dans une forte proportion. Ainsi, 30.826 irrigants ont adopté
au moins une des technologies développées et diffusées, soit 103% de la valeur cible (30 000)

                                                  -35-

pour la durée du projet. Ce qui a permis une nette amélioration de la productivité des terres
irriguées avec comme effet une augmentation significative des productions sur les sites suivie
d'une amélioration progressive des revenus des bénéficiaires. Ainsi, à titre illustratif, la marge
nette à l'hectare est de 3 025 818 FCFA pour l'oignon, 1 966 355 FCFA pour le poivron, et
3 311 262 FCFA pour la tomate.

Par les effets cumulés de l'adoption des technologies, de l'appui conseil et de l'accessibilité des
intrants agricoles, les superficies cultivées, la productivité des terres irriguées et les rendements
des principales cultures se sont améliorés de façon significative. La superficie totale équipée a
atteint 16.359 ha pour une prévision de 12 300 ha. La superficie totale mise en valeur quant à elle
se chiffre à 15 092,68 ha en 2008, soit un taux moyen de mise en valeur de 92%.

Dans le cadre du renforcement de capacités des acteurs impliqués, des sessions de formations
centrées sur des besoins réels de développement de l'irrigation ont été organisées au profit des
organisations de producteurs, des agents des services de l'Etat, et des groupements des services
conseils ( GSC). E n effet, 21 344 producteurs, 631 2 élus associatifs, 384 c adres des s ervices
techniques, 526 artisans et 265 membres des GSC ont été formés.

L'appui aux activités de fabrication de certains équipements par les artisans a abouti à plusieurs
formations sur des thèmes d'intérêt, ainsi qu'à l'équipement de ces artisans en vue de les amener
à participer à la diffusion des technologies à faible coût. Dans le même sens, un partenariat direct
a été développé entre ces artisans et les producteurs c ontribuant ainsi à l a pérennisation des
résultats obtenus.

Dans l es z ones de c oncentration de l 'irrigation, l es i ntrants a gricoles ( engrais, pe sticides,
semences) sont souvent indisponibles ou vendus à des prix qui dépassent la portée du paysan
moyen. Ces insuffisances du système d'approvisionnement en intrants ont été prises en compte
par le projet et ont motivé l'installation de 41 boutiques d'intrants dans les zones de concentration
d'irrigation. Des fonds de roulement et des équipements ont été octroyés à travers le financement
à coût partagé.

Pour la valorisation des produits agricoles irrigués par l'appui aux activités post récoltes, des
abris d e c onservation, de s s tands m araîchers e t de s pe tites u nités de transformation on t é té
réalisés avec l'appui du projet.

Le test d'externalisation de la gestion de l'eau sur les aménagements hydro agricoles ne s'est pas
déroulée comme prévu à Galmi et Konni suite à la résiliation de la convention avec l'ONAHA et
à Djiratawa en l'absence de l'opérateur privé recruté. Ainsi tel que réalisé, le test n'a pas permis
de co mparer les r ésultats d es deux types d'opérateurs. Néanmoins, l es trois A ssociations
d'Usagers de l'Eau mises en place s ur ces A HA e t a ppuyées pa r l e p rojet sont a ujourd'hui
fonctionnelles. Ces AUE ont été formées et équipées. D'importants effets ont été observés tels
que : une meilleure gestion de l'eau, une nette amélioration dans le recouvrement et l'utilisation
des redevances eau.


2. L'objectif de la Composante « Financement de l'Irrigation » est l'amélioration de l'accès des
irrigants et opérateurs connexes au financement adapté pour le développement de leurs activités,
visant l'augmentation de la valeur ajoutée, de la productivité et des revenus à travers :
    ·    La mise en place d'un mécanisme de financement de la petite irrigation adapté ;
    ·    L'amélioration d e la c apacité des S ystèmes Financiers D écentralisés (SFD) à g érer
         l'épargne des irrigants et les crédits d'investissement.



                                                  -36-

Le PIP2 a financé 4 435 sous projets pour un coût total de 15 601 455 511 FCFA dont 12 708
572 282 FCFA et 2 892 883 229 FCFA respectivement au titre de la subvention du projet sur
fonds IDA et d'apport des promoteurs (bénéficiaires).

Les sous p rojets f inancés s ont r épartis c omme s uit : 3731 s ous pr ojets « Equipements e t
intrants » (totalisant 21120 exploitations individuelles) ; 97 sous projets « activités connexes »,
intéressant les ateliers de fabrication et de réparation de matériels agricoles et les ateliers de
transformation des produits agricoles ; 8 s ous projets « structurants » constitués de seuils et de
digues de protection ; 74 sous projets de « protection environnementale et sociale » ; 41 s ous
projets « Boutiques d'intrants » ; 457 sous projets « appuis conseils »aux producteurs et 27 sous-
projets équipements des GSC.

Ces sous projets financés ont permis :
    ·    L'augmentation significative de la production et de la rentabilité des cultures irriguées
         dans les zones d'intervention ;
    ·    La modernisation des exploitations ag ricoles i rriguées à travers l 'équipement d es
         producteurs en moyens de captage, d'exhaure et de distribution ;
    ·    L'amélioration de l'approvisionnement en intrants agricoles;
    ·    Le t raitement de 1706 h a de s uperficies m enacés e t l a pr otection de 8 952ha de
         superficies exploitables en irrigation ;
    ·    une nette amélioration de l a f ourniture des matériels d' irrigation, l a di sponibilité des
         ateliers de réparation de GMP et des pompes manuelles, les possibilités de stockage et de
         conservation des produits maraîchers ;
    ·    L'approche d'appui conseil basée sur les GSC a permis la création d'emploi à des jeunes
         diplômés ;
    ·    Du point de vue de la rentabilité des sous projets, le projet a permis une augmentation
         très significative des revenus des bénéficiaires ;
    ·    Au niveau managérial le projet a permis la maîtrise de la petite irrigation privée et surtout
         la possibilité de gestion de l'exploitation comme une petite entreprise agricole ;
    ·    Les résultats obtenus jusqu'ici, sont des signes annonciateurs d'une amélioration durable
         de la sécurité alimentaire, des revenus et des conditions de vie des ménages des irrigants
         appuyés par le projet.

3. La composante « Protection Environnementale et Sociale » a pour objectif l'amélioration de
la prise en compte des préoccupations environnementales et sociales dans toutes les activités du
projet. S a m ise en oe uvre a reposé essentiellement su r l'exécution d 'un Plan d e Gestion
Environnementale et Sociale (PGES) issue de l'évaluation environnementale du projet.
Ainsi, à travers cette composante, le projet a contribué à la mise en oeuvre concrète des politiques
nationales e n m atière d 'évaluation e nvironnementale e t d es po litiques de s auvegarde
environnementale et sociale de la Banque mondiale.

Les principaux résultats obtenus se rapportent essentiellement à :
    ·    La mise en place d'un réseau de suivi des ressources en eau et sol constitué de 319
         piézomètres, 12 mares, 34 sites de suivi des sols ;
    ·    La mise en oeuvre d'un plan de correction des risques environnementaux observés (baisse
         de la nappe) par la réalisation de 8 seuils de recharge ;
    ·    La protection de 857 ha dans les zones à nappes fragile (Maradi, Agadez et Tahoua) et
         deux digues de protection le long du fleuve Niger a favorisé la restauration des conditions
         de développement de l'irrigation ;
    ·    La conception d' outils m éthodologiques e t techniques d 'appui à l'irrigation focalisés
         essentiellement sur les bonnes pratiques ;
    ·    La mise en oeuvre d'un programme structuré de renforcement des capacités des acteurs
         (dont 71 c adres du p rojet, 436 m embres de s G SC d'appui conseil, 9 2 m embres de s

                                                  -37-

        ONG ; 173 agents d es s ervices techniques ; 3169 2 pr oducteurs) ayant p ermis une
        intégration croissante des aspects environnementaux dans leurs méthodes de travail.
    ·   L'élaboration et l'opérationnalisation d'un manuel de procédure de mise en oeuvre de
        sous projet de protection rapprochée de sites menacés ayant permis de traiter 1706 ha de
        terres dégradées pour la protection de 8 952 ha de terres irrigables de vallée (réduction
        des effets de l'érosion sur les sites de production).

Ces résultats et performances sont spécialement attribués à la cohérence de la stratégie de mise en
oeuvre basée sur le faire faire mais aussi à la bonne collaboration de la composante avec différents
partenaires.

La leçon majeure à retenir est que l'information et l'éducation des producteurs sont essentielles
pour expliquer l'étendue des enjeux socio environnementaux, pour conscientiser davantage les
producteurs et pour les mettre à contribution dans la résolution des problèmes liés à la protection
des sites de production menacés.

4. La composante « Gestion » a pour objectif d'assurer une gestion technique, administrative et
financière du Projet à travers une unité de gestion du projet.

Sur le plan institutionnel, des améliorations significatives ont été enregistrées par le Projet au
cours des six années d'exécution ; la responsabilisation de l'UGP dans la mise en oeuvre du Projet
ajoutée à la cohésion créée au sein de l'équipe à l'issue du changement de leadership et de la
restructuration op érationnelle intervenue e n f in 200 6 a oc casionné une a mélioration de l a
performance du projet.

Le t aux de décaissement global est de 98,34 % a u 31 oc tobre 2008, c e qu i est une r éelle
performance du projet.

La performance globale a été jugée satisfaisante au regard des résultats enregistrés par le Projet à
travers 7 indicateurs de performance de l'accord de crédit 3621 NIR du 9 mai 2002.

Annex 10. Examples of Small-Scale Irrigation Technologies in Niger

The following examples are translated from the `Manuel technique de l'irrigant privée' (sheets
10, 16 and 19) which is widely distributed in Niger and used by several donors and many local
initiatives. Simple pumps, PVC drills, and the Californian Network are among the popular
irrigation technologies used all over Niger.

(a) Bangladesh Pump (regular)

Developed by: Enterprise Works Senegal.

Functioning: The "Bangladesh" treadle-pump can pump
water from a maximum depth of 8 meters. The water is
directly forced back into the irrigation network, in the
basin or a reservoir. The pump can be used by one or
two operators simultaneously. The hourly rate of flow of
the Bangladesh pump can vary between 5 m3 and 8 m3
per hour, according to the depth of the soil aquifer and
the number of operators working on the pump.

Specifications:
     - Cylinders: two 105 mm diameter metal cylinders
         with pistons ope rated by a na tural w alking
         motion on two treadles
     - Stroke length: between 0 and 300 mm
     - Weight: about 27 kg
     - Height of treadles above the ground level: 700
         mm

Recommended use: The Bangladesh treadle-pump is essentially used on clayey soils, clayey and
silt-laden soils, and/or sandy-clayey soils where water infiltration is low. The pump, which was
developed for pulling water up to the pump level, is very well adapted to the irrigation by gravity
and the filling up of basins or reservoirs.

Manufacturing in Niger: Small and medium-sized local workshops trained by ANPIP and its
component "Improved Manual Irrigation."

Other countries manufacturing the pump: Benin, Burkina Faso, and Senegal.

Approximate cost in Niger: 60,000 FCFA.




                                               -44-

(b) Hand-augured PVC Drills

Developed by: Lutheran World Relief Niger.

Functioning: The manual drill is a sophisticated and
low-cost drilling system in Niger that enables farmers
to have e asy access to i rrigation w ater. The drill i s
constructed with tubes and a manual auger. The drill is
feasible i n g ood soil conditions ( it m ay not be
appropriate i n hard or rocky soil), with a maximum
penetration of the auger at 14 meters under ground-
level.

Specifications :
      - Diameter of the d rill : v ariable, b etween 5 0
            and 140 mm
      - Depth: variable, between 4 and 14 meters,
      - Rate of flow: depends on the soil properties
            and the water-capacity of the aquifer (0 m3 to
            13 m3 per hour)

Recommended use: hand-augured drilling is recommended for irrigation in areas where the soil-
aquifer doesn't contain important quantities of clay or silt particles. Its performance is best in
areas where the s oil aq uifer c ontains co arse p articles o f s and, at m ore than 3 m eters u nder
ground-level.

Manufacturing in Niger: Small and medium-sized local workshops trained by ANPIP and its
component "Improved Manual Irrigation."

Other countries manufacturing the drill: Benin, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Mali.

(c) Californian Network PVC

Principle: The C alifornian-network s ystem us es
underground P VC c anals to d iffuse w ater f rom a
source t o distribution outlets ( like v ertical hos es),
located at the highest points of the farming gardens,
so as to supply existing gravity channels and water
distribution systems, or to irrigate directly the plant.
A power-pump i s of ten us ed t o nourish the
Californian network in water.

Specifications:
    - Nature of the tubes : PVC pipes,
    - Diameter of the tubes according to the size
        of the cropping area:
             o Surface less than 0.5 ha : 50 mm,
             o Surface between 0.5 ha and 1 ha :
                 63 mm
             o Surface between 1 and 2 ha : 75 mm
    - Number of outlets per hectare: 10 to 15
    - Shelf-life of t he distribution s ystem: 10
        years

Recommended use: the " Zamani" sy stem i s r ecommended where there are v ariations in the
topography of t he land t hat p revent t he farmers from us ing e xisting g round c anals. The
Californian system saves water during the transport, reduces the time and the cost of irrigation
more especially in (porous) sandy soils, where water losses are important. The "Zamani" network
can be used with a motor pump or pressure treadle pump. The network can be progressively
settled and improved according to the means of the farmer.

Other advantages of the Californian system:
             - Farmers have been trained to use the technology
             - Simple to assemble and to use, elementary maintenance
             - Conception materials available on local markets
             - Affordable: broadly 1,000 FCFA/ meter
             - Flat hoses can be connected to the outlet so as to apply the water by spray.
