Niger are as follows: outcomes of the\n            project were highly satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project's emphasis on\n            cost-effective small-scale irrigation with full\n            participation of the private sector remains valid and highly\n            relevant for Niger. The project design and the technologies\n            could be an important example for other countries facing\n            much less severe constraints. Irrigation investments under\n            the project had an average cost of approximately US$2,000\n            per hectare. These investments can bring measurable\n            improvements in farmers' welfare and achieve high\n            economic rates of return, possibly above 20 percent. The\n            project shows that additional responsibilities are created\n            for the private sector when it manages projects that are\n            highly visible and politically charged. Transparency in\n            financial management and procurement is essential.\n            Monitoring and evaluation greatly helped to inform decision-making."}, "docdt": "2009-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
