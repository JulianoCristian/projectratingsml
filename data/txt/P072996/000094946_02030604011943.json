Promotion Project is to increase production and\n            profitability of high-value, irrigated crops by private,\n            smallholder farmers with simple, low-cost technologies.\n            There are four main project components. The first component\n            has two sub-components: The first concerns participatory\n            research aimed at developing and testing new technologies\n            with farmer participation to increase irrigated production\n            and add value. The second involves advisory services, aimed\n            at ensuring that farmers are provided relevant and effective\n            advice on production and marketing on a regular and timely\n            basis, and aimed at disseminating technologies proved\n            effective in the pilot phase of the project. The second\n            component comprises three elements: The first supports the\n            Nigerien Association for the Promotion of Private Irrigation\n            (ANPIP) in its acquiring increasing autonomy,\n            sustainability, and accountability to its members, and also\n            provides support to producers' organizations. The\n            second subcomponent supports the government's efforts\n            in promoting private irrigation. The third subcomponent is a\n            pilot, testing private management of selected offices for\n            irrigated perimeters (ONAHA) to develop models enabling the\n            government to disengage itself from being directly involved\n            in these schemes. The third component finances an irrigation\n            investment fund and microfinance institutions. The fourth\n            component puts in place an action plan aimed at mitigating\n            environmental risks."}, "docdt": "2002-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
