Only the\n            usage of agrochemicals constitutes a major negative\n            environmental impact, the impact on the health of farm\n            families causing the principal concern. Other significant\n            environmental issues for small-scale irrigation is the\n            possibility for excessive water extraction from the\n            construction of hand-held pumps, the cultivation of new land\n            parcels (accompanied by deforestation and the soil\n            deterioration), the draw-down of the water table, and the\n            drainage of sediment and runoff and their concomitant effect\n            on water quality. Measures to mitigate these negative\n            impacts include: Developing an environmental assessment of\n            each site and systematically monitoring it ; elaborating and\n            incorporating environmental clauses in all legal documents\n            and contracts relative to this project; putting in place a\n            matching grant system enabling land valuation and\n            environmental preservation; and researching technological\n            options for aquifer use. Finally, an autonomous\n            nongovernmental organization, the Nigerienne Association for\n            Promoting Private Irrigation (ANPIP), will be charged with\n            managing the project's environmental aspects."}, "docdt": "2001-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
