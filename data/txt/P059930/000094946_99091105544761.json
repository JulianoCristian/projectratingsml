There are\n            three project components. The first revitalizes farmer\n            groups and the organization of farmer networks; builds\n            capacity of farmers to participate in and to lead extension\n            activities; and promotes participatory extension methods and\n            provides media and technology support. The second component\n            extends the introduction of institutional and management\n            reforms at the district level; builds the capacity of\n            extension staff in the participating districts; and\n            strengthens the extension support and delivery systems in\n            participating districts. The third component improves the\n            extension policy, conducts special studies, strengthens\n            central extension support systems including degree and\n            non-degree training, and provides technical assistance and\n            project management support."}, "docdt": "1999-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
