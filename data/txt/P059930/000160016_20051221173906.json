Technologies are available for small farmers that can\n            substantially raise their productivity and incomes if\n            adapted to their farming systems. This demonstrates that\n            modest injections of capital to information-starved rural\n            communities has dramatic impacts on the livelihoods of\n            farming families, and if extended more widely will lead to a\n            second farmer-led wave in increased agricultural\n            productivity and profitability to follow on the heels of the\n            Green Revolution. Integrated, farmer-led extension drives\n            the process enabling farming groups to access technology and\n            market information and to develop mutually beneficial\n            partnerships with agri-business and other providers. 2)\n            Multi-provider models, such as the field extension teams\n            piloted under this project, greatly improve the\n            cost-effectiveness of publicly-funded extension. Field\n            extension teams composed of government primary production\n            agencies and NGO extension workers together with leading\n            farmers, are highly effective in: (a) showing farmers how to\n            organize and discover information for themselves; (b)\n            enabling integrated farming systems solutions to improve\n            rural livelihoods; (c) facilitating the emergence of private\n            sector extension and adoption of \"user pays\"\n            principles; (d) assisting government agencies and NGOs plan\n            their activities to meet farmer needs; (e) increasing the\n            cost effectiveness of publicly-funded extension; and (f)\n            encouraging team building, and providing a focal point for\n            specialist training in participative approaches to extension\n            and agri-business planning. 3) Management structures such as\n            the district extension committees which are set up to\n            coordinate extension activities at the district level need\n            both political and financial backing to survive beyond the\n            life of the project. 4) To ensure high adoption rates among\n            farmers, extension activities should focus on introducing\n            and/or improving low-cost, highly profitable, market-led\n            production and processing activities. 5) Monitoring and\n            evaluation systems need to be established and given due\n            importance by the Government during project design and\n            closely followed during implementation. 6) Timely budget\n            flows from central and local governments to the project\n            implementing agencies down to field level should be ensured."}, "docdt": "2005-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
