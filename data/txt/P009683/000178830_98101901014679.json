"The purpose of the Karnataka Dairy\n            Development Project is to finance an integrated program for\n            increasing the production of milk in rural areas through a\n            program which includes quality cross-breeding, animal health\n            improvement, and the development of facilities for milk\n            collection, processing and marketing. The project consists\n            of: (a) the establishment of about 1,800 dairy cooperative\n            societies, four milk producers unions and the KDDC; (b) an\n            artificial insemination program of cross-breeding the native\n            village cattle with high producing exotic breeds, and\n            associated programs for fodder production and production of\n            purebred exotic breeding stock; (c) establishment of milk\n            collection routes and centers and the expansion of two\n            existing dairy plants and construction of two others, as\n            well as of four cattle feed mills; (d) establishment of two\n            regional diagnostic laboratories as support for an animal\n            health research program, and production of veterinary\n            biologicals and vaccines; (e) provision of consultant\n            services to assist KDDC in developing demonstration farms,\n            applied research trials on pastures and milk marketing\n            studies; and (f) provision of credit to dairy farmers for\n            purchase of crossbred cattle."}, "docdt": "1974-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
