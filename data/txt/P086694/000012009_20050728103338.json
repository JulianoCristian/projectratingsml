An environmental management plan\n            acceptable to the Bank would have to be finalized, and\n            disclosed in the country, prior to project appraisal of\n            category B projects. More comprehensive environmental impact\n            assessments would be required for category A projects. While\n            most projects to be financed under the program, are expected\n            to be category B projects, some generation renovation\n            projects however, might receive category A ratings. This\n            environmental management plan addresses in particular, the\n            potential environmental adversity due to the equipment\n            refurbishment of Lotru - Ciunget HPS, and offers mitigation\n            measures as follows. To prevent and avoid oil and lubricant\n            spills, used oils will be temporarily stored in buffer\n            tanks, to be then loaded into tank trucks, and transported\n            by authorized companies who will be responsible for its\n            collection, removal and/or eventual regeneration; reusable\n            wastes resulting from equipment removal, i.e., ferrous\n            metallic, non-ferrous metallic, ceramic materials, shall be\n            sorted, and temporarily stored on the power station\n            platform, to be then transported by authorized companies\n            responsible for its collection, recycling, and/or re-uses;\n            equipment containing compounds, i.e., PCBs - polychlorinated\n            biphenyls - will be removed in compliance with legal and\n            regulatory frameworks, to be stored at approved, selected\n            sites; to minimize noise disturbances, a maximum number of\n            equipment operating simultaneously will be established, so\n            as not to exceed acceptable noise levels, and, new equipment\n            to be procured, should be consistent in diminished noise\n            generation. In addition, scheduled working hours should\n            observe general norms of labor protection related to noise\n            levels; the absence of anticorrosive protection materials in\n            water systems, calls for the modernization of sealing\n            systems, featuring biodegradable absorbing instruments and\n            materials, such as absorbent pads, rolls, or anticorrosive\n            solvents, primers, and paints, in accordance with\n            international standards; soil erosion and contamination\n            shall be minimized through careful handling of lubricants\n            and oils, avoiding discharges, or pumping, taking special\n            consideration to the replacement, and decontamination of\n            drainage sands to prevent oil leakages; fire prevention and\n            control measures will be in place, and, extinguishers\n            (including portable ones) will be required, as will adequate\n            staff training, and evacuation procedures, as needed;\n            monitoring criteria, and regular inspections will be in\n            place to ensure compliance with environmental regulations."}, "docdt": "2005-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
