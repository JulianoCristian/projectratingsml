Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are overall\n            satisfactory. Lessons included the following: The pilot\n            operation was very useful in setting in motion a major\n            restructuring program--the mere fact that the pilot closure\n            was successful was sufficient to trigger an accelerated mine\n            closure program and thus substantially reduce the drain on\n            the national budget. In deviating from the best practice\n            norm, this project had several disbursement conditions for\n            different components, allowing fast processing and early\n            loan effectiveness, thus enabling the national economy to\n            reap the benefits of fast restructuring. Also, when it\n            became evident during implementation that micro-credits and\n            employment subsidies were ineffective social mitigation\n            measures at this time, the funds were shifted to public\n            works which, beside the positive temporary employment, had\n            added social benefits for the local public, and through the\n            goodwill created, contributed to keeping the pace of mine\n            closures. Triggered by difficulties met in financing social\n            assets transfers and the need to provide incentives for such\n            transfers and improve conditions in communities with closed\n            mines, the Bank's supervision team, in close\n            cooperation with the beneficiaries, developed the Municipal\n            Credit Line. Procedures that could improve mine closures\n            include sufficient preparation, splitting tasks, and\n            tailoring the agency for mine closures."}, "docdt": "2001-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
