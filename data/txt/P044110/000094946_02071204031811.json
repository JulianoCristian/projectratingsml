likely. The\n            institutional development impact of the Pilot was rated as\n            substantial, while that for the SECAL project was only\n            modest. World Bank and Borrower performances in both\n            projects were rated as satisfactory. Several lessons were\n            learned: Quick-disbursing SECALs are inappropriate vehicles\n            for supporting sector restructuring programs. SECALs in\n            support of mine closures should be designed with several\n            small, flexible tranches, rather than a small numberof large\n            tranches. Projects designed to support setor restructuring\n            should have a clear focus on poverty reduction objectives.\n            The financial and economic performance of pilot projects\n            activities needs to be carefully monitored. The Bank needs\n            to make greater efforts to help improve the eficiency of\n            mine closure activities. The Bank should consider working\n            more closely with other bilateral and multicultural agencies\n            that are providing seed money for establishing local\n            cooperatives and other self-help institutions."}, "docdt": "2002-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
