project\n            preparation was highly deficient, Bank performance in\n            project appraisal was highly deficient, Bank performance in\n            project supervision was partially satisfactory, Borrower\n            performance in project preparation was deficient, Borrower\n            performance in implementation was deficient, and Borrower\n            performance in covenant compliance was deficient. Some\n            lessons learned included: it is highly risky to attempt to\n            compensate for past under investment and neglect of water\n            and sewerage systems by undertaking overly ambitious\n            investment programs. Choices have to be made to implement\n            gradual improvements which adequately take into account the\n            prevailing institutional and financial constraints. Emphasis\n            should be put on actions and investments required for using\n            existing infrastructure in a more efficient manner,\n            particularly in cases where there is evidence that poor\n            service is due to deficiencies in system operation and\n            maintenance practices. Additions to installed capacity to\n            meet future demands should not be undertaken as a substitute\n            for improving operation and maintenance, and should not put\n            an excessive burden on the borrower's implementation\n            and financial capacity."}, "docdt": "1996-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
