Izmir, reduce health hazards,\n            bring about major environmental improvements and economic\n            benefits and help strengthen institutional and financial\n            aspects of the water supply and sewerage sector in Izmir.\n            To this end, the project includes components relating both\n            to the water supply and sewerage subsectors.  Within the\n            water supply component, the project provides for completion\n            of the construction of the Tahtali Dam and Reservoir, along\n            with construction for the Tahtali water supply system of an\n            intake, water treatment plant, treated water storage,\n            pumping station, water transmission main and a terminal\n            storage reservoir; and expansion, reinforcement and\n            rehabilitation of the water distribution network.  Under the\n            sewerage element of the project, it provides for\n            construction of a sewage interceptor, a sewage treatment\n            plant, seven pumping stations, sewage collectors and\n            property connections.  The loan will help to build up a\n            strong sector organization, and, through the organization,\n            will provide piped water facilities for approximately 0.84\n            million people, and sewerage for 1.17 million people by 1994."}, "docdt": "1987-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
