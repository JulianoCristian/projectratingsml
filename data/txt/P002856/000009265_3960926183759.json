This will be achieved by improving SOTOCO's\n            (Societe Togolaise du Coton) agricultural support services.\n            Special attention will be given to creating and supporting\n            new farmers groups, introducing integrated pest managment,\n            and providing selected technical assistance. The project\n            will also improve the sector's financial arrangements\n            by gradually eliminating subsidies, changing SOTOCO's\n            operating guidelines so that it can operate along commercial\n            lines, and by implementing a flexible producer price policy\n            that provides incentives to farmers and SOTOCO and is\n            responsive to world market prices. Finally, the project will\n            seek to improve the cost effectiveness of SOTOCO's\n            cotton processing and marketing operations."}, "docdt": "1988-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
