Following are some of\n            the lessons learned from the project: External funding is\n            inevitably used as a substitute for government funding,\n            despite assurances provided to the contrary. Project\n            management arrangements need to coordinate with Directorate\n            of Health Services operations as early as possible. User\n            fees do contribute vital resources towards non-salary\n            recurrent costs that can make a substantial difference to\n            the quality of care at hospitals."}, "docdt": "2006-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
