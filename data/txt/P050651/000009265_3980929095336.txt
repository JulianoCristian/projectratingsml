1.      Project Objectives.   The objectives of the proposed project
would be to assist the Governments of Maharashtra and Rajasthan to:
(i) improve efficiency in the allocation and use of health resources
through policy and institutional development; and (ii) improve the
performance of the health care system through improvements in the
quality, effectiveness and coverage of health services at the first
referral level and selective coverage at the primary level to better
serve the neediest sections of society.
2.      Project Description.   The proposed project would be an
investment operation with policy content. The policy content would
include: (i) increasing financing and improving resource allocation
for the health sector; (ii) strengthening the capacity for sector
analysis and management; (iii) enhancing the role of the private and
voluntary sectors in the delivery and management of health services;
and (iv) implementing a user charge policy.
3.      Project investments would include:
I. Management Development and Institutional Strengthening by:
(a) improving the institutional framework for policy development by
creating a Strategic Planning Cell at the state level to monitor the
critical issues in the health sector;
(b) strengthening the management and implementation capacity at (i)
the state level, by strengthening the management capacity of the
implementing agency and appointing key staff in finance, engineering
services, medical services, medical management, and administration
and personnel; (ii) at the district level, by setting up District
Health Committees which would facilitate the functioning of the
referral system, ensure maintenance of equipment, manage hospital
waste, provide quality assurance, undertake surveillance of
communicable diseases, monitor and supervise project activities and
be responsible for collecting and redistributing user charges; (iii)
strengthening the health management information system and
introducing a revised medical record system for in-patient and
diagnostic services; and (iv) providing appropriate training for all
management staff at the state and district levels; and



(c) strengthening the capacity for surveillance of major
communicable diseases through the development of a community based
system for early detection and reporting, with the full
participation of local institutions.
II. Improving Service Quality, Access and Effectiveness at the First
Referral Level, through:
(a) upgrading area, subdivisional and district hospitals by
renovating and extending the physical infrastructure; and
(b) upgrading effectiveness of clinical, managerial and support
services at the facility level by rationalizing service norms and
standards for clinical and support services; developing staffing,
equipment and space norms; ensuring the adequate maintenance of
existing facilities and equipment; and providing training for
clinical and managerial services.
III. Improving access to Primary Health Care in Remote and
Underdeveloped areas through
(a) selective upgrading of community and primary health centers; and
(b) improving referral mechanisms and strengthening linkages with
the secondary and tertiary health care levels.
4.      Project Implementation. The project will be managed and
implemented by the states' Department of Health and Family Welfare.
A Project Governing Board (PGB) would be at the top of the project
management structure. It will include high level representation
from all relevant parts of the state Government that are associated
with the project. The PGB would be fully empowered to make major
policy decisions and develop the broad policy outline for the
project; approve the annual budget; authorize major project
revisions as necessary; formulate rules and regulations; and
undertake an annual review of project implementation and monitor
overall project progress. The PGB would have the responsibility for
supervising the activities of project management. Project
management would be supported by the use of consultancy/professional
services under technical assistance, especially with regard to the
management of civil works. The PGB would meet as and when
necessary. The Strategic Planning Cell would report to the PGB.
5.      Reporting to the PGB would be the Project Management Cell
(PMC). The PMC would be headed by an Additional Secretary as the
Project Administrator. This function would be assisted by medical,
technical, engineering services, financial management and
administration and personnel divisions. The functions of the PMC
would include all aspects of routine project management, monitoring
progress, maintaining flow-of-funds and project account, providing
technical guidance and general administration, and preparing
progress reports.
6.      At the district level, District Health Committees (DHCs) would
be established in all districts to facilitate functioning of the

various activities to be carried out under the project. The DHCs
would facilitate the collection and distribution of user charges,
maintenance of equipment, waste management, training of technical
staff, quality assurance, surveillance of major communicable
diseases and monitoring and supervision of project related activities.
7.      Project Cost and Financing.   Preliminary project costs are
estimated at US$250 million, of which Bank Group financing would be
about US$200 million.

Annex
Environmental
Environmental and Social Aspects. Environmental Impact. While the
project will not contribute to any sizable increase in hospital
waste, it will address the issue of the management of medical waste
at the facility level, including collection, storage and final
disposal. Due to concern with regard to the use of incineration
technology and the expressed concern that the incineration of
plastics results in emissions of dioxins and furans, alternative
disposal technology will be fully evaluated. The states will
produce an environmental action plan and the project preparation
team will review the plans and incorporate them into project design.
Poverty Aspects. A large proportion of project beneficiaries will
be from poor and underprivileged segments of the state's population.
Indigenous Peoples. The project states have large scheduled tribe
populations, and tribal peoples are likely to be substantial project
beneficiaries. The proposed project would therefore address issues
related to (i) strengthening linkages between primary and first
referral health services; (ii) providing an incentive package to
doctors and medical staff in tribal areas to encourage them to
accept the assignment; and (iii) increasing appropriate utilization
of non-tribal medical systems by tribal populations and reducing the
cost to tribals of doing so. Gender Issues. The project would
establish linkages with the reproductive and child health (RCH)
project in each state, and provide an appropriate RCH package at the
first referral level. In addition, the project would promote a
life-cycle approach to women's health through information, education
and communication inputs.
