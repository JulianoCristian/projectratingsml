In addition, the Project will allocate\n            money for a Project Implementation Team.  These expenditures\n            included price and physical contingencies.  The activities\n            in the domestic tax administration and the PEM component are\n            currently being supported by a parallel activity with some\n            initial grant financing from the United Nations Development\n            Programme (UNDP).  The Revenue Enhancement and Fiscal\n            Management Technical Assistance Project will finance the\n            costs of consultants and some equipment for these activities\n            to supplement the UNDP financing."}, "docdt": "1994-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
