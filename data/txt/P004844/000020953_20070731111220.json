The lessons learned\n            included: 1) It is not healthy for a commercial bank like\n            Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD)\n            to manage many lines of credit under Bank-financed projects\n            with different lending terms and conditions, because it\n            results in inconsistencies in its lending policy and\n            operations; 2) The project supported the production of\n            higher-value commodities to improve incomes for the rural\n            poor. For future support to products like rubber, the scope\n            should be expanded to include activities on market\n            development, trade integration and promotion. This would\n            help enhance the competitiveness and obtain higher returns\n            for farmers 3) In order to achieve a sustainable impact on\n            poverty reduction, agricultural development should be linked\n            strongly with the management of natural resources; 4) To\n            improve VBARD's performance and consistency in its\n            lending policy, the Bank should pay closer attention to\n            capacity building and possibly combining lines of credit in\n            a single operation (such as the Rural Finance II Project)\n            under which these performance issues could be addressed; 5)\n            The project provides one more example of an M&E system\n            failing to achieve the quality anticipated in design; 6) The\n            project covered a large number of provinces - eleven in the\n            central region and seven provinces in the north - and this\n            made it difficult to manage project implementation\n            effectively; and 7) There was little decentralization from\n            Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to project\n            provinces in the project. This was one of the main reasons\n            for the delays in implementation and the slow rate of\n            disbursement of the Credit. As decentralization was\n            introduced in the last two years, project implementation accelerated."}, "docdt": "2007-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
