                                F. RESULTS FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS


Project Development Objective

The Project Development Objective was to diversify and intensify agricultural production and
thereby to increase and stabilize farmers' incomes and rural employment, principally through
establishing a smallholder rubber sector and up-grading livestock production and crop
intensification activities, in the poor central highland and coastal provinces of Vietnam.

Revised Project Development Objective

There were no changes made to the Project Development Objective during project
implementation. However, the main focus of diversification, the establishment of a smallholder
rubber sector, was reduced in importance during implementation and more emphasis was given to
intensification and diversification in the crop and livestock sub-sectors.

The Project Development Objective remained unchanged throughout the implementation period
of the project. However, one of the Key Performance Indicators related to the achievement of the
objective was formally revised to achieve more effective agricultural diversification. Specifically,
the target for the establishment of new planted rubber area was reduced: (a) from 60,000 ha to
40,000 ha in mid-2001 following the Mid-term Review; and (b) from 40,000 ha to 30,000 ha in
late 2003. Both of these changes were effected through amendments to the Development Credit
Agreement1. At the same time, the support provided for other crops and livestock was enhanced.
Accordingly, the funds allocated to rubber development were reduced by half and the funds
allocated for agricultural intensification and diversification were doubled. The justifications for
the changes were to respond to market niches and farmers' demands and to achieve a better-
balanced development of smallholder rubber, annual crops and livestock.

I. DISBURSEMENT PROFILE

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 In 1998, despite rapid growth in the economy as a whole, Vietnam's rural communities
were still overwhelmingly poor, mainly because of the small size of farmed area per household.
Rural unemployment was increasing as a result of high population growth rates, labor-displacing
technology changes and the return of workers displaced elsewhere. Rice and coffee export price
instability adversely affected incomes and investment as the economy had opened to world
markets. Rural poverty was worsening in the environmentally degraded highland areas where
agricultural conditions were generally not as favorable as in the lowlands and where ethnic
minorities were concentrated.

1.1.2 To generate a substantial impact on rural incomes, employment and the environment, the
relatively high annual agricultural growth rate of some four percent needed to be increased by
changing the structure of production and by broadening the rural based industries with a need for
equitable distribution. Two of the most significant impediments to changing the structure of
production included the general shortage of long-term investment finance in rural areas and the
inadequacy of technical advice on new opportunities.

1.1.3 Less than 50 percent of farmers received rural credit, which was mostly short-term
seasonal credit for rice production. This was because of the sheer number of new smallholder
operations (10 million) following de-collectivization, the large number of farmers without
collateral, the immaturity of rural financial institutions, and government controls on credit
availability and interest rates in order to limit inflation. Savings mobilization was traditionally
low and predominantly short term, partly reflecting the higher interest rates administratively set
on short-term lending. As a result, rural credit markets did not readily reflect investment
opportunities.

1.1.4 Although the government was reforming the financial sector with a number of important
changes to improve credit access and to lower the cost of reaching a large number of small
borrowers, financial reform programs required significant time to be completed and to have an
impact. In this context, the project - consistent with the direction of the reforms - introduced
long-term supervised credit and supported extension services in order to take advantage of clear
opportunities through diversifying the crop mix at both household and sector levels. The project
addressed the issue of credit access by providing land use certificates to smallholders to serve as
part of collateral requirements.

1.1.5 The sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal of the project was to
"... increase and stabilize incomes and employment in rural areas of Vietnam". A key
performance indicator for this CAS-related goal was that average rural household real income
would increase by 12 percent by 2004, although no indication was given in the Project Design
Summary as to how this was to be measured or on what it was based. The project was expected
to support poverty reduction and sustainable development, and to promote the sustainable use of
natural resources by supporting tree crop development on degraded sloping land unsuitable for
annual cropping.




                                                    1

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to diversify and intensify agricultural
production and thereby increase and stabilize farmers' incomes and rural employment through
establishing a smallholder rubber sector and upgrading livestock production and crop
intensification activities in the poor central highland and coastal provinces of Vietnam.

1.1.2 Two Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were stated in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) for the achievement of the PDO:

(a) the establishment of 60,000 ha of new rubber smallholdings and the rehabilitation of
17,000 ha of existing rubber smallholdings in the central highland and coastal provinces by
2004; and

(b) an increase of 20 percent in the number of cattle and pigs per farm household in the
central highland and coastal provinces by 2004.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1 The PDO remained unchanged throughout the implementation period of the project.
However, one of the KPIs related to the achievement of the PDO was formally revised to achieve
more effective agricultural diversification. Specifically, the target for the establishment of new
planted rubber area was reduced from 60,000 to 40,000 ha in mid-2001 following the Mid-term
Review and further reduced to 30,000 ha in late 2003. Both of these changes were effected
through amendments to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA)2. At the same time, the
support for other crops and livestock was enhanced. Accordingly, the funds allocated to rubber
development were reduced by half and the funds allocated for agricultural intensification and
diversification were doubled. The justifications for the changes were to respond to market niches
and farmers' demands and to achieve a better-balanced development of smallholder rubber,
annual crops and livestock.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 There were four main groups of project beneficiaries:

(a) smallholder farmers, especially the poor, in the central highland/coastal provinces of Vietnam
who would benefit from increasing land tenure security, farm incomes, and non-farm service jobs
(e.g., small-scale rubber processing and trading);

(b) minorities living in the project area who would benefit from a higher degree of food security,
increasing land tenure security and household incomes, creating employment opportunities, and
developing their specific cultural identify (e.g., construction of communal houses);




2The first letter of amendment was dated July 12, 2001, and was counter-signed on behalf of the Borrower on August 30, 2001. The
second letter was dated December 23, 2003, and was counter-signed on January 15, 2004.




                                                              2

(c) the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) agricultural research and
extension systems and central and local government's technical and administration bodies which
would benefit through improving their institutional and administrative capacity; and

(d) other stakeholders in the project area who would benefit from improving social stability and
environmental protection through covering bare hills with tree crops and reduction of slash-and-
burn agriculture.

1.4.2    At appraisal, six major areas of benefits were anticipated: (a) increases in farm incomes
and non-farm employment; (b) an increased stability in regional income; (c) the increased
participation of ethnic minorities in commercial agriculture; (d) improved security of land tenure
and community development; (e) soil conservation through tree cover and reduced slash-and-
burn agriculture; and (f) institutional development. The investments of the project were
expected to contribute directly to the achievement of these benefits in the following manner:

       Benefits                             Components/sub-components
           (a)           1. (a), (b), (c) and (e); 3. (a), (b) and (c)
          (b)            1. (a), (b), (c) and (e); 3. (a), (b) and (c)
           (c)           1. (a), (b), (c) and (e); 3 . (a), (b) and (c); 4. (a)
          (d)            2. and 3. (a)
           (e)           1. (a), (b), (c) and (e); 3. (a), (b) and (c)
           (f)           4. (a), (b) and (c)



1.4.3 In most cases, the causal link between the investments made under the project and the
benefits expected to flow to beneficiaries was a direct one. For example, assisting small
farmers to invest in new or rehabilitated rubber plantations would lead directly to an increase in
rubber production and incomes, and assisting farmers to diversify and intensify crop and
livestock production would lead directly to a broadened income base and income stability. In
other areas, the causal link was less direct: land allocation and the issuance of Land Use Rights
Certificates (LURCs) have been shown elsewhere in Vietnam to promote stable, long-term land
use, to encourage investment and to reduce disputes, all of which are necessary but not
sufficient conditions for increases in output and productivity to be achieved. The investments in
institution building were to provide an enabling environment, but it was recognized that
beneficiaries themselves must play a predominant role in order to realize the benefits.
Associated investments from other sources included the contributions of farmers to on-farm
investments, the parallel financing from the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and
counterpart funding from the government.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1 The project had four components. The costs at appraisal shown here included both
physical and price contingency provisions.

1.5.2 Component 1: Smallholder Rubber Development (U$50.9 million, 61 percent of the
total cost) was aimed at establishing a new smallholder rubber sector in the country's poor central
region through the development of new smallholder rubber and the rehabilitation and
maintenance of existing smallholder rubber in central highland and coastal provinces. This
component had five sub-components:




                                                       3

1.5.3 Sub-component 1(a): Establishment of New Rubber Smallholdings (US$35.2 million)
was designed to assist small farmers dependent on agricultural production for their livelihood and
with access to suitable land and available labor to plant and maintain rubber trees in the central
project provinces. The target at appraisal was 60,000 ha of planted rubber. Farmers were to
participate on a voluntary basis. The size of the rubber holdings was expected to be 1-3 ha per
household. Rubber extension and technical assistance were to be provided through the existing
General Rubber Corporation (GRC) and local State Rubber Companies (SRCs). Farmers were to
receive long-term credit through the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development
(VBARD) for planting materials and other inputs and to use their own labor for planting and
maintaining their rubber trees.

1.5.4 Sub-component 1(b): Rehabilitation of Existing Rubber Smallholdings (US$10
million) was designed to assist rubber smallholders in rehabilitating and maintaining existing
small rubber holdings in the central project provinces. The appraisal target was 17,600 ha.
Farmers were to receive extension and technical assistance through the GRC and SRCs and long-
term credit through VBARD. Only potentially viable rubber holdings (those with at least 300
trees per ha in the third year after planting) were to be selected for rehabilitation. The cost per ha
of rehabilitation was estimated to be about 40 percent of the cost of establishing new rubber.

1.5.5 Sub-component 1(c): Rubber Extension (US$2.8 million) was designed to provide
technical support to farmers for land preparation, planting and maintenance of new small rubber
holdings and for the rehabilitation and maintenance of existing holdings through the use of
existing networks of the GRC, SRCs and the Rubber Research Institute of Vietnam (RRIV). The
project was also to provide assistance to strengthen the capacity of the provincial Departments of
Agriculture to provide extension services for rubber, crops and livestock through the training of
extension staff at provincial level, the recruitment and training of district extension workers, and
the selection and training of farmer leaders in participating villages.

1.5.6 Sub-component 1(d): Smallholder Rubber Research (US$1.8 million) was designed to
test and recommend agricultural technical practices for rubber, associated annual and perennial
crops and farming systems to suit the project area's environmental and socio-economic conditions.
The research programs consisted of basic research trials, adaptive research and participatory
research aimed at developing and assessing technical options in response to farmers' needs. The
research programs were implemented by the RRIV for rubber and by other research institutes for
annual and perennial crops and farming systems. Two international research specialists were
seconded by the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le
Dévelopment (CIRAD), including a senior rubber research specialist and a senior farming
systems specialist, to assist in developing and coordinating research programs.

1.5.7 Sub-component 1(e): Upgrading of Farm Access Tracks (US$1.1 million) in project
rubber villages was aimed at facilitating transportation of farm inputs and extension activities.
Small tracks were 2-3 meters wide and constructed with local materials. The project did not
provide financing for the up-grading of village or commune access roads.

1.5.8 Component 2: Land Allocation (US$7.9 million, 9.0 percent of total cost) was designed
to promote the security of land tenure through the issuance of long-term LURCs to smallholders
in the central project provinces. This was intended to promote stable long-term land use and to
encourage investment in improvements to land, leading to increased productivity, economic
growth and reduced migration into the project area, thereby improving social stability, especially
in ethnic minority communes. The project financed the survey and mapping of land in project
communes by the provincial and district land administration offices based on village land-use

planning carried out through a participatory approach. The project also assisted in strengthening
the capacity for the land administration offices by providing them with necessary equipment and
training.

1.5.9 Component 3: Agriculture Intensification and Diversification (US$18.0 million, 21
percent of total cost) was designed to diversify and intensify agricultural production, thereby
improving smallholders' incomes especially during the initial period when rubber had not reached
maturity for tapping. This component consisted of three sub-components:

1.5.10 Sub-component 3(a): Crop and Livestock Extension Services (US$3.3 million) was
designed to provide technical support to small farmers for the intensification of crop and livestock
production in the central project provinces. Project assistance included the dissemination of
information, the establishment of livestock demonstrations (with a special focus on fattening
cattle and pigs using local feed materials, parasite control and artificial insemination) and training
of farmer leaders. It was implemented in all project communes in the central region through
MARD and provincial extension centers.

1.5.11 Sub-component 3(b): Credit for Annual and Perennial Crop and Livestock
Development (US$13.7 million) was to provide short-term and medium-term sub-loans (through
VBARD) to assist participating rubber smallholders in increasing farm income from annual crops
(e.g., rice, maize and groundnuts), perennial cash crops (e.g., fruit trees) and livestock production
during the immature period of the rubber trees. The line of credit was also available for crop
intensification activities to all non-rubber growers in the districts participating in the new
smallholder rubber development and for livestock production activities to all farmers in the
eleven central project provinces.

1.5.12 Sub-component 3(c): Pilot Fruit Tree Development (US$1.0 million) was to be
implemented on a "pilot scale" in the country's northern region, which has a potential for
development of sub-tropical and temperate fruit trees. It was designed to collect the technical and
socio-economic data necessary on which to base an expanded, large-scale program. The main
fruits assessed under the pilot program were to include citrus, mango, prune, pear, peach, apricot
and persimmon (kaki). The pilot program was to be conducted by the Research Institute for
Fruits and Vegetables (RIFAV), with the assistance of the National Institute of Plant Protection,
and to consist of the establishment and monitoring of nurseries, field trials under controlled
conditions and demonstrations under farmer management in seven northern project provinces
(Lang Son, Lao Cai, Nghe An, Phu Tho, Son La, Thai Nguyen and Vinh Phuc), and technical and
economic evaluation studies.

1.5.13 Component 4: Institutional Strengthening (US$7.5 million, 9 percent of total cost)
consisted of three sub-components:

1.5.14 Sub-component 4(a): Support for Ethnic Minority Participation (US$1.4 million)
was designed to implement the Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDP), prepared under the
project, to ensure that the indigenous populations would receive social and economic benefits
from the project, compatible with their culture, and that they would not suffer negative effects
from the project. The component included activities exclusively designed to support the
participation of ethnic minorities in the project, consisting of: (i) training and strengthening the
institutional capacities of the ethnic minority communities; (ii) construction of communal houses;
and, (iii) enhancing the capacity of project government departments to reach and provide
appropriate services to the minority communities.



                                                 5

1.5.15 Sub-component 4(b): Human Resource Development (US$1.2 million) was designed
to improve the quality of management in the agricultural sector by building on the program begun
under the (then-existing) IDA-financed Agricultural Rehabilitation Project. It included: (i) a
sector-wide education/training needs assessment to identify gaps in staff knowledge and skills as
they related to the new structure of MARD and to the type of extension and other support being
offered to farmers in the main agro-economic zones of the country; (ii) curriculum revision in key
ministry education and training institutions to match the future needs of sector development; (iii)
training of trainers and provision of limited basic teaching equipment; and (iv) a study of the
agricultural extension systems. This component was implemented in coordination with MARD's
Department of Personnel.

1.5.16 Sub-component 4(c): Project Management (US$1.2 million) was designed to support
the establishment of the institutional structures and management processes at all levels to
implement the project, including monitoring and evaluation of project impacts, financial
management and audits, and supervision.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The original structure of the project, with four components and eleven sub-components,
remained unchanged throughout the implementation period, but the relative importance of the
project's two main components changed significantly. In terms of project costs, Component 1:
Smallholder Rubber Development was halved, Component 3: Agriculture Intensification and
Diversification more than doubled, and Sub-component 4(c): Project Management grew by
two-thirds in size.

1.6.2   Project design and scope. At design, the project focused heavily on the development of
new smallholder rubber. During implementation, market niches for other crops and livestock
emerged and farmers demanded more short- and medium-term credit for diversification into other
crops and livestock. Responding to the market forces and demands, the indicative target for
development of new smallholder rubber was reduced from 60,000 ha to 40,000 ha during the
Mid-term Review (MTR) in 2001 and further reduced to 30,000 ha in late 2003. A significant
amount of the anticipated long-term credit for new rubber was reallocated to short- and medium-
term credit to promote more effective diversification in agriculture through a better balanced
development of smallholder rubber, crops and livestock.

1.6.3   The modifications of the target did not require Board approval; they were processed at
the regional level and formalized by amendments to the DCA.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 During project implementation, there were some significant changes in the allocation
of funds and in the scope of some sub-components that responded to actual implementation
conditions. Funds were reallocated between disbursement categories of the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA), the most significant of which was from the long-term credit for new rubber
development to short-term and medium-term credit for crop and livestock development, and
project management as a result of the following:

(a) The implementation period. The project was extended for two years. At start-up, project
performance was seriously hampered by: (i) the sharp decline of rubber prices in international
markets to a 25-year record low, which resulted in a low level of interest on the part of farmers
and local authorities (including the Provincial Project Management Units - PPMUs); (ii) the


                                                6

unavailability of technical guidelines from MARD and the slow issuance of the Financial Circular
on cost norms by the Ministry of Finance (MOF); (iii) issues related to lending procedures of
VBARD (e.g., complicated lending procedures and the application of market interest rates); and
(iv) the weak capacity and understaffing of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and PPMUs (in
part caused by new staff and lack of training).

(b) Reallocation of funds. Project design at appraisal under-estimated the funding needed for
diversification into other crops and livestock. The crop intensification/diversification component
was expanded to cover all districts following farmers' demands in response to market niches (not
only for new rubber development districts of the project as originally designed). During
implementation, the unit cost for land measurement and issuance of LURCs to smallholders
increased considerably (from US$27 per ha to US$45 per ha), in part as a result of the
government's adjustments to payment scales for unskilled labor. The number of project
provinces increased from 11 to 12 (Dak Lak province was split into two, and Dak Nong province
was created). With the extension of the project implementation period, the project also needed
more funds for project management and institutional development activities. Reallocation of
funds was made among the project components, as summarized in the table below.

1.7.2 The financial resources available for the project in US$ terms increased during
implementation as the result of exchange rate changes between the US$ and the Special Drawing
Right (SDR). The original total budget increased from US$84.3 million to US$86.9 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Project Preparation. During project preparation, extensive participation and consultation,
including the social assessment and environmental assessment processes, were carried out.
Project design was practical, with emphasis placed on increasing and diversifying farm income
and generating rural employment to achieve poverty reduction for the central poor region. The
protection of natural resources and the prevention of unplanned migration into the project area
were recognized as important issues, and mitigation measures were built into the project design,
(such as the introduction of environmentally-friendly extension services and the provision of
secure land tenure to local people through land allocation and the issuance of LURCs).

2.1.2 Project Design was built on the results from an analysis of existing credit operations in the
country.
    · First, the study showed that credit was available only for a few traditional crops for which
        markets, extension services and peer advice was readily available and was concentrated
        in the more fertile deltas where incomes were already higher than elsewhere. In order to
        have a major diversification impact while improving income distribution relative to other
        areas of Vietnam, an integrated package of short- and long-term credit was considered
        necessary, directed to suitable activities in chosen regions and associated with the
        necessary technical support and land allocation.
    · Second, the selection of a suitable smallholder crop and technical package was critical to
        the project's success. In the central coastal and highlands regions, a mixture of rubber,
        livestock and short-term cropping was chosen, based on: (a) the availability of suitable
        land, labor and markets; and (b) government policy which strongly supported the
        development of smallholder rubber in the regions as being environmentally suitable for
        the degraded uplands.
    · Third, the Central Highlands and the Central Coast uplands were chosen because they
        were among the poorest regions with a large part of the population living without access
        to social services. In addition, forests in this area had suffered extensive degradation as a
        result of defoliation during the war and intensive logging followed by shifting cultivation.
        The government promoted a program to rehabilitate these hills through community-based
        reforestation, the establishment of tree crops and biodiversity protection for remaining
        forest; rubber cultivation fitted particularly well into this strategy.

2.1.3 It should be noted that the project was designed during the 1990s when Vietnam had not
been well integrated with the regional and world economy. The project aimed to help the
government address poverty and unemployment in the central regions, mainly through increased
agricultural productivity of specific crops and livestock. The project set some indicative
production targets, especially for rubber, but did not include measures to allow quick and
effective responses to the market changes. As a result, in the first two years of project
implementation, when international rubber prices plunged, project implementation was stalled
with very little disbursement.

2.1.4 Quality at Entry. The project was appraised by the Bank with full diligence and the
identified project interventions were of priority to the country and to the CAS. All required
documents, such as the project implementation plan, the resettlement framework and the EMDP,
were thoroughly prepared by the government, reviewed by the Bank and ready at negotiations.
Despite that, with the benefit of hindsight it can be seen that the quality of project implementation
would have been enhanced if the following had been taken into account at project preparation:


                                                 8

    · A better balance between rubber, crops and livestock for more effective diversification.
    · Measures to allow the project to respond quickly and effectively to market changes.
    · Effective coordination measures to strengthen the linkages between credit and non-credit
        activities.
    · Providing training to local institutions and to communities on participation procedures at
        the earliest stage, preferably at project preparation rather than during implementation.
        However, this would have required additional budget resources and a longer preparation
        time.
    · Better-defined KPIs focused on the outcomes (e.g., farmers' income) as well as on the
        outputs (e.g., areas of rubber established and rehabilitated, and the numbers of cattle and
        pigs). The outcomes would have had to be defined accurately and to be related to those
        project inputs with strong causal linkages to outcomes.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 Overall. The implementation of the project is considered to have been successful and the
PDO achieved. The project made good progress after a prolonged delay at its start. The project
implementation period can be divided into three parts:

(a) From December 1998 to December 2001: Project performance was poor and
implementation was seriously delayed by: (i) the limited interest among farmers in planting or
rehabilitating rubber because of the low price of rubber and the competitiveness of coffee in some
parts of the project area; (ii) problems associated with land allocation and the slow issuance of
LURCs that were necessary as collateral for long-term credit; (iii) start-up and coordination
problems experienced by the PCU; and (iv) delays in the flow of counterpart funds. During this
period, few activities were implemented and disbursements were low.

(b) From December 2001 to December 2004: Implementation gradually caught up as a result
of the MTR in March 2001 during which the target for rubber development was reduced by half
(from 60,000 ha to 30,000 ha) and the support to other crops and livestock was enhanced to
achieve more effective agricultural diversification and a better balance among rubber, other crops
and livestock. The Technical Office was moved from Gia Lai to Hue to allow more effective
technical assistance to the PPMUs. Progress was made in all the project's components especially
land allocation, the implementation of crop and livestock extension programs, and rubber planting.
Project performance during this period was satisfactory. Although disbursement levels were
improved, they were still considerably lower than expected. The project required an extension of
the Credit's Closing Date by two years to achieve its PDO completely.

(c) From 2005 to 2006: An increase in rubber prices in the international markets attracted
farmers and local authorities to participate. Project implementation was at full speed.
Disbursements increased rapidly toward the end of the project. Disbursement of the IDA Credit
reached 108 percent of the original budget (in US$ terms) and 96 percent in SDR terms.




                                                 9

Component 1: Smallholder Rubber Development

2.2.3 Sub-component 1(a): Establishment of New Rubber Smallholdings: the
implementation of the sub-component achieved the revised target for planting despite initial
delays. The outcome of the sub-component is considered to have been satisfactory3. At project
completion, a total area of 30,395 ha of new rubber had been planted under the project and the
quality of the plantings was evaluated as 64 percent "good" or "very good", 34 percent "medium"
and only 2 percent "poor" quality. The high quality of the planting established under the project
was an important outcome, and made it substantially different from the government's other
programs of support for rubber. About 19,788 households received long-term credit from
VBARD, a total of VND286 billion (US$17.8 million equivalent). More detail on the
implementation of the sub-component is presented in Annex 2.

2.2.4      Factors affecting the implementation of the sub-component were as follows:

(a) Rubber prices. The fluctuations of rubber prices in the international markets directly affected
farmers' levels of interest and the pace of implementation of the sub-component. In the first three
years (1998-2001) when the prices declined sharply from over US$1,200 per ton of dry latex to
around US$550 per ton, many farmers actually cut down their rubber trees in order to plant other
crops. By contrast, in the last two years (2005-2006) when the prices increased to around
US$2,200 per ton, 14,000 ha were planted, equivalent to the whole area planted from 1999 to
2004.

(b) Slow issuance of LURCs. One of the key conditions for establishing new rubber
smallholdings was the issuance of LURCs to farmers before rubber planting. This was to ensure
that farmers would have access to the long-term credit necessary to purchase inputs and finance
maintenance. However, throughout the project life the issuance of LURCs was slower than
planned and often was completed only after the planting season. This slowness affected the
disbursement of the long-term credit of VBARD.

(c) Fluctuations in supply and demand of planting materials. Farmers purchased planting
materials from the nurseries certified by the RRIV. Since the demand for planting materials
varied greatly from one year to the next (affected by rubber prices in the market), the production
of planting materials in the project regions was insufficient in some years and excessive in others.



3The project's objective broadly defined ("... as encompassed by the stated PDO and the key associated outcome
targets ...") was formally revised twice through amendments to the DCA, described in paragraph 1.3.1, that affected
the target area for this sub-component. The outcome of this sub-component has been assessed against the original and
revised target areas.

These fluctuations in supply and demand of planting materials caused difficulty for the project
both in planning and in achieving the annual planned targets for rubber planting.

(d) Coordination between PPMUs and VBARD's branches. While the PCU and PPMUs were
responsible for providing farmers with guidance on technical matters, VBARD and its branches
made the final decision on lending using their own policy and procedures. Close coordination
between the PCU/PPMUs and VBARD was needed. While coordination was generally good at
the headquarters level, it was weaker at the provincial and district levels, not only for the long-
term credit for rubber but also for the short- and medium-term credit for other crops and livestock.
As a result of weak coordination, disbursement of credit was often late and did not match with
production cycles.

2.2.4 Sub-component 1(b): Rehabilitation of Existing Rubber Smallholdings was
successfully completed. The outcome of the sub-component is considered to have been
moderately satisfactory. A total of 10,645 ha of poor quality rubber planted under the national
327 Program (the so-called "Greening Barren Hills Program" that provided funds for the
establishment of rubber plantations during their first three years only) were rehabilitated under
this project (as a result of its generally poor quality, these rubber plantings had been left
abandoned). About 7,437 households received long-term credit from VBARD for rehabilitating
their rubber plantations. By the time of project closing, all of the rehabilitated rubber was being
tapped, giving an average yield of 1.1 tons/ha/year and generating a significant source of long-
term income to farmers, which allowed them to pay back VBARD on schedule. Factors affecting
implementation of the sub-component were as follows:

(a) Variations in quality of existing rubber plantings. At appraisal, it was estimated that 17,600
ha would be rehabilitated. Because of the great variations in the quality of existing rubber, only
10,600 ha were appraised by VBARD to be economically viable and therefore included in the
project. Variations in the quality of existing rubber plantings also required a considerable amount
of time for VBARD to appraise, resulting in slow disbursement of funds in the first two years.

(b) Transfer from the government's Program to the project. Most of existing rubber areas that
were planted under the national 327 Program had already received credit from the government
and their LURCs were physically in the possession of provincial Treasuries. In order to have
access to credit from VBARD under the project, much paperwork had to be completed by the
provincial Treasuries and VBARD to transfer the LURCs to VBARD. This required time and
caused slow disbursement in the first two years.

2.2.5 Sub-component 1(c): Rubber Extension was one of the most successful sub-components
of the project. The project organized and delivered about 477 training courses on rubber planting
techniques and 118 training course on rubber tapping to more than 30,000 participating farmers.
The project also supported the training of extension staff at provincial level, the recruitment and
training of district extension workers, and the selection and training of farmer leaders in
participating villages. Factors affecting implementation of the sub-component were as follows:

(a) Using the existing extension system. The project used the existing networks of GRC, SRCs
and RRIV which were strong and readily available. These government institutions had been
strengthened in the previous IDA-financed Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2516-VN).
The sub-component was well designed to have adequate rubber extension staff from the central to
commune level.




                                                 11

2.2.6 Sub-component 1(d): Smallholder Rubber Research was implemented satisfactorily by
the RRIV which, in turn, provided technical inputs and recommendations to the extension
program, especially concerning the choice of clones and the technical packages for planting.
Factors affecting implementation of the sub-component were as follows:

(a) Using the existing research system. Similar to rubber extension, the research sub-component
was implemented by the RRIV which had been strengthened by government programs and the
previous IDA-financed Agricultural Rehabilitation Project.

(b) Technical Assistance from CIRAD. Two international research specialists seconded by
CIRAD, including a senior rubber research specialist and senior farming systems specialist,
assisted the project in developing and coordinating research programs. The specialists were
located at the RRIV and had good cooperation from the RRIV.

2.2.7 Sub-component 1(e): Upgrading of Farm Access Tracks was aimed at facilitating
transport of farm inputs and extension activities in project rubber villages. In accordance with the
reduction of the target of the new rubber smallholdings from 60,000 ha to 30,000 ha, the target
for farm tracks was reduced by half (from about 400 km at appraisal to 200 km). At the project's
closing, about 190 km of farm tracks had been constructed. Implementation of this sub-
component was marginally satisfactory, and factors affecting it were as follows:

(a) Procurement capacity at provincial level. The key constraint to implementation of this sub-
component was the weak procurement capacity at the provincial level. While the task was
delegated to PPMUs, little training on the Bank's procurement procedures was organized for the
PPMUs.

(b) Guidance from PCU. There was inadequate guidance from the PCU to PPMUs in
implementing this sub-component. There was also misunderstanding among PCU and PPMU
staff about the eligibility criteria of farm tracks. While only small tracks located inside newly
established plantations, 2-3 m wide and constructed with local materials using manual labor were
eligible for project financing, many PPMUs proposed ineligible roads that connected plantations
to village or commune roads.

Component 2: Land Allocation

2.2.8 The component was implemented initially only in villages planting or rehabilitating
rubber; it was expanded to all project communes after 2003 with the aim of providing
smallholders with security of land tenure by issuing LURCs using a participatory approach.
The project also assisted in strengthening the capacity of the land administration offices by
providing them with equipment and training. By the end of the project, the project had measured
241,619 ha of agricultural land and issued LURCs to 256,088 households, of which 21,726
households were ethnic minorities, for about 169,347 ha in 1,700 villages. Despite these
impressive numbers, implementation of this component was rated to be marginally satisfactory
because of the slowness in issuing LURCs to newly-established rubber areas. Factors affecting
implementation of the component were as follows:

(a) Land conflicts. Although in most cases the issuance of LURCs served to legalize de facto
ownership and provided long-term secure rights for land traditionally or socially already
belonging to the individual farmers, land conflicts (between users and with the State Forestry




                                                  12

Enterprises) were complicated and needed a long time to resolve. This was the main reason for
the slowness of land allocation.

(c) Over-loaded capacity of Land Administration Offices. According to government regulation,
land measurement and the issuance of LURCs can only be done by the government's Land
Administration Offices at provincial and district levels. The weak and overloaded capacity of
these organizations appeared to be one of the key constraints. In addition, weak coordination
among concerned agencies (e.g., land institutions, local governments and PPMUs) also affected
the pace of implementation.

Component 3: Agriculture Intensification and Diversification

2.2.9 Sub-component 3(a): Crop and Livestock Extension was assessed to be successful and
has received high appreciation from beneficiaries, especially for livestock extension. Activities
included the dissemination of information, the establishment of livestock and crop demonstrations
using local materials, and the training of farmers. The sub-component also strengthened the
capacity of district and provincial extension workers in the project areas, provided training
equipment and materials for extension activities and international technical assistance.

2.2.10 The project provided training for 1,236 district extension staff and 17,878 farmers for
crop extension. Farmers started applying the introduced farming techniques to upland rice,
hybrid rice, hybrid maize, groundnuts, soybeans, inter-cropping (with rubber) and other crops on
an area of over 60,000 ha. For livestock extension, the project trained 70,575 farmers in cattle
fattening and 67,680 farmers in pig fattening techniques, and over 90 percent of the trained
farmers adopted the new techniques. Factors affecting implementation of the sub-component
were as follows:

(a) Demonstration models. The approach combining training with demonstrations appeared
more effective and receptive to local communities. Farmers appeared satisfied with the new crop
and livestock techniques because of higher yields and returns and reduced labor requirements
relative to traditional methods.

(b) Late start of crop extension. Guidelines and arrangements for implementation of crop
extension were not developed in detail at project design. At first, crop extension was just
concentrated in villages planting or rehabilitating rubber and was then expanded to all project
communes because of high demand. Crop extension only started in project year 3 (2003) with the
late arrival of the international crop specialist (seconded by the French Embassy).

(c) Reviewing and approval of extension contracts. The rigid use of cost norms by the Provincial
People's Committees in reviewing and approving extension contracts often caused delays, while
establishment of demonstration models for crops were highly seasonal.

2.2.11 Sub-component 3(b): Credit for Annual and Perennial Crop and Livestock
Development was provided through VBARD to assist smallholders in applying new farming
techniques to diversify and increase their income. In total, 147,000 short- and medium-term
loans were provided for crops amounting to VND884.8 billion (equivalent to US$55 million
including recycled funds) and 142,349 loans for livestock amounting to VND1,122 billion
(equivalent to US$70 million including recycled funds). Factors affecting implementation of the
sub-component were as follows:




                                                  13

(a) High demand for credit. There was a huge demand for rural credit while VBARD was the
only commercial bank working in rural areas. It was estimated that VBARD could only respond
to around 80 percent of potential demand.

(b) VBARD's capacity and networks. There were limited human resources and facilities at
VBARD's district branches (i.e., a few credit officers at District level), posing a real challenge for
them to appraise loan applications in a timely manner and respond effectively to the demand.

(c) Linkages between credit and extension. The cooperation and coordination between
VBARD's provincial and district branches and PPMUs were generally weak. As a result,
disbursement of the credit schemes was often late.

2.2.12 Sub-component 3(c): Pilot Fruit Tree Development was implemented satisfactorily by
RIFAV on a "pilot scale" in the country's northern region. Fourteen fruit tree models at seven
pilot sites in six northern provinces were established in the first year. All of these have been well
maintained and have produced good results. From each pilot model, RIFAV chose two or three
varieties which are most suitable to local conditions and markets and prepared recommended
technical packages. One factor affecting implementation of the sub-component was weak
procurement capacity. As all procurement activities under this sub-component were delegated to
RIFAV, the weak procurement capacity of RIFAV, especially in National Competitive Bidding
procedures, caused significant delays in procurement implementation.

Component 4: Institutional Development

2.2.13 Sub-component 4(a): Support for Ethnic Minority Participation was aimed at
enhancing the participation of ethnic minorities in the project. By the project's closing, 29
communal houses had been constructed and put into use. Other completed activities included the
training of trainers at provincial level; training for ethnic minority officers and women of ethnic
minority groups; training for ethnic minority farmers; establishment of ethnic minority
smallholder rubber teams; dissemination of project information in ethnic minorities' languages;
and study tours for ethnic farmers.

2.2.14 Ethnic minority participation was positive in all of the project's components. Under the
Land Allocation component, 21,725 ethnic minority households participated in the process and
received LURCs; under the Agricultural Intensification and Diversification component over
6,000 ethnic minority households participated in crop demonstration and training, and under the
Smallholder Rubber Development component about 7,183 ethnic minority households were
involved in establishing smallholder rubber plantations. Factors affecting implementation of the
sub-component were as follows:

(a) Late arrival of Technical Assistance. The selection of the international specialist was delayed.
The consultant was employed in 2002 and the activities began in 2003.

(b) Approval process. Since most activities were culturally sensitive, it took a long time to get
the approval of the Provincial Peoples' Committees. In addition, the staff in charge of this sub-
component was weak.

2.2.15 Sub-component 4(b): Human Resource Development was implemented by the PCU in
coordination with MARD's Department of Personnel. The international specialist conducted a
"training needs assessment" for the agricultural sector which was then used as the basis for the
preparation of the integrated training plan for the project. Implementation of this sub-component


                                                 14

was marginally satisfactory because it was not linked well with other components. One factor
affecting the implementation of the sub-component was coordination with other components.
The sub-component was implemented and completed early (year 3) and, consequently, the
coordination and linkages between it and other components were not as strong as envisaged.

2.2.16 Sub-component 4(c): Project Management was satisfactory, with significant
improvement being achieved over time. Procurement and financial management, including audits,
were satisfactory at both the central and the provincial levels. Factors affecting effective project
management were as follows:

(a) A lack of decentralization in the government's project management structure and procedures:
The lengthy review and approval procedures of MARD, especially in the first six years, resulted
in significant delays in handling and reviewing procurement activities at the central level and in
implementing field activities at local levels.

(b) The government's low pay scales. During project implementation, the staff turnover rate was
high mainly because of the government's low pay scales. Retaining high-quality staff was always
difficult and challenging for project management.

(c) The use of MOF and MARD cost norms not based on prevailing market prices in developing
work plans, budget plans and procurement plans at both the central and provincial levels caused
delays in all steps of project implementation. This was especially true in the first six years of
implementation. The problems were partially resolved when the decentralization of approval
power was made to provinces.

(d) Coordination with VBARD. Effective coordination between the PCU/PPMUs and VBARD
was a key challenge. It appeared more difficult at local levels. As a result, there were
inconsistencies in data provided by the PCU/PPMUs and by VBARD.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Design. The monitoring indicators were clearly presented in the log-frame of the PAD.
The project allocated adequate funds at the start of implementation for an international expert to
develop and make operational an M&E system to be operated by the PCU and the PPMUs.
However, as mentioned in the paragraph 2.1.4, the KPIs mostly focused on the outputs (e.g., the
areas of rubber planted and rehabilitated, and the numbers of cattle and pigs) rather than on the
outcomes (e.g., agricultural productivity and farmers' incomes).

2.3.2 Implementation. This was one of the weakest parts of project implementation. Selection
of consultants to develop an M&E system was unexpectedly delayed for various reasons. To
monitor the field progress, the PCU used a simple system to collect data and information through
their technical staff and the PPMUs on a regularly basis. The data provided by the PPMUs were
relatively reliable, although often late. Data collected through technical staff in charge of the
respective components were then consolidated to prepare progress reports. The project reports
prepared by the PCUs served as a good basis for supervision by the government and IDA. The
monitoring became steadily better and more efficient as the project progressed especially on
monitoring rubber area and quality, and livestock and crop demonstration models.

2.3.3 To put together a comprehensive M&E system, about six months before the project closed
the PCU hired a team of national consultants to consolidate separate monitoring systems managed



                                                15

by technical staff. The new system had three layers: (a) PCU system formats; (b) PPMU system
formats; and (c) an assessment system. Much of the data was similar to what had been collected
before but it was made to be more routine, systematic and computerized.

2.3.4 Utilization. The M&E system mainly focused on the monitoring of physical progress and
inputs rather than evaluation or impact assessment. It did not have a project management activity
(e.g., a management information system - MIS) to look at monthly activities of the work plan and
to flag activities that had (or had not) taken place in order for management to take corrective
action.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Project implementation was in full compliance with the Bank's safeguards and fiduciary
requirements. Close supervision and monitoring by the government and the IDA were
maintained throughout the project.

(a) Environmental. The PCU and PPMUs closely monitored site selection for rubber
development using the project's environmental criteria and technical guidelines which were
developed to avoid negative and enhance positive environmental impacts. Greening the barren
hills with rubber trees was assessed to yield environmental benefits (e.g., erosion control, soil
fertility restoration and carbon sequestration). The livestock techniques (e.g., the use of home-
made feeds from local ingredients) introduced reduced livestock grazing and reduced fuel-wood
consumption requirements for livestock feed preparation. The land allocation component
improved the stewardship of land and decreased slash-and-burn (swidden) agriculture practiced
by some of the ethnic minority communities. In addition, extension activities were well
developed and monitored to ensure minimal environmental impact caused by agricultural
activities. The Bank's supervision missions closely examined the environmental issues during
project implementation and no major issues were found.

(b) Social safeguards: No resettlement of households took place during project implementation.
The project was in full compliance with the EMDP (see Section 3.5(a)).

(c) Fiduciary safeguards: Procurement and financial management (including auditing) was
satisfactory during the implementation period although delay in the provision of the counterpart
funds was an issue at the beginning of project implementation.

(d) Anti-collusion efforts: One case of collusion in bidding was found during project
implementation. It was investigated by the Hue PPMU and corrective measures were taken
against the colluding bidders. As a result, three bidders were banned from participating in all
procurement under the project. The names of those bidders were also published in national
and/or provincial newspapers and other public media (such as local television channels and in
public places).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 In March 2003, the government sent an official request to IDA and AFD for a follow-on
project. In May 2004, a joint IDA/AFD identification mission was carried out to discuss with the
government the objectives, scope and preparation arrangements of the new project: the proposed
Second Agricultural Diversification Project (ADP2). It was anticipated that the ADP2 would be
implemented in the same region as the project and would build upon the results achieved, though



                                                 16

with a shift in focus to market development and competitiveness, recognizing the increasing
imperative for the agricultural sector to become market-oriented and the need to link smallholder
farmers into value chains. The design of the new project is still under discussion, but where
appropriate successful activities in the project would be maintained under ADP2. The
preparation of the ADP2 was slower than planned because of: (a) the request of the Ministry of
Planning and Investment to have a formal assessment of the project to learn lessons; (b) the
complicated funding arrangement (i.e., AFD financed technical assistance for the preparation of
three project components and the Japan Policy and Human Resources Development Grant
financed the preparation of one project component plus other required documents). It is expected
that the agreement on the overall design principles for ADP2 will be achieved in June 2007 and
that implementation will begin in 2008.

2.5.2 At present, the PCU and PPMUs of the project are managing the preparation activities of
the ADP2. This provides a natural continuity with the ADP2 implementation. The government
has decided to allocate counterpart funds to maintain the project structure for about one year after
the project closes in order to complete its internal inspections and to prepare ADP2. The current
key staff of the PCU/PPMUs would be retained for ADP2. It is clear that capacity building under
the project directly assisted the government at different levels in creating institutional capacity to
manage future projects.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The objectives of the project remained valid throughout the project cycle and are in line
with the current Five-Year Plan of MARD from 2006-2010. The project's objectives were also
consistent with the government's National Strategy for Socio-Economic Development for 2001-
2010 and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, and remain highly relevant
today. The project has helped to develop market-oriented agriculture, contributed to competitive
and diversified production, increased rural incomes and contributed to the reduction in rural
poverty. In addition, the project has also protected natural resources and the environment through
confined livestock rearing and greening of bare and poor fertility lands by planting rubber trees.
It has also contributed to poverty reduction for poor households, women and ethnic minorities.

3.1.2 The project, however, did not specifically focus on value-added activities (e.g., small
rubber processing industry, or livestock or crop processing industry), market-oriented aspects
(such as improvement in market chain infrastructure and marketing information), market
competitiveness or reform (especially in the rubber sector). These aspects are of importance and
should be included in any future projects to sustain and deepen the impact of the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

3.2.1 The project achieved its overall goal of assisting the government to diversify and intensify
agricultural production and thereby increase and stabilize farmers' incomes and rural employment
through establishing a smallholder rubber sector and upgrading livestock production and crop
intensification activities in the poor central highland and coastal provinces of Vietnam. The
detailed outputs of each component are described in Annex 2. The principal achievements
include:




                                                 17

(a) the establishment of a private smallholder rubber sector to diversify agricultural production in
the central highland and coastal provinces of Vietnam (the outputs of Component 1);

(b) the improvement of long-term land tenure for local villagers through land allocation and
issuance of LURCs (the outputs of Component 2);

(c) the improvement of profitability of livestock and crop production and the diversification of
income sources in the project area (the outputs of Component 3);

(d) the assessment of the potential of developing fruit trees in the northern region (the outputs of
Component 3);

(e) the improvement of the livelihood of ethnic minorities in central highland and coastal project
provinces (the outputs of all components); and

(f) the improvement of the human resources management capacity in the agriculture sector and in
MARD (the outputs of Component 4).

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 Quantifiable. The results of the economic analysis4 carried out in January 2007 show an
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the overall project of 22.5 percent compared to the ERR of
13.4 percent calculated at appraisal. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the ERR estimates are
very robust. The ERR estimates remain above 10 percent when the analysis is subjected to large
decreases in rubber, crop, cattle and pig prices and large increases in labor and other input costs.

3.3.2 The smallholder rubber plantations under the project are anticipated to be highly profitable.
The financial rates of return (FRR) from the one-hectare crop models were 15.4 percent for
rubber establishment and 17.1 percent for rubber rehabilitation. Rubber prices are forecast to
remain at current prices (in real terms) or to marginally increase over the next 15 years.

3.3.3 Crop extension activities concentrated on techniques that increased the yields of four main
crops: (a) upland rice (85 percent yield increase); (b) hybrid rice (38 percent); (c) hybrid maize
(42 percent); and (d) groundnuts (68 percent). This had the effect of increasing the net
benefits/ha for each crop by 80 percent, 151 percent, 117 percent, and 221 percent, respectively.
The marginal rate of return in each case was estimated at 107 percent, 195 percent, 316 percent
and 123 percent, respectively.

3.3.4 Livestock extension activities concentrated on cattle fattening and pig intensification
techniques. In addition to increasing the net benefits by 128 percent for cattle fattening and 100
percent for pig intensification two-animal units, the techniques decreased the labor requirement
by 22.5 person-days and 45 person-days, respectively. Labor productivity increased to
VND69,000/day for cattle fattening and VND33,000/day for pig intensification in contrast to the
average daily wage of VND25,000/day.

3.3.5 Unquantifiable benefits. There were many important unquantifiable benefits generated
by the project. These included: (a) secure land tenure (through the provision of LURCs) that
allow beneficiaries to obtain long-term credit, make long-term investments and improve their
stewardship of the land; (b) the knowledge gained through the training of government staff,
especially at the local level, and the training of farmers (both men and women) that will be
retained and used in future endeavors; (c) the spill-over effect from project-supported research
that will be used by other development projects and by the government extension service for the
benefit of all farmers; (d) the improved institutional capacity for managing development projects,
for future land allocation campaigns, and for providing short- and long-term credit to farm
households; (e) initiating the use of private sector involvement in development projects; and (f)
the social benefits derived from the creation of new employment- and income-generating
opportunities for beneficiaries which decrease the migratory pressure on people towards large
towns and cities.

3.3.6 The project also provided some environmental benefits. The 30,395 ha of rubber
establishment made a significant impact on erosion control and soil fertility restoration and has
contributed to the "greening" of the landscape. Rubber establishment and rehabilitation also
contributed to a higher level of carbon sequestration. The crop extension techniques included
advice on the proper level and use of fertilizers and pesticides. The livestock techniques have
reduced both over-grazing and the fuel-wood requirements for feed preparation. The Land
Allocation component improved the stewardship of land and decreased the extent of slash-and-
burn (swidden) agriculture practiced by some of the ethnic minority communities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 The objective of the project was (and remains) relevant to the country's priorities and the
Bank's CASs, and was fully achieved. Relatively high levels of efficiency and ERRs have been
achieved from the project's interventions. Most of the target values and outputs for the PDO
indicators and Intermediate Outcome Indicators were reached. However, one weakness of the
project design was that the KPIs mostly focused on the outputs (e.g., the areas of rubber planting
and the numbers of cattle and pigs) rather than on the outcomes (e.g., the resulting increases in
farmers' incomes). In addition, the baseline study was carried out very late (in 2004). Overall,
the outcome is considered to be satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty Impact. A household profile analysis indicates that, under the project, the net
income from the addition of one hectare of rubber to the existing farm resources of a government-
defined "poor" household is sufficient to increase the "with-project" net income above the
poverty line for most rubber farmers. Similarly, the net income from adding the "with-project"
crop techniques or cattle or pig fattening techniques to existing farm practices of a government-
defined poor household is sufficient to increase the "with-project" net income for most target
households above the poverty line. According to the data of the components' outputs, more than
145,000 households in the central regions have directly benefited from the project, either by
participating in rubber development or by adopting the crop and livestock techniques.




                                                 19

3.5.2 In addition to the direct impact on household income, the project also provided secure
LURCs for more than 240,000 households in the central regions for future agricultural
development. Employment directly generated from the project was equivalent to 25,300 full-time
jobs. Since most labor is either provided by the family or locally hired, this is a significant boost
to employment in the local economies. In addition, there is employment created from cutting the
rubber stands for wood at the end of the plantation life. The increased wood production also has
the follow-on effect of creating materials for wood processing and thus the creation of skilled
wood-worker employment. In short, the project has directly addressed poverty in the poor central
regions.

3.5.3 Ethnic minority development. There are high populations of ethnic minorities in the
project area. The project targeted ethnic minorities through the implementation of the EMDP in
the ethnic minority communes. Specially designed activities for ethnic minorities were
implemented in 306 ethnic minority villages of 74 communes (out of 156 project communes) in
25 districts (out of 48 project district) of seven provinces (out of 11 project provinces).

3.5.4 As a result of the implementation of the EMDP, the project impact on poverty reduction
for participating ethnic households was significant. For instance, about 21,725 ethnic minority
households participated in the process of land allocation and received LURCs. Under the
Agriculture Intensification and Diversification component, over 6,000 ethnic minority households
participated in crop demonstration and training; and under the Smallholder Rubber Development
component about 7,183 ethnic minority households were involved in establishing smallholder
rubber plantations.

3.5.5 In addition, the project had a significant impact on strengthening the government's
capacity to work with ethnic minority groups. Government staff were trained in using
Participatory Rural Appraisal, indigenous knowledge and ethnic minority social mobilization
methods. Ethnic minorities were trained for planning and making decisions affecting their
households and communities. The project also raised awareness among ethnic minorities of
opportunities for integration into existing commercial and social structures.

3.5.6 Gender aspects. The participation of women under this project was relatively high. For
example, women's participation in training on crop extension techniques accounted for nearly 40
percent of the project total, around 50 percent in cattle and pig production training, and 5 percent
in rubber plantation training. The overall percentage of women who were the principal borrowers
of VBARD sub-loans was also relatively high. Around 40 percent of the crop loans and 55
percent of the livestock loans were made in the names of women. However, the training of
women and the proportion of loans made to women varied widely by province. In most instances,
there were insufficient numbers of women trained as trainers in crop, livestock and rubber
extension.

3.5.7 Women tended to participate more in the cattle fattening and pig intensification programs,
and took the lead in both the management of the operations and supplying the labor inputs. Of
particular importance for women was the labor-saving nature of the cattle fattening and pig
intensification techniques. The financial return to their labor inputs was substantially increased
and women spent considerably less time preparing feed for the animals. This freed-up time for
women to occupy themselves with other commitments or increase their incomes by raising more
cattle or pigs. There were also labor-saving crop techniques for upland rice and groundnuts.

3.5.8 The project improved access to information for women. Women have taken part in
obtaining credit in their own name and can use this experience to borrow funds in the future for


                                                 20

other ventures. The record keeping and other management skills learned by women can also be
used in other household enterprises. The project also trained many women extension officers
which should help to create opportunities for these women within MARD and possibly with the
private sector. The fact that women now also have their names on the LURCs should give them
an equal say over the use of their land and the decision on how it should be used for collateral.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.9 A significant institutional change brought about by the project was the establishment of
contractual arrangements with the private sector for planting materials. This has served the
project well, and the government should be encouraged to continue to use this form of
institutional arrangement.

3.5.10 A further institutional change was that it was the first time that VBARD or any
agricultural lending agency in Vietnam offered long-term credit to farmers. This is an important
step in offering farmers more financial services and an experience that can be built upon in the
future. Institutional capacity has been strengthened through the provision of training and
equipment to MARD, the Departments of Agriculture and Rural Development, VBARD, RRIV
and the Departments of Natural Resources and the Environment. As a result, the technical
capabilities of the rubber sector, land administration and agriculture extension have been
strengthened significantly. The management capacity of the PCU and PPMUs has also been
strengthened. With the increased capacity of the PCU, MARD allowed it to take on additional
responsibilities including: (a) the preparation and implementation of the Bank-financed Avian
Influenza Emergency and Recovery Project; (b) the preparation of the ADP2: and (c) the
preparation and implementation of the Vietnam Avian and Human Influenza control and
preparedness project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.11 Investment in small-scale rubber processing units by private investors increased when the
area planted with rubber increased. Although the project did not directly support the
establishment of rubber processing, an unintended impact of the project may be an increase in the
use of groundwater for production of rubber processing units.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 There was no beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop carried out under the project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

4.1.1 An important risk is a possible decrease in rubber prices; however, the projections
of medium- and long-term rubber prices indicate that present prices, in real terms, will
remain constant or increase marginally. A second risk is that, with the end of the project,
many farmers may not be able to obtain the necessary credit or technical information on
tapping and management of rubber, and this may result in a decrease in productivity. In
this respect, the government has made a firm commitment to maintain the rubber area
planted under the project either through the forthcoming overseas development
assistance-supported projects or through the use of the government's own funds.


                                                21

Currently, VBARD is using the funds recycled from the short- and medium-term credit
(around US$7 million) to lend to farmers for rubber maintenance. The financing and
debt servicing analysis indicates that farmers who have borrowed loans under the project
can service their debts while maintaining good cash flows and income generation.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 The quality at entry of the project is considered to have been moderately satisfactory,
based on the following: (a) project appraisal was carried out by Bank missions with full diligence
and the identified project interventions were of priority to the country and to the CAS; and (b) all
required documents such as the project implementation plan, resettlement framework and the
EMDP were thoroughly prepared by the government, reviewed by the Bank and ready at
negotiations. However, project design would have been significantly enhanced with a better
balance in design between rubber, crops and livestock for more effective diversification and
inclusion of measures to allow the project to respond quickly and effectively to market changes.
These shortcomings, however, are minor.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.2 The "satisfactory" ratings for the Development Objective and Implementation Progress
included in the first six Implementation Status and Results Reports covering the period from late-
1998 to mid-2000, when very little was happening in project implementation, indicate that
supervision was less rigorous than necessary and that management was somewhat slow in
demanding corrective action. The Implementation Progress rating was down-graded to
"unsatisfactory" in late-2000 and only up-graded again to "satisfactory" in late-2001 after the
Mid-Term Review (March 2001) and its Action Plan.

5.1.3 In 2004, the QAG carried out an assessment of quality of supervision and rated the Bank's
supervision of the project as "satisfactory" overall. In two of the four dimensions (the
"Supervision of Fiduciary/Safeguard Aspects and Candor" and the "Quality of Project
Performance Ratings") the project was considered to be "satisfactory" and in the other two
dimensions (the "Focus on Development Effectiveness" and the "Adequacy of Supervision Inputs
and Processes") it was considered to be "highly satisfactory". However, with the delay in the
establishment of the M&E system and the focus primarily on outputs rather than on outcomes, the
overall quality of Bank supervision is considered by the ICR team to have been moderately
satisfactory (in the sense that it was marginally less than satisfactory).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                                22

5.1.4 Based on the Quality at Entry of the project and the Bank's role in ensuring it, and on the
proactive nature of supervision, the overall Bank performance is considered to have been
moderately satisfactory



5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 The government's performance in supporting project implementation in general is
considered to have been moderately satisfactory, particularly in taking measures to improve
implementation performance when the project was facing delays.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


Implementing Agencies:       The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
                             The Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development


Performance:                 The implementing agencies were good at following up on actions
                             recommended by IDA supervision missions. In general, there were
                             only moderate shortcomings in its performance.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.2 The Overall Borrower Performance is considered to have been moderately satisfactory,
based on its performance during both preparation and implementation, and with specific reference
to:

(a) Cooperation with the Bank team: the concerned ministries, central agencies and
implementing agencies cooperated closely with the Bank during project implementation and
supervision. Most of the actions agreed during supervision missions or recommended in audit
and procurement ex post review reports were followed up in a satisfactory manner or
implemented (although in some cases with significant delays).

(b) Improved management skill and capacity: after the initial slow start-up, the capacity of the
PCU and PPMUs was significantly improved. This was the main factor accelerating project
implementation and disbursement, especially in the second half of the project's life.


6. Lessons Learned

The major lessons learned from the project are:




                                              23

6.1 For future agriculture development projects:

6.1.1 Project line of credit. The project was designed in the mid-1990s when the financial sector
in Vietnam was underdeveloped. The economic climate has changed rapidly in the past few years
and, indicative of this progress, Vietnam has joined the World Trade Organization. In a new
competitive market, commercial banks are operating independently and the market "picks the
winners". In the present development context, the inclusion of a line of credit in agricultural
operations similar to that provided under the project becomes highly debatable. A recent review
by the Bank indicated that VBARD is managing nine lines of credit under Bank-financed projects
with different lending terms and conditions. This is not healthy for a commercial bank like
VBARD because it results in inconsistencies in its lending policy and operations.

6.1.2 Competitiveness enhancement. The project supported the production of higher-value
commodities to improve incomes for the rural poor. The project was prepared when the country
was not fully opened to global trade integration. For future support to products like rubber, the
scope should be expanded to include activities on market development, trade integration and
promotion. This would help enhance the competitiveness and obtain higher returns for farmers.

6.1.3 Linking agricultural development with the management of natural resources. In order to
achieve a sustainable impact on poverty reduction, agricultural development should be linked
strongly with the management of natural resources. Under the project, environmental screening
was carried out to protect existing natural forests and biodiversity areas. The project has
reclaimed thousands of hectares of unused and barren land in the hills in the central regions and
turned them into high-value rubber plantations. Sustainable land management was introduced
through agricultural extension aimed at introducing environmentally-friendly farming practices to
prevent soil erosion and to reduce slash-and-burn agriculture by the ethnic minorities.

6.1.4 Financial sector development. To improve VBARD's performance and consistency in its
lending policy, the Bank should pay closer attention to capacity building and possibly combining
lines of credit in a single operation (such as the Rural Finance II Project) under which these
performance issues could be addressed.

6.1.5 Monitoring and evaluation. The project provides one more example of an M&E system
failing to achieve the quality anticipated in design. The role of consultants in designing and
making the system operational should be more focused; they should (a) organize the routine
collection of data by project staff through operational processes; and (b) assist in the preparation
of a base-line study and in analyzing the impact of project interventions. There should be an
emphasis on "measuring the measurable" and in this respect the accurate definition of the PDOs
is of key importance. Objectives such as "increasing farmers' incomes" should not be set unless
the system and resources are in place accurately to measure such a variable and, more importantly,
to be able to address confidently the issue of attribution and correct for exogenous (non-project
induced) factors. Consideration should be given to setting PDOs at a "lower" but measurable
level such as (in this project) the rate of adoption of improved production technology.

6.2 For project management in general:

6.2.1 Number of provinces. The project covered a large number of provinces - eleven in the
central region and seven provinces in the north ­ and this made it difficult to manage project
implementation effectively. To ensure good supervision and project management, future projects
should limit the number of project provinces to a manageable size, preferably not more than eight
provinces per project.


                                                 24

6.2.2 Decentralization. There was little decentralization from MARD to project provinces in the
project. This was one of the main reasons for the delays in implementation and the slow rate of
disbursement of the Credit. As decentralization was introduced in the last two years, project
implementation accelerated.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.1 A summary of the Borrower's Completion Report is included in Annex 7. Overall, the
Borrower concluded that the project had achieved its objective in developing a private
smallholder rubber sector in the central highland and coastal provinces and in improving the
productivity of crops and livestock, thereby improving farmers' labor efficiency and income. It
considered that the project had created good conditions to improve the livelihood of ethnic
minorities in the central highlands. The Borrower agreed with the ICR's assessments of the
projects' achievements, and rated the performance of both the Borrower and the Bank as "good".

(b) Co-financiers

7.2.1 Based on the Impact Assessment Report prepared by the FAO - World Bank Cooperative
Program, the AFD rated this project as very successful in terms of physical outputs and financial
and economic performance. The project made a positive contribution to poverty reduction, social
development and environmental improvement.

7.2.2 The AFD also raised a concern that although VBARD had no difficulty in the
disbursement of the short-term and medium-term credit for the Agriculture Intensification and
Diversification component it had more difficulty in the disbursement of long-term credit for
rubber development. It further commented that unless VBARD is provided with long-term
financial resources dedicated to these specific investments, the private rubber smallholding sector
runs the risk of not being financed.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

7.3.1 There were no other partners or stakeholders in the project.

Component 1: Smallholder Rubber Development

2.1 The key outputs of this component were:

(a) New rubber smallholdings. At the end of 2006, 103 percent (30,877 ha) of the revised target
of 30,000 ha for rubber establishment had been met.

(b) Rubber rehabilitation. About 10,645 ha of existing rubber were rehabilitated. At appraisal, it
was estimated that 17,000 ha of rubber were available for rehabilitation. However, the amount of
actual rubber that was available for rehabilitation was closer to 11,000 ha. Thus the appraisal
target was over-estimated and it could be said that the rehabilitation target has been met.

(c) The average area of rubber establishment per household for the entire project was 1.5 ha. The
Northern Coastal region had the lowest average at 1.2 ha and the Southern Coastal region had the
highest average at 2.2 ha. The major influence on the area per household was land availability for
rubber plantations.

(d) Rubber extension. The project also set up an extension system consisting of an international
rubber specialist, GRC rubber specialist, provincial rubber specialists, district rubber extension
staff and key farmers. The extension system organized 477 rubber training courses (28,636
participants) for extension staff, VBARD staff, key farmers and project beneficiaries on the
techniques of planting and maintaining rubber trees. Also, 118 training courses were organized to
teach rubber tapping techniques for 3,649 participants.

(e) Farm tracks. Around 190 km of farm tracks were developed to comply with the key
performance indicator that 80 percent of the new rubber area should be accessible by motorcycle
for at least nine months of the year.

(f) Smallholder rubber research. The RRIV was instrumental in providing and inspecting
planting material for the project. The RRIV signed contracts for providing planting material to
many of the project provinces and for assistance in inspecting the quality of the rubber trees. The
RRIV also conducted close to 100 demonstrations on rubber extension and tapping, and continues
to undertake experiments on rubber clones. Through their experiments, the RRIV has made
recommendations on which varieties to use specific to the individual regions and provinces. The
RRIV also worked on rubber tapping techniques and smallholder rubber processing.

(g) Long-term credit for rubber. Up to December 31, 2006 some 19,788 households received
VBARD long-term credit amounting to a total of VND 286,000 billion (US$17.8 million) for
rubber establishment on 30,205 ha of land. In addition, 7,437 households received VBARD long-
term credit amounting to a total of VND 47,900 billion (US$3.0 million) for rubber rehabilitation
on 7,945 ha of land.

Component 2: Land Allocation

2.2 The key outputs of this component were:

(a) Land measurement and issuance of LURCs. By the Credit's closing date, around 241,619 ha
of agricultural land were measured and 169,374 ha (around 70 percent) of the land measured had
been issued with LURCs. In total, 256,088 households received LURCs among whom 21,725 are
ethnic minorities. At appraisal, it was estimated that around 300,000 ha in 300 villages would be
measured and issued with LURCs to villagers. One of the impediments to measuring the 300,000


                                                28

ha was the increased costs for land measurement because of the increase in government salaries
for state employees. As a result, during implementation the funds earmarked for land allocation
under the project were not adequate for the measurement and issuance of LURCs for the whole
300,000 ha intended at appraisal.

Component 3: Agriculture Intensification/Diversification

2.3 The key outputs of this component were:

(a) Crop Extension and Credit. The project trained 1,236 district extension staff (19 percent of
whom were women) and 17,878 farmers (39 percent women). Farmers started applying ADP
crop extension techniques in 2003. By 2006, over 60,000 ha had applied the cropping
technologies introduced by the project. In total, households applying the ADP crop techniques
obtained 147,369 short- or medium-term loans from VBARD for crop inputs totaling
VND884,798 billion (US$55 million) in loans.

(b) Livestock Extension and Credit. By the end of the project, 70,575 farmers had been trained
in cattle fattening techniques and 67,680 farmers in pig intensification techniques. Ninety-six
percent of the original target of 37,500 households applying cattle fattening and 112 percent of
the original target of 37,500 households applying pig intensification techniques was achieved by
the end of the project. In total, households applying the ADP techniques obtained 142,349 short-
or medium-term loans from VBARD for cattle fattening and pig intensification with the total
amount of the loans at VND1,122 billion (US$70 million).

(c) Fodder production demonstration trials (167 in total by project end) were introduced in 2005
and 2006. The idea was to have farmers grow their own high-quality green feed, cutting it as
required and bringing it to the cattle being fattened. This replaced the old practices of either
cutting grass from road sides or grazing cattle with its significant requirements of labor for
herding. Indications were that farmers like the fodder production approach as some 3,000 have
been said to adopt it through learning from the demonstrations.

(d) Fruit tree development was implemented by RIFAV on a "pilot scale" in the northern region.
Fourteen fruit tree models at seven pilot sites in six Northern provinces were established in the
first year. All of these have been well maintained and produced good results. From each pilot
model, RIFAV has chosen two to three varieties most suitable to local conditions and markets and
prepared the recommended technical packages.

Component 4: Institutional Strengthening

2.4 The key outputs of this component were:

(a) Support for Ethnic Minority Participation. By the Credit's closing date, 29 communal houses
had been constructed and put into use. Other completed activities include the training of trainers
at provincial level; training for ethnic minority officers and women of ethnic minority groups;
training for ethnic minority farmers; establishment of ethnic minority smallholder rubber teams;
dissemination of project information in ethnic minorities' languages; and study tours for ethnic
farmers.

(b) The EMDP was implemented in 306 villages of 74 communes in 25 districts of seven project
provinces. EMD training was carried out for ten provincial EMD staff, 22 district staff, and 750



                                                29

extension workers, key farmers, and village officials. Project commune working groups were
established and information campaigns about ADP were carried out. About 21,725 ethnic
minority households participated in the land allocation program and received LURCs. Under the
agricultural intensification and diversification program, over 6,000 ethnic minority households
participated in crop demonstration and training, and under the smallholder rubber development
component about 7,183 ethnic minority households were involved in establishing smallholder
rubber plantations.

(c) Human resource development and project management. A "training needs" assessment for
the agricultural sector was conducted and an integrated training plan for the project was prepared
and implemented. The capacity of the implementing agencies, especially in project management,
was enhanced with significant improvement being achieved over time. Procurement and
financial management, including audits, were satisfactory at both the central and provincial level.
Institutional capacity was strengthened through the provision of training and equipment to
MARD, VBARD, RRIV and DONRE. As a result, the technical capabilities of the rubber sector,
land administration and agriculture extension were strengthened significantly.

                                 ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS


3.1 This section was condensed from the report: "End of Project Impact Assessment Report"
carried out by FAO-World Bank Cooperative Programme dated January 31, 2007. Financial
analysis was carried out for rubber planting and rehabilitation, improved cropping and improved
livestock raising activities on the basis of partial budget models. These were incorporated into
farm household models to examine the impact on net incomes and debt service capability.
Economic analysis, including the calculation of an economic rate of return (ERR), was carried
out for those project outcomes that can be quantified. These include: (a) rubber establishment;
(b) rubber rehabilitation; (c) crop intensification and diversification; and (d) livestock
intensification/diversification. An ERR was also estimated for the project as a whole.
Unquantifiable project benefits are also discussed.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

3.2 The financial analysis was based on partial budget crop and animal production models for:
new rubber establishment, rehabilitation of existing rubber, upland rice, hybrid rice, hybrid
maize, groundnuts, cattle finishing and intensified pig-raising. The models are based on "with-
project" and "without-project" scenarios.

3.3 Rubber Production: The models of rubber production were tested through sensitivity
analysis to examine the robustness of the conclusions. The results were as follows:

3.4 The financial impact of establishing one ha of new rubber plantation on a typical upland
subsistence farm was examined. A family of five below the poverty line (of VND200,000 per
person per month), planting rubber and inter-cropping for six years before the commencement of
rubber tapping, would increase its net income by 25 percent during the gestation period but still
be below the poverty line. Net income would increase slowly from the commencement of
tapping in year 8, and by year 12 net income (after debt service) would increase by 42 percent,



                                                 31

sufficient to lift the family over the poverty line (by US$55). By year 15, net income would be
US$300 above the line and by year 21 it would be US$900 above the line.

3.5 Credit from VBARD was used to finance land preparation, inputs and planting materials,
with farmers providing the labor for establishment of rubber and its maintenance. The sub-loans
had an interest rate of 9.7 percent per year with a grace period for principal repayment of eight
years. Beneficiaries were obliged to repay their loans at a rate not exceeding 25 percent of the
net income from rubber production. Farmers borrowing the maximum amount (VND17.4
million per ha) could repay their loans in 13 years after the grace period. The interest rate of 9.7
percent per year was subsidized. The long-term commercial interest rate at appraisal was 14.4
percent, and at project close was 15.6 percent. The analysis shows that at 14.4 percent interest
farmers could not repay their loans in full using a maximum of 25 percent of net rubber income.
Relaxing that restriction (for example, to 45 percent) would allow a loan of the maximum size to
be repaid in 11 years. The analysis concluded, intuitively, that the lowest income households
were those most in need of borrowing the maximum amount per ha and thus those most likely to
be deterred from participating in the project if commercial interest rates had been applied.
VBARD credit was also used for the rehabilitation of rubber; farmers borrowing for this purpose
were able to service their debt more easily than those farmers establishing rubber, and
consequently their theoretical ability to service a debt at a commercial rate of interest was
greater.

3.6 Crop Diversification: partial budget models for the four main crops for which new
techniques were promulgated among farmers under the project indicated a clear increase in net
benefits and returns to labor for the "with-project" scenario:

3.7 The financial impact was examined of the introduction of improved crop production
techniques to a typical upland subsistence farm. The "without-project" farm household with 1.5
cultivated ha and selling two head of cattle per year had a total net income of VND10.6 million
per year (US$659), marginally below the poverty line of VND11.52 million for a family of four.
The adoption of the crop intensification techniques increased the household net income by 23
percent, lifting it above the poverty line to an income of VND13.04 million.

3.8 Livestock Intensification: partial budget models for two livestock activities were prepared.
The first involves purchased store cattle and the second purchased feeder pigs. In both cases, in
the "with-project" scenario the animals are finished to a higher weight in shorter time using
improved techniques promoted under the project, compared to the "without-project" scenario
and traditional methods. The result in both cases is a higher net income and return to labor, and
a shortened production cycle that enables the farmer to go through four cycles per year instead
of the previous two, in the case of cattle, and three cycles per year instead of the previous two,
in the case of pigs.

3.9 Gross revenue is increased in both models because animals are finished to a higher weight
but the main impact comes through the reduced labor requirement and the shortened production
cycle which result from the new techniques (especially nutrition).

3.10 The financial impact was examined of the introduction of: (a) improved cattle finishing to
a wage-earning family near an urban center; and (b) improved pig rearing to a subsistence
farming family. In both cases, total net income was raised by more than 25 percent and lifted
the family above the poverty line.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

3.11 Table 3.4 presents the project costs associated with the outcomes from: (a) rubber
establishment; (b) rubber rehabilitation; (c) crop intensification and diversification; and (d)
livestock intensification and diversification. It is based on project expenditures at January 15,
2007. Some assumptions were made to arrive at the cost allocations because the PCU
accounting system does not show detailed cost and disbursement breakdowns for all items. The
costs in Table 3.4 represent about 70 percent of total project costs.

Rubber Establishment and Rehabilitation

3.12 Total rubber establishment and extension costs are available by year. About 75 percent of
extension costs were disbursed for rubber establishment and 25 percent for rubber rehabilitation.
These percentages are based roughly on the proportions of areas established and rehabilitated.
Farm access roads were only built for rubber establishment areas. Smallholder rubber research
also assumes the 75/25 percent split.

3.13 It is difficult to attribute the land allocation costs because not all of them can be charged
against rubber component outcomes. Only about 10 percent of the allocated land is used for
rubber, although a farmer's entire land holding is measured and allocated a Red Book. There are



                                                     33

other quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits from holding a Red Book in addition to
participating in the rubber program. Half of the land allocation cost was charged against the
rubber component, using the 75/25 percent split between rubber establishment and rehabilitation.

3.14 Twenty-five percent of Human Resource Management and Project Management
disbursements are charged against the rubber component using the 75/25 percent split. The
Support for Ethnic Minorities sub-component helped the project initiate the rubber and other
programs in the ethnic communities. It is likely that the benefits would have been much less in
the ethnic project areas had the sub-component not been included in the project. One-third of the
ethnic minority component costs are charged against the rubber component, using the 75/25
percent split.

Livestock Intensification and Diversification

3.16 The livestock extension disbursements were accounted for by the PCU accounting
system but the accounting system did not allow for a cost/disbursement breakdown between
cattle fattening and pig intensification. Twenty-five percent of Human Resource Management
and Project Management disbursements and one-third of ethnic minority sub-component
expenditures are charged against livestock intensification and diversification.

PROJECT BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN

Rubber Establishment and Rehabilitation

3.17 The rubber establishment benefits are based on an economic one-hectare crop model; the
net cash flow from the model is multiplied by the yearly area of rubber establishment. The rubber
rehabilitation benefits are also based on an economic one-hectare crop model; the net cash flow
from the model is multiplied by the yearly area of rubber rehabilitation (i.e., 8,419 ha in 2000,
1,029 ha in 2001 and 1,197 ha in 2002). In both cases, it is assumed that tapping starts in year 8
after planting.

3.18 There is a distinction drawn between the financial and economic one-hectare crop models
and this concerns the wage rate. There are reported to be labor surpluses in many of the rubber
project areas, especially in the ethnic minority areas. A conversion factor of 0.8 has been used for
labor wage costs to reflect this.

3.19 The remaining economic model coefficients are the same as the financial model
coefficients, and input and product financial prices are assumed to reflect economic prices. The
rubber price used in the analysis is VND16.6 million/ton (US$1,030/ton).

3.20 The ERRs for rubber establishment and rubber rehabilitation are estimated at 15.4 percent
and 19.2 percent, respectively, giving a combined ERR of 16.3 percent for the entire rubber
program. The NPVs for rubber establishment and rubber rehabilitation are estimated at VND546
billion (US$33.9 million) and VND225 billion (US$14.0 million), respectively, giving a
combined NPV of VND771 billion (US$47.9 million) for the entire rubber program. Setting the
labor wage rate equal to the financial rate (i.e., using a conversion factor of 1.0) has the effect of
reducing the ERRS for establishment and rehabilitation to 14.1 and 16.2 percent, respectively.

3.21 The ERRs estimated at appraisal for rubber establishment and rubber rehabilitation were
13 percent and 17 percent, respectively. The main difference between the appraisal estimates
and the ex post estimates are differences in: (a) establishment and rehabilitation costs; (b) rubber
prices; (c) ADP project costs; and (d) the areas of established and rehabilitated rubber. The
rubber establishment and rehabilitation average yields used are 1.3 tons/ha (dry rubber basis) and
0.875 tons/ha, respectively, and these are similar to the projected yields used at appraisal. The
rubber price at appraisal was US$690/ton (in 1998 constant prices) and the price used in this
analysis is VND16.6 million/ton (US$1,030/ton) in 2006 constant prices. The project costs
differ substantially in that more cost categories are included in the present analysis than were
included at appraisal. The total area of established rubber projected at appraisal was 60,000 ha
whereas the actual outcome was 30,395 ha. Similarly, the total rehabilitated rubber area
projected at appraisal was 17,000 ha whereas the actual outcome was 10,645 ha.

Crop Intensification and Diversification

3.22 The crop intensification and diversification economic benefits are based on four economic
crop one-hectare models for upland rice, hybrid rice, hybrid maize and groundnuts. The
incremental net incomes used in the ERR analysis are set at 75 percent of the incremental net
incomes shown in the economic one-hectare crop models. This allows for field and post-harvest
crop losses over all farmers. The incremental net incomes from the four crops are multiplied by
the areas (in ha) applying the ADP crop extension techniques each year. The assumption is made
that 30 percent of the area applying ADP crop extension techniques in a given year will not apply
them in the next year (i.e., attrition). A further assumption is made that the crop extension survey
overstates the area that can be claimed by the ADP crop extension program by 20 percent because
the survey has picked up areas that may be using similar crop techniques resulting from other
projects and programs. Furthermore, it is assumed that there is a five percent per year attrition
rate from 2007 onward to reflect that some farmers will not be using ADP techniques. The
benefit stream is continued for 15 years after 2006 to the year 2021. By this time, farmers will
probably be using other techniques and information not related to the technology of the ADP

program. The assumptions reflect a conservative estimate of the crop net-benefits and, therefore,
a conservative ERR estimate.

3.23 The difference between the financial and economic one-hectare crop models is the wage
rate. For the same reasons as given for rubber, a conversion factor of 0.8 has been used for
unskilled labor and is charged VND20,000/day. The remaining economic crop model
coefficients are the same as the financial model coefficients. All input and product financial
prices are assumed to reflect economic prices.

3.24 The ERR and NPV for crop intensification and diversification are estimated to be 66
percent and VND87 billion (US$5.4 million), respectively. The high ERR is expected despite
the conservative estimate of the crop extension net benefits.

did not benefit from ADP.


Livestock Intensification/Diversification

3.25 The livestock intensification and diversification economic benefits are based on the cattle
fattening and pig intensification economic enterprise models. The incremental levels of net
income per head used in the ERR analysis are set at 75 percent of the incremental net incomes per
head presented in the models to allow for livestock mortality and processing losses. The
incremental net income per head is multiplied by an estimate of the number of cattle and pigs
being fattened each year using the livestock extension techniques. High and low estimates for the


                                                       38

number of animals fattened are included. Furthermore, it is assumed that there is a five percent
per year attrition rate from 2007 onward to reflect that some farmers will stop using ADP
techniques. The benefit stream is continued for 15 years after 2006 to the year 2021. By this
time, farmers will probably be using different techniques and information not related to the
project. These assumptions provide a more conservative estimate of the livestock net-benefits
and a more conservative ERR estimate.

3.26 The difference between the financial and economic livestock models is the wage rate.
For the same reasons as given for rubber and crops, a conversion factor of 0.8 has been used for
unskilled labor and is charged VND 20,000/day. The remaining economic and financial model
coefficients are the same, and financial prices are assumed to reflect economic prices.

3.27 The ERR is estimated at 126 percent and the NPV at VND366 billion (US$22.7 million)
when using the low estimate for the number of animals being fattened. The ERR is estimated
at 197 percent when using the high estimate. A high ERR is projected despite the conservative
estimate of the livestock extension net benefits. Setting the labor wage rate equal to the
financial rate (i.e., using a conversion factor of 1.0) has the effect of increasing the ERR to 129
percent and the NPV to VND380 billion (US$23.6 million) using the low estimate for the
number of animals raised; this counter-intuitive estimate occurs because the "with-project"
budgets require less labor than the "without-project" budgets.

Total Project ERR

3.28 When the overall net benefits and project costs for: (a) rubber establishment; (b)
rubber rehabilitation; (c) crop intensification/diversification; and (d) livestock intensification
and diversification (using the low estimate for livestock numbers fattened) are added
together, the total project ERR is estimated to be 22.5 percent with a NPV of VND1,223
billion (US$77.4 million). This is in contrast to an overall project ERR of 13.4 percent
estimated at appraisal, although it should be borne in mind that the appraisal analysis was
confined to the rubber development component..

SENSITIVITY AND SWITCHING VALUE ANALYSIS

Rubber Establishment and Rehabilitation

3.29 The two main risks to achieving the base rubber ERR estimates are the farm-gate rubber
price and the daily wage rate for tapping. Table 3.8 presents sensitivity and switching value
analyses of the rubber component outcomes. While a 20 percent decrease in the farm-gate rubber
price reduces the ERRs in all four categories, they remain robust. It requires a 35 to 40 percent
decrease in the rubber price (to between US$680 and US$630/tonne) to decrease the ERRs to
near or below the 10 percent discount rate level.

3.30 A 10 percent decrease in the rubber yield decreases the ERRs in each rubber category by
between 1.2 and 2.3 percentage points. A 20 percent decrease in the rubber yield will decrease
the ERRs in each rubber category by between 4 and 65 percentage points. Increasing the rubber
yield to levels suggested by the RRIV increases the new rubber ERR to 17.2 percent and the
rehabilitated rubber ERR to 22.3 percent. A doubling of the tapping daily wage rate will decrease
the ERR for rubber establishment (by 2.5 percentage points), rehabilitation (by 6.6 percentage
points) and total rubber (by 3.5 percentage points). However, under the above changes in yield
and tapping labor costs, the ERRs in each category remain robust.

3.31 The sensitivity analysis suggests that the rubber ERR estimates are highly robust. It would
require a drop in rubber prices by about 35 to 40 percent or more than a doubling of the economic
tapping wage rate before the ERR becomes less than 10 percent (and the NPV negative). If the
events occur simultaneously, it would require a drop in rubber prices by about 20 percent and a
doubling of the economic tapping wage rate before the ERR approaches 10 percent. Although the
economic wage rates are likely to increase, a doubling of wage rates is unlikely before the end of
the analysis period.

Crop Intensification and Diversification

3.32 The two main risks to achieving the base crop intensification and diversification ERR
estimates are a decrease in the farm-gate crop prices and an increase in the input costs for seed
and fertilizers. While labor rates are important, the ERR analysis is not very sensitive to changes
in them because: (a) the amount of labor used does not change in the "with-project" hybrid rice
and hybrid maize models and only changes marginally in the groundnut model; and (b) the "with-
project" upland rice labor requirement actually decreases (in addition, the area of upland rice is
very small).

3.33 Table 3.8 presents a sensitivity and switching-value analysis of the crop intensification and
diversification outcomes for changes in crop prices and inputs. The ERR remains very robust
even with a decrease in crop prices by 20 percent or a doubling of input costs. When combined, a
decrease in crop prices by 20 percent and a doubling of input costs decreases the ERR to around
27 percent.

Livestock Intensification and Diversification

3.34 The two main risks to achieving the base livestock intensification and diversification ERR
estimates are the farm-gate buying and selling prices of animals and the concentrate feed costs.
Table 3.9 presents a sensitivity and switching-value analysis of the livestock intensification and
diversification outcomes for changes in livestock prices and concentrate feed inputs. The ERR
remains very robust even with a decrease in animal buying and selling prices by 20 percent or an
increase in concentrate feed costs by 20 percent. When combined, a decrease in animal buying
and selling prices by 20 percent and an increase in concentrate feed costs by 20 percent
decreases the ERR to around 96 percent.

Total Project ERR

3.35 A 20 percent decrease in the rubber price changes the overall project ERR from 22.5 to
19.8 percent. A doubling of the wage rate for rubber tapping changes the overall project ERR
from 22.5 to 18.4 percent. A 20 percent decrease in crop prices or a doubling of fertilizer and
seed costs only decrease the overall project ERR by about 2-3 percentage points. Similarly, a
decrease in livestock buying and selling prices by 20 percent or an increase in concentrate feed
costs by 20 percent will decrease the overall project ERR by about 2-3 percent.

UNQUANTIFIABLE BENEFITS

3.36 In addition to the quantifiable benefits expressed by the economic rate of return, the project
has generated a number of important unquantifiable benefits.




                                               42

Land Allocation and Tenure

3.37 The project has secured land tenure for project farmers. Secure land tenure by possessing a
Red Book will allow farmers to obtain long-term credit. In addition, the stewardship of the land
is likely to improve as farmers can make long-term investments (such as planting trees for fruit,
fuel-wood and erosion control). Further environmental benefits come from the decrease in slash-
and-burn agricultural practices because farmers with secure land tenure know that they will be
entitled to the future benefits from any long-term investments they make.

Training of Staff and Farmers

3.38 Both government staff and farmers at all levels have been trained in various improved
technologies from rubber plantation to livestock rearing and improved annual crop production.
This knowledge constitutes the basis for further development and diversification of the
agricultural sector. It facilitates the transition from the high labor-intensive farming system to the
lower labor-intensive system. This is in line with the development of the economy, as the labor
cost will gradually increase.

Technological Improvement

3.39 Through support of research activities, the project has contributed to the improvement of
new technology. These activities range from the introduction of new rubber clones, new rubber
tapping methods, improved fruit tree varieties, livestock rearing technologies, and to a lesser
extent improving annual crop technologies. These technologies have a spill-over effect to other
projects and farmers.

Improved Institutional Capacity

3.40 Institutional capacity at the government level has been strengthened through training,
information exchange, and equipment support. Coordination has been improved at all levels:
central, provincial, local, and communal. This will have a spill-over effect to other projects and
government agencies.

Private Sector Involvement

3.41 There are also positive impacts to the private sector that has become more involved in the
rubber sector through contracting for rubber planting materials. Although indirectly involved,
the project has stimulated the private sector rubber processing industry by making more
smallholder rubber available.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Implementation

Component 1: Smallholder Rubber Development

Sub-component 1(a): Establishment of New Rubber Smallholdings

2.1.1 Up to the project closing time, 31/12/2006, the Agricultural Diversification Project (ADP)
had planted 30,877 ha of small holder rubber, achieving 103 % the project objective (there was a
revision of rubber target in March, 2001 when the new planting objective was reduced from
60,000 ha to 30,000 ha). About 64% of new planting area has high quality, 34% has medium
quality and 2% has poor quality. About 20,531 farm households participated in planting new
rubber; each household has 0.5­2 ha of rubber and rubber is expected to provide them with
sustainable incomes. According to the assessment of FAO, the financial return on 1 ha of new
planting is 15.4%. The price of rubber latex will be maintained and slightly increased in the next
15 years. The new planting has made contribution to protecting the environment, greening of
barren hills, mitigating land degradation, improving land quality and CO2 absorption. Rubber
planted on sloping land has also contributed to preventing land erosion.

Sub-component 1(b): Rehabilitation of Existing Rubber Smallholdings

2.1.2 Rubber for rehabilitation was the ones planted under the program 327 (greening the bare
hills) or the provincial rubber planting program. At the project closing time, there had been
10,654 ha of rubber rehabilitated or tapping with the average yield of 0.82 tons of dried latex per
ha and the total output of the final year (2006) reached 8,749 tons of dried latex. The FAO team
assessed that this sub-component had been extremely successful with the rate of financial return
on 1 ha of rehabilitated rubber reached 17.1%.

Sub-component 1(c): Rubber Extension

2.1.3 The project had conducted 477 training courses on rubber planting and maintenance with
participation of 28,636 participants who were rubber planters, key farmers, extension staff and
banking officials. The project had also organized 118 training courses on tapping techniques for
3,649 participants, who mainly were farmers.

2.1.4 The project had established a strong rubber extension system based on the existing
extension groups in order to provide technical support for the project. At the project closing time,
CPU and the 10 project provinces had 11 officials who had responsibility in monitoring the
smallholder rubber development sub-component, 1 international consultant (in 2005-2006, this
position was the national consultant), 9 rubber specialists recruited from General Rubber
Company (GRC) (before 2002, there were 10 specialists), 47 rubber specialists recruited from


                                               49

state rubber companies, which belong to GRC or provincial rubber companies (PRC), 96 rubber
extension workers, 804 rubber key farmers.
Sub-component 1(d): Smallholder Rubber Research

2.1.5 The subcomponent on rubber adaptive research had successfully met the set out targets. The
agency implementing this subcomponent was Vietnam's Rubber Research Institute. The
subcomponent had conducted 11 scientific studies on rubber seedlings selection and rubber
seedlings recommendations, rubber planting techniques, tapping techniques, pest controls.
Results of these researches had been recommended to farmers in the project areas.

Sub-component 1(e): Upgrading of Farm Access Tracks

2.1.6 At the project closing time, the project had constructed 192 km of rubber farm tracks to
meet the requirement on transportation to 80% of the new rubber planting area during the 9
months of the year by motorcycles and small trucks.

2.1.7 Long term credit disbursement: The long term credit disbursement for developing
smallholder rubber was carried out by VBARD. According to the report of VBARD, up to 31
December, 2006, the total borrowing amount under the long term credit was VND334 billion for
27,225 farm households, of which VND48 billion were lent to 7,437 farm households for
rehabilitating 7,945 ha of rubber and VND286 billion were lent to 19,788 farm households for
planting 30,205 ha of new rubber.

Component 2: Land Allocation

2.1.8 This subcomponent was aimed to guarantee safe conditions in land ownership through
delivering land use certificates. At the project closing time, about 241,619 ha of land had been
measured, of which 169,347 ha had been delivered with red books. 777,294 red books had been
delivered to 256,088 households. Among lands delivered with red books, about 31,887 ha were
planted with rubber. Land measurement and land use certificates delivery had helped farmers to
stabilize their production, reduced deforestation and slash and burnt phenomenon. Red book
delivery also meant that farmers have had assets to help borrowing funds from the banks to meet
their production requirement. This component had satisfied the set out targets of the project.

Component 3: Agriculture Intensification and Diversification

Sub-component 3(a): Crop and Livestock Extension Services

2.1.9 The livestock extension subcomponent of the project had been valued successful in all
project provinces. Through implementing this subcomponent, the capacity of livestock extension
system at provincial level had been significantly improved. There had been 2,174 officials among
whom 558 people were women and 107 people came from ethnic minorities had been trained.
143,205 farmers had been trained on cattle fattening techniques, achieving 97% of the project
objective. About 39,968 farmers had applied techniques for pig intensive raising fulfilling 107%
of the project objective. Through applying the project technologies, about 75 thousand tons of
high quality pork meat and beef had been supplied to market with reasonable prices. About 1,277
ha of grass for livestock production had been extended from the grass planting models ensuring
the supply of green feed for cattle populations in project provinces in the dry season. Owning to
the two main activities which were cattle fattening and pig intensive raising, the net profit
attained by producers in pig and cattle raising had increased greatly (128% for cattle fattening and
100% for pig intensive raising calculated on two heads of animals). Labor productivity from


                                                50

cattle fattening had increased by 4.7 times (equivalent to VND69,000 per day), from pig intensive
raising had increased by 4.7 times (equivalent to VND33,000/day) comparing to the periods
without having the project.

2.1.10 The crop extension subcomponent had also been successful. The subcomponent had
carried out 329 models demonstrating the plantation of annual crops and post harvest
technologies (excluding some models implemented by the Agricultural Research Center in South
Coastal Central) on an area of 587 communes and for 146 ethnic minority households who
participated into the models. The activities of the crop extension focused on introducing
techniques to increase the productivity of a number of annual crop species, which mainly were:
(i) upland rice (productivity increased by 85%), (ii) hybrid rice (increased by 38%), (iii) hybrid
maize (increased by 42%) and (iv) groundnut (increased by 68%) with an increase in net profit
per ha of each crop species by 80%, 151%, 117% and 221% respectively. The exceeded rate of
profits for each crop species was 107%, 195%, 316% and 123% respectively. Through primary
analysis, it indicates that the actual incomes returned from the additional technical application by
a poor household exceed the level of modest living standard as applied by the government. Based
on the results recorded from the demonstration models, training, study visits, meeting, workshops,
it indicates that many farmers had accessed technical advances for running production on more
than 60,000 ha, equivalent to about 100,000 households applying these advances.

Sub-component 3(b): Credit for Annual and Perennial Crop and Livestock Development

2.1.11 Disbursement of the medium and short term credit for crop and livestock production in the
overall credit structure of the project was carried out by VBARD in order to support small holder
farmers in applying new production techniques to further diversify revenue sources. There had
been in total 147,369 loans of short and medium term lending for crop production with an amount
of VND885 billion (or US$55 million) and 142,349 loans for livestock production with an
amount of VND1,122 billion (or US$70 million, including revolving funds). The total short and
medium lending had reached VND2,007 billion (equivalent to US$125 million) with 289,718
loans. The revolving times of the medium and short term credit component was 3.69 times.

Sub-component 3(c): Pilot Fruit Tree Development

2.1.12 The pilot fruit tree development subcomponent was assessed as successful and had met the
set out targets. The agency implementing this subcomponent was RIFAV. Fourteen crop species
were planted in test in 6 northern provinces since the first year. All these demonstration models
had been well maintained and returned encouraging results. From demonstration models, RIFAV
had selected 2-3 suitable species which well adapted to the local conditions and markets,
including introducing a number of technical recommendations and guidance.

Component 4: Institutional Strengthening

Sub-component 4(a): Support for Ethnic Minority Participation

2.1.13 The objective of this subcomponent was to strengthen the participation of ethic people into
the project. At the project closing time, there had been 27 community houses constructed and put
into utilization. Other activities include training of trainers (TOT) at provincial level, training of
officials who were ethnic people, ethnic women groups, ethnic farmers, establishing ethnic small
holder rubber groups, disseminating information in ethnic language and conducting study tours
for ethnic farmers. The participation of ethnic people had been promoted in all project
components. In land measurement and allocation, there had been 21,725 ethnic households


                                                 51

participating into this component and given with red books. For the agricultural diversification
and intensification, there had been over 6,000 households participating into training courses and
crop production demonstration models. In small holder rubber development, about 7,183 ethnic
households had participated into new rubber planting.

Sub-component 4(b): Human Resource Development

2.1.14 This subcomponent had been completed early (in 2003). The international consultants
carried out "a training need assessment" for the agricultural sector. This assessment later on was
used as a foundation for preparing an integrated training plan for the project. The implementation
of this subcomponent had been assessed as marginally satisfactory because it could not create a
close link to other project components.

Sub-component 4(c): Project Management

2.1.15 There was an important change in institutional aspect when the project decided to sign
contracts with each governmental agency to carry out specific activities of the project. The
contracting mechanism as applied to the project proved effective and the government should
further strengthen this mechanism. Contracting with private sector to purchase seedlings was also
a new institutional arrangement. The ADP project paid a great effort in strengthening capacity.
The institutional capacity had been promoted through training and equipment procurement for
MARD, VBARD, Vietnam's Rubber Research Institute and Departments of Natural Resources
and Environment (DONRE). Management capacity had also been strengthened especially at PCU
and PPMU. The two agricultural and rubber extension systems had been consolidated. The
project management had satisfied the set out requirement with a strong improvement after a
period of implementation. The financial management and equipment procurement, including
auditing had been assessed effective both at central and provincial level.

2.2 Key factors affecting project implementation

2.2.1 There were four major factors that caused the slow progress of ADP project implementation
in the initial years: (i) low levels of farmers' interest in rubber farming because of the low farm-
gate price of rubber during the initial project years, (ii) the profitability and competitiveness of
coffee with rubber in certain parts of the project area in the initial project years, (iii) problems
associated with land allocation and the issuance of Red Books required for collateral for long-
term credit from VBARD, and (iv) start-up and coordination problems experienced by the ADP
implementation unit.

2.2.2 Several problems slowed down the overall progress of land measurement and allocation: (i)
land conflicts among local farmers, (ii) the lengthy procedure for changing land use categories,
(iii) how to treat migrants, and (iv) communications among different agencies. Other problems
included small land parcel size along with most farmers having several small pieces of land
scattered over a wide area and participating farmers scattered throughout the district. Furthermore,
the unique circumstances of the ethnic minority communities and the highly risk averse nature of
the ethnic minorities made it difficult to attract them to participate in long-term rubber production
and long-term credit. The new Land Law of 2004 also slowed the progress of issuing Red Books
in that year. There was also a lag between land measuring and documentation and the actual
issuance of the Red Books by the District People's Committees.

2.2.3 The other major factor was start-up and coordination problems experienced by the ADP
implementation unit. It took the first few years of the project for the PCU and PPMUs to become


                                                  52

focused and organized and to identify a mechanism to coordinate various project entities. Other
problems were insufficient number of staff and support staff with adequate project management
experience and the delay of the counterpart funding. None of the project components made
headway during this initial period largely because of the PCU start-up problems.

2.2.4 For the VBARD this is the first attempt to deliver long term loans to the poor households
and ethnic minorities living in the remote areas; so the disbursement was slow mainly due to the
local banking branches and staffs were not skillful.

2.2.5 Coordination of stakeholders was slow leading to delay in deciding institutional
arrangement, financial mechanism, fund flow, etc. For example, the cost norms have been
approved extremely late (only in October 2001). In addition, the delay was also in staff and expert
recruitment.

2.3 Sustainability of Project Achievements

The project has achieved the sustainability both on the economic, social and environment aspects.

2.3.1 With total of 41,541 ha rubber planted and rehabilitated, many farmers who participated in
the project can get the long time benefit for a duration of 20-25 years since these rubber areas to
be tapped. The rubber price is expected that to be slightly increased and the poor farmers will be
able to obtain good profit from rubber tapping.

2.3.2 Through crop and livestock demonstrations and training of key and other farmers, a large
number of beneficiaries are applying the new techniques and their net incomes have increased
compared to traditional methods. This is corroborated by the financial analysis which
demonstrates high returns to the use of "with-project" techniques even in the situation of high
input prices and low product prices.

2.3.3 Land is allocated for all households in project communes. This is a prerequisite for farmer
livelihood improvement and to secure for long term investment on agriculture intensification and
diversification. From the small, scattered and fragment land plots, rubber areas have been
established. To met the production requirements (growing, processing, consumption, market
prediction, etc.), farmers need to get together in a community of a same interest. In this
community they can mutually cooperate and help each others. Similarly, crop and livestock
intensification have been forming commercial production areas in which farmers link together to
access the extension systems, credit sources, input and output services.

2.3.4 It is claimed that rubber tree plantations are friendly to the environment. They can grow in
the poorer fertility soils found on bare and unused lands and on sloping and hillside land
providing good ground cover that reduces soil erosion. The rubber tree is a good tree to
rehabilitate the land in areas where the forest was previously disrupted. Rubber tree plantations
can be intercropped for the first 5 years providing further ground cover. Compared to other crops
such as coffee, rubber trees need much less water and do not require irrigation. Rubber trees are
non-toxic unlike some forest plantation trees used for wood harvesting. The wood produced is a
by-product which can be used for fuel, construction, furniture and chip-board manufacturing
thereby putting less demand on traditional forested areas. Rubber trees are also an important
source of carbon sequestration. The amount of carbon sequestered is higher/ha than coffee,
traditional food crops or bare land vegetation and equal to the amount sequestered by plantation
forests. The amount of fertilizers and pesticides used are at low levels and so not harmful to the
environment.


                                                53

2.3.5 Crop extension activities have trained farmers to use inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides
and herbicides in the proper manner and in the proper amounts thus minimizing any damage to
the environment. Although minor, the method of cow fattening in stalls has reduced the number
of grazing animals that roam the countryside causing damage to various trees and plants. Also,
the with-project feeding techniques do not require the heating/cooking of animal feed and thus
may be more environmentally friendly because less wood is burnt.

2.3.6 Land tenure rights given to farmers through the Land Allocation Component had a long-
term effect on the stewardship of the land. Farmers who own the land are more likely to be good
stewards of the land and undertake those activities which are more environmentally friendly. In
combination with land allocation and rubber tree planting, many farmers associated with ADP
(mostly ethnic) have stopped the environmentally unsound slash-and-burn agricultural practice.

4. Lessons Learns

4.1. The original ADP objectives do not specifically focus on value added activities (i.e., small
rubber processing, livestock and crop processing) or on some of the market-oriented aspects such
as improvement in market chain infrastructure and marketing information or on market
competitiveness and reform especially in the rubber sector. Therefore, the follow-up project
should focus on these aspects.

4.2 The complication of land allocation procedures and planting material supplying were not
envisaged during project preparation and planning. These two key steps should be completed at
least one to one and half years before planting start. Unrealistic targets on the new planting areas
were set for the first two year (1998-1999) when prerequisite conditions like land preparation,
planting material and extension were not yet in place.

4.3 Success of small holder rubber depends on at least three groups of factors/criteria: (i) rubber
requirements (ecological conditions, elevation, land quality, variety, technical alternatives, etc.);



                                               54

(ii) land tenure for private holdings; and (iii) grower access to credit (farmer eligibility to the loan
terms, banking branches capable to deliver loan in time, etc.). These factors are interactive and
need to be satisfied at the same time. However, in certain cases the sequence of satisfaction was
not duly considered in the project design and implementation plan. As a consequence, eligible
rubber growers were stepwise dropped from the initial list of potential involving households and
the target areas of rubber planting had to be reduced.

4.4 Regarding disbursement of long term loan for rubber planting and rehabilitation, it was very
often found that the disbursement figures provided by the VBARD and the Project systems were
inconsistent. This is due to the lack of benchmark checking by the PPMUs and the VBARD
branches before submitting the progress information to the upper levels. This is also a lesson
learnt from the cooperation between the project implementing units.

5. Conclusions

5.1 In conclusion, despite a very slow start-up of ADP, the project has had major impacts. The
project was on course to achieve the agricultural intensification/diversification target outcomes
and achieved the rubber establishment target (103% target). The financial analysis indicates that
land productivity (yield/ha), labor productivity (net income/hour worked), and the overall net
incomes of rubber, crop and livestock farmers who participated in ADP has increased
substantially. Total rubber, crop production and beef and pork production has also increased.
These outcomes are likely to be sustained in the coming years. The economic rate of return
analysis indicates that the project is a very good investment for the people. The gender action
plan and the Ethnic Minority Development Plan has empowered both groups and has laid the
foundation for greater women and ethnic minority group involvement in the economic and social
life of the country. The project's impact on institutional arrangements and the investment in
capacity building will have an effect on future government activities and future projects like the
ADP. ADP has built a good foundation upon which the ADP2 can be launched.

5.2. There are a number of activities to be implemented after the completion of the project. Many
farmers may not be able to access credits as needed and the technical training on rubber
maintaining and tapping. This will result in a risk of reducing the latex productivity. Regarding to
this issue, VBARD requested Ministry of Finance (MOF) to transfer US$7 million from the
recycled medium and short term credit to the long term credit to continue the lending for rubber
maintenance for the next 15 months. MARD also forwarded its letters to project provinces
requesting the continuation of providing project's technical assistance. The government is
discussing with the World Bank and AFD on the ADP2 project in an attempt to sustain the
previous investment. The analysis of financial services and lending indicates that farmers who
borrowed loans from the project can service their debts, effectively maintain the cash amount and
generate more incomes for their families. This proves to be very promising. Therefore, technical
and credit supports (especially to tapping) should be maintained for years to come until all areas
planted with rubber under the ADP project come to the harvesting period.

     ANNEX 8. COMMENTS OF CO-FINANCIERS AND OTHER PARTNERS/STAKEHOLDERS


8.1. The comments from the AFD were received on June 4, 2007. Overall, AFD agrees with the
FAO assessment that this project has been very successful in term of physical outputs and in term
of financial and economic performances. In the same way, the project has had a positive
contribution to poverty reduction, social development and environmental improvement.

8.2. Among others, the development of more than 30 000 ha of new private rubber smallholdings,
and the rehabilitation of more than 10 000 ha of existing ones are quite an achievement in the
project context.

8.3. On the economic side, the overall project ERR is high (22.5%), robust to changes in revenues
and costs, and confirms that the project is a good investment for the country.

8.4. In term of lessons learned from the project, it appears that VBARD, the bank partner, has had
no difficulties in disbursing the short and medium term credits, which are standard financial
produces, and were allocated to the "intensification and diversification crop and livestock
component". On the contrary, disbursement of long-term credit for the "rubber component" was
slow, difficult and in some ways below expectation.

8.5. Therefore, it is likely that one cannot expect this type of "commercial bank" to grant
naturally, from its standard financial resources, long term credit for investments such as private
rubber smallholdings. And unless providing the bank with long term financial resources dedicated
to these specific investments, the private rubber smallholding sector runs the risk of not being
financed, and also to see part of the investment made through ADP to be deteriorated.
