The project has four components.\n            Component 1 helps small farmers plant and maintain new\n            rubber trees in ten central provinces; rehabilitates small\n            rubber holdings in eight central provinces; upgrades\n            existing and constructs new farm tracks to transport inputs;\n            provides technical support for land preparation, planting\n            and maintenance of new small rubber holdings and for\n            rehabilitating and maintaining existing holdings; builds the\n            capacity of the provincial departments of agriculture to\n            provide effective extension; and selects and trains farmer\n            leaders while carrying out a rubber research program\n            consisting of basic, adaptive, and participatory research,\n            which assesses technical options. Component 2 surveys and\n            maps land in villages and issues land use certificates.\n            Component 3 provides technical support for intensifying crop\n            and livestock production, and strengthens the capacity of\n            extension services; provides a line of credit for sub-loans\n            to help increase farm income from crops and livestock\n            production; pilots fruit tree development, and establishes\n            and monitors nurseries. Component 4 funds training and\n            strengthens the institutional capacities of ethnic minority\n            communities and government departments, and upgrades\n            management skills."}, "docdt": "1998-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
