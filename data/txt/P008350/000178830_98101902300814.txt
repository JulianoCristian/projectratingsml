Risks:            The project provides for sufficient port facilities to cope
with forecast traffic up to 1983 at minimum cost and accords
with an investment policy which minimizes risks since it
takes account of the possibility that other ports might
become available.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE CYPRUS PORTS AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
FOR A SECOND PORTS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan
to the CyprusPorts Authority, with the guarantee of the Republic of Cyprus,
for the equivalent of $8.5 million to help finance a second ports project.
The loan would have a term of fifteen years, including three years of grace,
with interest at 7.45 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Cyprus (1151-CY) was circulated to the
Executive Directors in May 1976. The Country Economist who visited Cyprus
in April 1977 to update the information and analysis, also visited the
economically important areas in the northern part of the island and held
discussions with Turkish Cypriot officials. Since sufficient reliable data
are still not available for the northern area, it is only possible to review
adequately the economic situation and prospects for the southern Government-
controlled part of the island. Findings of the April 1977 visit are reflected
herein.
General Background
3.        Cyprus' economy grew at 7 percent per annum between 1960 and 1972,
despite tension between t:he Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.
The major contributing factors to this growth were: a competent Government,
dynamic entrepreneurs, a high rate of investment especially in the private
sector, a rapid increase in agricultural exports contributing to strong over-
all balance of payments, and flexible fiscal and monetary policies, which
helped to stimulate growth while maintaining domestic price stability.
*          4.         The unprecedented drought of 1973 caused serious economic difficul-
ties, and subsequently the events of July/August 1974 shattered the growing
economy. Since then, Cyprus has been divided into two parts by a cease-fire
line, with little movement of people or goods between them.  The southern
part, under the Government's control, constitutes 64 percent of the area of
the island; the northern part, 36 percent of the land area, is under Turkish
Cypriot control. About one-third of the total population was displaced, with
over 150,000 Greek Cypriots moving south and approximately 45,000 Turkish
Cypriots moving north. 'he displaced population has, in good part, been
resettled with humanitarian assistance provided largely through the UN. In



1976, the Government-controlled area had an estimated 480,000 people; with
150,000 in the area under Turkish Cypriot control. Pending an island-wide
political solution based on the principle of federation, the Turkish Federated
State of Cyprus was proclaimed in February 1975. UN-sponsored intercommunal
talks towards such a possible solution have been held intermittently, but have
so far not been productive. With new initiatives recently undertaken by UN
Secretary General Waldheim, such talks are scheduled to resume shortly.
5.        The division of Cyprus into two zones has resulted in significant
structural changes and difficulties for the island's economy. Immediately
following the events of July/August, 1974, GNP per capita dropped by some 19
percent and the unemployment rate jumped to approximately 25 percent of the
labor force in the Government-controlled area. The northern part of the
island also faced a similar loss in income and increase in unemployment.
The balance of payments position also suffered as both exports and imports
of the area under Government control fell by about 55 percent in the second
half of 1974. The drop in export earnings in the Government-controlled area
reflected the loss of over 47 percent of Cyprus' cultivated land area in the
north (including areas which produced over half the Island's agricultural
exports), but which have only partially been exploited since 1974 by the
Turkish Cypriots.
Recent Developments
6.        The Government, through bold measures, succeeded in arresting and,
in 1976, reversing the economic decline in the area it controls. In August
1975, it consolidated initial and new measures for economic recovery into an
Emergency Economic Action Plan for 1975 and 1976. This Plan called for fixed
investment of $275 million to create 16,000 to 20,000 new jobs, and efforts to
reactivate industry and agriculture. In industry, it aimed at a major revival
of industrial activity, through the creation of additional capacity in labor-
intensive, export-oriented industries to rehabilitate the available labor
force, and increase the utilization of existing capital. These efforts led
to a rapid recovery of GDP and employment in 1975, from their very depressed
levels at the end of 1974. The Cypriots were also successful in earning
foreign exchange and obtaining significant employment opportunities abroad by
winning construction contracts in the Middle East. In addition, the inflow of
refugee aid reached $57 million. Despite these improvements, the balance of
payments remained in deficit and reserves fell to the equivalent of six
months' imports of goods and services.
7.        There was a further strong export-led recovery in 1976, with a
revival of private sector confidence and initiative stimulated by Government
fiscal policies and direct investment in rehabilitating and expanding produc-
tive capacity. GDP increased by 14 percent in real terms, a remarkable
achievement, with value added in both agriculture and industry up 20 percent.
The unemployment rate fell to 10 percent. As a result of the success in
exporting labor for civil works contracts won by Cypriots in the Middle-East,



some industries began to experience some labor shortage. Private consumption
rose 14 percent in real terms, while Government current expenditures remained
level. As a result total consumption increased only 11.5 percent. On the
other hand gross investment increased by only 9.3 percent and fixed capital
formation increased by 12 percent with most of the increase in private invest-
ment and refugee housing. Large budget deficits continued as the Government
stimulated recovery and tried to meet the needs of refugees, but consumer
prices rose less than 4 percent, reflecting the existence of substantial
unutilized resources.
8.        In 1976, there was also a remarkable turn-around in the balance of
payments position after ithree years of increasing deficits. Receipts from
merchandise exports soared 73 percent, mostly from agricultural produce for
the United Kingdom, cement, clothing and footwear for the Middle East and
Eastern Europe. Payments for merchandise imports rose 33 percent in support
of economic reactivation and export production. The current account balance
was only slightly negative. The Government obtained $40 million from the IMF
oil and compensatory financing facilities, and $2 million from SDR holdings
and it was successful in reopening, although quite limited, external borrowing
from bilateral and multi:Lateral official sources during 1976. These funds
coupled with short-term external factors, which included $47 million in inter-
national refugee aid, were sufficient to result in an overall balance of pay-
ments surplus of $43 mil:Lion, and to increase reserves to $288 million by
the end of 1976, equivalent to nearly seven months' imports of goods and
services.
9.        Despite these achievements, investment, employment and GNP per
capita in constant prices (of 1967) had still not gained their pre-1974 levels
by the end of 1976. In evaluating Cyprus' creditable economic performance
and recovery in 1976, it should be kept in mind that in addition to the
short-term internal factors which influenced the supply side, such as the
existence of unutilized lplant capacity, surplus labor, low wages and low
inflation rates, much of the rapid growth was due to short-term external
factors affecting the demand side, which are unlikely to recur, including:
greatly increased exports to Lebanon and large expenditures in Cyprus by
Lebanese temporary residents as a result of the Lebanese civil war; an agri-
cultural export market boosted by severe drought conditions in Western and
Eastern Europe; and continuing international refugee aid.
10.       This is reflected in the lower GDP growth rate for 1977 in contrast
to the 14 percent growth rate in 1976. Preliminary indications are that GDP
increased by eight percent in real terms in 1977. Construction and trade were
the leading sectors. Investment activity appears to have increased rapidly,
with the import of capital goods doubling in the first six months of 1977 over
thle 3ame period in 1976. Reserves stood at $323.6 million at the end of
November 1977, equivalent to seven months of imports of goods and services,
comparable to the level attained at the end of 1976.
Short and Medium Term Outlook
11.       Cyprus can count on several favorable factors to sustain continued
economic growth. These are: unutilized, although difficult to harness,



- 4 -
water resources; dynamic and responsible entrepreneurship; skilled labor;
lower wage levels than in continental Europe; and favorable location in rela-
tion to Middle Eastern markets.
12.       The pace and shape of future economic development, however, will
depend largely on the political situation. The Government has followed up
on its previous plan, by finalizing a Second Emergency Action Plan for 1977
and 1978. It envisages an 8.5 percent per annum growth in GDP and a 44 per-
cent increase in gross fixed capital formation; 12 percent of this will be
destined for the primary sectors, 28 percent for the secondary sectors and the
remaining 60 percent to the tertiary sectors. As a result of this allocation,
the level of real investment in the primary sectors is projected to remain
unchanged. However, the levels of real investment in the secondary and ter-
tiary sectors are projected to increase by 56 and 52 percent respectively over
their levels during the First Emergency Action Plan. This allocation reflects
the priority being given to industrialization and the recovery of the tourist
sector, with the complementary infrastructure investments that will be neces-
sary in transportation, communication and housing. Overall this investment
program is expected to be increasingly capital intensive, as the underutilized
labor pool available a year and a half ago has been diminished considerably.
13.       Approximately $300 million (over 77 percent) of the $387.5 million
investment program for the 1977/78 plan period is expected by the government
to be financed through national savings, including transfers. A capital
inflow of approximately $115.0 million, will be required to cover the deficit
and to maintain the level of reserves.
14.      The average GDP growth rate envisaged in the Second Plan appears
feasible. However, as pointed out in the Plan it will be contingent upon a
rapid expansion of exports and a favorable balance of payments position.
Indeed, beyond 1978, balance of payments prospects, rather than supply poten-
tial, will determine the feasibility of continuing the high growth rates of
the last few years. Over the medium-term, a six to seven percent per annum
growth in output appears possible, given continued expansion in exports
particularly to the Middle-Eastern Countries, and the re-establishment of the
tourist industry. In the longer-term, however, growth will have to be based
increasingly on an export-oriented manufacturing sector, whose success will
depend on achieving competitive prices, consistent quality, and longer produc-
tion runs. To ensure competitiveness it will be necessary to restructure
industry over the medium-term. This effort should be facilitated by the
two-year extension in 1977 of the Association Agreement with the European
Economic Community.
15.       Despite the good prospects for export growth and import-substitution,
the overall balance of payments outlook over the medium and longer-term will
depend on increasing success in external borrowing, while maintaining a more
ample level of reserves than is currently normal elsewhere, which in Cyprus'
recent political experience and circumstances appears to be most prudent.



16.       Cyprus' recent. experiences in mobilizing external resources given
the volatility of the political situation, is encouraging. It successfully
raised its first Euro-currency loan of $30 million in early 1977. This has
encouraged it to try ancl raise a commercial bank loan of between $35 to 50
million to cover a portiLon of the estimated $115 million in foreign exchange,
required for development expenditures in its Second Emergency Plan. Prospects
for the finalization of this limited commercial borrowing, are bright. In
1976, KfW also resumed bilateral German aid to Cyprus through small loans for
irrigation and the Cyprus Development Bank (CDB). The Council for Europe
also commenced channelliLng limited assistance in 1977, part of which was
tied by the Government to cover the foreign exchange cost of the Pitsilia
Rural Development Project financed in July 1977 by the Bank. With Bank
encouragement to try and gradually diversify its sources of official aid
further, Cyprus also succeeded in obtaining co-financing from the Kuwait Fund
for the Bank-financed N:icosia-Limassol Highway Project (1344-CY). In the
context of the proposed ports project, Cyprus will try to obtain a portion
of the foreign exchange financing required, through suppliers' credits.
After 1978, however, ba:Lance of payments deficits are likely. Hence, medium-
term growth will probably have to be kept at a moderate level, as mentioned
above, restricting the development of the economy's potential and further
delaying the rehabilitaltion of refugees.
17.       Cyprus' external debt has remained low, as a result of both the Gov-
ernment's past policy of financing development internally and its past limited
borrowing ability in a relatively uncertain political context. Total long-
term public debt disbursed and outstanding was $94 million as of December 31,
1976 with short-term debt of a further $58 million. Public debt service was
only 3.6 percent of exports in 1976. Given expected export growth, debt
service should remain Low through the next decade. The Bank has always held a
high proportion of Cyprus' external public debt (42 percent of disbursed debt
as of December 31, 1976), and received 34 percent of service payments on
public debt in 1976. Through this, the Bank has helped overcome Cyprus'
relative inability to borrow abroad during the 1960s and early 1970s. The
Bank's exposure, although high, remains reasonable, given Cyprus' low external
debt and debt service ratio, and the Government's good economic management and
policy of maintaining ample reserves. The exposure is expected to continue to
decline as Cyprus continues to endeavor diversifying its external borrowings.
Cyprus is creditworthy for additional Bank borrowing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CYPRUS
18.       Bank lending to Cyprus began in 1963 and as of January 31,1978, com-
prised thirteen loans totalling $96.0 million (net of cancellations), of which
$82.3 million was held by the Bank. These include four power loans ($31.6
million), two highway loans ($15.4 million), two loans to the Cyprus Develop-
ment Bank ($8.9 million), two sewerage loans for Nicosia and Famagusta ($4.6
million), an irrigation loan ($14.0 million); an integrated rural development



- 6 -
loan for the economically depressed Pitsilia region ($10.0 million), and a
ports loan ($11.5 million). Details of Bank loans to Cyprus are given
in Annex II.
19.       The events of 1974 caused a temporary break in Bank operations until
June 1976, and resulted in delays in the execution of some projects. In par-
ticular, the execution of the following projects are affected: (i) the sewer-
age project in Famagusta, which lies entirely in the area controlled by the
Turkish Cypriots; and (ii) the cotistruction of the Nicosia-Morphou highway,
the alignment of which coincides with the cease-fire line. (The loan was
amended at the request of the Government in November 1976, to make available
the balance of uncommitted funds for construction of the new Nicosia-Limassol
highway financed by Loan No. 1344 approved by the Executive ri-e ors in
December 1976). The Nicosia Sewerage Project also remains - oe completed
because some final work is needed to complete the treatment plant located in
the area under the control of the Turkish Cypriots. With the initiative of
UNDP and the Bank and the cooperation of the two sides, the Nicosia Sewerage
Board and the Turkish Cypriots reached tentative agreement in September 1977,
to proceed with the completion of this project. This development, which will
need careful nurturing by both sides if only to implement the tentative agree-
ment, offers some promise for possible cooperation by both communities in
respect of ongoing projects. The Bank, together with UNDP, will continue
to make sustained efforts to find ways of promoting similar cooperation.
20.       The Bank's objectives in Cyprus are to finance projects to meet
urgent needs for productive employment, exports and rehabilitation; to invest
in essential infrastructure useful in the context of the whole island; to
cooperate in attracting long-term development capital from other sources;
and to accelerate the recovery of the Cypriot economy to the level prevailing
before the events of 1974. When a political settlement is reached, the Bank
would seek to help both communities through support of projects developed to
improve living standards of those groups left out of the growing prosperity
prior to 1974; to encourage development of a national water policy; to develop
resources on which both communities are dependent; and to continue to help
attract long-term capital from other sources for Cyprus' development. At
present the Government is preparing an irrigation project in the Vassilikos
Pendaskinos region, which should be ready for Board presentation in FY79.
21.       IFC's first investment in Cyprus was in a cement company in 1972.
The company has since become a leader in the country's successful export drive.
IFC has most recently invested in an asbestos cement pipe plant and is cur-
rently exploring opportunities for further investment on the island. As of
January 31, 1978, gross commitments totalled $3.6 million, of which $2.7
million are still held by IFC. Details of IFC investments in Cyprus are
given in Annex II.



PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR, THE PORT SUB-SECTOR AND THE BORROWER
The Transport Sector
22.       The transportaltion system in Cyprus, prior to 1974, was reasonably
balanced, encompassing roads, ports, airports, and some coastal shipping. As
Cyprus has no railway system, highways play a critical role in the transporta-
tion system. After the 4events of 1974, the Government concentrated on trans-
portation investments, to cope with the immediate demands of the economy and
is now beginning to focus on long-term planning for the transport sector.
Planned investment in the Second Emergency Economic Plan (1977/78) in order
of priority, is as follows: housing, manufacturing, transport and communica-
tions, services, and agriculture. Government development expenditures for
transport and communications are projected to increase to +C 7.8 million in
1977/78 from +C 6.8 million in 1975/76. The Government plans to use the
increase in funds for thez construction of major infrastructure projects,
mainly new trunk roads and port and airport works, which are considered neces-
sary for the provision of facilities for the marketing of local producLion.
23.       The Planning Bureau is responsible for the preparation (and imple-
mentation) of overall, regional, and sectoral plans including the transporta-
tion sector. Plans for the transport sector are formulated in consultation
with the Ministries concerned. The Government regulates public passenger and
freight transport under the Motor Transport Regulation Law of 1974 as amended;
the Law is administered by the semi-independent Licensing Authority and by the
Licensing Department in Mlinistry of Communications and Works (MCW). The Gov-
ernment controls fares and schedules for public transport routes and imports
of buses and trucks. These controls and regulations are administered flexibly
and do not affect competition in the industry. The current organization of the
transport sector is based on the pre-July 1974 framework. MCW is responsible
for supervising the Public Works Department (PWD), Department of Civil Aviation
(DCA), and the Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA) which are responsible for roads,
airports, and ports respectively. The Forestry Department of the Ministry of
Agriculture and the Municipalities are responsible for the remaining roads.
24.       The highway network radiates from the capital of Cyprus--Nicosia--
to the main coastal centers at Limassol and Larnaca and to the hinterland.
The total network of national highways for the southern part of the island is
1,479 km, almost 90 percent of which are paved. As the roads are the only
mea:.- of overland transport, they are being used to capacity and the network
has not been developed fast enough to keep pace with the country's economic
development. The Bank is assisting in financing the construction of a new
Nicosia-Limassol highway to accommodate growing traffic and changes in traffic
patterns caused by the 1974 events.
The Ports Sub-Sector
25.       Before the events of 1974, the main general cargo port in Cyprus
was Famagusta which, in 1973, handled over 80 percent of the total traffic



-8-
for the country, much of it serving the capital city, Nicosia. Next in im-
portance were the ports of Limassol and Larnaca, both located on the south
coast. The other small ports, Paphos in the soutuwebL and Kyrenia on the
north coast, handled a minimal amount of traffic, basically servicing the
immediate vicinity. There were also two privately operated mineral exporting
ports: Karavostassi on the northwest coast, and Vassiliko/Zyyi on the south
coast between Limassol and Larnaca. Oil imports were handled at an offshore
terminal at Larnaca.
26.       As a result of the events of July 1974, the general cargo ports of
Famagusta and Kyrenia, and the mineral port of Karavostassi are under Turkish
Cypriot control. This has resulted in considerable shift in the traffic flow,
and now all the general cargo traffic for the capital, Nicosia, and for south-
ern Cyprus is handled by Limassol and Larnaca. As an indication of the drastic
shift in the traffic flow, and the consequent burden being borne by Limassol
and Larnaca, total cargo traffic handled by Famagusta, Limassol and Larnaca
in 1973 was 1.8 million tons (out of which traffic handled by Limassol and
Larnaca accounted for 0.3 million tons), while in 1976 Limassol and Larnaca
alone handled 2.3 million tons. This amounts to approximately three times the
design capacity of the two ports, and an inevitable consequence of this growth
in traffic has been port congestion and foreign exchange costs in the form of
surcharges imposed by the shipping companies. Barring a political settlement
which would bring Famagusta back into operation, projections show that by 1985
Limassol and Larnaca will be handling over four million tons of traffic which
is within the projected capacity of the two ports in view of the planned
further development of Larnaca port beyond the scope of this project.
27.       Based on economic factors discussed in Part I, traffic is expected
to grow from 2.3 million tons in 1976 to 4.1 million tons in 1985. In order
to cope with this problem, expansion of the port facilities is required and
the proposed project is designed to help solve these problems. The expansion
at Limassol and Larnaca is both needed and justified even if the facilities
at Famagusta were to become available.
The Borrower
28.       The Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA) will be the borrower of the proposed
loan and will be responsible for implementing the project. The establishment
of an autonomous national ports authority was agreed under the First Ports
Project (Loan 628-CY) and CPA was established as an autonomous corporation in
1973 under the Cyprus Ports Authority Law, and is responsible for managing
the ports in Cyprus. Although CPA was created in 1973, it did not become
fully effective until August 1, 1976, because of the political and administra-
tive disruptions of 1974, and delays in the transfer of the assets and liabili-
ties of existing ports to CPA. Despite the changed situation since 1973, the
reason for creating the Authority is still valid. CPA is empowered to: (i)
regulate and control port operations and provide navigation services; (ii)
levy dues and charges for the use of the ports and port installations; (iii)
acquire, rent or lease properties; (iv) borrow from the Government and other
sources. CPA is governed by a Board of seven members, all appointed by the
Council of Ministers; the Director of Customs is an ex-officio member of the



- 9 -
Board. The General Manager is appointed by the Council of Ministers in con-
sultation with the Board and takes care of day-to-day management and imple-
ments the decisions of the Board. CPA has sufficient autonomy to carry
out its responsibilities satisfactorily.
29.       As CPA became fully operational only in August 1976, it is premature
to judge its overall performance. However, operational performance at Limassol
and Larnaca has been good, as evidenced by the fact that the two ports together
handled more than three times the traffic load they were originally designed
for. This was made possible by close cooperation between the CPA, customs
departments, shipping agents, stevedores, licensed porters and labor. On the
managerial side there is also good cooperation and excellent working relation-
ships between the General Manager, the Financial Manager and the two port
managers. Nevertheless, as the traffic through the ports increases, the
appointment of an Operations Manager is essential to coordinate the daily
operations of all the ports and free the General Manager to concentrate on
broader policy issues, all the more so if Famagusta were to come under the
control of CPA. Agreement has been reached on filling the position of the
Operations Manager by the end of August, 1978 (Loan Agreement, Section 4.01).
Similarly, as the size and complexity of the port operations grow, CPA will
need its own technical services unit to take over the maintenance operations
currently being performed by the Public Works Department. The CPA has under-
taken to establish a technical services unit as soon as practicable, and in
any event not later than December 1978.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
30.       The expansion of port facilities at Limassol and Larnaca was ini-
tially identified through a port expansion study completed by Louis Berger
International Inc. (LBI), U.S.A. in 1976. It was financed under the Bank's
first highway loan (Loan No. 904-CY). The project was prepared by CPA, since
the expansion of port facilities at Limassol and Larnaca in southern Cyprus
was confirmed by this study as having the highest priority for port develop-
ment. Bank missions visited Cyprus in June and September 1977, to discuss and
guide the Government in its preparation efforts. The project was appraised in
September 1977. Negotiations took place in Washington in February 1978. The
Cypriot delegation was headed by CPA's General Manager, Mr. Bayada, and
included Mr. Theophilou of the Finance Ministry. A Staff Appraisal Report
entitled "Second Ports Project, Cyprus" (No. 1861b-CY) dated March 7, 1978 is
being distributed separately. Supplementary Project data is contained in
Annex III.
Project Rationale and Objectives
31.       The main objective of the proposed project is to relieve congestion
at Limassol and Larnaca, which have become major ports in the country in the
last 3 to 4 years, and to accommodate future traffic growth there up to 1983.



- 10 -
Fhe proposed project is, in essence, a follow-up to the first port project
completed in 1975. The project will complement the improvements being carried
out to the Nicosia Limassol highway, financed by the Bank's second highway
loan, and ensure that the benefits stemming from that project are fully
achieved. Partly because of the unforeseen political events of 1974, which
made the port of Famagusta inaccessible to the Government and therefore
significantly changed traffic patterns, the first port project expanding the
port of Limassol turned out to be too limited in scope. This is reflected
in the Project Performance Audit Report on the First Ports Project. The
handling in Limassol and Larnaca of a much larger traffic load than originally
projected was made possible by a combination of considerable overtime, a
decline in passenger traffic, and good port management. Nevertheless, in
1976, these two ports experienced approximately 2,600 ship days of waiting
time with an average berth occupancy of 88 percent. Moreover, as the current
economic development strategy of Cyprus relies to a large degree on the
expansion of the industrial sector and promotion of industrial and agri-
cultural exports from southern Cyprus, increasing demands will be made upon
port facilities as a result of increased exports and imports.
32.       The project's additional objectives are also to help introduce new
technology in the form of specialized container cargo-handling equipment and
facilities, and, through consultant services and training programs, upgrade
CPA's management capabilities as well as the operational efficiency and
skills of its workers.
33.       The scope of the project has been defined taking into account the
possibility of a political solution whereby the port of Famagusta would become
available, and also the Government's other investment priorities. It is a
least cost solution: the project is a fairly straightforward port expansion
project with few technical complications. Final engineering is already
underway.
Project Description
34.       The proposed project includes the construction of a 11 meter deep
and 480 meters long quay at Limassol, as well as transit sheds, warehouses and
a passenger terminal building at that port. It also includes the construction
of port administration and ancilliary buildings at both Limassol and Larnaca,
as well as the paving and surfacing of roads, open storage and parking areas,
besides provision of necessary utilities at both ports. Cargo handling and
workshop equipment for both ports and container handling equipment for Limassol
will also be provided.
35.       Besides the above, the project includes the provison of consultancy
services to assist CPA in the engineering design, preparation of tender docu-
ments, and supervision of construction and civil works. The services of con-
sultants experienced in the administration and operation of ports are also
included in the project to (i) advise CPA in management, operation and tech-
nical policies and procedures; (ii) assist in establishing cost based tariffs
and the revaluation of assets; and (iii) organize vocational training programs
for CPA personnel and port workers. Approximately 180 man months of experts



- 11 -
and about 200 man months of technicians are envisaged at rates of $5,000 and
$3,000 per man-month, respectively. CPA will review with the Bank the con-
sultants recommendations and the action it proposes to take thereon (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.02(c)).
CPA Investment Program
36.       The project ($29.5 million) accounts for a major part (64 percent)
of CPA's Investment Program for 1978-82 totalling $46 million. Other items in
the program total about $16.5 million, the main item being the provision for
further expansion of port facilities at Larnaca at an estimated cost of $8.5
million. CPA's program up to 1982 as presently constituted, is considered
feasible and justifiable. CPA has agreed not to make any material changes in
the investment program without consulting the Bank, and any such investments
should be fully justifiable on economic and financial grounds (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.05). The Government is planning the development of port facilities
at Paphos to further the economic development of the region but this is not
likely to take place during CPA's current investment program.
Project Cost and Financing
37.       The total project cost (including contingencies) is estimated at
$29.5 million (excluding domestic taxes and customs duties since CPA is exempt
from both), of which $17.4 million is in foreign exchange. These estimates
assume the availability of local construction materials and labor and also
that local contractors would be unlikely to undertake main civil works (quay
construction), since they lack the construction equipment and the experience
required. Cost estimates of civil works are based on the feasibility study
prepared by Louis Berger International, Inc. (LBI) in 1976, and on prices
given by PWD based on updating of recent contracts for similar works. Equip-
ment costs are based on quotations from foreign suppliers at the end of 1976
and also updated to reflect current prices. Bills of quantities are computed
on the basis of preliminary engineering, and construction equipment rates are
based on actual productivity during construction of existing port facilities.
38.       Price escalation of foreign and local components are based on infla-
tion rates as follows: for civil works at 9 percent per annum for 1978-79 and
8 percent per annum for 1980-81, and for equipment at 7.5 percent per annum for
1978-79 and 7 percent per annum for 1980-81.
39.       The proposed loan of $8.5 million would finance about 50 percent of
the foreign exchange costs of the project. It would be utilized to finance
the foreign costs of major civil works at Limassol and consultants services.
The $9.0 million balance of the foreign exchange required will be financed by:
(i) equipment suppliers who would, if the CPA so desires, submit financing
terms with their bids in order to make their bids eligible for consideration;
their bids would then be evaluated in conjunction with the financing terms;
and (ii) by the Government on-lending to the CPA the remaining foreign exchange
required. About $4.5 million is thus expected to come through suppliers'
credits and roughly anoither $4.5 million from the Government. The Government
is currently negotiating with a consortium of foreign commercial banks to



- 12 -
finance expenditures under its current Economic Development Plan, and prospects
appear bright that this will soon be successfully placed on Eurocurrency loan
terms. The Guarantor will then retain the option, with CPA's agreement, to
provide the full $9.0 million of foreign exchange required from this commercial
loan instead of as mentioned above.  In that case, the terms of on-lending to
CPA will have to be on terms acceptable to the Bank. As the CPA will not be
inviting bids for equipment for at least eighteen months, a condition of loan
effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 7.01) is that the Government should have
granted the CPA a loan to cover the foreign exchange gap. That loan may later
be reduced by the amount CPA subsequently gets through suppliers' credits.
Local costs will be borne by the CPA, from internally generated funds.
Procurement and Disbursements
40.       Procurement of all items financed by the Bank included in the pro-
posed project will be based on international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank guidelines. It is expected that one single contract will be awarded
for the main civil works (quays), to be financed by the Bank at Limassol. It
is unlikely that local contractors will submit tenders for these works. All
other works at both ports will most probably be won by local contractors,
either under separate contracts or as sub-contractors. Procurement of equip-
ment, none of which is to be financed by the Bank, will depend on sources of
financing. The tender documents for equipment could, if the CPA so desires,
stipulate that the financing terms should be provided by suppliers. The bid
evaluation would then include both the evaluation of the technical bid, as
well as the credit terms.
41.       Project execution started in October 1977, with the employment of
the engineering consultants.  Retroactive financing of up to $150,000 is rec-
ommended for these services.  Since engineering for civil works is expected
to be completed by April 1978, and construction completed by December 1981,
procurement of equipment will take place between 1978 and 1981. The manage-
ment consultants are expected to be selected by September 1978. The execution
of the project will be carefully monitored by using a critical path analysis
and learning from the experience of the first port project. The findings
contained in the Operations Evaluation Department's report on the first ports
project will be taken into account in the execution of the project. Disburse-
ments for all civil works included in the project for Bank financing will be
on the basis of 58 percent of the total costs for Limassol. Consultant
services, including technical assistance, will be reimbursed on the basis of
100 percent of the foreign expenditures. All other foreign expenditure and
100 percent of local expenditures will be financed by or through CPA.
Project Implementation
42.       CPA will be responsible for implementing the proposed project.  It
is competent to execute the project. CPA will have the technical support of
the Public Works Department of the Ministry of Communications and Works and
the assistance of the consultants for the preparation of engineering designs,
tender documents, evaluation of bids, monitoring or project execution (includ-
ing the critical path program) and supervision. The consultant engineers have



- 13 -
already been employed in accordance with Bank guidelines. The terms of refer-
ence for engaging the management and administration experts were discussed and
agreed during negotiations (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
43.       During the project implementation, CPA will also generate informa-
tion needed for it to prepare, in cooperation with the Bank staff, the Project
Completion Report, to be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after
the closing date of the loan (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04).
44.       The proposed project has no adverse environmental impact.  To safe-
guard against any such contingency CPA will study and make recommendations
for the prevention of pollution due to ships' wastes or spillages in the ports
under its jurisdiction by the end of December, 1978 (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01(b)).
Tariffs
45.       The tariff structure currently in effect is the same as that in
force prior to the establishment of CPA and charges are not cost-related,
although their level is sufficient to produce adequate revenues for the pre-
sent. CPA increased tariffs on August 1, 1976 and is currently considering
partial revision of the tariff structure. It is, however, essential for a
complete review to be undertaken with emphasis on cost-related charges and the
revaluation of assets to ensure that the benefits from the investment are
captured by Cyprus. A revised tariff structure should be introduced not later
than December 31, 1981 (Loan Agreement, Section 5.06). Consultant services
being provided under the loan will assist CPA in this task.
Financial Covenants
46.       While it is too early to formulate judgements on CPA's financial
performance, due to the short period of its existence, indications are that
the quality of financial management is good. Cash flow projections indicate
that CPA will be able to finance the local costs of the project from inter-
nally generated funds, and will have an operating ratio of around 41 percent
from 1978 to 1982. The rate of return on assets, adjusted to reflect current
replacement costs, would be 10 percent in 1978 and would fall to about 8 per-
cent in 1982. CPA is also expected to have ample coverage of interest charges
on its loans.
47.       To safeguard its financial position, CPA will (i) not incur any fur-
ther debt, without the agreement of the Bank, unless its net revenues for the
fiscal year preceding the date of such incurrence is not less than 1.5 times
the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding year (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.08); (ii) maiLntain its revenue at a level which will enable it to
generate a return on average revalued net fixed assets of 7 percent up to
1978, 8 percent from 1979 to 1981, and such rates thereafter as may be appro-
priate (Loan Agreement, Section 5.07).



- 14 -
Project Benefits and Risks
48.       The benefits from the project would result mainly from (i) savings
in ship-waiting time produced primarily by increased port capacity, (ii)
savings in ship-service time and handling costs brought about by the use
of new equipment and facilities. The new container crane provided under
the project may also serve to encourage the introduction of larger, more
efficient container ships thereby reducing shipping costs. A further benefit
would be improved safety and operational efficiency of handling passenger
movements within the ports through provision of new passenger facilities.
In assessing the benefits, however, only savings in ship-waiting time, and
only a portion of savings in ship-service time, have been quantified. Of
the project benefits that have been quantified, only the share accruing to
Cyprus has been taken into account for calculating the economic return from
the project, such as a reduction in the prices of imported goods and improved
net sales prices for Cypriot exports.
49.       For the purpose of economic evaluation, the project is assumed to
include the new quays to be built at Larnaca with resources to be provided by
the Government. On this basis, the economic rate of return for the project is
31 percent, even under the conservative assumptions made. The economic rate
of return was tested for its sensitivity to variations in the cost and benefit
parameters assuming (a) a 25 percent increase in costs and (b) a 25 percent
decline in benefits. The project would still yield a rate of return of 26
percent under assumption (a) and 24 percent under assumption (b). Under a
third assumption of a straight 25 percent reduction of traffic at Limassol and
Larnaca, the project would still yield an economic return of 23 percent.
50.       The proposed development of port facilities at Paphos (para 36)
could have some adverse impact on traffic volumes through Limassol/Larnaca,
particularly if it becomes operational prior to 1986 while adequate capacity
is already available to handle shipping requirements. However, Paphos is
unlikely to divert significant traffic from the existing port facilities;
the port would serve a relatively underdeveloped and agriculturally-oriented
hinterland comprising less than 10 percent of the Cypriot population and,
relative to the other ports, it would entail higher inland transport costs
for traffic destined for or originating from major consumption areas of
Crypus. (Traffic through the port would consist largely of agricultural
exports from the region and lesser amounts of general cargo. Traffic diverted
from Limassol/Larnaca would probably not exceed 150,000-200,000 tons annually.)
However the impact of the Paphos port development on the project has been
assessed under the conservative assumption that it becomes operational in 1983
with an initial capacity of about 400,000 tons annually, roughly equal to two
years' growth in Cypriot port traffic volume. On that basis, the economic
return of the project would be 26 percent.
51.       The justification of the project was also examined from the stand-
point of a political settlement and unification of the country whereby the
port of Famagusta would become available and the ports of Limassol and Larnaca
would serve the whole country. Assuming that the port of Famagusta becomes
available in 1981, when the proposed project would be completed, sensitivity



- 15 -
analysis still shows an economic return of 20 percent. Therefore, the project
is justified not only from the point of view of a satisfactory rate of return
in the context of the area controlled currently by the Government, but also in
the context of the island as a whole. It is also justified in terms of bene-
fits accruing to the island's economy in the form of employment opportunities
created, new technology and skills introduced into the country, lower prices
of imports to consumers, and potential for increasing foreign exchange earn-
ings because of price competitiveness of exports.
52.        In order to minimize risks, the projet takes into account the
political situation of the island, investment priorities, traffic growth, and
the experience of the first ports project outlined in the Operations Evaluation
Department's report.  The project provides for sufficient port facilities to
cope with forecast traffic up to 1983 at minimum cost, and accords with an
investment policy which minimizes risks since it allows for the possibility
that other ports might become available.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.        The draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and the
Bank, the draft Loan Agreement between the Cyprus Ports Authority and the Bank,
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreements conform generally to the normal pattern
for loans for port projects. Special conditions of the project are listed in
Section III of Annex III.
54.        A special condition of loan effectiveness is the effectiveness of
loans from other sources to meet the balance of the foreign exchange costs of
the project.
55.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

/1    Data up to July 1974 refer to the whole of Cyprus; data thereafter refer to southern Cyprus only and are therefore not
directly comparable with those for earlier years.
/2    Yearly information on private debt is not available.  However, total private medium and long-term  debt outstanding is very
small as a result of the 1974 events. Total short-term debt outstanding was $58 million at the end of 1976.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 729 - Nicosia Sewerage Project: US$2.7 million loan of April 5, 1971.
Effective Date:  July 16, 1971.  Closing Date:  (original) March 31, 1975;
(current) September 30, 1978.
The system was largely completed in July 1974 when construction was
interrupted. After prolonged negotiations, a mutually acceptable solution
was reached between the Turkish Cypriots and the Nicosia Sewage Board, and
provisional arrangements were agreed for the completion of the final stages of
the project. The Nicosia Sewage Board has prepared rough estimates covering
the remaining works. The Canadian consulting engineering firm is to send a
representative in mid-February 1978 to accurately identify the elements which
remain to be completed.
Loan No. 730 - Famagusta Sewerage Project: US$1.9 million loan of April 5,
1971. Effective Date: July 16, 1971. Closing Date: (original) March 31,
1975; (current) March 31, 1978.
The project was about 90 percent complete by July 1974, when con-
struction was interrupted. The project site lies completely in Famagusta,
which is under the control of the Turkish Cypriot administration. Completion
of this project therefore depends on a political settlement. Following the
visit of a UNDP representative in September 1977, the Famagusta Sewage Board
has requested the assistance of UNDP to initiate maintenance operations on
the equipment and machinery already installed. The Sewage Board is also
in the process of negotiating a solution to the outstanding claims of the
contractor, CYBARCO, Ltd. Under the circumstances, the current closing date
of March 31, 1978 will need another extension.
Loan No. 904 - First Highway Project: US$5.4 million loan of June 12, 1973.
Effective Date: September 12, 1973. Closing Date: (original) December 31,
1976; (current) December 31, 1979.
The construct:ion element of this Loan, a new four-lane divided
Nicosia-Morphou highway, was interrupted by the events of July/August 1974
shortly after its start in May 1974. The Bank has agreed to the Government's
request to a change of :Loan description that allows the use of up to US$3.6
million to make up the foreign exchange shortfall for the construction of
a new Nicosia-Limassol highway under the Second Highway Project, Loan 1344-
CY. Amendments to the Loan Agreement were concluded in 1977.
Loan No. 960 - Paphos Irrigation Project: US$14.0 million loan of January 30,
1974. Effective Date: October 10, 1975. Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Engineering of project works is nearing completion. Work on the
main canal including excavation and lining of canal and building of syphons,
bridges, culverts, and drop structures is progressing satisfactorily. Bids
for construction of Asprokremos Dam were opened December 15, 1977, and are
being reviewed. The contract award date for the Dam is set for March 16,
1978.  Estimated completion date for central office building is February, 1978.

Land consolidation is progressing satisfactorily with about 10% of the area
to be consolidated already completed. Cost overrun is estimated at about 34%,
but more accurate estimates will be possible following award of major con-
tracts on about March 16, 1978. Overall progress is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1278 - Second Cyprus Development Bank Project: US$6.0 million loan
of June 3, 1976. Effective Date: October 1, 1976. Closing Date: June 30,
1981.
Commitments and disbursements are more rapid than foreseen at the
time of the appraisal, reflecting the surging economic recovery in which CDB
is playing an active part. After organizational delays, commitments under the
$0.75 million small-scale industry (SSI) component of the loan began in 1977.
It is expected that the full amount of the loan, including the SSI component,
will be committed in 1978 and that disbursement will be completed well ahead
of the Closing Date. The management and expanding staff of CDB are capable
and have developed an excellent project appraisal and supervision capability.
The SSI work, after some start-up difficulties, is now also progressing
smoothly despite the increased emphasis in Cyprus on larger, more capital
intensive industries due to developing labor shortages.
Loan No. 1344 - Second Highway Project: US$10.0 million loan of December 31,
1976. Effective Date: October 11, 1977. Closing Date: April 30, 1982.
Bidding documents and grouping of contracts have been agreed with
the Government, and contracts are expected to be awarded in mid-1978. The
terms of reference for consultants to assist in supervising construction and
undertaking feasibility studies have also been agreed.
Loan No. 1483 - Pitsilia Integrated Rural Development Project: US$10.0
million loan of August 18, 1977. Effective Date: November 7, 1977. Closing
Date: June 30, 1983.
The Project Coordinator and his assistant have been designated.
Project Policy Committee (PPC) and Project Coordination Committee (PCC) have
been established. Project Management is actively recruiting appopriate con-
sultants to assist in the Study of Agricultural Investment Financing. Physical
execution of the Project is expected to begin as scheduled by March 1978.
