This report is based on information provided by the Cyprus Ports Authority,
on consultants' studies and on the findings of an appraisal mission in
September 1977 composed of Messrs. J. Burns (Senior Financial Analyst),
G. Unda (Engineer) and P. Nichols (Consultant Economist).



I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
1.01      Cyprus has an area of 9,251 km2, 64% being agricultural land of
which about four fifths is cultivated. The main geographical features of
the island are two east-west mountain ranges (Kyrenia and Troodos) which
cover about half its area, separated by a broad central plain. The foothills
of the mountain ranges and the central plain are the principal cultivated
areas. This configuration facilitates east-west transport but is an impedi-
ment to north-south transport.
1.02      The transportation system in Cyprus prior to the 1974 events was
reasonably balanced, comprising roads, ports, airports and a limited amount
of coastal shipping. The 1974 events, however, resulted in significant dis-
ruptions to the transport sector. There is little movement between the
southern and northern parts of the island, although this situation could
improve if and when an island-wide political situation is found.
1.03      Since the 1974 events, the Government has undertaken to improve
the essential parts of the transport system to make existing facilities to
serve the economic needs of the area it controls. With the closing of the
Nicosia Airport (it is now under United Nations control), the Government has
extended the airport runway at Larnaca to accommodate medium- and long-range
jet aircraft so as to reestablish international communications with southern
Cyprus.
1.04      As Cyprus has no railway system, highways are of critical importance.
The highway network radiates from the capital, Nicosia, to the main coastal
centers, Limassol and Larnaca, and to the hinterland. The total network of
national highways for the southern area makes up 1,472 km, about 90% of
which are paved and the remainder gravel-surfaced.
B. Transportation Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.05      The Planning Bureau centralized economic planning for the Government
integrating development plans for all sectors including transportation. The
events of 1974 interrupted implementation of the third Five-Year Plan (1972-76)
which has since been replaced by the first and second Emergency Economic Action
Plans (1975-76 and 1977-78). After the disruptions of 1974, the Government
concentrated on immediate transportation needs but it is now beginning to
focus on long-term planning.
1.06      The organization of the Transport Sector follows the pre-July 1974
framework. The Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW) through its
Departments of Public Works (PWD) and of Civil Aviation (DCA) is responsible
for main roads and airports, the Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA) for ports, and
the Ministry of Interior, the Forestry Department of the Mlinistry of Agri-
culture and the Municipalities for the remaining roads.



1.07      The Government regulates public passenger and freight transport
under the Motor Transport Regulation Law of 1974 as amended; the law is ad-
ministered by the semi-independent Licensing Authority and by the Licensing
Department in MCW. The Government controls fares and schedules for public
transport routes and imports of buses and trucks. These controls and regula-
tions are administered flexibly and there is competition in the industry.
C. The Ports and Port Planning (Map IBRD 13170R2)
1.08      Until July 1974, the main general cargo port in Cyprus was Famagusta;
in 1973 it handled over 80% of the total traffic passing through Cyprus ports.
Next in importance were the ports of Limassol and Larnaca both located on the
south coast, 55 miles and 23 miles from Nicosia. Two other ports, Paphos in
the southwest and Kyrenia on the north coast, handled onlj minimal amounts of
traffic.
1.09      There are also two privately-operated mineral exporting ports -
Karavostassi and Vassiliko/Zyyi; the first is on the northwest coast and
the latter on the south coast between Limassol and Larnaca. Oil imports are
handled at an offshore terminal at Larnaca.
1.10      As a result of the events of July 1974, general cargo ports of
Famagusta and Kyrenia and the mineral port of Karavostassi are under Turkish
control.  This led to the entire traffic for Cyprus being handled through
the ports of Limassol and Larnaca totalling some 2.3 million tons in 1976
compared with 1.8 million tons in 1973 (including Famagusta).
1.11      The ports of Limassol and Larnaca were developed during the period
1970-1974 (the former with Bank assistance) to provide berthage and equipment
sufficient to meet a forecast traffic demand of some 600,000 tons by 1978
(against 2.3 million tons handled in 1976).
1.12      These two ports are capable of considerable development beyond the
then planned capacity. Further studies for their expansion were undertaken in
1975 by Louis Berger, Inc. (USA) financed under the Highway Loan (904-CY) who
also examined in 1976 the feasibility of developing the port of Paphos.
1.13      The proposed project for the ports of Limassol and Larnaca is
intended to meet traffic demands until 1986/87. The Project also provides for
the continuation of institution building initiated in the first ports project
which was delayed by the events of 1974 and which is now more than ever essen-
tial to ensure that CPA's management and operational capabilities continue to
develop in keeping with the growth of the ports now and in the future. Further
investment in port facilities will be kept under review and the Government and
CPA have agreed not to undertake except with the Bank's agreement any major
investments in port facilities unless they are justified by all appropriate
financial and economic criteria. The proposed port developments at Paphos to
which the Government is already committed are exempted from these restrictions.

D. Previous Bank Group Transport Sector Operations in Cyprus
1.14      The proposed loan would be the fourth Bank Group operation for
transport in Cyprus and the second for ports; the first three operations were:
(i) A loan was made for ports in May 1969 (Loan 628-CY - US$11.5
million) and helped finance development of a new deep-water
port at Limassol. The project was completed in 1974. Due
to the hostilities, consultants' recommendations for improve-
ments in port administration, operations and accounting
procedures were not fully implemented.
(ii) Two loans were made for highways. The first of these approved
in May 1973 (Loan 904-CY - US$5.4 million), was to have been
used to help finance the construction of the Nicosia-Morphou
highway and access roads. As a result of the hostilities,
construction was interrupted in July 1974 after only one
month of work, and the Bank has agreed to the Government's
request for the reallocation of US$3.6 million to the second
project (Loan 1334-CY - US$10.0 million). This second loan
will contribute to the financing of a new Nicosia-Limassol
highway and became effective on October 11, 1977. The studies
required under the first loan were completed and training of
PWD staff is in progress.
II. THE PROJECT PORTS
A. General
2.01      The new ports at Limassol and Larnaca are well designed and have
achieved high throughputs of general cargo in 1976, 1,700 tons per meter
of quay at Limassol and 2,200 tons at Larnaca. The higher throughput at
Larnaca is due to the incidence of exports of potatoes and cement for which
X      the loading rates are high, the cargo being pre-slung or palletized.  These
ports are currently handling more than three times the volume of cargo anti-
cipated at the time of appraisal of first port project largely due to the
cooperation existing between the various agencies involved in port operations,
a decline in passenger traffic and the continuation of lighterage operations
at the old port of Limassol where a very satisfactory throughput of 1,000 per
meter of quay was achieved in 1976. In 1973 Famagusta achieved a throughput
of 1,300 tons per meter of quay. The Bank estimated a throughput of 900 tons
per meter of quay for the new port of Limassol when the first port project
was appraised in 1969.

B. Port Facilities at Limassol and Larnaca
Limassol - New Port (opened to traffic in June 1974)
2.02      The new port facilities consist of (i) a main and secondary break-
water with an entrance depth of 12.0 m, (ii) quays totalling 800 m in length
with an 11 m depth, (iii) transit sheds and produce-inspection sheds, (iv)
cargo-handling and floating equipment. The breakwaters offer good protection
against prevailing winds and port operations are only infrequently interrupted
by wave action stemming from northeasterly winds.
Limassol - Old Port
2.03      This is a small, shallow-draft breakwater harbor with two quays,
one of 160 m with a depth of 5 m and another of 100 m with a maximum depth of
3 m. There are two transit sheds, open space storage and some cargo-handling
equipment.
Larnaca - New Port (opened to traffic in June 1973)
2.04      The new port facilities consist of (i) a main and secondary break-
water with an entrance depth of 9.5 m, (ii) two berths with a total length of
326 m, (iii) transit sheds, and (iv) cargo-handling and floating equipment.
In July 1977, floating pontoons became operational and added over 60% to
existing capacity by providing a further 200 m of quay.
Traffic
2.05      In 1976, the total number of commercial vessels calling at Limassol
and Larnaca was 3,170 of which 2,510 were general cargo ships, 364 container
and roll-on/roll-off vessels. In addition, 219 passenger ships called at
Limassol including cruise liners. Many of the cargo ships were small, which
is a feature of the Eastern Mediterranean trade, averaging 2,900 dwt and 85 m
length per ship. Total traffic at the project ports was 2.3 million tons in
1976, 1.6 million at Limassol, and 0.7 million tons at Larnaca. General cargo
accounted for 35%; cement exports; 30%; grain imports, 7%; agricultural prod-
ucts exports, 13%; and transit cargo, 13%. Container and roll-on/roll-off
traffic is developing rapidly; 17,000 containers were handled in 1976.
2.06      Traffic projections have been made in detail up to 1985; general
cargo is expected to increase from 793,000 tons in 1976 to 2.1 million tons
in 1985; cement exports tc remain stable at 690,000 tons. Fertilizer imports
will be replaced by exports once the new fertilizer plant comes into opera-
tion. Traffic projections are summarized below and additional details are
given in Chapter IV and in Project Files.

C. Port Administration
The Cyprus Ports Authority (The Borrower)
2.07      The Cyprus Ports Organization Law No. 38 of 1973 established the
Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA) as a body corporate governed by this law to manage
and exploit the ports in the Republic and to undertake and manage the existing
ports with all their assets and liabilities. The Authority is managed and
acts through a Board of seven members consisting of a chairman, vice chairman
and four members appointed by the Council of Ministers and the Director of
the Department of Customs (ex-officio). The day-to-day management of CPA and
implementation of Board decisions is carried out by the General Manager, who
is appointed by the Council of Ministers in consultation with the Board. By
law, CPA is empowered to: (i) regulate and control port operations and
provide navigational services and (ii) levy dues and charges for the use of
the ports and their installations. CPA also (i) operates as a commercial
entity, (ii) can own, acquire, rent and lease property, and (iii) has
authority to borrow from the Government or other sources. The legislation
is adequate for the purposes of the project and for lending operations.



-6-
2.08      CPA is resporsible for cargo storage but does not undertake cargo
handling on ship or on shore, the stevedores and shore cargo-handling workers
being engaged by the shipping agents or licensed porters acting for the
shippers. Section 30 of the CPO Law of 1973 provides for the regulation of
these services by CPA and for the issue of licenses to and the control of
charges levied by the Licensed Porters.
Organization and Management
2.09      CPA's management structure at present comprises the General Manager,
the Finance Manager, the Operations Manager and the Administration Manager.
2.10      Due to the events of 1974, considerable delay was experienced in
setting up the management structure. The General Manager was not appointed
until December 1975; the appointments of the Finance and Administration
Managers were confirmed only in 1977. A serious gap in the management struc-
ture is the absence of an Operations Manager and CPA has undertaken to fill
this position on or before August 31, 1978. The various personnel at the
ports, previously under the control of the Ports Department of the Ministry of
Communications and Works and the Customs Department, were transferred on
October 1, 1977. It is therefore premature to formulate any judgment on the
management's overall performance. However, the operational efficiency of the
ports at Limassol and Larnaca is a tribute to the ability of the personnel at
the ports. The cooperation which has existed between them and the shipping
agents, stevedores and licensed porters and labor unions has overcome the
considerable difficulties in moving cargo more than three times that antici-
pated by traffic forecasts.
2.11      The composition of CPA's staff is as follows:
General Manager's Department        2
Finance Department                 12
Administration Department          18
Operations Department             211 (of which 155 at Limassol,
56 at Larnaca)
Further appointments to be made include the creation of a Technical Services
Unit (which is discussed under para 2.14 on Maintenance) and an Internal Audit
Section. It is essential that the Technical Services Unit be formed as soon
as possible and CPA has agreed to establish such a unit not later than
December 31, 1978.
2.12      Provision therefor has been made in the proposed project for consul-
tancy services to strengthen CPA's capabilities in management and operational
procedures and undertake the required training.
Pquipment and Maintenance
2.13      Forklift trucks are owned and operated by the licensed porters'who
are responsible for their maintenance. Maintenance of facilities and other
equipment is at present carried out by the Public Works Department.



-7-
2.14      The Technical Services Unit referred to.in para 2.11 will be respon-
sible for the maintenance and repair of all property, equipment, machinery and
other facilities, and the project includes provision of fully-equipped work-
shops at the ports to ensure adequate and efficient maintenance (para 3.17).
The licensed porters have indicated that they would prefer CPA facilities
which would be more suitable for their maintenance requirements.
D. Operations
2.15      In 1976, some port congestion was experienced and this continued
into 1977.  Ships' waiting time in 1976 was 2,600 days and the conference
lines imposed congestion surcharges (paras 4.18 and 4.23). If required, the
ports now operate up to 14 hours a day through the introduction of the extra
shift, 1700 hours to 2300 hours, the decision to work the extra shift being
that of CPA, not of the shipping agents. It is anticipated that this over-
time shift will be extended to a full second shift of eight hours in 1978.
The feasibility of introducing a third shift was discussed during negotia-
tions (para. 3.10). Relations between employers and employees are good and
no serious labor disputes have occurred.
2.16      The very satisfactory cargo-handling performance under difficult
conditions in 1976 is borne out by the following indicators: general cargo,
tons per gang hour, 12.to 15 tons, 25/31 tons for palletized cargo, 38/50 tons
for bagged cargo, 39 tons for roll-on/roll-off, 7/10 units for containers
(handled by floating crane) and 165 tons for grain. Container handling and
roll-on/roll-off performance will be much improved by facilities proposed in
the project.
E. Finance, Accounts and Audit
General
2.17      CPA's accounting system is based on the recommendations of the con-
sultants appointed under the first Bank loan, suitably updated. Depreciation
rates are adequate; assets for Limassol and Larnaca are on a cost basis; those
for other ports were revalued on a replacement cost basis as at July 1, 1971.
CPA will revalue assets from time to time on a replacement cost basis in
accordance with the covenants in Loan Agreement 628-CY and the CPO Law of 1973.
2.18      CPA's revenues are mainly derived from dues on ships (28%), cargo
(55%) and storage (15%). Some additional revenue is derived from renting
premises to port users.
2.19      The annual revenues after meeting operating expenses including
depreciation are applied to provide for:



-8-
(i) loan amortization;
(ii) replacement of assets;
(iii) working capital; and
(iv) reserves for improvement and development of port facilities.
The Council of Ministers may, after due consideration of CPA's investment
plans, give directions as to the payment of the remaining surplus.
2.20      CPA's annual budget for current and capital expenditures is sub-
mitted to the Council of Ministers for approval.
2.21      CPA's accounts will be audited by the Auditor General of the
Republic.  CPA is considering the employment of additional auditors to meet
commercial audit requirements.  Since 1977 will be the first full year for
which audited accounts will be available, the Bank can only make the general
observation that the Auditor General is acceptable as an independent auditor
but would welcome the appointment of more commercially-oriented auditors.
2.22      CPA is required by law to submit not later than June 30 in any year
to the Minister of Communications and Works an annual report on the discharge
of its functions and the policy and program followed by it. The annual report
will include a copy of the audited accounts.
Insurance
2.23      The CPA Law of 1973 provides that CPA shall be insured against all
losses of or damage to any vessel, property or goods entering, leaving, re-
maining or stored in the precincts under its control caused by CPA personnel
or equipment. CPA will make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for cover-
age of these and other risks in accordance with appropriate port practice.
Tariffs
2.24      As provided in the first ports project, a satisfactory accounting
system was introduced but the consultants' proposals on tariffs were not im-
plemented. Dues and charges continue to be levied on the same basis as
formerly, i.e., before CPA was established and are not directly related to
the cost of providing services.  Costing information as such does not yet
exist and it may be that CPA operates at a loss on berthage and pilotage.
However, CPA has so far generated revenues sufficient to ensure a reasonable
return on net fixed assets in operation in accordance with Loan Agreement
628-CY.
2.25      At present, the principal charges for port services are as follow:
1.   Harbor Entry Dues             30 mils per NRT up to 800 NRT
15 mils thereafter
2.   Berthage                      12 mils per NRT per day with a 25%
reduction for export vessels



- 9 -
3.   Pilotage including use of tugs is levied on an NRT basis on
entry and departure with a 25% reduction for export vessels.
4.   Wharfage Dues
On imports range from 200 mils to 2,400 mils per 1,000 kg
On exports range from 10 mils to 300 mils per 1,000 kg
5.   There are also charges for the use of cranes, for warehousing
and overtime working. The full range of tariffs is detailed
in Project Files.
2.26      In order to develop cost related charges so far as possible, the
tariff structure will be reviewed by CPA with the assistance of consultants as
necessary to enable such charges to be introduced by December 31, 1981.  CPA is
presently considering changing the basis of assessing berthage to per meter of
ship's length per day or part thereof from NRT per day as recommended by the
Bank under the first loan.
2.27      Overtime charges, for mooring vessels and the use of equipment,
levied by CPA in 1977 are estimated to produce a revenue of LC 352,000
against a cost of LC 185,000 which could be regarded as having the effect
of a congestion surcharge on port users.
III. THE INVESTMENT PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A. The Port Investment Program
3.01      Long-term development planning was disrupted by the events of 1974.
Although the Government is still implementing the second Emergency Economic
Action Plan (1977-1978), more attention is now being given to long-term
planning (see para 1.05). CPA, based on a review of master plans and of
feasibility studies by Louis Berger International (LBI) (USA), for the
expansion of the ports of Limassol and Larnaca, has prepared a ports invest-
ment program for the period 1978-1982.
3.02      As agreed with CPA the program has been divided into two parts:
Part A consisting of the proposed project which will proceed as scheduled and
which amounts to 64% of the total, and Part B whose execution will depend on
financial resources being available.
3.03      The principal elements in the program are:

3.04      A 30,000-ton capacity grain silo presently being constructed
at Limassol, is complementary to the proposed project. The silo is due for
completion in 1979, and its cost is being borne by the Grain Commission,
which is the Government Agency responsible for the importation and distribu-
tion of grain in Cyprus.
B. Project Objectives, Dimensions and Timing
Objectives
3.05      The main objective of the project is to relieve present and antic-
ipated congestion at the project ports and to accommodate future traffic; in
1976 ship-waiting time was about 2600 days with an average berth occupancy
of 88%. Specialized berths, adequate cargo handling equipment and sufficient
open and covered storage areas will improve cargo handling operations and
throughput capacity of the ports. Improved management, proper port mainte-
nance and training of port personnel will increase operational efficiency.
The project will complement the improvements being carried out to the Nicosia-
Limassol highway, financed by the Bank's second highway loan and ensure that
the benefits stemming from this project are fully achieved.



- 11 -
Dimensions
3.06      The scope of the project has been determined taking into account
the political situation, investment priorities and traffic growth. Without
investment restrictions, a more ambitious project might have been proposed.
However the proposed project provides for sufficient port facilities to cope
with forecast traffic up to 1983 at minimum cost, i.e. it is the least cost
solution and accords with an investment policy which minimizes risks since
it allows more time for development of traffic trends and the possibility
that the port of Famagusta might become available.
Timing
3.07      Although berthing capacity at Larnaca has been expanded about 60%
with the acquisition of floating pontoons which commenced operations in
July 1977, that development represents an increase of only 14% in overall port
capacity and can only serve to postpone serious congestion in the short
term.
3.08      The throughput of the ports of Limassol and Larnaca has also been
increased by 21% through overtime working as discussed in para 2.15 above.
This throughput could be increased by a further 15% if the present level of
overtime working is extended into a second full shift.
3.09      From 1979, the two ports will likely incur increasingly severe
congestion even with the implementation of the second full shift. It is
estimated that the proposed project will be completed two to three years late
relative to its optimum timing and this is reflected in the high rates of
return shown for the project in the economic analysis.
3.10      The feasibility of introducing a third shift was discussed during
negotiations as throughput could be increased by a further 25 to 30%. While
a third shift is already worked for special cargoes e.g. grain, its intro-
duction presents operational difficulties. CPA has however agreed to keep the
possibility of introducing a third shift under review.
C. Project Description (Maps IBRD 13171R1 and 13172R2)
3.11      The project consists of:
Civil Works
Limassol: (a)  Construction of about 480 m of quay, with a depth of
11 m, including two berths for container vessels, one for
passenger ships and a Roll-on/Roll-off ramp.
(b)  Paving and surfacing roads, open storage and parking areas.
(c)  Construction of transit sheds and warehouses.



- 12 -
(d) Construction of passenger terminal, port administration
and ancillary buildings.
(e) Provision of utilities including inter alia water supply,
electricity, drainage, sewerage, etc.
Larnaca:  (a)  Construction of a transit shed.
(b) Paving and surfacing open storage and parking areas.
(c) Construction of baggage hall and port administration
and ancillary buildings.
(d) Utilities (water supply, electricity, drainage,
sewerage, etc.).
Equipment
Limassol: (a)  Cargo handling (mobile cranes) and container handling
equipment and workshop equipment.
Larnaca:  (b)  Cargo handling equipment (mobile cranes) and workshop
equipment.
Technical Assistance
(a) Consulting services for engineering design and super-
vision of civil works.
(b) Additional site investigations as may be required for
the preparation of (a) above.
(c) Consulting services to assist CPA on management,
operational and technical policies and procedures.
(d) Training of CPA personnel and port workers.
D. Engineering Evaluation
General
3.12      In evaluating the project, the following general considerations were
taken into account:
(i) all technical data required for final design is either
available or will be satisfactorily produced to enable
consultants to prepare a final design;



- 13 -
(ii) final design and cost estimates are realistically,
based on availability of materials and labor, and in
accordance with soil conditions;
(iii) maintenance of productivity levels through the pro-
vision of adequate port equipment and proper mainte-
nance and repair facilities;
(iv) the necessary technical support required for the imple-
mentation of the project.
Engineering
3.13      Limassol port expansion is based on a master plan study by Rendel,
Palmer and Tritton (RPT), (UK), later revised by LBI. The proposed project
consists mainly of the construction of new berths within the existing lee
breakwater, and will be fully protected against wave action. The addi-
tional length of berths (480 m) to be built is sufficient to cope with
traffic forecast up to 1983 (see Chapter IV) and its alignment as modified
by CPA, PWD and Coode and Partners (CP), (UK), was agreed by the Bank as
it permits the reclamation of the necessary backup areas which could be
further extended at a low cost when required.
Technical Data
3.14      Previous soils borings and hydraulic studies show that the site has
suitable soil conditions and enough protection against wave action. CPA will
carry out additional soil investigations to confirm the above. Design live
loads, berthing forces, container crane wheel-loads and any other technical
data are to be defined by the consultants taking into account that only 360 m
out of the total length of 480 m of quays will be designed for container
operations.
Design and Supervision
3.15      CP, consulting engineers, have been appointed to prepare engineering
design and tender documents and to supervise construction of main civil works.
Local consultants, yet to be appointed and satisfactory to the Bank, will
prepare the buildings design. CPA has entered into an agreement with PWD for
the provision of adequate technical support during the implementation of the
project, including site investigations. Soil boring should be supervised by
CP as PWD has the equipment and personnel but little experience in underwater
soil investigation.
3.16      General engineering criteria are as follows:
(i) Berths at Limassol: The 480 m long berths will be designed
to a depth of 11 m and the type of construction will be
defined in the light of soil investigations. A ramp for
Roll-on/Roll-off vessels will be built at the northeast
corner. The passenger terminal building will be located
at the southern end of the berths.



- 14 -
(ii) Paving
At Limassol:  About 200,000 m2 as follows:
(a)  about 130,000 m2 for a container stacking area and
Roll-on/Roll-off trailers' parking to cope with
forecast traffic of about 69,000 containers in 1985;
(b) about 50,000 m2 of open storage area at the back of
northern quays, i.e. about 120 m2 per linear meter
of quay;
(c) about 20,000 m2 of parking areas and access road to
the passenger terminal; and
(d) about 10,000 m2 of roads and parking areas of adminis-
tration buildings, workshops, etc.
At Larnaca: About 60,000 m2, as follows:
(e) about 50,000 m2 of open storage area for general cargo,
i.e. 147 m2 per linear meter of berth (exclusive of
floating pontoons); and
(f) about 10,000 m2 of roads and parking areas.
(iii) Covered Storage
At Limassol: About 30,000 m2, as follows:
(a) about 10,000 m2 of transit sheds on the northern quays
backup area, thal: added to existing sheds will total
26,800 m2, i.e. 34 m2 per linear meter of quay;
(b) about 10,000 m2 of consolidation shed for stuffing and
unstuffing containers;
(c) about 10,000 m2 of warehousing space.
At Larnaca:
(d) a transit shed of about 6,000 m2 to serve the floating
pontoons, i.e. 30 m2 per linear meter or berth.
Equipment
3.17      To maintain some productivity levels and improve others, equipment
needs and maintenance requirements were also evaluated as follows:



- 15 -
(a)  Container handling equipment at Limassol will consist of a
40-ton container crane and two straddle carriers; this equip-
ment will be able to double the present productivity obtained
with a 35-ton level luffing crane; there is also a 60-ton
floating crane at Limassol that is temporarily on loan to CPA
by the Greek Government and will eventually be returned to
Greece;
(b) Mobile cranes will replace old ones at Limassol and will
equip Larnaca to handle general cargo;
(c) Ports workshop equipment. To repair and maintain port equip-
ment, CPA presently depends largely on PWD's workshops which
are located some distance away from the port areas.  PWD owns
a considerably large amount of equipment, port equipment
usually is not given priority. There are two possibilities
either to increase PWD's maintenance capability or to provide
separate facilities for the ports. On balance the latter is
the better solution. The provision of ports workshops will
improve maintenance and repair and consequently contribute
to improving cargo handling productivity levels at the ports.
CPA is, therefore, setting up a Technical Services Unit, which
will, inter alia, be responsible for port equipment maintenance.
Consultancy Services
3.18      The technical support required for the implementation of the project
was discussed with CPA as follows:
(a) Engineering design and supervision as described in para 3.15.
To ensure the completion of institutional reforms envisaged in the
first port project, whose introduction has been delayed:
(b) Experts in the administration and operation of ports to advise
and assist CPA:
(i) on management, operational and technical policies and
procedures,
(ii) in establishing cost based tariffs and the revaluation
of assets, and
(iii) in providing vocational training programs either inside
or outside CPA for CPA personnel and port workers.
The consultants recommendations under (b) will be submitted to the Bank
for review and comment prior to action thereon by CPA.

Bill of Quantities and Cost Estimate Criteria
3.19      Cost estimates reflect the availability of local construction
materials and labor, and also the fact that local contractors are unlikely to
undertake the construction of main civil works as they lack the construction
equipment and the experience required. Bills of quantities were computed
based on preliminary engineering and construction equipment rates are based
on actual productivity during construction of existing port facilities.
3.20      Percentages of foreign exchange currency expenditures were deter-
mined following the Bank's guidelines and based on data from the previous
Bank financed port project at Limassol.
E. Cost Estimates
3.21      The total cost of the project is estimated at LC 11.8 million or
US$29.5 million equivalent. The foreign exchange component is US$17.4 mil-
lion (about 59%). Cost estimates were reviewed and agreed with CPA at nego-
tiations; contingencies have been adjusted in accordance with the project
execution program. A summary is given below:

For civil works               9% p.a.    8% p.a.
For equipment                 7.5% p.a.  7% p.a.
Cost estimates of civil works are based on the feasibility study prepared by
LBI in 1976 and on prices given by the PWD resulting from updating those of
previous contracts for similar works. They reflect estimated 1978 prices.



- 18 -
Equipment costs are based on quotations from foreign suppliers at the end of
1976 updated to reflect current prices. Costs of consultant's services are
based on estimated required manpower which amounts to about 180 man-months of
experts and about 200 man-months of technicians at the rates of US$5,000/month
and US$3,000/month respectively.
3.22      An average contingency of 14.2% of total project cost,,including
physical contingencies but excluding the cost of technical assistance, has
been allowed for expected cost increases (see footnotes to the cost estimates
under 3.21 for details).
3.23      Cost estimates do not include any taxes, fees or duties on plant,
vehicles, equipment or materials imported for use by or for CPA, since CPA is
exempted from payment of such taxes, fees or duties by Clause 28(a) of CPA
Law of 1973.
3.24      An analysis of the costs of delays in project execution has been
conducted. It shows that a delay of six months would increase the project
costs by about US$1.1 million and a delay of one year by US$2.3 million.
F. Financing Plan
Bank Loan
3.25      The proposed Bank loan of US$8.5 million will contribute towards
the foreign exchange of the following project elements to the extent stated:
US$ million
Port of Limassol:
Construction of quays, utilities,
roads and paving                                           5.8
Technical assistance                                         1.2

3.27      The Bank loan will be to CPA on standard Bank terms at 7.45% interest
for a period of 15 years including 3 years of grace.



- 19 -
3.28      The CPA Law of 1973, Clause 12(i), gives CPA the power to secure
loans from the Government or other sources on terms and conditions as may
be approved by the Government. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan will be the completion of satisfactory agreements regarding the pro-
vision of funds by or through the Government sufficient to meet the balance
of the foreign exchange costs not covered by the Bank loan. It is expected
that local currency costs to the extent stated above (para 3.26) will be
financed from CPA's internally generated funds. The Government has guar-
anteed cost overruns.
G. Project Execution, Supervision and Reporting
3.29      The CPA is competent to execute the project with the technical
support of PWD and the assistance of consultants for (i) preparation of
engineering design, tender documents and evaluation of tenders of civil
works, (ii) monitoring project execution including the critical path program
and (iii) supervision of construction. The consulting engineers have been
employed in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. The terms of reference
for management and administration consultant services were discussed and
agreed during negotiations.
3.30      The critical path program for project execution was discussed and
reviewed with CPA during negotiations. The implementation schedule is as
follows:
1. Main Civil Works
Selection of consultants                   October 1977

Consultants for management and administration and revaluation of assets will
be recruited as required not later than December 31, 1978. Training programs
will be implemented from 1979 to 1980. The planning allows for a period of
about one year for engineering design and procurement procedures. The project
is expected to be completed by the end of December, 1981 and the loan would be
closed on June 30, 1982.

3.31      Monitoring the project and interface for relations with the Bank will
be carried out directly by CPA with the assistance of PWD and the consultants.
CPA will also prepare quarterly progress reports which shall include engineer-
ing, procurement, progress of construction and consultancy services, traffic
statistics, financial statements and disbursement schedule, port efficiency
indicators and critical path program. Copies of these reports, the format of
which was agreed with CPA during negotiations, will be sent to the Bank.
3.32      During the project implementation, CPA will generate the information
needed for CPA in cooperation with the Bank staff to produce the project com-
pletion report (PCR) which should be submitted to the Bank not later than 6
months after the loan closing date. This matter was discussed and agreed
wtih CPA during negotiations.
H. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.33      Procurement of items financed by the Bank will be done on the basis
of international competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines.
3.34      It is expected that one single contract will be awarded for main
civil works to be financed by the Bank at Limassol; it is unlikely that local
contractors will be qualified to submit tenders for these main works. All
other civil works at Limassol most probably will be undertaken by local con-
tractors either under separate contracts or as subcontractors to the main
civil works contractor. Procurement of equipment and civil works at Larnaca,
none of which is to be financed by the Bank, will depend on the sources of
financing. Project components proposed for Bank financing was discussed
and agreed with CPA during negotiations.
Disbursement
3.35      Disbursements for civil works (quays, utilities, roads and paving)
at Limassol will be on the basis of 58Z of the total cost. Technical assist-
ance will be reimbursed on the basis of 100% of foreign expenditures; all
local expenditures will be financed by CPA. The tentative schedule of dis-
bursements of the Bank loan which was discussed with CPA during negotiations,
is as follows:

Retroactive financing may be necessary, up to US$150,000 from October 1, 1977
for consulting engineering services.
I. Environmental Impact
3.36      Existing environment is likely to be improved as the project
includes some favorable additional elements, i.e. the provision of welfare
and sanitary facilities for port workers. CPA will also examine the steps
to be taken to deal with pollution due to ships wastes and/or spillages in
the ports under its jurisdiction and will submit not later than December 31,
1978 its recommendations to the Bank for review and comment prior to taking
any action.



- 22 -
J. Impact on Employment
3.37      The combination of traffic growth and implementation of a second
shift will require an estimated 300 additional stevedores and porters by 1981
and a further 150-200 by 1985. Displaced Famagusta port workers (about 250),
who are now under-employed, can be readily absorbed into the port labor over
the next three years.
3.38      The provision of additional cargo-handling equipment and ports
workshops will also require additional labor, as at present, equipment main-
tenance is not done by the ports but contracted outside (PWD and/or private
workshops). An estimated 25-30 skilled workers will be required.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01      The first ports project in Cyprus was completed in 1974 and, in
retrospect, it can be seen that the traffic increases and the capacity of
the ports were considerably underestimated. It therefore appears that the
scope of the first project was too limited. The project now proposed is in
essence a follow-up to the first and has been defined bearing in mind invest-
ment needs in other transport subsectors and other key economic sectors.
4.02      For the purposes of the economic evaluation, the project is defined
to include the new quays at Larnaca, as well as the Bank project (para 3.11),
which are expected to be developed simultaneously if financial resources are
available. The proposed project is fully Justified as borne out by the
satisfactory rate of return and the urgent need to expand port capacity to
meet forecast traffic demand. In addition to normal sensitivity analyses,
the project has also been evaluated under the assumption that a port is
constructed at Paphos (para 1.13) and, alternatively, that port capacity at
Famagusta becomes available as a consequence of political settlements on the
island. The economic return to the project remains acceptable under these
circumstances.
B. Traffic Analysis
Recent Developments and Future Prospects
4.03      Virtually all Cypriot foreign trade passes through its ports:  air
.freight accounts for less than 1% of total cargo movements. Bulk mineral
exports and petroleum imports, which comprise 30% of total traffic, move
through specialized port terminals. The remaining trade is handled by
Limassol and Larnaca ports.



- 23 -
4.04      In spite of the severe economic setbacks suffered by Cyprus during
1974, total port traffic by 1976 had again reached 1973 levels of 3.3 million
tons. Cargo handled by the two general cargo ports totaled 2.3 million tons,
compared to a combined total of 1.8 million tons for Famagusta/ Limassol/
Larnaca in 1973. The recovery of trade volume is attributable to the rapid
economic growth achieved since 1975, as well as to a number of special factors,
which prompted a significant increase in the shipment of agricultural products
to Western Europe and in exports to Lebanon and the Middle East generally.
4.05      Macroeconomic projections for Cyprus assume a continuing high, but
declining, rate of economic growth over the next five years. Real GDP growth
of 8-1/2% per annum is expected in 1977/78, slowing to a level of about 5%
per annum after 1980. The foreign trade sector should demonstrate particular
strength: export-import values, in constant prices, are likely to increase by
20% in 1977 with a further growth over the next five years of about 10% per
annum and 7% per annum for exports and imports, respectively. Exports of
manufactured goods and imports of non-fuel raw materials and capital goods
will lead this trade expansion, and accordingly, an important share of traffic
growth will be concentrated in the general cargo ports.
Traffic Projections, 1977-85
4.06      The traffic projections discussed in the following sections are
based on the above macroeconomic assumptions. However, a number of factors
may intervene to affect the actual performance of the economy. Various
sensitivity analyses (para 4.27) have, therefore, been applied to assess the
impact of possible adverse variations in the projected economic growth;
these confirm that the project remains economically justified in these cir-
cumstances.
4.07      Traffic expected through Limassol and Larnaca ports has been pro-
jected to 1985. The methodology followed is presented in para 4.10. The
traffic estimates project growth in the two ports' total volume from 2.3 m
tons in 1976 to 4.1 m tons in 1985. General cargo traffic will account for
three quarters of the increase with agricultural exports and grain imports
responsible for much of the remainder. The number of ships calling at the
project ports is likely to increase at a somewhat slower rate (3,200 in
1976 to 5,200 in 1985) reflecting a general increase in the size of vessels,
particularly in the case of container and grain ships.
4.08      Traffic projections for Limassol and Larnaca as well as the other
bulk-handling port facilities in Cyprus are summarized below:

- 25 -
Basis for the Traffic Projlections
4.09      The traffic projections presented above were prepared on the fol-
lowing basis:
(a) Cement. Exports of bagged cement accounted for 30% of
total cargo volume at Limassol and Larnaca in 1976. The
cement industry, which is predominantly export-oriented,
was expanded by one third during 1976 and has benefited
from buoyant market conditions in the Middle East.
Although there is scope for further expansion in manu-
facturing and export capability (existing facilities are
operating at 80% capacity and further plant expansion is
a possibility) neither government nor industry officials
forecast significant export growth in the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, traffic projections assume constant
annual export volume at 1976 levels of about 690,000 tons.
It is possible that Middle East developments in terms
of market demand or competition could adversely affect
cement exports from Cyprus in an intermediate to long-term
period; the effect of this eventuality on the project has
been considered under the sensitivity analyses discussed
later in para 4.27.
(b) Fertilizer. Cyprus is at present an importer of fertilizers
and will remain so until completion of a domestic fertilizer
plant in 1979. The new facility is planned to meet local
requirements and to export as much as 100,000 tons per year
abroad. Raw material requirements of phosphate rock and
ammonia as well as most export shipments will be accommodated
by private loading and unloading facilities at Vassiliko and
will not affect traffic through Limassol or Larnaca. The
traffic forecasts assume that beyond satisfying local
requirements estimated at 60,000 tons in 1981, the new
plant will export 75,000 tons annually of which one third
will move through Larnaca port.
(c)  Minerals.  Based on information obtained from the Cyprus
Planning Bureau, exports of metallic and non-metallic
minerals are assumed to decline by 5% per annum to 1981,
remaining stable thereafter. The drop in shipments
reflects the continued depletion in reserves of operating
mines. Over the intermediate to long-term horizon the
development of new mineral reserves is expected to offset
further export reductions.
(d) Agricultural Products. Under favorable production and
marketing conditions, exports of agricultural products
increased dramatically in 1976--by about 60% in volume
terms--and are expected to grow by a further 30% in 1977.



- 26 -
Government planners anticipate relatively modest growth
in foreign sales over the next five years, until agricul-
tural projects now under development enhance production
capability. The value of these exports is projected to
increase by 4% per annum to 1980, rising to 6% annually
in the early 1980's. Growth in export volume will be some-
what less. Potato shipments, which comprise one half of
the total volume of agricultural exports, are assumed to
remain stable at present levels, with citrus, grapes, wine
and various vegetables and fruits accounting for all
export growth in this sector.
(e) Foodgrains. Bulk maovements of imported foodgrains are
expected to increase to meet the growing gap between
domestic production and consumption, and traffic volume
is assumed to expand at a rate equivalent to real GDP
growth.
(f)  General Cargo.  For exports of general cargo items, traf-
fic estimates are premised upon a rapid growth of the
Cypriot manufacturing sector over the next decade, as
projected by the Bank and the Cyprus Planning Bureau.
This rapid growth is considered attainable in the light
of the economic performance in Cyprus since 1975 and the
industrial developments underway. The shipment of manu-
factured goods, in constant value terms, is expected to
grow by 20% in 1977, declining to 10% per annum by 1981
and to a slightly lower rate thereafter. These rates
of growth are assumed to equate roughly to growth in
physical volume. Imports will likely grow more slowly
than exports, reflecting the high emphasis on import-
substitution and the export of local production within
the industrial sector, as well as the effect of policies
to discourage consumption of imported foodstuffs and
consumables. Growth in the manufacturing sector should,
however, induce a fairly rapid increase in imports of
capital goods and raw material intermediates, such as
iron and steel, paper and paperboard products. Imports
of other general cargo items are estimated to grow in
volume by approximately 7% per year from 1977-1985.
(g)  Transit Cargo.  TraEfic in transit cargoes at Limassol
and Larnaca ports increased substantially during 1976,
largely in response to political disturbances in Lebanon
and to congestion problems at various Middle Eastern
ports. Although Cyprus is favorably located geographically
to attract transit traffic between Europe and the Middle
East, the potential market for these cargoes is uncertain
in the light of new port developments in the Middle East;
furthermore, the desirability of attracting this traffic



- 27 -
is questionable, particularly in the absence of under-
utilized port capacity in Cyprus. Transit traffic has
been assumed to grow by 3% per annum to 1985.
4.10      The proportion of general cargo and transit traffic which is
expected to be containerized or otherwise carried in specialized Roll-on/Roll-
off vessels is forecast to increase from the present 13% to 32% by 1985. This
implies that about one half of containerizable general cargo will be carried
in containers. The number of full containers is estimated on the basis of the
current average revenue tons per container, and a proportional factor has been
applied to estimate the number of empty containers. The total number of
containers handled (including empties) is expected to increase from 17,000 in
1976 to almost 69,000 by 1985.
Distribution of Traffic
4.11      The present distribution of traffic as between Limassol and Larnaca
is approximately as follows:
Limassol     Larnaca
Cement                                      50           50
Potatoes                                     -          100
Other Agricultural Products                 90           10
Grain                                      100            -
Other (General Cargo)                       80           20
For traffic items other than general cargo, the present distribution, which
generally is based on comparative inland transportation and handling costs
through the two ports or on the availability of specialized facilities, will
likely continue in the future. Containerized general cargo trade will be
concentrated at Limassol with the provision there of container-handling
equipment and special berths. With a road distance of only 44 miles between
the two ports, relative inland transport costs are not a major factor deter-
mining the port-wise distribution of general cargo traffic. Rather, the
greater availability of port facilities and related shipping services at
Limassol has favored that port and heavy shipping during the potato season
can disrupt general cargo traffic at Larnaca. As facilities are improved at
Larnaca, it is expected that the relative use of that port for conventional
general cargo traffic will increase, and that ships will be directed to either
port in such a way as to minimize waiting time and possible congestion.
4.12      The traffic projections for the two ports are summarized below:
1976 (act.)    1977    1979    1981    1983    1985
('000 tons)
Limassol         1,606        1,810   2,010   2,210   2,610   2,820
Larnaca            718          885   1,020   1,115   1,060   1,255



- 28 -
4.13      The estimated berth utilization figures for the ports are shown
be low:
1977    1978    1979    1980    1981
With present facilities         89%     87%      92%      95%     97%
1982    1983    1984    1985    1986
With the Bank project
and expansion of quays
at Larnaca                      64%     68%      72%      75%     79%
The 1977 utilization factor assumes the availability of the floating pontoons
at Larnaca for a full year and the 1978 factor, the extension of the present
overtime working into a full second shift. The high port utilization esti-
mates for 1979 to 1981 imply that in the years immediately prior to completion
of the additional facilities, port congestion will become significant; by
1980, the number of ship waiting days will likely exceed 4000 per annum and
the related costs will amount to more than US$10 million.
4.14      Failing a political settlement whereby the port of Famagusta would
become available (see para 4.29), some further expansion in port facilities
or operating capacity would again be necessary by 1986/87, if the projected
growth in traffic is to be accommodated.
C. Project Benefits
Nature of Benefits
4.15      The current economic program in Cyprus is to an important degree
focused on industrialization, supported by increased imports of industrial
materials and exports of finished products. Without the proposed project,
this traffic would be heavily penalized by the higher transport costs that
would result from delays at the two ports. The full consequential impact
on economic development in Cyprus would be substantial.
4.16      The economic benefits accruing from the project have been conser-
vatively estimated from a comparison of the shipping and handling costs with
and without the project. The "without project" situation is defined as having
the existing facilities (approximately 18.5 berths in Limassol and Larnaca,
including new floating pontoons), operating with a full second labor shift.
The operation of a second shift is assumed to increase ship-day productivity
by about 15% over present levels, which already have been enhanced by 20% or
more since 1975 through the regular use of overtime labor.
4.17      The main benefits from the project would be:
(i) savings in ship-waiting time, produced primarily by increased
port capacity;



- 29 -
(ii) savings in ship-service time and handling costs brought about
by operation of the new container-handling equipment, mobile
cranes and storage sheds, and from the other elements of
the project such as technical assistance for operations and
management, which together will contribute to improved port
efficiency. The new container crane provided under the project
may also serve to encourage the introduction of larger, more
efficient main-line container ships to the Cyprus trade and
reduce shipping costs. Only a portion of these benefits,
i.e., the savings in ship-service time due to introduction
of the container cranes, has been quantified;
(iii)  improved safety and operational efficiency of handling
passenger movements within the ports, through the provision
of new passenger facilities. These benefits have not been
quantified.
Assessment of Benefits
4.18      Even with the assumed introduction of a second shift to improve
throughput, the two ports will be operating near 100% capacity by the time the
project is complete in 1981, and ship queuing time would theoretically extend
towards infinity without the project. The ship waiting time that would occur
without the project has been estimated and frozen at a level of 1.5 times the
service time required in 1981 or about 9,500 ship-days; this is a conservative
estimate. By comparison, the two ports have already experienced approximately
2,600 ship-days of waiting time in 1976 with an average berth occupancy of 88%.
An average waiting cost per ship-day of US$2,500 has been assumed, based on
the actual pattern of various types and sizes of ships handled at the port.
4.19      The savings in waiting time attributed to the project are assumed to
commence at the beginning of 1982 and have been derived by deducting annual
waiting times in 1982 to 1986 "with" the project from the level described
under para 4.18. The waiting times and related ship waiting costs have been
calculated through use of the Bank's Port Simulation Model. The allocable
savings have been kept constant from 1986, the approximate time at which
further port capacity would need to be provided.
4.20      The use of new container-handling equipment and facilities will
reduce average ship-service times by about one half, and total annual savings
have been calculated on the basis of projected movements of container ships
and estimated costs per ship-day. These savings are exclusive of the reduced
handling and transportation costs for container movements which will be derived
under the project.
4.21      No benefits are ascribed to the project from the introduction of a
second working shift, assumed to occur in 1978, or from the development of the
floating pontoons at Larnaca.
Distribution of Project Benefits
4.22      Of the project benefits that have been quantified, only the share
accruing to Cyprus has been taken into account for calculating the economic



- 30 -
return from the project. That share of benefits would ultimately be re-
flected in reduced prices of imported goods to domestic and industrial
consumers, and to improved net sales prices for Cypriot exports.
4.23      Savings in ship-waiting time should largely accrue to Cyprus, either
as reduced demurrage charges in charter trade, or as avoided congestion sur-
charges in liner trade; during the period October 1976 to March 1977, confer-
ence lines imposed surcharges ranging from 5% to 25% of the normal level of
freight tariffs. Credit for only two thirds of these savings has been taken
in calculating the economic return, based on Cyprus obtaining 100% of the
savings in charter trade (25% of total traffic), 100% of the savings in the
trade derived by Cypriot-owned ships (accounting for 10% of liner volume),
and 50% of the savings for the remaining liner shipping.
4.24      It is recognized that the benefits accruing to container liner
traffic through the introduction of container handling equipment may not
be easily passed on to Cyprus and, consequently, it has been assumed that
only 50% of the related savings in ship-service time will be captured.
D. Economic Costs of the Project
4.25      Project investment costs already exclude customs duties on imports
component as well as local taxes; price contingencies have been excluded from
the economic costs used in estimating the economic return on the project.
The economic costs cover all civil works and equipment components under the
project, including those items such as passenger facilities and technical
assistance for which project benefits have not been specifically quantified.
Cost and benefit streams are as follows:

E. Economic Return and Sensitivity Analysis
4.26      Based on the methodology and data presented in the foregoing sec-
tions, the project yields a satisfactory economic return of 31%, even under
the conservative assumptions made. The first year rate of return is estimated
to be 39%, using a 10% discount rate. These results confirm the economic
justification of the project and its urgency.
4.27      The economic return was tested for its sensitivity to variations in
the cost and benefit parameters.  The results show that (a) a 25% increase in
costs would reduce the economic return to 26%, (b) a 25% decline in benefits
(already conservatively estimated) would yield a rate of return of 24%, and
(c) the two preceding adverse conditions occurring together would result in
a 20% return. A straight 25% reduction in traffic at the two ports would,
while making the project premature by about three years, still yield an
economic return of 23%.
4.28      The proposed development of port facilities at Paphos (para. 1.13)
would have some adverse impact on traffic volumes through Limassol/Larnaca,
particularly if it becomes operational prior to 1986 while adequate capacity
is already available to handle shipping requirements. However, Paphos is
unlikely to divert significant traffic from the existing port facilities: the
port would serve a relatively underdeveloped and agriculturally-oriented hinter-
land comprising less than 10% of the Cypriot population and, relative to the
other ports, it would entail higher inland transport costs for traffic destined
for or originating from other areas of Cyprus. Traffic through the port would
consist largely of agricultural exports from the region and lesser amounts of
general cargo. Traffic diverted from Limassol/Larnaca would probably not
exceed 150,000-200,000 tons annually. The impact of the Paphos port develop-
ment on the project has been assessed under the conservative assumption that
it becomes operational in 1983 with an initial capacity of about 400,000 tons
annually, roughly equal to two years' growth in Cypriot port traffic volume.
On that basis, the economic return of the project would be 26%.
4.29      The project has also been examined from the standpoint that a
political settlement in Cyprus may evolve, which would reintegrate the island
economically and permit the use of existing transportation facilities in the
northern zone, including available port capacity at Famagusta. An analysis
has been made of the potential effect on traffic volume at Limassol and
Larnaca under those circumstances. Assuming full use of the Famagusta facil-
ities, the impact would be to reduce traffic at the two southern ports by
29% in 1981 and 18% in 1985 and would have an even greater impact on service
time requirements. Notwithstanding this, the expansion of facilities at
Limassol and Larnaca would still be justified by 1985. A sensitivity analysis
has been made under the assumption that the Famagusta facilities become avail-
able and fully utilized in 1982, the first year in which the project becomes
operational; under these assumptions, the corresponding economic return for
the project declines to an acceptable 20%. The project therefore represents
an economically justified investment in transportation infrastructure in the



- 32 -
context of the whole island; in addition, the project includes specialized
cargo handling facilities and equipment which will benefit both the north and
south zones should reintegration occur.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      While it is early to formulate judgements on CPA's financial per-
formance due to the short period of its existence (the assets and liabilities
of existing ports were transferred to CPA on August 1, 1976), indications are
that the quality of the financial management is good. Increases in tariffs
ranging from 50% to 100% were introduced on August 1, 1976 and the structure
is currently under review. The revaluations of assets on an indexing basis
is also being considered. These measures will be supported by the technical
assistance provided in the proposed project.
5.02      The Balance Sheets at December 31, 1976 and 1977 as summarized below
include the fixed assets taken over on August 1, 1976, in accordance with the
terms agreed with the Government.

5.04      Land at the existing old ports and those now under Turkish control
was revalued at LC 4,506,933 on July 1, 1971. Since this land was designated
port areas, it was argued that it is unlikely to have a commercial value other
than its use for port operation and it was transferred to CPA at a nominal
value of LC 10.
5.05      Financial arrangements for repaying the Government for these assets
are as follows:
(i) No repayment of capital or interest charge at this stage for
assets at the ports under Turkish control (written down value
at August 1, 1976, LC 1,645,870);
(ii) For those assets listed as for future use (consisting of
part of the breakwaters and land at Limassol and Larnaca
with a written down value at August 1, 1976 of LC 3,390,150).
Capital will be repaid over 30 years with a five-year period
of grace, and interest of 2% per annum;



- 34 -
(iCiu  For all other assets (written down value at August 1, 1976
LC 8,129,003) capital will be repaid over 30 years with a
five-year period of grace and interest of 6% per annum.
The tirst repayment of capital will take place on August 1, 1981 and will
amount to LC 586,269.  The Bank loan of US$11.5 million for the first port
ptoJuct is being repaid by the Government to whom the loan was made and which
in turn will recover from CPA under the arrangements described above.

5.07      The value of assets at Limassol and Larnaca is based on cost and
would require to be increased by at least one-half to reflect current replace-
ment cost levels which would reduce the above rates of return to about 10% in
1978 falling to around 8% in 1982.
5.08      The assumptions used in the financial analysis are as follows:
(a)  Tariffs:  Revenues from ships, cargo and storage are
based on current tariff levels until 1980. In 1981
all charges except rents have been increase by 25%.
(b)  Expenditure:  1977 has been taken as the base year and
projected in line with traffic forecasts:
(i) Wages and salaries which account for about 50% of
operation costs are assumed to increase by 10% per
annum because of inflation and include additional
staff to be recruited;
(ii) Maintenance and repair of port equipment (3% of
capital cost) costs have been increased by 5% per
annum; and
(iii) Depreciation is 1% for breakwaters, 2% for quays,
3-1/3% for roads, 2-1/2% for sheds, 10% for mobile
cranes, 7.5% for electric cranes, and 10% for tugs
and takes account of the investment program.
(c) Other:
(i) The balance of foreign exchange needed in addition
to the proposed Bank loan of US$8.5 million is assumed
to be available from commercial banks for a seven-
year period with interest at an average rate of 8%.
5.09      Cash flow estimates indicate that CPA will be able to contribute
about LC 5.0 million towards the 1978-1982 investment program of LC 18.4
leaving a cash shortfall of LC 13.4 million. The proposed Bank loan of LC
3.4 million will leave a balance amount of LC 10.0 million to be found from
other sources. A summary of the 1978-1982 cash flow is given below.

5.10      The financing plan shows the financial requirements of the total
investment program 1978 to 1982 and the contributions made by various sources.
During negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that funds from a de-
velopment loan will be provided to the extent necessary to meet the balance
of foreign exchange requirements, additional to those covered by the Bank
loan and local expenditures. The prior conclusion of the agreement securing
these funds will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. The
Government will guarantee cost overruns.
C. Financial Covenants
5.11      CPA is obviously able to maintain satisfactory operating ratio (para
5.06), generate a realistic return on assets and cover its loan interest com-
mitments adequately (para 5.06) with the reservations that the asset valuation
does not reflect replacement cost and that there is probably some cross sub-
sidization by wharfage, of services to ships.
5.12      During negotiations CPA agreed to:
(i)  revalue its operational assets on a replacement cost basis;
(ii)  review,its tariffs and operating costs, develop a cost related
tariff structure reflecting the investments and bring the new
tariff into operation on or before December 31, 1981;



- 37 -
(iii)  generate revenue sufficient to (a) produce an annual return
on the net fixed assets in operation of not less than 7%
before tax up to 1979, 8% in 1979 to 1981 and to be maintained
at an appropriate level thereafter, and (b) enable it out of
internally-generated funds to pay interest on and amortize
loans and debts, pay current taxation, and provide adequate
reserves, maintain adequate working capital and finance out
of its own funds a reasonable proportion of the cost of new
investments.
5.13      These covenants are in continuation and extension of those contained
in Sections 5.08 and 5.09(c) of the Loan Agreement (904-CY) for the first port
project which were effectively incorporated in Sections 20 and 25 of the CPA
Law of 1973.
5.14      CPA has managed its finances well so far.  However, to ensure that
a sound financial position is maintained, in view of the borrowing required
to finance the investment program, CPA acceded to a debt limitation covenant;
namely, not to incur any further debt, without the agreement of the Bank,
unless its net income for the fiscal year next preceding the date of such
incurrence, or for a later period of twelve consecutive months ending prior
to such incurrence, whichever amount is the greater, shall not be less than
1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal
year.
5.15      CPA agreed not to change materially the investment program shown in
para 3.03. However, they may expend up to US$2.0 million per year in addition
to project expenditures until the completion of the project.
VI.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      The Government has agreed to guarantee cost overruns (paras 3.28
and 5.10).
As recorded in the draft Guarantee Agreement (Section 2.02).
6.02      The Government and CPA have agreed not to undertake any major
investment in port facilities which shall not be justified by all appropriate
financial and economic criteria, but such restriction shall not apply to any
investment (i) which is included in the investment program agreed between CPA
and the Bank or (ii) which would result in expenditure by CPA not exceeding
US$2.0 million in any fiscal year or (iii) to the proposed port developments
at Paphos (paras 1.13 and 5.15).
As recorded in the draft Loan Agreement (Section 5.05) and in the
Guarantor's undertaking in Supplemental Letter No. 4.
6.03      CPA has undertaken the following financial covenants:



- 38 -
(i)  to develop a cost-related charges structure for imple-
mentation by December 31, 1981 (paras 2.26 and 5.12);
(ii)  to maintain its revenues at a level which will ensure an
annual return on average net fixed assets in operation, as
revalued from time to time, of not less than 7% in 1978, 8%
for 1979 through 1981, and to be maintained at an appropriate
level thereafter (paras 2.17 and 5.12);
(iii)  not to incur any debt, other than money borrowed for finan-
cing the project, unless its net revenue for the fiscal year
next preceding such incurrence or for a later period of twelve
consecutive months ending prior to such incurrence, whichever
amount is the greater, shall not be less than 1.5 times the
maximum debt service requirement for any succeeding fiscal
year on all its debt, including the debt to be incurred (para
5.14).
As recorded in the draft Loan Agreement (Sections 5.06, 5.07 and
5.08).
6.04      A condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan is that (i) CPA
shall have been granted by or through the Guarantor loans sufficient to
meet the financing of foreign exchange costs not covered by the Bank Loan and
(ii) a copy of the Agreement providing therefor and evidence satisfactory
to the Bank that all conditions precedent to the disbursement of such loans
shall have been fulfilled (paras 3.28 and 5.10).
As recorded in the draft Loan Agreement (Section 7.01).
6.05      Subject to the foregoing condition of effectiveness, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of U',$8.5 million for 15 years including a three-
year grace period.
