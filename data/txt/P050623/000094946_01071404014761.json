      Roads Sector Development Program Project is to achieve\n            sustainable improvements in the supply, and performance of\n            roads transport services, in a regionally equitable manner.\n            The project components are: 1) routine maintenance,\n            consisting of patching potholes; lightning, vegetative\n            propagation along roadsides, and drainage maintenance; 2)\n            periodic maintenance, minor rehabilitation, and upgrading of\n            trunk roads, and urban roads consist of spot improvements,\n            road resurfacing and resealing, and slope repairs. Feeder\n            roads include re-graveling, and drainage repairs; 3) major\n            rehabilitation, reconstruction, and upgrading, will include\n            reconstruction, or rehabilitation of paved/unpaved roads,\n            resealing, and upgrading from gravel to bitumen, or from\n            bituminous-treated surfaces, to asphalt/concrete surfaces.\n            Repair, and construction of bridges will also be included,\n            as well as for trunk roads, feeder roads, and urban roads\n            segments; 4) traffic management, and safety, to develop\n            comprehensive programs on safety strategies, by\n            strengthening the National Road Safety Council, and the\n            Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority, through reforms,\n            computerization, and training of traffic officials; 5)\n            institutional strengthening, particularly as it regards\n            environmental policies vs. road works, and directives for\n            social, and gender equity, through the provision of studies,\n            training, and technical assistance; and, 6) project\n            management, coordination, monitoring, and reporting on the\n            road development program."}, "docdt": "2001-07-02T00:00:00Z"}
