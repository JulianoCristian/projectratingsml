Project for Ghana were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the Bank's preparedness criteria requires\n            that first year works should be fully designed and ready for\n            contracting as soon as the project becomes effective. Major\n            differences between expected and actual costs may often\n            result in the face of poorly designed projects. A detailed\n            monitoring and evaluation system is critical for effective\n            supervision and to adapt the project design to address\n            specific needs during implementation. Focus should not only\n            be limited to capturing the 'output' indicators\n            but also the 'outcome' indicators. A first time\n            preparation and implementation of safeguards instruments\n            requires close supervision and consistent support of the\n            client. Acquiring at detailed design stage, the Executive\n            Instrument, which in Ghana, is the document that authorizes\n            land acquisition, is key to a timely preparation and\n            implementation of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)."}, "docdt": "2008-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
