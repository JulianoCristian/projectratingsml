action plan (RAP) for\n            the Road Sector Development Program Project in Ghana,\n            reviews the land acquisition and compensation laws, which\n            provides entitlement to compensation for affected property\n            by public projects, as well as the possibility to seek\n            redress through other avenues for people not satisfied with\n            compensation. The RAP recommends the preparation of a social\n            assessment, to include the demographic, and socioeconomic\n            profile of affected populations, and an assessment of\n            potential impacts on cultural, social and economic aspects,\n            suggesting mitigation plans, and the application of a\n            framework for compensation and resettlement as follows. The\n            RAP stipulates institutional arrangements among the\n            country's agencies and units, to align and identify the\n            properties affected, followed by valuation of properties,\n            presented at public forum, and in consultation with affected\n            people. Monitoring, and assessment should follow, to adjust\n            valuation as necessary, based on database information to\n            control timing, and compensation issues. Authorization of\n            payment will be made prior to resettlement and demolition,\n            and, assistance will be provided to cover resettlement\n            costs. Grievance mechanisms will be established to receive,\n            and resolve possible complaints, and an independent\n            evaluation of impacts will be coordinated."}, "docdt": "2000-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
