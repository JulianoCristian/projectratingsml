Development Program\n            (RSDP) Project involves the rehabilitation of roads\n            following existing alignments, thus, it is expected that\n            environmental impacts will be minimal. Nevertheless, this\n            environmental assessment reviews the legal, and\n            administrative framework in Ghana, and the alternatives\n            examined for improvement of existing roads. It specifies\n            that clearing around the right-of-way, or for borrow pits\n            may threaten ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands and\n            wildlife refuges; construction works may lead to\n            sedimentation, and pollution of streams, and water bodies,\n            resulting from the operation of heavy machinery; potential\n            erosion, and inadequate drainage would increase water\n            pollution levels; and, air, and noise pollution, as a result\n            of construction, and increased traffic, may affect roadside\n            communities, in terms of health and safety problems.\n            Mitigation include: 1) installation of culverts to prevent\n            water logging, and an immediate vegetative propagation, will\n            minimize soil erosion, and sedimentation; 2) drainage\n            discharges will be appropriately located to control, and\n            manage solid wastes, fuel and oil spills, and sewage to\n            prevent water pollution; 3) likewise, groundwater leakage,\n            and pollution of water resources will be adequately\n            discharged, in accordance with sanitary measures; 4) a\n            buffer zone will be maintained to protect, and preserve\n            local flora and fauna; and, 5) spraying, and surface covers\n            will minimize dust pollution; vehicle maintenance and\n            regular working schedules would reduce noise disturbances;\n            and, traffic safety include the installation of traffic\n            signs, and provision of alternate route diversions."}, "docdt": "2000-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
