Lessons learned from the project: The Bank\n            is well positioned to respond to similar emergencies in the\n            future. The Bank can play an active role to assist countries\n            in meeting established and evolving regulatory standards.\n            There can be significant advantages to implementing\n            multi-country programs through a regional entity with\n            sufficient capacity. Regional procurement can bring\n            important cost-benefits. The Emergency Recovery Project in\n            Grenada was successful in great part thanks to the close and\n            regular supervision of the Bank team. This was made possible\n            by grouping supervision of five similar projects in the\n            region, thereby creating significant economies of scale.\n            With pooled supervision funds, the team was able to visit\n            all participating islands on a single mission while paying\n            transportation costs only once. Had this not been the case,\n            the Bank team would not have had the funds required to be\n            closely involved in project implementation - to the\n            detriment of the project."}, "docdt": "2006-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
