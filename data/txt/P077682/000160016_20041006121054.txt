                       Grenada-Emergency Recoveryprojectand Credit
      ProposedAmendment to the Loan7100-GRDand Credit 3611-GRDAgreements




1. This proposal seeks the Executive Directors approval of an amendment of the Loan and credit
    agreements for the Grenada - Emergency Recovery project (Loan 7100-GRD and Credit
    3611-GRD). The purpose is to reassign project cost savings to finance the purchase of
   low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation and transport to support the Government's
   reconstruction efforts inresponse to the passageof Hurricane Ivan.

2. Grenada's Emergency Recovery Project (Loan 7100-GRD and Credit 3611-GRD) was
   approved by the Board on March 7, 2002 for an amount of US$3.8 million to support: (a) an
   expansion of tourism promotion through 2002 by way of a regional campaign; (b) maintenance
   of critical fuel imports necessary to keep tourism related facilities operational during the
   recovery period; (c) additional enhancements to port and airport security, necessary to maintain
   secure transportation linkages to major markets and to preserve the sub-region's image as a safe
   tourist destination; and (d) further improvements to the administration of off-shore financial
   and business services inline with recent international agreements.

3. On September 7, 2004, the eye-wall of Hurricane Ivan, a Category 3 hurricane, passed over
   Grenada on a course between the town of Grenville in the west and the capitol city of St.
   George's inthe east. Damage resulting from the storm i s catastrophic. Overall, inexcess of 80
   percent of building structures on the island have sustained some form of damage, including 90
   percent of the housing stock and nearly every school in the country. The second largest
   hospital has been completely destroyed and almost all Government buildings have suffered
   significant damage. Other areas severely effected include the power sector, as a large part of
   the electricity distribution system has been destroyed; the tourism industry, which accounts for
   60 percent of export earnings, with close to 70 percent of its infrastructure made unusable; and
   the agricultural sector, which has suffered a near complete loss of this year's crop. Emergency
   rehabilitation i s ongoing in the power sector to reconnect critical services and government
   buildingto the grid.

4. As part of their reconstruction effort, the Government of Grenada has requested that the
   US$450,000 savings within the US$3.8 million Emergency Recovery Project, identified during
   the recent midterm review, be redirected towards the financing of low sulfur diesel fuel to be
   used for emergency electricity generation and transportation to support the Borrower's
   reconstruction efforts in response to the passage of Hurricane Ivan on September 7, 2004 (See
   Annex 1hereto).

5. In order to accommodate this request, it i s necessary to amend the development objective and
   Component A in Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement of the Grenada Emergency Recovery
   Project to reflect the change in rationale for this component, which i s the occurrence of the
   recent disaster.

6. As the original project objective i s being amended to take into consideration recent events, the
  use of project cost savings i s not allowed under OPBP 13.25, which stipulates that `the
  additional activities have high priority and are consistent with the original project objectives.'
  Therefore, OPBP 13.25 must be waived to allow for the flow of funds.

7. The request to reallocate these savings toward the new emergency i s expected to be the first
   phase of Bank's response to Grenada following the devastation of Hurricane Ivan. Discussions
   are currently ongoing with the Government regarding a second phase which may include
   reallocations under other ongoing projects, as well as possible new operation to be financed
   through the ERDMP contingency fund (up to US$10 million available in case of natural
   disaster as APL-Phase 4). The Bank will be hosting, at the request of the Government, an
   international donor's conference in Washington on October 4, 2004, at which the authorities
   outlined their needs and a way forward incoordinating with the development partners.

8. A copy of the draft Letter of Amendment to the Borrower i s available upon request.
