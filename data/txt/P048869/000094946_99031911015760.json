This\n            report overviews the environmental impact assessment on the\n            integrated transportation system of Salvador. The impacts\n            over the biotic media are considered to be light. Negative\n            impacts and their mitigation measures relate both to the\n            construction and operational phases. Physical impacts\n            include: a) water, drainage, and water resources pollution;\n            b) noise/vibration - significant during construction -\n            mitigated by the minimum use of percussive construction\n            methods and careful evaluation of slopes and existing\n            building foundations; c) air pollution - mitigation includes\n            taking present levels into consideration when creating the\n            forced ventilation system; and d) landscape & visual\n            impacts - mitigated by use of strict control of relocation\n            effort and land occupation after construction. Social\n            impacts including personal and commercial relocation as well\n            as increased accidents (during construction) will be\n            mitigated by a widespread information plan, a carefully\n            designed relocation plan, and a campaign of Environmental\n            education. Indemnification should also be considered,\n            translating into expeditious appropriations actions."}, "docdt": "1998-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
