Dear Mr. Minister:
Re:
BRAZIL: Ln 4494-BR - Salvador Urban Transport Project 
Amendment of  Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement
We refer to the Loan Agreement, dated December 3, 1999, between the Federative 
Republic of Brazil and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and 
to the request, dated April 25, 2001, from Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos-CBTU 
to amend the disbursement table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan 
Agreement. 
We agree to: (a) increase, during 2001, the percentage of expenditures to be 
financed under Category 1 (Turnkey Contract) of that table; (b) split Category 4 
(Consultants’ Services) in two sub-categories, one for services under Part A.2 of the 
Project (Rehabilitation of the Calçada-Paripe link), and the other for services under 
the other Parts of the Project; and (c) to reallocate the funds from Category (6) 
(Unallocated) to the other Categories.  Therefore, we propose to that the table set 
forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement be amended to read as 
follows:
