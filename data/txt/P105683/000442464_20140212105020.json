Some\n            lessons learned included: the community-driven development\n            (CDD) approach can be an effective instrument not only to\n            empower communities but also to develop leadership and\n            implementation capacity of local institutions that can\n            enhance social service delivery in the short term and\n            facilitate between different stakeholders in fragile\n            environments. Stakeholder and donor coordination is\n            essential in all development activities in a post conflict\n            context, especially during the transition from relief to\n            development phase where priorities need to be clearly\n            identified and sequenced. Careful attention to fiduciary and\n            project management skills in a low capacity, post conflict\n            setting proved to be a critical factor that contributed to\n            the success of the project.
