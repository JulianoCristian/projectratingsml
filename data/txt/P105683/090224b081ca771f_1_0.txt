                         Context: The Project’s IDA grant became effective in August 2007. The trust fund for EU co-financing to the Project’s community-driven development activities became effective in
                         August 2009. In addition, a grant from the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (FPCRTF), which introduced a temporary employment component to the Project, was signed in
                         June 2008.

                         Relevance: The Project’s objectives, design, and implementation remained relevant to the country context. The Project’s objectives contributed directly to the Government’s PRSP
                         pillar regarding basic social services. In 2009, the PDO was revised to respond and help mitigate the negative impacts of the 2008 international food price crisis within food insecure
                         households by adding the temporary employment component to the CEPII. The Project design and implementation benefitted from capacity built and lessons learned under the first
                         CEP. The relevance of the Project, and the Implementing Agency (LACE), was confirmed by a 2011 IEG Report on GAC in Liberia.

                         Achievement of objectives: Implementation support missions were conducted in February and May 2013 and found that the Project continues to make steady progress toward the
                         achievement of its development objectives as measured by the key outcome indicators. Under the community-driven development activities, LACE has engaged 260 communities,
                         out of a target of 265. Of the 260, 100% of the sub-projects reflect community priorities as verified through PRA/CDD approaches; this is compared to the key outcome indicator
                         target of 90%. A beneficiary assessment is currently ongoing to verify this indicator. Regarding the key outcome indicator on school enrollment, 6,480 students, as compared to a
                         target of 8,910, are in improved school facilities. An additional seven school sub-projects remain ongoing and are expected to be completed prior to the Project closing date. This is
                         likely to increase the number of students benefiting from CEPII-constructed schools.

                         In regards to its intermediate indicators, the CEPII targets the completion of 265 community-driven sub-projects, including 33 schools, 6 markets, 52 bridges, 85 WASH, 1 health
                         clinic, and 88 culverts. The targets for markets and health clinics have been achieved. In addition, 24 schools, 42 bridges, 62 WASH, and 68 culverts have been completed. LACE
                         has successfully completed trainings in the total targeted number of communities (265), meeting the target of training 2,650 people in project cycle management. These trainings
                         focused on the project management, social mobilization, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, as well as on conflict resolution and reconciliation. Fifty percent of the training
                         participants and the Project Management Committee (PMC) members have been women in all 265 communities. This exceeds the target that there would be gender parity in at least
                         90% of communities. LACE has also exceeded its target regarding the inclusion of local government officials in its training, with 530 local and district officers trained as compared to
                         a target of 360. In addition, 90% of PMC are reported to have minutes of the meeting during which PMC members were elected. This will be confirmed by the ongoing beneficiary
                         assessment.

                         Under the key outcome indicator related to the temporary employment activities, the Project's impact assessment found a 27% reduction in the poverty gap of targeted vulnerable
                         households. This exceeds the Project target of a 20% reduction. Regarding intermediate indicators, LACE successfully engaged its target of 17,000 Liberians in temporary
                         employment and created 680,000 work days through these activities. This is below the established target of 800,000 days given the Government and World Bank decision to change
                         the daily wage rate of the program to US$3 per day (instead of US$2.5 as originally envisioned) to align the Project with other ongoing Government and donor interventions providing
                         temporary employment. The overall cash transfer to beneficiaries did not change as a result of the decision to reduce the number of work days and increase the wage rate.

                         Efficiency: LACE has efficiently allocated the resources for these construction activities as compared to international standards. For example, schools constructed under CEPII cost
                         approximately US$90,000, with six classrooms and WASH facilities. This is approximately US$15,000 per classroom, even without removing the WASH construction costs. By
                         comparison, data from recent education-sector ICR in other low capacity and fragile conte xts (Benin, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Northern Uganda and Tanzania) show per classroom

                         construction costs between US$20,000 and US$25,000, when using same NCB procurement methods as the CEPII.

                         The efficiency of the temporary employment component also appears Satisfactory based on the wage share, targeting performance, and the proportionate wage gain as measured
                         against international markers for similar programs. Based on these three measured, the overall Project costs effectiveness is estimated at 0.51, meaning that the cost of transferring
                         US$1.00 in net wage benefit to a poor participant was US$1.96 (including the US$1.00 net wage). This rate is in line with the 0.55 effectiveness standard in Ethiopia’s Productive
                         Safety Net Program, but higher than rates seen in many other programs with weaker targeting efficiency.

                         In terms of the efficiency of the program management component, LACE's operating ratio is 10%, below the Project target of 13%. It is also below operating costs of social funds in
                         other low capacity contexts which average between 15 and 20%.

                         Institutional performance: LACE performed well throughout the Project period. Delays in implementation that resulted in the Project’s implementation progress at Moderately

                         Unsatisfactory between March and November 2012 were due to three challenges. First, although the Project was approved by the Board in June 2007, the EU co-financing did
                         become effective until August 2009, largely because of delays in signing the Administration Agreement for the parent trust fund. Second, the Project’s mid-term review (MTR) raised
                         weaknesses in LACE’s procurement capacity, which required the development of all new procurement templates. The timing of the MTR coincided with the effectiveness of the EU
                         co-financing and it was necessary that all such revisions be finalized before the majority of activities financed by the EU could begin. Third, with Liberia being a post-conflict and

                         fragile state, weak capacity of local contractors has led to delays in the completion of subprojects within the agreed time frames.

                         In overcoming these delays, the LACE team has worked diligently to achievement the Project’s development objectives. In addition to improving its procurement capacity, LACE also
                         adopted a series of management tools that proved effective to improve implementation of the Project. They include submission of monthly sub-project completion progress reports
                         for Bank review, creation of four regional teams to conduct nearly constant field site visits, and, with Bank approval, the development of two new payment methods to increase
                         contractor liquidity.
