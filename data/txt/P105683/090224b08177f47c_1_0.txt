                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         To improve communities' access to basic infrastructures and provide economic opportunities for vulnerable households in urban and rural areas, through: (a) a
                         community driven approach; (b) a labor-intensive public works program; and (c) the provision of capacity-building at the community and local government levels.

                         improved significantly since the previous mission in June 2012. Of a target of 265 sub-projects, 159 were completed by August 31, 2012, as compared with 79 completed at the end
                         of June 2012. Based on this progress and in keeping with the CEPII Restructuring Paper dated June 25, 2012, the Task Team recommends upgrading the Project's rating for
                         implementation performance to moderately satisfactory. Of the balance 106 sub-projects, 95 sub-projects are under construction, four contracts have been canceled for cause
                         without re-award, and 11 are pending procurement. Completion of these outstanding activities prior to the IDA Grant closing date of July 31, 2013 will require that LACE continue its

                         intensive field monitoring of sub-project contractors and LACE will continue its submission of monthly sub-project progress reports to the Bank throughout the remainder of the CEPII.
                         (Note: The Restructuring Paper specified to upgrade the rating for implementation performance once LACE had completed 50 percent of the target number of sub-projects and was
                         continuing to make steady progress toward the completion of the balance 50 percent.)

                         All PDO indicators are on track and if implementation progress remains on schedule the team will, during the next mission, upgrade the PDO, IP and component ratings to
                         satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         At the end of FY12, a Project Restructuring was finalized to extend the closing date of the Project's IDA Grant to July 31, 2013 and of the Project's EU Trust Fund to August 31, 2012.
                         The EU TF has now closed and is fully disbursed. All financial documentation for expenditures under the Trust Fund have been submitted to the Bank (the Administration Agreement
                         for the Parent TF closes December 31, 2012). LACE has submitted all the financial paperwork to Chennai and there are no outstanding disbursement issues.

                         The Additional Financing to support cash-for-work activities under the CEPII closed on July 31, 2012. The financial documentation for expenditures under this TF have also been
                         submitted to the Bank.
