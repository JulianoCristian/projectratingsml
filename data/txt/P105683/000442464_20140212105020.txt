     The disbursement graph from the Operations Portal only reflects IDA Grant Number H3050. Note that
     the decrease in disbursements on March 16, 2012 results from the reposting of expenses originally
     incurred under the IDA Grant to the co-financing EU Trust Fund. While not materially affecting the
     overall funding allocations under CEPII, it allowed LACE to fully utilize the EU funding before its
     closing date of August 31, 2012 (11 months prior to the closing of the IDA Grant).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal: Post-War Emergency Challenges and Project Rationale

1.      Liberia was a middle-income country before the civil war began in 1989, but the fourteen
years of war diverted resources away from development. The conflict devastated the country's
economy and destroyed its physical, social, and human capital. By the time hostilities ended in
August 2003, with the signing of a Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA), the country’s GDP
stood at negative 31 percent. Following the CPA, a democratically-elected Government took
office in January 2006 and completed an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy (IPRS) in early
2007. The GDP growth rate reversed and grew from 5.3 percent in 2005 to 7.8 percent in 2007.
Despite this macro-level growth, the 2007 Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ) found
that more than 60 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, with rural poverty at
nearly 68 percent. Government capacity to delivery services remained limited; this was
particularly true in the rural areas, which historically had little access to the relatively centralized
Government structures.7 In addition, the institutional space for local decision-making had been
undermined by population dislocation, limited local economic activity, lack of social capital, and
widespread dependence on international relief agencies.

2.        The long-lasting implications of the country’s post-conflict condition continued to have
negative impacts for Liberian households. Liberia’s Human Development Indicators, as
measured by the UNDP, were among the worst in the world. Infant and under-five mortality rates
were 157 and 235 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Nearly 40 percent of children under five
years old were stunted. Education fared no better. About 70 percent of the population was
illiterate and over half of the children of primary school age were not in school. At the county
and district levels, physical infrastructure was unusable. Most hospitals and clinics were
damaged or destroyed and only 10 percent of communities had a health care facility.

3.      Economic decline precipitated by the conflict also left behind excessively high levels of
unemployment. Only 4 percent of the population was estimated to be engaged in the formal
employment, with nearly half of all these workers employed by the public sector. The rest of the
population worked in informal activities, many relying on subsistence farming. The creation of
job opportunities, therefore, was a key element in the post-conflict strategy and deemed essential
to ensure peace and stability.

4.      The 2008 international food price crisis further threatened the well-being of Liberia’s
vulnerable households. By March 2008, the Liberian consumer price index (in which food
carried a weight of 45 percent) had increased 14 percent in March 2008, with a typical food
basket costing 25 percent more than in January 2007. Based on the results of the CWIQ survey, it
was estimated that a 20 percent increase in the price of rice could lead to an increase of 3 to 4
percentage points to the headcount poverty rate. By 2008, this increase had already been
witnessed in Monrovia.

5.       The Government’s IPRS and the Bank’s corresponding Interim Strategy Note (ISN)
identified community-driven development (CDD) as an appropriate vehicle for delivering
emergency social and economic recovery activities as necessitated by the factors outlined above.


7
    In Liberia, the Local Government Authorities (LGA) are appointed by the President and report to the
    Ministry of Internal Affairs, rather than being elected through local processes.

                                                   1
The ISN noted “scaling up of community-driven development efforts is thus a high priority of
both donors and government.” This approach was deemed particularly relevant in the rural areas,
which had suffered from both the war and historically limited access to basic services, and sought
to encourage accountability and responsiveness of Government delivery of basic services.

6.      Within this context, the Second Community Empowerment Project (CEPII) was the
outcome of two factors: satisfactory implementation of the first Community Empowerment
Project (CEPI) and donor efforts to harmonize community rehabilitation. CEPI was successfully
implemented by the Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE), which had been
created by Government to support CDD projects. The LACE CDD approach centered on
community identification of their needs for basic services, participation in the selection and
monitoring of contractors to build the chosen facilities, and management of the funds to pay the
contractors. 8 Through this model, CEPI generated attention from both the Government and
beneficiaries as a successful intervention that should remain ongoing. Furthermore, CEPII was in
line with donor plans for CDD, and especially timely given that the Project would fill part of the
gap left by the phasing out of the UNDP-financed Community Recovery Program. CEPII also
provided the basis for EUR8.5 million co-financing from the European Union (EU).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The PDO as expressed in the original Emergency Project Paper (EPP) for CEPII was: “as
part of the Government response to the social and economic emergency in Liberia, the Project
will improve poor rural communities’ access to basic services and economic opportunities
through a community-driven development approach by investing in community sub-projects, and
in capacity building at the community and local government levels.”9

8.      Progress toward achieving this objective was to be measured by two Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs):
        a. All supported communities have benefited from social mobilization and at least 90
            percent of sub-projects undertaken reflect the emergency priorities of targeted
            communities and beneficiaries, and are implemented in collaboration with local
            authorities.
        b. Increased access to basic services, in particular in health and education, especially in:
                 i. Primary education, as measured by the attendance rate of primary schools
                     one year after completion
                ii. Health, as measured by the population of the catchment area of the facilities 10

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

9.     The CEPII PDO was amended once during implementation to improve the relevance of
CEPII and adapt to the evolving country context. On June 21, 2008, Grant Agreement
(TF092325) provided US$3.0 million co-financing to CEPII for the Cash for Work Temporary




8
   Section 1.5 provides additional details on the Project’s operational details.
9
   The Financing Agreement (FA) used the same language for the Project Objective.
10
   This is taken from the Results Framework and Monitoring Annex of the EPP, which also included
   several intermediate indicators. The FA did not distinguish between KPI and intermediate indicators.
   See ICR Annex 2: Outputs by Component.

                                                  2
Employment Program (CfWTEP). 11 It was part of a larger Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR)
Trust Fund to address the sudden and dramatic increase in food prices. The CEPII PDO was
revised as: “to improve communities’ access to basic infrastructure and provide economic
opportunities for vulnerable households in urban and rural areas through: (a) a community
driven approach; (b) a labor-intensive public works program; and (c) the provision of capacity
building at the community and local government levels.” The revisions added the labor-intensive
public works program funded by the FPCR TF to the PDO and also expanded the target
population from “poor rural communities” to “vulnerable households in urban and rural areas.”

10.     The June 2008 Restructuring added a new KPI to measure the outcomes of the labor-
intensive public works program and revised the original two KPIs. The wording of the first
indicator was simplified and reference to collaboration with local authorities removed. The
health indicator (originally included with the KPI on school enrollment) was dropped given
ongoing challenges under the CEPI of properly staffing and equipping such facilities.12
        a. Percentage of completed sub-projects reflecting beneficiary’s priorities;
        b. Number of children attending primary school in “improved” facilities as defined by
            technical assessment; 13 and
        c. Percentage of targeted vulnerable households (at least 10,000) reporting increased
            income by at least 20 percent.14

11.      On June 25, 2012, the Project KPIs were revised again to (i) restore the measure of local
authority engagement in the Project; (ii) add a target value of 8,910 students for the second KPI
(no target value was set previously); and (iii) reword the third KPI from “Percentage of targeted
vulnerable households (at least 10,000) reporting increased income by at least 20 percent” to
“Percentage of reduction in poverty gap of targeted vulnerable households at least 20 percent.”
The school enrollment target had not been set at appraisal given the community-driven nature of
intervention. However, once communities had selected sub-projects, this target was adopted by
calculating the number of school sub-projects identified (33) by number of classrooms in a
primary school (6) and the national standard class size of 45 students capacity standards set for
the national primary school design (270 students per school). The third KPI was reworded to
reflect the limited availability of household data in Liberia; poverty measures by asset index,
rather than specific income levels, are more common within national surveys. 15

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.    Poor rural communities were originally the primary beneficiary of the Project. The
CfWTEP expanded this target group to include urban communities and made more explicit the
emphasis on benefiting women. 16 Local government authorities (LGAs), which were to be


11
   This June 2008 Restructuring also was the first extension of the Project closing date, extending it from
   June 30, 2011 to July 31, 2012.
12
   See Section 3.2 for additional detail.
13
   The FPCR TF EPP defined “improved” facilities as schools that (i) function during the rainy season; (ii)
   with access to water and sanitation facilities' in the school area; and (iii) with furnished classrooms.
14
   The Results Framework was also modified to incorporate Intermediate Indicators for the CfWTEP, as
   well as a greater focus on gender and financial accountability of the Project Management Committees
   (PMCs) through management of their bank accounts. See Annex 2: Outputs by Component.
15
   The Project quantitative assessment surveyed 1,000 participants after the CfWTEP. Since no baseline
   survey was conducted, national household data (CWIQ 2007) was used as a comparator for participant
   households. See Section 1.7 and Annex 2 for additional changes adopted under this Restructuring.
16
   See Annex 2 for additional detail.

                                                    3
strengthened in line with the Government’s policies to encourage accountability to communities,
and LACE, which was to be strengthened as a Government implementing agency, also were
expected to benefit.

1.5 Original Components

13.      As given in the FA and EPP, the original components comprised:
      a. Part A: The Community Driven Program (US$4.0 million or US$13.0 million with EU
         Co-financing) would provide sub-grants to beneficiaries for financing sub-projects,
         including but not limited to reconstructing and rehabilitating infrastructure in health,
         education, water, sanitation services, and as related to agriculture, including rural roads,
         markets, and storage facilities, as well as improving delivery of and access to economic
         services. The Project was designed to assist beneficiaries throughout this process through
         technical assistance and training, social mobilization, and collective action. Communities
         were to form Community Based Organizations (CBOs) to represent them vis-à-vis the
         activities, including procurement, monitoring, and payment of local contractors
         responsible for constructing sub-projects. 17 Local non-governmental organizations
         (NGOs) were to support implementation at the county level, including social
         mobilization, training, and contractor monitoring. 18
      b. Part B: The Capacity Building Program (US$0.4 million or US$1.3 million with EU
         Co-financing) would provide training and technical advice to enhance the capacity of
         communities and other sub-project stakeholders, including local government, in
         participatory planning and development. Under LACE supervision, Community
         Facilitators (CFs) were to conduct training programs to enable communities to play a
         leading role in the identification and implementation of the activities. This component
         also included technical assistance to build LACE capacity. It was envisioned that CEPII
         might finance technical assistance to Government on local governance policy. 19
      c. Part C: Project Management (US$0.6 million or US$1.95 million with EU Co-financing)
         was to support the operating capacity of LACE to effectively manage the Project by
         financing and strengthen its management capacity. Specifically, the Project would
         support: (a) development of an M&E system to collect data from the community,
         regional, and central levels; (b) information, education, and communication activities; (c)
         financial, technical, procurement, and management audits; (d) assistance for social and
         beneficiary assessments, community mobilization, and environmental studies; and (e)
         incremental operating costs for LACE.

1.6 Revised Components

14.     The Letter Agreement dated April 24, 2009 providing the EU co-financing to CEPII did
not change the three components but made slight modifications to their descriptions, as follow.




17
   The Project adopted the use of Project Management Committees (PMCs) as the name for these CBOs.
   Contracts for sub-project construction were signed by the contractor, LACE, and the PMC.
18
   The Project adopted the use of Community Facilitators (CFs) as the name of these local NGOs.
19
   The possibility of supporting Government efforts to decentralize was mentioned in the description of the
   component only. It was never formalized in either the PDO or KPIs for CEPII.

                                                    4
     a. Part A: Community Driven Program (US$16.0 million) 20 : Provide support to local
        communities to select, design, implement, and maintain small-scale sub-projects that will
        help in restoring social and economic infrastructure, and increase the income of
        community members.
     b. Part B: Capacity Building Program (US$1.3 million): Support for the carrying out of
        capacity building activities (including preparation of various training modules) for
        communities, local authorities, and other key stakeholders to enable them to play a
        leading role in identification, design, and implementation of community-based activities
        as a means of ensuring greater sustainability.
     c. Part C: Project Management (US$1.95 million): Provision of support to strengthen the
        operational capacity of the LACE to effectively manage the Project by, inter alia,
        strengthening its management capacity, including its monitoring and evaluation
        mechanisms, all through the provision of technical advisory services and operating costs.

1.7 Other significant changes

15.    The Project was restructured five times. As discussed in Section 1.3, on June 21, 2008,
the Project’s first Restructuring provided US$3.0 million co-financing from the FPCR TF,
amended the PDO and KPIs, and extended the closing date from June 30, 2011 to July 31, 2012.21

16.     On April 24, 2009, the second Restructuring established Trust Fund Number 094016 to
provide EUR 8,047,200 for CEPII. 22 EU co-financing increased the following intermediate
indicator targets: (i) sub-projects (from 80 to 260), (ii) training of PMC members (from 800 to
2600), and (iii) training of county and district officials (from 60 to 360). As noted in Section 1.6,
this Restructuring also streamlined the wording of the Project components.

17.     On June 20, 2011, the third Restructuring modified the Letter Agreement for TF094016
to reflect the EU contribution of an additional EUR 285,000. The Letter Agreement was
amended to modify the categories of eligible expenditure (Table 1) and to extend the Closing
Dates from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012. The funding was allocated toward the completion of
five additional sub-projects, although the Project’s M&E Framework was not formally revised.




20
   The entirety of the CfWTEP funding is allocated to the Community Driven Program. While the
   CfWTEP EPP refers to “Component 4: Cash for Work Employment Program” in discussion of the new
   KPI (see Section 1.3), the corresponding June 21, 2008 Grant Agreement does not specify that an
   additional component was created. Moreover, the Letter Agreement dated April 24, 2009 states:
   “pursuant to a FPCR Trust Fund Grant Agreement … dated June 21, 2008, the Recipient has received
   from the World Bank, a grant in an amount not to exceed US$3,000,000 from the FPCR Trust Fund
   towards the co-financing of certain activities under Part A of the Project.”
21
   See Section 1.3 and Annex 2 for additional detail.
22
   The Grant Agreement between GoL and the Bank did not include the five percent administrative and
   management fee charged by the Bank for administering the EU TF or the fee of US$35,000 to defer the
   costs to establish the Trust Fund.

18.     On April 18, 2012, the fourth Restructuring corrected errors in the June 20, 2011
Amendment to the TF094016 Letter Agreement regarding the financing percentages. It restored
the applicable percentage for each item (100 percent) for each respective Category of Eligible
Expenditure (Table 2), as was the original intent of the Trust Fund (TF) and consistent with
standard Bank practice, as specified in the Amendment.

19.     On June 25, 2012, the Project’s fifth and last Restructuring extended the IDA Grant
Closing Date to July 31, 2013 and the EU TF Closing Date to August 31, 2012. In addition, as
detailed in Section 1.3 above, the Restructuring revised to the Project’s M&E Framework. 23

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     The Project was designed in support of the Government and donor partner, including the
EU, USAID, and Bank, commitment to continuing to improve community access to basic
services and economic opportunities through the CDD approach. At the time of preparation, Her
Excellency President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf had endorsed LACE as the primary vehicle for
community empowerment and, as noted above, the IPRS endorsed CDD as contributing to the
Strategy’s fourth pillar regarding infrastructure and basic service delivery. The Bank’s ISN
contained a similar pillar (infrastructure and basic services) that was supported through three
investment lending operations, including CEPII.

21.      Project preparation benefitted from the implementation structures and lessons learned
under CEPI. LACE remained as the implementing partner for CEPII, thereby building on the
institutional capacity established under CEPI. Improving on the CEPI design, CEPII placed
greater emphasis on the participation of line ministries and local authorities to incorporate CEPII
sub-projects into county and sectoral development plans. The Ministries of Education (MOE)
and Health (MOH) were asked to sign Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) that
acknowledged LACE’s responsibility for constructing facilities with previous approval from the
relevant ministry and to secure ministry agreement to provide staff and other critical inputs to
these facilities.24 Although, in the end, only the MOU with MOE was signed, the one health post
under CEPII was constructed with approval from and close coordination with the MOH. LACE
did not initiate a MOU with the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) regarding the Project’s road
rehabilitation sub-projects, although the Borrower’s ICR does specify that MOPW approval was
sought for culverts, bridges, and water, sanitation, and health (WASH) sub-projects. 25

22.       The CfWTEP design complemented the Project’s original design by providing a direct
cash transfer to poor communities in the wake of the international increases in food prices in 2008.
The design benefitted from the Project’s existing implementation arrangements and LACE’s
capacity for execution. Without LACE’s existing networks and relationships across the country,
a nationwide scale-up of the size and speed of CfWTEP would not have been possible. Project
activities were deliberately labor intensive, to maximize the necessary labor force, and included
work such as roadside brushing and backfilling of potholes. The design also leveraged the
capacity of the private sector by engaging a commercial bank for the payment system.

23.      The Project design, however, may be considered overly ambitious in the scaling up of
activities from CEPI to CEPII. CEPII did include support for a capacity building program and
program management and another IDA-financing operation (Grant H3850), the Economic
Governance and Institutional Reform Project, provided supplemental support to LACE. CfWTEP
further allowed for the hiring of new LACE staff to manage these activities. Still, under CEPI,
LACE managed 100 sub-projects, whereas CEPII set an original target of 260 sub-projects within
a similar timeframe. This did not adequately reflect the continued post-conflict, low-capacity
operational context. In particular, even with Project resources available, LACE struggled to find
qualified professional staff, particularly in the areas of program management and procurement.

24.      The environmental and safeguard screening classified CEPII as a Category B project,
triggering Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). A local
consultant prepared an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) of good quality. Although LACE had demonstrated its commitment to
environmental and social safeguard issues under CEPI, weaknesses in LACE’s safeguard
compliance had been identified under CEPI. Options for strengthening LACE’s capacity were
identified during preparation but did not translate into concrete actions.26

25.     The EPP for CEPII rated procurement risk as substantial and the financial management
risk as moderate. Procurement under CEPI had been generally acceptable; even so, the EPP for
CEPII outlined additional capacity building and monitoring measures, such as hiring of new


24
   No independent assessments of Government capacity to staff education or health facilities or provide
   other key inputs (i.e. textbooks and drugs) were conducted. In addition to the MOU, the MOE and MOH
   capacity to fulfill these functions was determined primarily through their coordination with CEPI.
25
   The Borrower’s ICR is attached as Annex 7.
26
   See Section 2.4 for details.

                                                  7
procurement staff, regular procurement assessments, and intensive Bank supervision. Within the
much constrained Liberian context, the Task Team opted for the pragmatic approach of on-the-
job training during implementation; however, this could have benefitted from more precise
identification of mitigating measures to address problems as they arose. LACE’s financial
management performance under CEPI was satisfactory, with submission of acceptable audits to
IDA; therefore, FM arrangements for CEPII largely mirrored those of CEPI. Although the FM
risk for CEPII was rated as high, primarily due to the country context, LACE’s performance
under CEPI and mitigating measures proposed under CEPII led to the residual risk of moderate.

26.     There was no Quality at Entry Review conducted for CEPII.

2.2 Implementation27

27.      Institutional capital in Liberia remained extremely weak throughout implementation, with
the threat of political instability a constant problem. The fiduciary environment had few
established control mechanisms and lacked modern payment systems, leaving financial
transactions often cash-based. Limited judiciary capacity compounded the situation, while
individuals with project management and procurement skills were virtually non-existent.

28.     Given this context, the generally satisfactory implementation of CEPII (and LACE’s
performance as implementing agency) is commendable and certain innovations under the Project
noteworthy. This is especially true in light of two other factors: the additional responsibilities
LACE took on during the Project (discussed in Section 2.1 above) and the changes to Liberia’s
status as a Bank borrower. In 2007, at Project appraisal, Liberia was eligible for emergency
preparation and implementation procedures; by the Project’s closing in 2013, the country had
cleared its debt through achievement of the HIPC Completion Point and became eligible for IDA
Credits. The changing conditions and regulations required revision of LACE operating
procedures to ensure of compliance with Bank guidelines and judgments of performance.

29.      CEPII retained its satisfactory/moderately satisfactory implementation performance
ratings throughout most of its implementation, although significant delays contributed to a
moderately unsatisfactory rating between March and November 2012. The delays were due to
several challenges. First, EU co-financing did not become available until mid-2009, primarily
due to delays in signing the Administrative Agreement for the parent TF between the EU and the
Bank. Second, weaknesses in LACE’s procurement capacity identified during the 2009 Mid-
Term Review (MTR) necessitated development of new procurement templates, delaying approval
of a large number of sub-projects, particularly those funded under the EU TF. Finally, the weak
capacity of local contractors led to significant delays in completing sub-projects on time. 28

30.     The LACE team adopted several measures to overcome the delays. With Bank support,
LACE focused on improving its procurement capacity through hiring new procurement staff,
retaining an international procurement specialist, and revising its standard procurement



27
   A Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP) evaluation was undertaken in April 2010. It
   assessed the overall likelihood of achieving the development objectives as “2 = Satisfactory/Likely”.
   The QALP ratings generally agree with those of the ICR. Differences, along with the rationale for the
   diverging opinions, are noted.
28
   These challenges were not fully evident at the time of the QALP, which regarded implementation
   performance as satisfactory.

                                                   8
documents. 29 LACE also adopted a series of effective tools that improved project management.
These included submission of monthly sub-project completion reports for Bank review, creation
of four regional teams to conduct intensive site supervision, and – with Bank approval – the
development of new payment methods to increase contractor liquidity. One of the innovations
involved a materials advance to contractors, which sped up construction considerably. Even so,
implementation delays required extension of the Project by two years.

31.      The Project’s MTR had significant impact on LACE’s implementation of CEPII. It
improved LACE’s planning and budgeting process by allowing LACE to pre-determine the
number of each sub-project type and develop its annual work program and budget accordingly. It
improved LACE’s procurement management and bid evaluation process by shifting the emphasis
to cost estimates of sub-projects and qualifications of contractors. Although the actions taken to
strengthen procurement resulted in Project delays, the changes strengthened LACE’s capacity in
this key area and led to an improvement in Project implementation overall.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.      The Project’s M&E design and results monitoring was basically solid. The PDO and
KPIs generally focused on outcomes for which CEPII and LACE could be held accountable.
Indicators were generally appropriate to Project objectives and the ability of LACE to monitor
them. The school attendance indicator, however, was beyond the Project’s capacity to control or
influence. Moreover, the target of 8,910 students was based on standard norms used for school
design – not actual enrollment projections. Also, as noted in the QALP, there were no indicators
specifically directed at measuring social impact. The intermediate indicators regarding PMC
training and composition sought to measure relevant outputs, but including outcome indicators to
assess changes in communities’ capacity for collective action—while difficult to measure—could
have strengthened the M&E framework.

33.     LACE was responsible for day-to-day monitoring of CEPII’s performance and did a
credible job of data collection and utilization of this information throughout the implementation
period. IDA supervision missions rated M&E reporting as satisfactory except for the period from
June 2008 to September 2010, when the rating slipped to moderately satisfactory because
reporting on sub-projects was found to be inadequate. Findings from a Rapid Technical
Assessment of sub-projects during the MTR were instrumental in improving LACE oversight,
including increasing frequency of site visits and reporting. Experienced program staff also was
given more responsibility for M&E. Finally, a computerized data system for project monitoring,
adopted towards the end of the project, further strengthened the M&E function.

2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

34.      Environmental and Social Safeguards. Safeguard compliance was rated moderately
satisfactory throughout much of implementation, except from March 2009 to December 2010
when it was rated moderately unsatisfactory. Early supervision missions found that contractors
were carrying out their work without recourse to environmental, health, or safety considerations
and that supporting documentation relating to acquisition of land for sub-projects was weak. A
social and environmental compliance review undertaken in advance of the MTR found that
significant shortcomings persisted in the area of safeguard compliance, specifically in terms of
LACE’s monitoring and supervision of sub-projects. This led to the adoption of moderately


29
     See Section 2.4.

                                                9
unsatisfactory rating. Specific MTR recommendations included more clearly delegated
responsibilities for safeguard monitoring and the adoption of a safeguard template for field
monitoring. The template provided a simplified version of applicable policies which could be
widely distributed and used as a basic information sheet. This helped LACE make progress
toward the actions identified during the MTR and the rating was upgraded to moderately
satisfactory in December 2010. Throughout the remainder of implementation, however, some
weakness in reporting remained evident, likely owing to a failure to assign clearly the safeguard
responsibility to specific individuals in LACE.

35.      Fiduciary Compliance. FM under CEPII was rated satisfactory or moderately
satisfactory throughout implementation. Throughout Project implementation, review of the FM
systems and detailed action items sought to strengthen LACE capacity in this area. A detailed
FM review was conducted in January 2009 that made several recommendations, including: hiring
a new Internal Auditor; improving budgetary controls; strengthening the M&E unit; improving
petty cash management by PMCs; and revising conditions for staff bonuses. Action was taken to
implement these recommendations; however, a subsequent in-depth FM review in March 2012
advised to strengthen performance of the Internal Auditor; bolster FM capacity at the community
level; and improve the quality of the Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IFRs). A new Internal
Auditor was hired in May 2012 and Bank supervision noted improvements by the final FM
mission in May 2013. Particularly, LACE had instituted monthly preparation of IFRs to ensure
reconciliation and addressed issues of record keeping and petty cash management. FM capacity
at the community level, however, remained weak and LACE had difficulty conducting routine
reconciliations of its financial records with those of the PMCs. Although delayed in a few cases,
LACE submitted annual external audits throughout the CEPII, which were without qualification.

36.      Procurement Management.           Procurement compliance was rated moderately
unsatisfactory from March 2009 to April 2011, although the rating improved to moderately
satisfactory by the Project’s closure. Issues concerning: i) adequacy of OM procurement
guidelines; ii) procurement planning; iii) LACE procurement capacity; iv) misunderstanding of
key aspects of the bidding and IDA approval processes; and v) undercapitalized and
inexperienced contractors surfaced early and remained significant impediments throughout the
implementation of CEPII. A 2009 procurement review identified challenges in several of these
areas and prepared a revised bid evaluation document, strengthened relevant sections in the OM,
and recommended that LACE use the revised bid evaluation form to re-conduct evaluations of 65
sub-projects prior to awarding contracts. The MTR in 2010 found that the changes from the 2009
review were not being followed, prompting more thorough review and revision. Developing new
procurement procedures took time. The bidding templates in particular required extensive
consultation between LACE and the Bank, as well as within the Bank team, to balance the CDD
approach with procurement regulations. A 2012 Post Procurement Review (PPR) identified
continuing shortcomings with contract documentation and record keeping, as well as the
constitution of bid evaluation panels. In 2012, a new International Procurement Specialist,
experienced in Bank procurement regulations, was hired and helped improve LACE procurement
management. The final PPR, conducted at the Project’s closing in June/July 2013, noted
improvements in overall procurement capacity, although identified the need for continued
progress on document management. Throughout implementation, as noted above, LACE
struggled to find qualified procurement staff.

37.    Under the Project, there was one incidence of a cancelled procurement, valued at
US$6,500. Recruitment for the FY11 external audit was conducted according to Bank prior
review guidelines; however, the final contract was signed on September 16, 2012 prior to the


                                               10
issuance of the No Objection for the selection of the firm on December 22, 2011. This contract
was paid through the Government budgetary support received by LACE.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

38.     As noted elsewhere, CEPII helped to establish LACE as a capable implementing agency
of and for the Government of Liberia. Since its inception, LACE has received Government
funding to support its operating costs; however, in FY13, Government support for LACE was
expanded to include a US$3.3 million programmatic allocation for construction of basic social
services throughout the country. These activities mirror those undertaken through CEPII and
build directly on the capacity that LACE developed under the Project. The Government’s FY14
budget allocates an additional US$5.0 million to LACE to continue these activities.

39.     In addition, CEPII contributed to a number of social protection initiatives by providing an
entry point for the Bank to open a broader dialogue with the Government on social protection
policies and programs. Bank support for CEPII provided opportunities for routine interaction
with Bank social protection specialists, which was critical to both the development of the social
protection dialogue within Liberia and the Bank’s current social protection agenda in the country.
This included development of the public works-based activities under CfWTEP, which served as
a basis for design of the ongoing US$16 million Youth, Employment, Skills (YES) Project,
funded by the Bank and jointly implemented by LACE and the Ministry of Youth and Sports
(MOYS). Additional financing of US$3.4 million for the LACE activities of the YES Project is
currently under preparation, with the aim of informing future Bank investment lending envisioned
for FY15. The CfWTEP design also has informed activities under the MOYS-implemented
Liberia Youth Employment Program (LYEP), a nationally-funded initiative.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

40.     The following assessment of outcomes maintains a single narrative assessment of the
achievement of the PDO given that the revision to the PDO occurred early during the Project’s
implementation on June 21, 2008, when only 3 percent of the total Project allocation had been
disbursed. The revisions expanded the scope of the PDO, to add urban beneficiary areas and the
labor-intensive public works program, and this expanded scope is discussed throughout this
section. Changes to the KPIs under the June 21, 2008 Restructuring (3 percent disbursement) and
June 25, 2012 (79 percent disbursement) are discussed in Section 3.2 as related to the
achievement of each KPI.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial
41.      The Project’s relevance is rated substantial given that its objectives, design, and
implementation arrangements remained relevant to the country context, Liberian development
priorities, and Bank assistance policies and programs throughout implementation. CEPII
objectives continued to be consistent with the development policies of both the Government and
the Bank as they evolved during the Project period. The Government’s first full PRS in 2008
noted, “one of the Government’s foremost objectives was … the rehabilitation of infrastructure
and the rebuilding of systems to deliver basic services.” The second PRS, launched in 2012,
maintained a focus on infrastructure development and added a pillar devoted to human
development, including social protection, which corresponded with the original PDO of CEPII as
well as the PDO as expanded under CfWTEP. Social protection was included as part of the third


                                                11
pillar (supporting pro-poor growth) in the Bank’s FY2009-2011 CAS, and CEPII was specifically
mentioned as a vehicle for achieving this objective.

42.     The Project design responded to the country’s ongoing and evolving needs. As noted
above, at preparation, the Government and donor partners supported design of a coordinated
CDD intervention based on the successful implementation of CEPI. However, while the
consolidation of CDD interventions reflects well on the Project design, the resultant increase in
the size of the CEPII, as compared to CEPI, may be considered a design flaw in light of the
country context, LACE’s extant capacity, and the time allocated for Project implementation.

43.      The expansion of the CEPII design to include CfWTEP provided a mechanism for rapid
relief from the food crisis and contributed to the continued relevance of the Project design. The
temporary employment activities were modeled on LACE’s CDD approach developed under
CEPI and CEPII, helping to ensure that the public works could be rolled out quickly. As noted in
Section 2.5, this revision of the Project’s design led to the expansion of public works activities
under the Bank-funded YES Project and also provided lessons for implementation of the
Government-funded LYEP, launched in 2013.

44.     Implementation reinforced the continuing relevance of the CDD approach and LACE’s
capacity as the Government’s primary vehicle for community empowerment. The LACE
implementation arrangements prioritized community mobilization and engagement, while also
building capacity of its local NGO partners. LACE’s ability to accommodate the new needs of
CfWTEP further speaks to the appropriateness of these arrangements. As noted in Section 2.5,
the Government’s allocation of resources to continue similar activities in FY13 and FY14 is a
concrete demonstration of its confidence in this approach.

45.     Finally, two recent Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reports confirm the continuing
relevance of CEPII’s objectives, design, and implementation. The Liberia: World Bank Country-
Level Engagement on Governance and Anti-Corruption (Working Paper No. 11/8) noted: “the
Bank’s engagement … through LACE has been very relevant in supporting the Government’s
primary goal of delivering results.” The IEG Liberia Country Program Evaluation: 2004-2011
states: “In the area of social protection, early interventions have produced positive results,
including the rehabilitation of war-torn communities, the mitigation of adverse effects from the
food crisis, and the development of institutional capacity at LACE.”

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial
46.     The achievement of the revised PDO is rated substantial given the Project’s performance
against its key performance indicators. The Project’s three KPIs related directly to the
achievement of the PDO to improve communities’ access to basic infrastructure and provide
economic opportunities for vulnerable households in urban and rural areas through: (a) a
community driven approach; (b) a labor-intensive public works program; and (c) the provision of
capacity building at the community and local government levels. As detailed below, two of the
Project’s revised key indicators were achieved and the third was largely achieved. Achievement
of the PDO is further supported by the attainment of five of the seven intermediate indicators.

47.     The Project achieved the KPI that at least 90 percent of sub-projects undertaken reflect
beneficiary priorities and are implemented in collaboration with local authorities. In fact, 100
percent of sub-projects appear to reflect beneficiary priorities. The Beneficiary Assessment (BA)
and ICR missions affirmed that all sampled communities were satisfied with the type of sub-

                                               12
projects constructed through the Project. Communities sampled in the BA confirmed that the
sub-projects had met basic needs and improved living standards (the schools and WASH
facilities), strengthened economic opportunities (the markets), and opened up transport corridors,
enhancing trade (culverts and bridges). In the BA, WASH was the most commonly requested
type of sub-project, with nearly all communities (97 percent) expressing this need. These
accounted for nearly one third of all completed CEPII sub-projects. The large number of
transportation infrastructure sub-projects (culverts and bridges represented 56 percent of sub-
projects) also reflected the expressed needs of communities. Many BA respondents stated that
good roads allowed for transportation of materials to build other essential infrastructure and
participate more actively in commerce. One mismatch of the Project appears to be in health
services. Ninety percent of the sampled communities listed a clinic, hospital, or health center
among their needs, yet only one health post was built under the Project. This resulted from
staffing constraints within the MOH, as previously discussed, suggesting that the allocation of
resources to other types of sub-projects was appropriate. 30

48.      Collaboration with LGAs, most specifically through attendance of groundbreaking and
dedication events, was reported by LACE and confirmed by the ICR mission. In addition, the
over-achievement of the intermediate indicator regarding the project management training for
LGAs (530 district/county officials as compared to the targeted 360) highlights LACE’s
engagement of the local authorities. The BA assessment found that LGAs were involved in two-
thirds of the sub-projects sampled.

49.      In total, 244 sub-projects were completed under CEPII, representing 92 percent of the
265 targeted sub-projects. During the February 2013 supervision mission, the Bank and LACE
agreed not to initiate any new sub-projects given the likelihood that they could not be completed
by the July 2013 closing date. At the time, 260 sub-projects were ongoing; this decision was not
reflected through a formal Restructuring of the intermediate indicator. In regards to types of sub-
projects constructed, the following targets were set: 33 schools, six markets, 52 bridges, 85
WASH facilities, one health clinic, and 88 culverts. 31 By the Project’s closing date, 30 schools,
six markets, 49 bridges, 69 WASH facilities, one health post, and 89 culverts had been
completed. LACE has committed Government of Liberia resources to completing the remaining
16 sub-projects. Of the 260 sub-projects launched, 82 were in urban areas while the remainder
was spread throughout rural communities in all 15 counties.

50.      The Project achieved 92 percent of the KPI target of having 8,910 children attending
school in “improved” facilities as defined by technical assessment. 32 By October 2013, at the
start of the 2013/14 school year, 8,596 children were enrolled in the 30 schools completed under
CEPII. 33 School attendance was a poor indicator, as ensuring school attendance was well beyond
LACE’s ability to influence or control. Moreover, enrollment targets were based not on actual
enrollment projections, but on standard norms used for school designs. LACE followed MOE



30
   The findings of the BA are discussed in further detail in Section 3.5 and Annex 5 below.
31
   These targets were adopted in the June 2012 Restructuring after LACE had engaged communities
   regarding their priorities for the types of sub-project constructed.
32
   The target for this indicator was adopted on June 25, 2012 (79 percent disbursement); however, this
   value is used to measure achievement of this key performance indicator throughout the Project period
   given that the CDD approach did not allow for targets to be set at preparation. In addition, revisions to
   the M&E Framework at the MTR attempted to broaden this KPI to measure access to other services,
   particularly markets and WASH, but these proposals were never reflected in the Project Restructurings.
33
   This figure was collected by LACE M&E Staff as reported by MOE staff.

                                                    13
guidelines and built six-room primary schools designed to accommodate 270 students each. Of
the target of 33 primary schools under CEPII, LACE launched construction of 31 and 30 were
completed by the Project’s closing date. The one additional school construction is being
completed with Government resources.

51.     The 30 completed schools meet the three set criteria for “improved” facilities, as defined
under the June 2008 Restructuring. 34 The buildings follow the national MOE designs, to allow
for year-round functionality, and include WASH (with separate latrines for boys and girls) and
furniture in the standard school sub-project package. The Project’s technical assessment was
conducted at the MTR. This allowed for assessment of the CEPI schools to inform construction
of the CEPII schools but, therefore, was completed before the majority of CEPII schools were
constructed. However, funding for second technical assessment resources was not sufficient to
cover this work without further reducing the number of beneficiary communities.

52.      Originally, the Project’s KPI on access to basic services included not only school
enrollment but also access to basic health services, as measured by the population of the
catchment area of the facilities. LACE estimates that the one health post constructed under CEPII
has a catchment area of 20,000 persons. This is against an original Project target of at least 7,500
people per health clinic. However, this part of the access to basic services KPI was dropped
during the Project’s June 2008 Restructuring (3 percent disbursement). The emphasis on health
clinics was reduced when the challenges of properly staffing and equipping such facilities became
clear. At the close of CEPI in December 31, 2008, of the ten clinics constructed under that
Project, five were supported by Government, one was operated by an international NGO, and four
remained without staff. Given that this challenge was recognized and addressed early during
implementation, the removal of this indicator is not seen to significantly impact the Project’s
overall achievement of the PDO.

53.      The Project exceeded the third KPI, both in its original and revised wording, as measured
by a quantitative assessment of CfWTEP. 35 Originally the KPI specified that at least 10,000
targeted vulnerable households report increased income of at least 20 percent. An independent
quantitative evaluation of CfWTEP estimates that 80 percent of beneficiaries (approximately
13,600 persons) fell below the country’s poverty line. The CfWTEP wage of US$120 per
beneficiary represents 50 percent of both the urban and rural poverty lines (US$241 and US$242
per annum, respectively). 36 As revised, the indicator set a target of a 20 percent reduction in
poverty gap of targeted vulnerable households. The CfWTEP evaluation found achievement of a
27 percent reduction in the poverty gap of the vulnerable households targeted. The CfWTEP
activities reached 17,000 individuals, although the number of unique households participating
was not recorded. Of these individuals, 8,293 resided in urban and 8,707 were in rural
communities.

54.      Moreover, the CfWTEP evaluation provided encouraging results about the possible long-
term impact of the Project on livelihoods and economic opportunity. The quantitative assessment
showed that a significant portion of wages went to investments in children’s education (31
percent) as well as for farm and non-farm investments (14.2 percent). These results may be due
in part to the timing of payments, in some cases just after school fees were due, although the fact

35
   The third KPI was added with the Project’s first Restructuring on June 21, 2008 (3 percent disbursement).
   It was reworded under the Project’s last Restructuring on June 25, 2012 (79 percent disbursement).

that the wages received represented a high share of the household’s total earnings may also have
allowed for these investments. In addition, 90 percent of respondents reported that, through
CfWTEP, they had their first interaction ever with a commercial bank. 37

55.      The intermediate indicator linked to the temporary employment activities was not
achieved. LACE created 680,000 work days through these activities, below the target of 800,000.
The shortfall was due to the fact that, in the CfWTEP Operational Guidelines, the Government
and the Bank agreed to raise the daily wage rate for the program from US$2.50 (as originally
outlined in the EPP) to US$3.00 per day to align with other ongoing temporary employment
programs. Given the funding available, this meant reducing the number of person-days of
temporary employment. The change in daily wage was made in direct response to the
Government’s request for this harmonization and did not impact the total value of the cash
transfer to beneficiary households through the Project.

56.      The five remaining intermediate indicators were achieved. These indicators aimed to
measure the achievement of the PDO by providing communities the opportunity to identify their
needs, support design, implementation, and management of sub-projects in a gender-balanced
manner, and be responsible for bank accounts and the appropriate and efficient utilization of sub-
project resources -- all of which contributed to the higher level goal of empowering communities.

57.     Regarding gender equity, the Project exceeded the intermediate target that women
constitute half of the membership in at least 90 percent of the PMCs. In fact, gender parity was
achieved in all cases, as evidenced by the recorded minutes of the meetings electing PMC
members and confirmed during the ICR mission. Although a specific male/female ratio was not
verified in the BA, respondents confirmed the broad-based and inclusive nature of PMC
membership, noting the presence of men and women, as well as elders and youth.

58.     The organizational capacity of and empowerment at the community and local
government levels were measured through three interrelated indicators: i) number of PMC
members and county/district officials successfully trained; ii) percentage of PMCs managing their
own bank accounts; and iii) the percentage of communities that have minutes of the meeting
electing PMCs. Targets for training (2,650 PMC members and 360 local officials) were fully
achieved. As reported by LACE, 2,650 PMC members and 530 local officials were trained
during CEPII. For the second two indicators, targets were 90 percent. LACE affirmed that 100
percent of the communities managed their own bank accounts and that 90 percent of the
communities had minutes from the meetings where PMC members had been elected. The ICR
mission verified a sample of the LACE records on PMC bank accounts and clarified with LACE
what was meant by PMCs managing their own bank accounts. LACE noted that, according to the
Operations Manual (OM), transactions required the signatures of designated individuals from
both LACE and the PMCs. The ICR mission also undertook a random review of the records of
the meetings in which the PMCs were elected and confirms the reporting by LACE on this
indicator. Section 3.5 below discusses further the social impact of CEPII at the community level.

59.     Lastly, a target to keep project management expenses below 13 percent of expenditures
was set to measure management efficiency of the Project. Percentages varied slightly over the
years, but always fell below the target. At Project closing, the management expenses, as
measured by the final Project allocation of all three funding sources, were at 10.8 percent.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial
60.     Overall efficiency of the Project is rated as substantial based on the cost effectiveness of
the CDD approach and LACE’s ability to deliver both community-based, small-scale construction
sub-projects, albeit with some delays in implementation, and CfWTEP in a cost-effective manner.

61.      Although there were no economic rate of return (ERR) calculations for CEPII, recent
projects with similar CDD infrastructure components can be used as an indication of the
efficiency likely achieved under CEPII. The Comoros Services Support Project, for example,
demonstrated very high ERR for several types of sub-projects, such as schools, WASH, and road
rehabilitation, that are similar to those constructed under CEPII. The Comoros analysis
underscored the efficiency of CDD sub-projects by noting the economic and social gains realized
within beneficiary communities through improved transportation, greater access to markets and
cultivable land, improved health conditions through access to potable water and cleaner public
areas, reductions in household time spent finding clean water, and costs savings on market goods
through improved roads. It also found positive ERR correlated with the school sub-projects,
specifically regarding time saved through reduced walking distances to classrooms. These
benefits are similar to those reported by CEPII beneficiaries in the BA.

62.     In addition, the Project appears to have represented the least-cost solution for improving
community access to basic services, especially given the post-conflict context. LACE efficiently
allocated resources for the construction activities in comparison with regional norms. For
example, schools constructed under CEPII cost approximately US$90,000, with six classrooms
and WASH facilities. This is approximately US$15,000 per classroom. By comparison, data
from recent education sector ICRs in other low capacity and fragile contexts (Benin, Burundi,
Cote d’Ivoire, Northern Uganda, and Tanzania) show per classroom construction costs between
US$20,000 and US$25,000 when using national competitive bidding procurement methods.

63.      The efficiency of the temporary employment component also appears satisfactory based
on wage share, targeting performance, and proportionate wage gain. Cost effectiveness of the
CfWTEP component is estimated at 0.51 based on the methodology developed in Ravallion
(1998) based on these three factors. 38 First, the labor intensity (share of wages paid in total public
works costs) was 68 percent. This is on par with international standards; public works in India,
Bangladesh, and Korea have rates between 60 and 70 percent, with higher rates in Ethiopia (85
percent) and lower rates in Argentina (40 to 50 percent). Second, the wage targeting performance
(proportion of the wages paid to poor workers), as detailed in Section 3.5, was found to be
approximately 80 percent. This compares well to programs in Ethiopia (87 percent) and
Argentina (70-80 percent poor), although the Liberian poverty rate of over 60 percent likely
contributes to this positive targeting performance. Third, the net wage gain (share of the gross
wages received after accounting for foregone income) was very high (93 percent). Approximately
75 percent participants had no other income or employment before the program. In comparison,
public works in India estimated net gain at 75 percent, while in Argentina the estimate was only
50 percent. 39 This cost analysis does not capture economic gains resulting from public works
activities that opened and improved road infrastructure.

     The calculation of the effectiveness of the CfWTEP is detailed in Annex 3.

                                                   16
64.      In terms of program management, LACE delivered good value-for-money as an
implementing agency; however, implementation delays, and the resulting two-year extension of
the Project period, reduced its overall efficient implementation. As noted above, at Project
closure, LACE’s operating ratio for CEPII was 10.8 percent, below the project target of 13
percent. 40 This operating cost was achieved despite two additional years of operating costs
resulting from the Project’s extensions. Nevertheless, delays in implementation of the sub-
projects negatively affected the Project’s efficiency. The BA noted that delays experienced at the
time of these focus groups contributed to a sense of frustration among many participants.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

65.      The Project’s overall performance outcome is rated as moderately satisfactory based on
its relevance, achievement of the PDO, and efficiency. Despite some overly ambitious targets of
the Project’s design, CEPII remained relevant to Liberia's post-conflict development needs and
the Bank’s priorities for support. It engendered the creation of an institution capable of
implementing Government and donor-financed programs effectively and efficiently. The
addition of the temporary employment activities was highly relevant under the circumstances and
led to development of a new free-standing IDA-funded operation. CEPII achieved the target that
over 90 percent of sub-projects reflect community priorities and exceeded its targeted poverty gap
reduction amongst CfWTEP beneficiaries. Enrollment in CEPII schools, the third KPI, was 92
percent of the target.41 Five of seven of the intermediate indicators were achieved. Moreover,
these achievements appear to have been made fairly efficiently. Efficiency outcomes in the
temporary employment component, as well as cost comparisons of the CEPII-built schools, were
good relative to regional norms. LACE also maintained an operating ratio below the Project
target. Implementation delays, however, meant that many of the sub-projects were completed in
2013, as compared to an original end-target date of 2011.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

66.      As evidenced from the evaluations of CfWTEP and the Project’s BA, the Project appears
to have had a positive impact on poverty, gender dynamics, and social development. Project
benefits, in terms of increased access to better basic services, improved to economic
infrastructure and employment opportunities, and reached the intended target groups, which
originally had limited access to basic social services.42 Moreover, results of the qualitative and
quantitative assessments of CfWTEP indicate that the targeting of the program was effective with
an estimated 80 percent of the target group being either poor or extremely poor. Using a variety
of indicators (wealth asset and estimated consumption level) as well as methods (different
matching techniques for estimating consumption and wealth indicators were considered), the




40
   This does not include the Government budgetary allocation provided to LACE during implementation.
41
   The KPI regarding health clinics was not achieved, but the fact that it was dropped soon after
   implementation began (3 percent disbursement) was entirely appropriate and demonstrated the Bank’s
   and the Government’s ability to adapt quickly to the emerging reality that the clinics would not be
   adequately staffed.
42
   See Section 3.2 and 3.6, and Annex 5.

                                                 17
share of the participants estimated to be poor varied from 60 to 90 percent, with the estimate of
about 80 percent of participants being poor being the most likely. 43

67.     The gender impact also appeared to be largely positive. As noted earlier, the target of
having 50 percent women on PMCs was achieved. In addition, 46 percent of the CfWTEP
beneficiaries were women, exceeding the 30 percent quota adopted in the CfWTEP Operational
Guidelines. However, the BA found that women, while involved in the PMC, were less
knowledgeable about the sub-project, particularly on selection and cost, than their male
counterparts. In one third of the sampled communities, women who were not part of the PMC
were not involved in the sub-project selection process. 44

68.      The BA suggests that the Project was successful in empowering communities, a finding
underscored during the interviews and site visits conducted by the ICR mission. 45 The BA
highlights that the creation of PMCs had a positive impact in getting community members more
involved in attending town meetings and participating in decisions that affected them and their
communities’ development. PMC members benefited from their PMC membership, building
civic skills such as team-work, problem solving, effective listening, and advocacy, as well as
learning how to conduct productive meetings, motivate people, and represent themselves vis-à-vis
others (i.e. LACE, contractors, CFs, and local authorities). The BA noted that roughly two-thirds
of the communities surveyed reached out to NGOs or Government for additional assistance
following the CEPII intervention. CEPII also connected many beneficiaries to formal banking
systems for the first time, strengthening their ability to operate in a modern financial environment.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

69.     At both national and local levels, the positive institutional impact of CEPII was
considerable. As noted above, LACE emerged as an effective implementing agency, evidenced
by its continued funding from both the Bank and Government. Community-level implementing
capacity was also strengthened through creation of PMCs, which the BA noted had a positive
impact in terms of increasing communities’ awareness about and involvement in their town’s
development. Thus, while there is no evidence suggesting that PMCs will continue functioning
as formal implementing agencies, they have enhanced communities’ ability to understand how
such entities must be organized to function as agents of economic development and operate in a
transparent, accountable, and participatory manner. However, the BA found little change to the
way community members viewed their local authorities, suggesting minimal overall impact on
enhancing the role of local governments in community development or in strengthening the link
between communities and their local government. 46

70.     One area where CEPII did not appear to have much institutional impact was in advancing
the Government’s decentralization agenda. As outlined in the original EPP, the Project would
explore the role for LACE to work with LGAs to strengthen their role in community development.
Project resources were devoted to training of county and district officials in this capacity and
early supervision missions put forth specific steps to engage the LGAs more actively in sub-
project activities and community life. While the trainings did take place as intended, LGAs

   Responding to Crisis in Low Income, Fragile Countries, June 2011.

   See Section 3.6 and Annex 5.
45
   The findings of the BA are discussed in additional detail in Section 3.6 and Annex 5.
46
   Ibid.

                                                18
participation in the sub-project process, as reported in the BA, was mixed and, as noted above, the
BA found little to no change in communities’ perceptions of the LGAs following the CEPII
intervention.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

71.     As discussed above, the CfWTEP activities achieved their intended impact to increase
economic opportunities for beneficiaries; however, this activity, under which people were paid
for work, had an unintended consequence on the other CEPII subprojects. While the benefit
under the CfWTEP was the wages earned through the public works, the other CEPII subprojects
benefitted communities through the construction of basic services and asked these communities to
contribute ten percent of the subproject value toward its completion. In practice, this was done
primarily through in-kind contributions of local materials or labor. Following the introduction of
the CfWTEP, LACE witnessed, in some instances, a change in community willingness to
contribute labor without compensation. Separate from the community contribution aspect, LACE
does note that the CEPII construction subprojects had a positive local effect on job opportunities,
through the use of Liberian contractors who would hire locally when possible.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops 47

72.      The CEPII BA was undertaken in May and June 2012 and substantiates a number of key
findings regarding CEPII and LACE performance. 48 A random sample of 30 communities across
6 counties was selected, which constituted about 12 percent of all sub-projects eventually
completed. Focus group discussions were organized separately for PMC and non-PMC members,
with both disaggregated by gender. The BA confirmed that the sub-projects selected reflected
community choice. The vast majority of communities expressed satisfaction with the type of
infrastructure provided and was uniform in the opinion that the benefits of sub-projects would be
positive and widespread. However, neither the BA nor the ICR mission found concrete
maintenance plans in place or arrangements for financing maintenance and minor repairs. 49 As
highlighted in Section 3.5(b) above, the BA found the positive impact of the PMCs in getting
community members more involved in attending town meetings, participating in decisions that
affected them and the development of their town, and building skills useful to the development of
a functioning civil society. Approximately three quarters of the communities sampled for the BA
expressed satisfaction with LACE’s performance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial
73.      The overall risk to the development outcome is rated substantial. Of the risks identified
at project preparation, the most important ones entail future maintenance of the physical
infrastructure. The BA and ICR missions confirmed community commitment to support
maintenance of the facilities; however, no concrete maintenance plans were developed in any
community involved in the BA or visited by the ICR mission. Moreover, various supervision


47
   Annex 5 provides a detailed summary of the BA, along with observations the ICR mission.
48
   The BA focus groups were conducted during a period when the Project and the sub-projects surveyed
   were experiencing delays. In fact, only four of the 30 sub-projects surveyed were complete. Many
   others had barely started. This undoubtedly had an impact on participants’ responses to some questions.
   The BA did not cover CfWTEP activities, which had been evaluated previously.
49
   See Section 4 for additional detail.

                                                   19
missions reported that the backfilling of bridges and culverts (a necessary undertaking each year
after the rainy season) was incomplete and left these structures subject to erosion. Another risk
centers on recurrent costs for the infrastructure investments, particularly for schools. The MOU
between the MOE and LACE helps to mitigate this risk, but the MOE struggles with these
provisions nationally and therefore may not be able to staff these schools fully. During its site
visits, the ICR mission did note community willingness to recruit teachers locally when the MOE
does not meet its obligation.

74.      The Project did not materially contribute to decentralization of decision-making to local
authorities or build up their role vis-à-vis community development. This was not an explicit
objective of the Project and is unlikely to affect the specific CEPII sub-projects but could affect
the wider development agenda. The 2013 global IEG study, World Bank Assistance to Low-
Income Fragile and Conflict-Affected States, highlights a general shortcoming that “CDD
programs are not joined up with local governments … (and that) the Bank has not instituted
alternative mechanisms to ensure their viability beyond the live of the project supporting them.”
As noted elsewhere, this risk is mitigated in Liberia where LACE programming is supported
directly by Government budget contributions; however, like CEPII, this funding emphasizes
expanding basic service infrastructure, not decentralization. Decentralization reforms in Liberia
have not progressed and LGA officials remain centrally appointed. Instead Government’s focus
has been on deconcentration, led by the line ministries with each ministry independently
responsible for these processes. Over the longer term, failure to sufficiently address this key
linkage between communities and the Government could affect evolution of a more responsive
governmental structure overall. The IEG Liberia Country Program Evaluation: 2004-2011
identified the failure to develop a coherent decentralization strategy as a failing, not of CEPII, but
of the Government’s program. It notes that “progress on decentralization has been constrained by
limited devolution of decision-making authority, although to some extent administrative functions
are being transferred from central to local agencies (with officials appointed from the center).”

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
75.      During preparation, the Task Team was led by an experienced Bank staff member with
strong post-conflict and CDD experience. Adequate resources were available to the Team, which
was supported by the SDV’s coordinator for CDD and a senior staff from HDN specialized in
CDD and social protection. Bank senior, regional, country, and sector management placed high
priority on delivery of the overall Liberia portfolio and CEPI and CEPII benefitted accordingly.

76.      Preparation strengths and weaknesses, many of which were attributable to the Bank, have
been discussed under Section 2.1. Assessment of fiduciary risk was realistic. Attention to social
and environmental safeguards was generally satisfactory, but could have been improved by
insisting upon more detailed monitoring arrangements to oversee compliance in place during
preparation. Gender and community empowerment issues were adequately addressed as
evidenced in the design of effective targeting mechanisms, gender balance in the composition of
PMCs, and emphasis on stakeholder participation at every step in the sub-project process. The
need to strengthen LACE’s institutional capacity through staffing and continuous professional
training was incorporated into the design as well. Additional staffing for CfWTEP was adequate,


                                                 20
as evidenced by its smooth implementation. Finally, the arrangements for M&E were satisfactory,
with exception of the school enrollment/attendance indicator.

77.      A weakness in Bank performance was ensuring that LACE’s procurement management
arrangements were satisfactory. It is not entirely clear where the problem lay: in the failure to
recognize and sufficiently address endemic weaknesses left over from CEPI; the country context,
which made finding qualified procurement staff difficult; or the Bank’s adoption of regular, rather
than emergency, procedures during the Project period that resulted in demonstrably higher
implementation standards for LACE. But the fact that early CEPII supervision missions raised
issues that had surfaced under CEPI suggests that some lessons were not learned or sufficiently
addressed during project preparation through a clear program of actions to mitigate risk.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Highly Satisfactory
78.      The Bank worked closely with LACE throughout CEPII. There were 13 formal
supervisions missions that were pro-active in identifying implementation issues and following up
on their resolution in subsequent missions. There was a good balance of skills on Bank missions,
with nearly universal participation of Financial Management and Procurement Specialists and
frequent participation of the Social and Environmental Specialist. The Bank team also drew on
cross-country post conflict and CDD experience in providing relevant and practical advice,
including on techniques for targeting in the absence of data, fiduciary issues, adjusting LACE’s
structure and staffing as its mandate grew, designing a cash-for-work scheme quickly and
efficiently, and developing guidelines covering LACE’s relations with LGAs and social sector
ministries. Although the Project’s Task Team Leader changed three times, there was good
transition and hand-over between them. The EU was an early and active partner in the CEPII
design and remained so throughout implementation.

79.     The Bank team also ensured regular in-depth review of the Project. The MTR was
successful not only in gathering information through various in-depth reviews, such as
compliance and technical assessments, but also in discussing and reflecting on the findings, then
developing workable solutions in a collaborative manner. 50 The CEPII technical studies
undertaken by the Bank were of good quality. They informed implementation, evaluated the
impact of sub-projects on beneficiaries, and contributed to the assessment of CfWTEP as a
successful and replicable project. As in Section 3.2, the Project could have benefited from a
second technical assessment regarding the quality of the sub-projects from an engineering
perspective, but resources were not sufficient to cover this work without further reducing the
number of beneficiary communities.

80.      The Bank also demonstrated good flexibility during implementation. The fact that
construction of clinics was stopped early on was appropriate under the circumstances and a good
judgment call on the Bank’s part. The timely addition of CfWTEP to CEPII also allowed the
Government to respond quickly to the international food price crisis. Two areas of Bank
flexibility were especially appreciated by LACE. One was the Bank’s willingness to repost

     and CEPII (2010); ii) Liberia: Cash for Work Temporary Employment Project: A Qualitative Assessment

expenses originally incurred under Bank financing to the EU TF. While not materially affecting
the overall funding allocations under CEPII, it allowed LACE to fully utilize EU funds by the TF
closing date of August 2012. The other action was the Bank’s decision to allow for an advance of
construction materials to contractors. This innovative solution allowed contractors to mobilize
more quickly and thereby speed up construction.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
81.     The overall performance of the Bank is judged to be satisfactory. Preparation benefitted
from a strong Task Team of diverse specialists and lessons from CEPI, although failure to
identify weaknesses in procurement capacity from the outset likely contributed to later delays to
build procurement capacity during the Project. However, the Team’s supervision of the Project
was highly pro-active. Missions and external assessments, of both LACE capacity and the
Project activities, were conducted on a regular basis. The Bank’s flexibility, innovativeness, and
responsiveness during implementation were exemplary.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
82.      The Liberian Government supported a CDD approach from the outset. It endorsed the
creation of an independent implementing agency to oversee CDD and highlighted the importance
of this approach in its development planning policies. Support for LACE remained strong
throughout CEPII and was evident at the highest levels. In fact, the Government has increasingly
used LACE for implementation. Moreover, although counterpart financing was not a requirement,
the Government provided funding to LACE during CEPII to support its management and
administrative costs. This contributed to keeping the proportion of operating expenditures
financed by the Project under 13 percent. This supplemental funding also was critical to LACE’s
ability to continue construction of the 16 sub-projects that remained incomplete on the Project’s
closing date. The Government ensured that LACE was a full and active partner in any and all
discussions affecting its status and operations, especially as concerned the donor community.

83.      Against this picture, two areas of weakness could be considered: i) the limited
engagement of the MOH, which compromised the feasibility of the rehabilitation/construction of
health clinics and ii) limited enhanced capacity of LGA to be a proactive and responsive
participant in the development agenda of communities. 51 Nevertheless, it is the opinion of the
ICR that these weaknesses do not materially affect the Government’s satisfactory performance
rating, particularly considering the overall low capacity context that, as noted above, limits the
availability of qualified personnel.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
84.      LACE was successful as an implementing agency and it is likely to be a sustainable
institution, thanks in large part to the experience gained under CEPII and the funds and support


51
     The BA found LGA participation in approximately two thirds of samples communities; however, much
     of this engagement was limited to the groundbreaking and/or dedication ceremonies for sub-projects.

                                                     22
provided by the World Bank and EU. LACE’s good performance was due in part to its strong
and effective management, the consistent support from high levels of Government, a stable and
qualified staff, and an active and involved Board of Directors.

85.     LACE remained fully committed to achieving the CEPII PDO. The Project was intended
to involve communities throughout sub-project identification, design, and implementation, and
LACE ensured that this consultation took place in a timely and participatory manner. The BA
confirmed communities’ satisfaction with LACE’s performance. Early in implementation LACE
also developed an MOU with the MOE that outlined the responsibilities of each with respect to
the schools being constructed. This framework provided a good context for a continuous
dialogue between the two agencies, and contributed to the MOE also engaging LACE for school
construction outside of CEPII. 52

86.      LACE’s organizational structure was generally appropriate to and adequate for its
responsibilities, although the substantial scaling up of LACE activities (from 80 to 265 sub-
projects and the addition of CfWTEP) presented a challenge to its institutional capacity. Overall
LACE had strong and consistent management throughout the Project, which was certainly to its
credit, although other staffing issues arose during implementation which had a negative impact on
implementation, including that the Deputy Executive Director post was vacant for about two
years. Vacancies in other key areas (internal audit, procurement, M&E) also hampered LACE’s
effectiveness. Issues of compliance with Bank guidelines and those in its own OM did arise
during implementation (particularly, as noted above, surrounding procurement). Once these
problems surfaced, LACE management moved quickly to address them, although with varying
degrees of success. In some instances, when responsibilities grew or changed, such as with the
addition of CfWTEP, LACE was able to adjust quickly and effectively. In other key areas,
implementation delays arose from prolonged capacity weaknesses. As noted above, revision to
the LACE procurement unit and procedures required extensive assistance and resulted delayed
Project activities for over one year following the MTR.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
87.      In light of the Government’s satisfactory performance (as evidenced by its ongoing
support to improving access to services and of LACE) and the implementing agency’s moderately
satisfactory performance (as evidenced by its strong commitment to achieving the PDO and
overcoming implementation challenges toward this end), the overall borrower performance is
rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

88.        The following are some of the lessons learned from implementing CEPII:

        The CDD approach can be an effective instrument not only to empower communities but
         also to develop leadership and implementation capacity of local institutions that can
         enhance social service delivery in the short term and facilitate between different
         stakeholders in fragile environments. While line ministry and local authority capacity

     As noted elsewhere, a similar MOU with MOH was drafted but never finalized. This did not materially
     affect the outcome of CEPII, however, as only one clinic was constructed and, for this sub-project, there
     was active engagement between LACE and MOH.

                                                      23
          remains relatively limited, there is the institutional space for complementary local
          institutions, such as LACE, to act as intermediaries between communities, LGAs, and the
          central Government and line Ministries. This is particularly applicable when the relevant
          line ministries and local governments understand and agree to adhere to their respective
          sector norms and standards including the maintenance of facilities and provision of staff
          and recurrent costs in the post-completion phase. The Bank and EU support was
          instrumental in developing LACE’s track record of successful implementation and
          contributing to its evolution into a self-sustaining implementing agency capable of
          facilitating different stakeholders. In particular, the quick and successful implementation
          of CfWTEP highlights the capacity of such structures to adapt quickly to meet the
          changing needs of vulnerable households in a post-conflict setting.

       Stakeholder and donor coordination is essential in all development activities in a post-
        conflict context, especially during the transition from relief to development phase where
        priorities need to be clearly identified and sequenced. Under CEPII, effective
        harmonization of donor efforts was encouraged by collaboration among the donors and
        development partners supporting CDD during the transition period. In addition, the
        LACE Board of Directors brought together representatives from key Government
        ministries, civil society and women’s organizations, and donor partners.

       Careful attention to fiduciary and project management skills in a low capacity, post-
        conflict setting proved to be a critical factor that contributed to the success of the Project.
        The Bank’s hands-on, proactive, and continuous support on fiduciary and project
        management was essential in meeting project targets and overcoming implementation
        delays. Bank fiduciary staff were based in the country office and paid particular attention
        to the Project. Around the MTR, when Project delays began, an international Bank
        consultant was hired in the country office to specifically provide regular support to the
        Project. These efforts yielded great benefits and contributed to achievement of Project
        objectives. In future however, the Bank could focus more resources on improving these
        fiduciary areas as part of the Project preparation and routine engagement.

       Transparency in the payment process to Project participants contributed to improving
        the CEPII administration in such a low capacity environment. Although the banking
        sector in Liberia continues to expand, the majority of counties only have bank branches
        in their capital cities. Despite this constraint, CEPII established bank accounts for all
        PMCs and facilitated direct payment through a commercial bank to all CfWTEP
        beneficiaries. For most of the CEPII participants, this was the first interaction with a
        formal bank. In addition, the CfWTEP assessments found positive responses from the
        beneficiaries surveyed in terms of transparency in dealing with these banks.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors

(a) Grantee/Implementing Agencies
89.       The Borrower has prepared a final evaluation report, which is attached as Annex 7.
(b) Co-financiers/Donors
90.     The EU is in the process of preparing an evaluation of the CEPII that is to be finalized in
March 2014, however, the preliminary findings so far of this assessment concur with the overall
ICR ratings of Moderately Satisfactory.

   As noted above, the entirety of the CfWTEP funding is allocated to the Community Driven Program.
   While the CfWTEP EPP refers to “Component 4: Cash for Work Employment Program” in discussion of
   the new KPI in Section 1.3, the corresponding June 21, 2008 Grant Agreement does not specify that an
   additional component was created. Moreover, the Letter Agreement dated April 24, 2009 states:
   “pursuant to a FPCR Trust Fund Grant Agreement entered into between the Recipient and the World
   Bank, dated June 21, 2008, the Recipient has received from the World Bank, a grant in an amount not to
   exceed US$3,000,000 from the FPCR Trust Fund towards the co-financing of certain activities under
   Part A of the Project.”
54
   Appraisal Estimate of 2nd EU Co-Financing is derived from the Categories of Eligible Expenditure for
   TF094016 modified April 18, 2012 (see Table 2 in Section 1.7). In keeping with practice during Project
   implementation, the “Goods” and “Incremental Operating Costs” Categories are combined under “Part 3:
   Program Management”. “Sub-grants for Sub-projects” is considered synonymous with “Part 1:
   Community Driven Program” while “Consultants’ services and training” is considered likewise for “Part
   2: Capacity Building Program”. The historical exchange rate of 1.31 is used for the conversion from
   EUR to USD. The Appraisal Estimates from the Original IDA Grant and CfWTEP Co-Financing are
   then added to the figures from the 2nd EU Co-Financing estimates.
55
   Discrepancy between Appraisal Estimate and Actual/Latest Estimate is due to currency fluctuations.

        Indicators from the EPP are used and match the core wording of the indicators as presented in the
        Original Financing Agreement dated June 15, 2007, although the original EPP indicators provide
        additional detail. The FA did not distinguish between key project outcome indicators and intermediate
        results indicators.
     57
        Wording of indicators from the FPCRTF EPP are used. The June 21, 2008 Grant Agreement only
        included five indicators and did not specify between key project outcome indicators and intermediate
        results indicators. Where possible, target values in this column are adopted from the June 21, 2008 GA,
        as no targets were specified in the EPP.
     58
        Wording from June 21, 2008 GA was “Increase in access to basic services, in particular in education by
        end of Project implementation.” The EPP language is more specific and therefore adopted above.
        Neither document set a target value.
     59
        This indicator was not included in the June 21, 2008 GA.

  Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

  1.      The following economic and financial analysis was prepared of the CfWTEP during
  preparation of the YES Project, which built on the public works activities under CEPII.

  Program Impact on Households

  2.       The results of the quantitative assessment of the exiting CfWTEP are very encouraging
  regarding both the short- and long-term impact of the program on households. The results of how
  project income was used for instance indicated that as much as 30 percent of the income of
  participants was spent on education and 25 percent on various types of investments (See Table 1
  below). This implies that the program is not only achieving short-term impacts, but is also having
  some longer-term impact on the targeted households. The relatively high share of the income
  used for education and investments is in part possible because of the wage rate of US$3 a day,
  which may be considered high for an emergency program aiming to address food insecurity. Yet,
  given that the program only provides one single episode of employment to participants, a
  relatively high wage rate that allows not only for increased temporary consumptions but also
  some level of investment may be warranted.

  Cost-Effectiveness of the CfWTEP

  3.      The program appears highly cost-effective compared to international comparators. This is
  due to its high labor intensity of activities, the effective geographical and household level
  targeting, and the low foregone income from participation.

  4.      To estimate the “cost-effectiveness ratio” or the relative efficiency of converting program
  funding to income benefit for the poor, this analysis adapts the methodology developed in
  Ravallion (1998). 63 The calculation is based on only three variables as other data on the benefits

of the infrastructure outputs are not available. Some estimates in this regard will be made
however. The three variables are:

        Labor Intensity (The share of all wages paid in total public works costs). Labor intensity
         of CfWTEP was 68 percent. This is good by international standards. Other public works
         programs show rates of around 60 percent in India (National Rural Employment
         Guarantee Scheme), 70 percent in Korea’s public works program, 85 percent in the
         Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) in Ethiopia, 40-50 percent in Argentina’s
         Trabajar Program, and 60-70 percent in Bangladesh’s Food for Work Program. There are
         two caveats to this nevertheless. The first is that these programs are of a much larger
         scale than the program in Liberia. The second is that the government contribution in
         terms of project management in Liberia is zero. This is important as in most other
         programs the cost of government officials managing the program is not fully factored into
         the project costs thus enabling higher labor intensities to be achieved.

        Wage Targeting Performance (The proportion of the wages paid out that goes to poor
         workers). By using different matching approaches for analyzing the results of the
         quantitative survey, it was found that between 71 and 85 percent of the households
         benefiting from the program were from the first three income quintiles. The findings of
         the previous Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey found that all those
         in the first three quintiles in Liberia are classified as poor, as 63 percent of the entire
         population was found to be living below the poverty line. When taking this into account,
         it is estimated that between 74 and 86 percent of program participants were below the
         poverty line. For the purposes of the assessment the average value of 80 percent will be
         used. 64 This compares fairly well with the Ethiopian Productive Safety Net Project
         (PSNP), for instance, where it was found that 87 percent of beneficiaries were among the
         target group. It was estimated that 70-80 percent of Argentina’s Trabajar Program
         beneficiaries were under the national poverty line.

        Net Wage Gain (Share of the gross wages received by the poor after taking into account
         any foregone income). Because of the high wage paid, extreme poverty, and lack of other
         income opportunities in Liberia, the quantitative survey found that the net wage gain of
         the CfWTEP was very high. Approximately 75 percent participants had no other income
         or employment before the program and so the foregone earnings were very low. The net
         wage gain was found to be 93 percent. In comparison, a finding from India estimated net
         gain at 75 percent. In comparison, a study of Argentina found that net wage gain was
         only 50 percent, where more work alternatives are available.

5.         Overall cost-effectiveness is thus:

                                Cost-effectiveness of the wage transfer:
        Labor intensity (.68)* wage targeting performance (.80)* net wage gain (0.93) = 0.51.

6.       The estimated cost-effectiveness of the wage transfer on the current CfWTEP is 0.51, so
the total cost of transferring US$1 in net wage benefit to a food insecure person through CfWTEP
is US$1.96, which includes the US$1 in net wage. A 0.51 overall cost-effectiveness is somewhat
lower than for instance Ethiopia’s PSNP where the cost-effectiveness of the wage transfer was


64
     This is consistent with the analysis in SP Discussion Paper No. 1114, Liberia’s Cash for Work
     Temporary Employment Project: Responding to Crisis in Low Income, Fragile Countries, June 2011.

                                                    33
also about 0.55. Although no data is available regarding the benefits of the infrastructure provided,
given the effective targeting in the CfWTEP and the fact that projects are generally located within
the communities participants are from, it can be assumed that a fair amount of the benefits accrue
to the poor. If it is assumed that the same program participants are beneficiaries of the
infrastructure maintenance outputs then a value 0.80 can be retained as a measure of the
effectiveness of the infrastructure benefiting the poor.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.       A beneficiary assessment (BA) of the impact of CEPII sub-projects was undertaken in
May and April 2012. 65 Its focus was sub-projects financed by the Bank and the EU. It did not
include an evaluation of CfWTEP, which had been done earlier. Objectives of the assessment
were to:
       •   Determine the degree and depth of community participation
       •   Assess the nature and degree of beneficiary satisfaction with the sub-projects
       •   Understand CEPII’s success in targeting poor and vulnerable populations
       •   Assess community willingness to maintain the sub-projects, thereby increasing
           sustainability
       •   Ascertain beneficiary attitudes toward LACE and local government authorities (LGAs)

2.      A random sample of 30 communities across 6 counties which had benefited from CEPII
was selected to participate, which constituted 12 percent of all completed sub-projects. The
communities and counties were chosen randomly, although the counties were selected so that
each of the country’s four administrative districts was included. The sub-project sample was
representative and included six bridges, six schools, two market buildings, eight WASH facilities,
and eight box culverts.

3.      The field work for the BA was conducted by a Liberian research firm between May 8 and
June 15, 2012. The evaluation team conducted focus group interviews with 4 groups in each
community: female PMC members, male PMC members, female non-PMC members, and male
non-PMC members. Each group had between three and five participants. It is important to note
that focus groups were conducted during a period when the sub-projects surveyed were
experiencing delays. In fact, only four of the 30 sub-projects surveyed were complete. Many
others had barely started. This undoubtedly had an impact on some participants’ responses.

4.     The BA verified that LACE had appropriately identified the communities to participate in
CEPII. Only two of the 30 communities had access to education, health services, drinking water,
and a market within their community. The rest lacked one or more of these facilities.

5.      Nearly all communities (97 percent) expressed a need for wells and/or hand pumps.
Despite that 80 percent of communities had wells and hand pumps in town, they were almost
always broken or insufficient to provide water for everyone in the community. Access to drinking
water therefore remains a major concern in most Liberian rural communities. The request for
wells or hand pumps was often accompanied by a request for latrines and toilets. This demand
matches the high number of WASH sub-projects conducted under CEPII.


65
     In an effort to confirm the findings in the BA, the ICR mission visited several sub-project sites (including
     one school, one market, two WASH facilities, and two bridges) and met with beneficiaries and CFs, as
     well as interviewed LACE staff and reviewed their files. There were instances where the BA findings
     differed from what had been reported by LACE. The ICR mission looked into these discrepancies,
     paying particular attention to cases involving achievement of targets or indicators. This Annex
     incorporates findings of the ICR mission where relevant and offers possible reasons for any differences.

                                                        37
6.      The comparatively large number of transportation infrastructure projects also reflected
the expressed needs of sampled communities and the importance of transportation in the
development of these rural areas. Eighty percent of sampled communities noted their need for
improved roads. Four communities said they were nearly or completely cut off from the rest of
the country during the rainy season. Many respondents stated that good roads would allow for
transportation of materials to build other essential infrastructure and participate more actively in
commerce.

7.       Meanwhile, access to education and healthcare are very important priorities for the
Liberian populations. Although 77 percent of the communities reported having access to
education, meaning they either had a school or used existing buildings (i.e. the church, old
houses) to teach classes, many of these schools lacked equipment such as desks and chairs, were
overfilled with students, and were in need or qualified teachers. Many respondents explained that
they wanted their children not to be like them (meaning with little education), and to have the
opportunity to go to school. Education is seen by many as a benefit to the future of all the
Liberian people. In Butter Hill for instance, education is deemed to play a critical role in bringing
children – who had for the most part been idle or engaged in farming activities – into adulthood.

8.      One mismatch of the Project appears to be in the delivery of health services. Ninety
percent of the sampled communities listed a clinic, hospital, or health center among their needs,
yet only one health post was built under the Project. This resulted from staffing constraints within
the Ministry of Health, suggesting that the allocation of resources to other types of sub-projects
was appropriate; however, high community demand also highlights the need for additional
investment in this sector. In addition, almost half of the surveyed communities expressed the
need for a market, 30 percent asked for a guesthouse, and 27 percent for a meeting hall. A very
small number of communities also asked for GSM network coverage, a peace house, a church, a
mosque a youth center, a police station, teachers’ quarters, teachers, training for midwives, and
assistance with farming activities.66

9.      The decision-making structures in the communities appeared to reflect those of the
society at large. Elders played a major role and were cited as decision-makers in about 90 percent
of the communities. However, decision-making was also a participatory and inclusive process
involving men and women as well as youth. All 30 communities were able to identify who was
responsible for bringing the sub-project to the community and, in 25 cases, also articulated how
the sub-project was selected. In these 25 cases, community respondents said that they had held a
town or community meeting to decide on the sub-project, with six of these communities
specifically referencing a vote. Project selection was unclear in the remaining five communities:
while there was some mention of a meeting and/or vote, respondents also referenced a lottery in
one instance and the town elders in another.

10.     Respondents stated that PMC members were chosen during a town meeting in about half
of the cases. A more few communities said that they held a vote, although without specifically
noting whether the vote was in the context of a meeting. In some cases, PMC members appeared
to be self-appointed or appointed by local authorities or LACE. Although focus group


66
     The BA did not limit the discussion about what services communities needed; therefore, respondents
     often cited the need for multiple services.

                                                   38
respondents were somewhat vague in the justification for selecting PMC members,
trustworthiness, character, behavior, and past experience were important. Thus, the BA did not
confirm that 90 percent of communities had minutes of the meetings or concrete processes by
which PMC members were selected. LACE was able to demonstrate to the ICR mission that
communities had: i) held meetings in which PMC members were elected, ii) kept minutes of
these meetings; and iii) had elected 50 percent women as members. In fact, attendees at these
meetings, convened by the CFs, had signed their names to the minutes, which were verified by
the ICR mission. Divergent findings may be due to BA respondents’ misunderstanding of the
question or lack of awareness or memory of what actually happened. Given the large catchment
area for some of the communities, it is also possible that not all BA respondents actually attended
the meeting.

11.     With regard to gender equity and gender balance in decision making, BA findings were
mixed. While only one community specifically stated that half its PMC members were women,
all PMCs had both men and women members. Thus, LACE’s assertion that 100 percent of
participating communities had PMCs in which 50 percent were women could not be confirmed by
the BA, although again this is contradicted by the signed minutes in the LACE records. However,
the BA found that women (both PMC and non-PMC members) were less knowledgeable about
the sub-project, particularly on issues of sub-project selection and cost, than their male
counterparts. In one third of the communities surveyed, women who were not PMC members did
not participate in PMC meetings, were not involved in the sub-project selection process, and did
not know how the project was chosen. This was not the case for a similar proportion of the men
who were not PMC members.

12.      The creation of a PMC appeared to have a positive impact in getting community
members more involved in attending town meetings and participating in decisions that affected
them and the development of their town, thus enhancing their sense of empowerment. PMC
members, in turn, became more aware of community needs and benefited from their PMC
membership by building civic skills such as team-work, problem solving, effective listening, and
advocacy. They learned how to conduct productive meetings, motivate people, and represent
them vis-à-vis others involved in the sub-project process (i.e. LACE, contractors, CFs, and local
authorities), certainly a good contribution to the development of a stronger civil society.

13.     Communities, however, were not aware of the costs of the sub-projects. In only one
community were most respondents seemingly aware of the costs of the project. Indeed, in the
majority of communities, only a portion of the respondents claimed to know how much the
project cost. Moreover, in most surveyed communities, only men were able to provide
information about the project’s cost, and in eight communities, only the men who belonged to the
PMC knew how much the project cost. In five communities, no one knew the cost of the project.
A signboard indicating the cost of the project was supposed to be placed in a visible place in each
community. It is thus possible that this board was not placed, as requested, in many of the
communities.

14.     All communities made material contributions to their sub-projects and most contributed
labor/manpower. Four communities also gave financial contributions, demonstrating that they
did consider the sub-project important to the community. A technical supervisor (a community
member appointed by LACE) was supposed to monitor the construction of sub-projects, and this
arrangement was acknowledged in about two-thirds of the communities surveyed. One third of


                                                39
the communities stated that the technical supervisor was also assisted by other community
members. In most cases where issues or complaints arose, communities took action.

15.      Most respondents said that the community as a whole -- supervised by the PMC, town
chief, or maintenance committee -- would be responsible for maintaining their project, further
indicating a broad sense of ownership of and responsibility for the facilities provided and
therefore the likely sustainability of the investment. Types of maintenance support included
cleaning, surveillance, and direct financial contributions. However, none of the communities had
a concrete maintenance plan in place, including the four where sub-projects had been
completed. 67

16.      Out of the sampled sub-projects, the vast majority of communities are satisfied with the
type of infrastructure built. Residents noted that the projects implemented in their towns were
right for their communities for four main reasons, depending on the project type: 1) it will attract
more development to their town; 2) community members will no longer have to walk or carry
sick people to the clinic or hospital; 3) it will create opportunities for additional income by
opening up communities to the outside world and decreasing travel time and cost; and 4) it will
give children access to education, which is essential.

17.     Moreover, focus group participants were uniform in their opinion that the benefits of sub-
projects would be positive and widespread. The communities universally said that everyone in
the community would benefit from the project and, in a few towns, respondents gave an estimated
number of direct beneficiaries. For instance, in Ziah Town, residents specified that over 500
children would benefit from the town’s new school. In addition, nearly two-thirds of the
communities said that their project would benefit nearby towns, the entire district, or even Liberia
as a whole. This opinion was particularly evident for the bridge and culvert sub-projects.

18.      In terms of geographic reach and total number of direct beneficiaries, the impact of
bridges and culverts was reported to be the most widespread. By nature, they expand the
coverage of the roads network and connect people from different areas more easily. Nevertheless,
all types of projects included in the CEPII are expected to improve the life of people beyond the
community. For example, in Zealakpala, community members said that the school would benefit
surrounding towns because neighboring communities would also send their children to the new
school. In Butter Hill, respondents explained that the school would benefit the entire nation
because education is a common good. In Kpaye, community members explained that the new
market would attract people from nearby towns and thus give the opportunity for more people to
sell and buy products. In Dartu-ta, respondents said that the new wells and latrines would benefit
newcomers who are building houses in town, perhaps creating opportunities for outsiders to settle
in the community. In fact, it is interesting to note that in Telemu – which is also receiving wells
and latrines – residents pointed out that the project would benefit outsiders.

19.    The BA research suggests that all types of sub-projects included in the CEPII are
expected to benefit communities in the long-term. In six communities, respondents specifically


67
     The ICR mission confirmed community willingness to maintain CEPII facilities, although none had a
     specific maintenance plan or arrangements for financing maintenance and repairs. In fact, in one or two
     cases visited by the mission, communities wanted LACE to return and undertake repairs, which were
     relatively minor and could be undertaken by communities themselves.

                                                     40
noted that their projects, which include wells and latrines, two bridges, a school building, and two
box culverts, would benefit future generations. Expanding access to education through the
construction of new schools also was commonly noted to have a long-term benefit.

20.      Most respondents said that everyone would benefit equally from the project. However, a
few respondents in 27 communities claimed that some people would benefit more from their
respective projects. Generally, people who were said to benefit more from the different projects
fall into three categories: 1) those who live closer to the project; 2) businessmen, traders, farmers
and those who generally need to travel between towns to increase revenues (this concerns mainly
bridges/culverts and markets); and 3) those who own a motorized vehicle such as a motorbike,
truck or car (this concerns mainly bridges/culverts). It is also interesting to note that some
community members explained that residents who did not contribute to the project (i.e. did not
provide labor/manpower) but will nevertheless get to use the project would benefit more from the
project. Furthermore, in a few communities, residents said that those who care about the broader
implications of the project will benefit more. For instance, according to respondents, Pronoken’s
community members who are more serious about learning will benefit more from the new school.

21.     The implementation delays experienced at the time focus groups were conducted
contributed to a sense of frustration among many participants. Interestingly, these frustrations
emanated not only from the fear that the projects would not be completed but from a lack of
communication and knowledge about the reasons for the delay. In several cases there had been
miscommunication or misunderstanding regarding financial compensation of community
members, and this also contributed to frustration expressed in some interviews. The
misunderstanding appears to have centered on the community contribution (as discussed above),
which was meant to make-up 10 percent of the total sub-project cost. This contribution was
frequently misconstrued as an allocation of 10 percent of the total sub-project cost that would be
given to communities as an additional benefit of the Project.68

22.      Assessing the beneficiary communities’ satisfaction about the quality of the sub-projects
also was impacted by the construction delays. Communities’ satisfaction stemmed principally
from the fact that the project was useful, relevant, and directly addressed their most essential
needs. Meanwhile, the dissatisfaction expressed by some communities seemed directly and
mostly related to residents’ frustration about the construction delays. Twelve of the 30
communities highlighted problems with the quality of the building materials. Issues with
construction quality included mainly weak or poorly-installed foundations, inadequate rods (too
thin), erosion, inadequate height or width of bridges (prone to flooding), and the use of materials
of inferior quality. In a few communities, issues with construction became a safety concern. For
instance, in Telemu, the contractor had difficulties reaching water underground and left open a
hole that was unsuccessfully drilled, which became an important safety hazard for the community.

23.     Overall, approximately three quarters of the sampled communities expressed satisfaction
with LACE’s performance. Most frustrations or disappointments concerning LACE were related
to delays in project implementation. Respondents saw LACE as primarily responsible for
bringing the projects to the community and building them, including being responsible for hiring
contractors and monitoring their work. They also saw LACE as responsible for hiring the CFs
that assisted in identifying projects and providing training. In reality, however, community


68
     The ICR mission found confusion over financial compensation to communities in all five site visits.

                                                      41
members did not necessarily distinguish between the role of LACE and that of the CFs, and
generally judged LACE and CFs as if they were one. By and large, satisfaction (or frustration)
with LACE meant satisfaction (or frustration) with CFs.

24.      Under CEPII, LGAs were required to give their approval for the implementation of sub-
projects and attend groundbreaking ceremonies. The majority of communities sampled did
confirm that the LGAs were present at the groundbreaking and gave overall approval for the
CEPII activities. Beyond this, about two thirds of the sampled communities noted greater
involvement of the local authorities in the sub-project. 69 This involvement, however, varied
significantly. In addition, about one third of the communities surveyed spoke about the role of
the LGAs in terms of their broader engagement. According to their comments, LGAs run the
political and administrative affairs of the county and district, but do not necessarily pay much
attention to community development activities. Among all local authorities, town chiefs seemed
to have been the ones most consistently involved with the sub-projects, and county and district
officials less so.

25.     Overall, implementation of the project did not change the way community members
viewed their local authorities, except in three cases: two in which authorities’ disregard for the
sub-project had pushed residents to lose faith in their leaders and one in which respondents
claimed to have gained more respect for their local authorities after the Project. In light of this, it
appears that CEPII did not have much impact on enhancing the role of local governments in
community development nor in strengthening the link between communities and their local
government, the training provided to the 530 local officials notwithstanding.




69
     Local authorities were present at all sites visited by the ICR mission, participated actively in group
     discussions, and were very pleased with the sub-projects and LACE performance. Some made a point of
     stating how involved they had been throughout sub-project implementation.

1.0 About LACE

LACE was created by the Community Empowerment Act promulgated by the National
Legislature on July 22, 2004 under the new Executive Law, also known as the
Community Empowerment Act. Title 12 Chapter 50.B, Liberian Code of Laws. The
objectives of LACE are to improve the living standard of the poor communities through
the provision and strengthening of basic social services, and to promote a community
based approach in sub-projects identification, preparation, implementation and
maintenance.

LACE has a nine member Board of Directors, including the Ministry of Planning &
Economic Affairs (MPEA), Ministry of Gender and Development (MoDG), Ministry of
Internal Affairs (MIA), USAID, European Union (EU), Women NGO Secretariat, Civil
Society Movement of Liberia (CSML-CSO), and a private person as Chairman.

LACE’s Secretariat is headed by an Executive Director (ED), Deputy Executive Director
for Administration (DED-A), and Finance Director (FD), supported by Project Managers,
Engineers and other professional and support staff.

The Board provides overall policy guidance and formulates policies. It ensures that
LACE operates within the provision of its mandate in accordance with the Act. The
Board approves the annual workplan and budget; and also approves the geographical
coverage of the Agency’s program. LACE Board is appointed by and reports to the
President of Liberia.

2.0 The Country Context

Since 2003, following the cessation of hostilities, Liberia has enjoyed ten years a relative
peace. It has conducted two successive general and presidential elections; and the
government has been able to pursue Poverty Reduction and Economic Development
Strategies, including 150 days Action Plan, Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy, the
PRS, and the Agenda for Transformation (AFT). Nonetheless, Liberia remains one of the
poorest countries in the world, both in terms of infrastructure and human capital
development. The country’s 14 years of civil war caused massive devastation and
destruction of socio-economic infrastructure, including roads, energy, water, as well as
human development institutions, i.e., educational and health facilities. The Government
is under tremendous pressure to rebuild and restore these facilities. The incidence of
poverty remains high, with over 60% of the population living on less than US$1.00 per
day. 68% of the population in rural areas and 55% of the poor are in rural areas (AFT).
LISGIS Labor Force Survey puts unemployment at 3.7%, but vulnerable employment at
over 70%. Youth unemployment is one of the insurmountable challenges for the current
Administration.

According to the AFT the Liberian economy has been growing at 7% per annum for the
past seven years and therefore the national budget has increased from US$80 million in
2005 to over US$500 million in 2013/14. Nonetheless, the growth must be shared in the
form of development of the entire population (AFT) through the creation of short-term
and long-term jobs; strengthening skills development institutions, formal and informal;
strengthening small businesses and increasing opportunities for self-employment.


                                            47
Very few labor intensive jobs are being created to match the growing youth population
that is moving into the country’s labor force annually. Majority of the youth are illiterate
and lack employable skills. The economy must create productive and sustainable job
opportunities for the youth in order to ensure sustainable peace, which means the
necessary policies should be promulgated that will create the enabling environment to
attract private domestic and foreign investment. The rural social economic infrastructure
must be improved, including small bridges and culverts that connect villages and towns,
support small holder agriculture in order to produce cash crops and food crops,
generating income in the rural areas where over two thirds of the population lives. The
financial and accountability institutions must also be strengthened; as well as the judicial
system for the transparent and fair dispensation of justice. The predictability of the
justice system can attract investors, spur economic growth, create jobs and enhance
human development.

3.0 Community Empowerment Project (CEP) II

In 2007, the Government of Liberia, through the Ministry of Finance signed an
administrative agreement providing a grant of US$5.0 million to LACE for the
implementation of 80 community subprojects throughout Liberia, using the Community
Driven Development approach. The CEP II was to be co-financed by the World Bank
and European Union. The EU grant was not effective until two years into project
implementation. LACE implemented CEP II/WB #H3050 up to 2009, completing 69
community subprojects. In the middle of 2009, the World Bank, the EU and the
Government of Liberia signed a co-financing agreement for the CEP II with 8.047 million
Euros, for LACE to implement additional 180 subprojects, another 285,000 Euros for five
subprojects were also added, for a total target of 265 subprojects. The total funds
available to LACE for the implementation of these projects was approximately US$16.0
million; but as the project was being implemented, US$0.5 million was lost due to the
fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Euros and the U.S. Dollars.

In addition, on June 21, 2008, the Government of Liberia and the World Bank signed the
Agreement providing Additional Financing of US$3.0 million to the CEPII. This funding
was from the Global Food Price Crisis Trust Fund and supported the Liberia Cash for
Works Temporary Employment Project (CfWTEP). The CfWTEP aimed specifically at
responding to the immediate detrimental effects of escalating prices of food commodities
on the lives of the poor in Liberia; creating temporary job opportunities for the food
insecured population in targeted urban and rural areas. The project targeted 17,000
vulnerable people throughout Liberia, in the food insecure counties.

           3.1 The Project Development Objective (PDO):

The CEP II’s PDO was to improve communities’ access to basic infrastructure and
economic opportunities for vulnerable households in urban and rural areas through (a) a
community driven approach; (b) a labor-intensive public works program; and (c) the
provision of capacity building at the community and local government levels.

The project consists of three components:

           3.2 Component I: Community Driven Program



                                            48
      (a) Assisting Beneficiaries to select and design small-scale community sub-
          projects, through: the provision of technical assistance and training; social
          mobilization; and collective action.

      (b) Providing Sub-grants to beneficiaries for the financing of sub-projects,
          including but not limited to sub-projects aimed at:
                 Reconstructing and rehabilitation of infrastructure in the health,
                  education, water and sanitation sector;
                 Reconstructing and rehabilitating infrastructure in the agricultural
                  sector, including, inter alia: (i) rural roads; (ii) markets; and (iii) storage
                  facilities; and
                 Improving the delivery of and access to, economic services.

       (c) Activities for the CfWTEP (known as subprojects) will be identified by the
           community members themselves with support from the implementing
           partners. The projects should be simple and for a public good; all work must
           be done on public or community own land, but not on private land. The
           project shall benefit a wider community; not a few; it should not negatively
           affect the environment. Activities to be undertaken are:
                     In rural areas: Bush brushing, either along roads or to clear non-
                       private agricultural land (or for another purpose that would serve a
                       community or public need); Rock breaking for the roads; Cleaning
                       and replacement of culverts; Drain clearance along roads;
                       Construction of small wood bridges along roads that would be
                       rehabilitated under the project but would remain otherwise
                       impassable at some points.
                     In urban areas: Street sweeping/cleaning; Drainage clearance;
                       Painting of cross walks; Rehabilitation of recreational spaces;
                       Small rehabilitation of schools, health posts and other community
                       buildings.

           3.3 Component II: Capacity Building Program

       (a) Providing training and technical advisory services to enhance the technical
           and managerial capacity of community members and other sub-project
           stakeholders in participatory planning and development.

       (b) Providing technical support to LACE for the design of detailed guidelines for
           the involvement of local authorities in the identification, preparation, and
           implementation of the sub-projects.

           3.4 Component III: Project Management

       (a) Supporting the operational capacity of LACE to effectively manage the project
           by, inter alia, strengthening its management capacity, including its monitoring
           and evaluation mechanisms, all through the provision of goods, technical
           advisory services, training and incremental operating costs.

           3.5 Design principles

The key project design principles were as follows:

                                              49
             i. Sub-projects must be community driven: The beneficiary community must
                identify projects that meet their priority needs using the CDD approach.
       ii.      Subprojects      must     support     Government’s       development     agenda
                (CDA/DDA/PRS/AFT). Subprojects must be in line with the development
                objectives of the districts, the communities and counties at large.
      iii.      Community sub-projects must be accessible.
      iv.       Beneficiary communities must be vigilant, willing to make their 10%
                community contribution in the form of local materials, land, labor, etc.; the
                local beneficiaries must be prepared to take off time to work on their
                projects, and to provide some inputs free of charge.
       v.       In order to ensure sustainability, all social infrastructure subprojects must be
                approved by the appropriate line ministries before LACE can finally approve
                the sub grant to the community. Primary schools must be approved by the
                Ministry of Education (MOE); clinics by Ministry of Health & Social Welfare
                (MHSW), and bridges, culverts, wells and latrine projects by the Ministry of
                Public Works (MPW).
      vi.       The project must be implemented within the context of the World Bank’s
                Operational Manual, the MAAFP, ESMP, RPF/RAP. The project must follow
                the WB procurement guidelines.
     vii.       Subprojects must follow the World Bank’s Environmental and Social
                Safeguards Guidelines.
     viii.      Operational expenditure must not be more than 13% of the total expenditure
                under the grant.

Project design principles for the CfWTEP were:

        i.      Targeted 17,000 vulnerable people.
       ii.      At least 30% women.
      iii.      Apply participatory approach (CDD) in activities implementation.
      iv.       Project to smoothing consumption of the vulnerable people.
       v.       Project activities shouldn’t adversely affect the environment.
      vi.       Each beneficiary is paid US$5.00 for skilled labor and US$3.00 for unskilled
                labor.
     vii.       Local authorities to provide leadership and help resolve problem; ensure
                their participation.
     viii.      Lottery system to be used when more people turn-out for recruitment than
                the target number.
      ix.       Recruitment based on self-selection.
       x.       Target counties with high level of food insecurity.
      xi.       Payment of beneficiary wages will be done through a commercial bank.
     xii.       CFs to handle recruitment, sensitization and mobilization in their localities.
     xiii.      Each beneficiary will sign a one page contract outlining conditions of
                contract.
    xiv.        I.D. Cards issue to each beneficiary.

                4.1 Category I - Goods

   This category allocation was intended to enable LACE to purchase the needed vehicles
   and equipment to facilitate the implementation of the project. Under this component, a.
   vehicle 1- EU-Cofinancing US$52,000.00; 2 vehicles IDA US$92,000.00; 1 generator
   US$8,000.00; and air conditioner/printer US$975.00 were procured for the monitoring
   and supervision of subprojects, as well as for office use.

   Under CfWTEP, goods included vehicles (2 pickups for $40,000.00 each and 1 jeep for
   $50,000.00) for supervision and monitoring of projects around the country over the two
   years period. Motorbikes for CFs and monitors also were provided on loan to local
   NGOs to facilitate effective community mobilization, consultations & monitoring of
   projects implementations. (1 motorbike assigned to LACE monitor for monitoring visits in
   places where vehicles cannot reach. The cost of the 16 motorbikes is at $3,631.00 per
   motorbike.

                4.2 Category 2 - Community Driven Development (Subprojects)

   The number of subprojects under the entire CEP II was stipulated in the project grant
   document. The subprojects were distributed within the following principles in mind:
   (a) To improve livelihood and economic opportunities especially for the rural poor, and
   (b) to ensure that the project resources are deployed in places where they are most
   needed. To achieve this objective, LACE considered the following parameters for the
   allocation of subprojects per county: (1) population (2) incidence of poverty (3) level of
   development intervention already ongoing in the county by LACE and/or other
   development partners, (4) remoteness and accessibility of the beneficiary communities,
   and (5) the county’s overall development strategy. Very poor communities, with high


                                                51
youthful population and food insecurity are considered for intervention. The Community
people must be willing to get involved in the implementation of their community
subprojects, i.e. physical labor, provision of local materials, and the management of the
project.

A total of eighty (80) subprojects funded by the World Bank funds and 185 71 subprojects
funded by the European Union funds, totaling 265 subprojects were planned for CEP II.
However, due to the loss of some funds caused by fluctuation in the exchange rate, five
subprojects were dropped from the total subprojects, leaving funding available for 260
subprojects. In particularly, the Euro/USD exchange rate dropped from 1.33 Euro to 1
USD in 2004 to 1.22 Euros to 1 USD in 2012. This resulted in a loss of approximately
USD0.5 million).

The final allocation of sub-projects was: 31 schools, 51 bridges, 92 culverts, 6 markets, 1
heath post and 79 wells and latrines subprojects.

The EU Component of the CEP II Co-financing subprojects was closed on August 31,
2012. With the reposting 72 of the sub-projects from the WB’s CEP II list of completed
subprojects to EU’s co-financing component of on-going subproject, the completion of
the 185 subprojects was achieved. The WB Component of the CEP II was extended by
another year, up to July 31, 2013 so as to enable LACE to continue working in order to
complete the subprojects.

Up to the closing date, LACE completed a total of 244 out of 260 subprojects (93%). The
subprojects are benefitting over a million people throughout Liberia; the CEP II
subprojects were implemented throughout the country.

This progress was made partly due to the material advance to contractors; as well as
intensive monitoring of contractors working at the project site by LACE Project Officers
and Engineers. In addition to technical specification monitoring, the Engineers and
Project Officers also follow-up on social and environmental safeguards compliance.
They ensured that bridges were cleared of debris, for free flow of water, removal of
construction materials from construction sites, covering of pits where soil was used for
the production of the SSB bricks, closing of unused open wells. LACE intervention in this
area was highly successful. And on the social safe-guard measures, LACE Staff secured
some tribal certificates for the land on which the school or market projects are built.
Some community authorities were however reluctant to sign the tribal certificates. This
was a major challenge.

This Community Driven Development (subprojects) Component of the CEP II absorbs
75% of the entire project grant. Once subprojects were identified and approved by LACE
for the subgrants, the funds were placed in the subproject accounts in three allotments


71
   Initially, these 180 subprojects were earmarked for the CEP EU Additional Financing projects, but
   during project implementation, Euro 285,000 was added to implement five (5) additional subprojects
   totaling 185 subprojects.
72
   Reposting: LACE, with No Objection from the World Bank, transferred 39 completed subprojects to the
   EU Co-financing component of the project, and with the concurring expenditures. As such, US$2.1
   million was transferred to IDA H#3050 for continuous implementation of subprojects as the CEP II EU
   Co-financing Component of the project closed on August 31, 2012.

Project Identification: LACE recruited Community Facilitators (CFs) 73, sensitized and
trained them. The CFs are community based; there are 19 CFs in all fifteen counties.
The CFs undertook community sensitization, organization of the Project Management
Committee (PMCs) 74, and assisted PMCs to identify their priority projects. LACE assisted
PMCs with technical assessment; and along with the PMCs/CFs undertook the
procurement process, management, monitoring and supervision of the project.

Project Financial Management:
                     1. Project identified by PMCs;
                     2. Subgrant approved by LACE;
                     3. Subgrant signed by PMCs and LACE;
                     4. PMCs opened subproject Accounts in recognized commercial
                        banks, with four signatories from the PMC’s Finance
                        Committees;
                     5. LACE deposited project funds into subproject accounts (40%,
                        40% and 20%);
                     6. PMC Finance Committee authorized and made payments from
                        the subproject accounts upon the completion of milestone by
                        the contractors;



73
   Community Facilitators (CFs) are local NGOs recruited in the communities to provide sensitization and
   facilitation services for the CEP II project; they are paid USD2,350.00 for facilitation- a subproject from
   start to completion.
74
   PMCs are community people organized (5 men and 5 women) to manage the implementation of the
   subprojects on behalf of the community people. The PMCs are signatories to the subprojects accounts;
   they form part of the procurement committee along with LACE to evaluate bids and awarding of
   contracts. They are responsible to monitor and supervise the project, and authorize payments to the
   contractor upon completion of subproject milestones.

                                                     53
                     7. PMCs keep records of their financial transaction until the
                        project is completed;
                     8. PMCs keep the project records after the project closes;
                     9. PMCs got petty cash for operations
                     a. Finance Officers got stipends for bookkeeping services;
                     b. Technical supervisors got stipends for daily monitoring of
                        subprojects.

CfWTEP: 500 persons were employed per subproject. 34 subprojects were be
implemented over the two years period, costing on average $60,400.00 per subproject
for labor. Each beneficiary was paid $3.00US per day and one foreman out of the group
paid $5.00US per day for supervision of the workers.

Beneficiary wages were paid through a commercial bank, EcoBank. Bank commission
for payment services to beneficiary workers was estimated at $1,000.00 per project, i.e.,
payment to five hundred persons for one month (once a month payment). LACE
proposed that payment to beneficiary workers will be done by commercial banks. Where
there are no banks, the Community Facilitator, LACE and the Commercial Bank staff will
design a strategy for the workers to receive their payments at their place of work. All
payments will be made by commercial bank staff.

Project materials/tools for 17,000 beneficiary workers was budgeted for a lump sum of
$212,500.00 over a two-year period

The allocation of beneficiaries were based on the 2006 CFSNS which was conducted by
the U.N., the allocation were as follows:

LACE recruited local NGOs, CFs to provide community mobilization, sensitization,
training and monitoring and supervision services. A CF was paid US$2,350.00 per
project. For the infrastructure subprojects, the CFs and LACE trained the PMCs in

                                           54
          project Cycle management (sensitization and social mobilization, project management,
          financial management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation). The CFs were paid per
          output; that if a subproject fails because a contractor abandoned the project, the CFs
          would not get his balance pay for outputs not achieved. But almost all subprojects were
          completed, though many of the projects were delayed, which was partly due to capacity
          problem on the part of the contractors.

          For CfWTEP, CFs helped ensure that selected projects meet the “public good” standard,
          and does not adversely affect the environment; cooperate and coordinate with land
          authorities. Under the CfWTEP, in addition to the US$2,350 per subproject payment,
          LACE provided an amount of $2,500.00 to cover insurance, registration, fuel and
          maintenance cost for motorbikes assigned to CFs for the subproject period.

          Under this component, professional/technical LACE staffs were paid as consultants;
          auditors and other short-term consultants were also paid from this component.

          This component also covers cost for consultancy and training activities, including
          workshops, auditing; and technical studies, coordinate with local authorities and
          monitoring and supervision.

                           4.4 Component III- Project Management

          This component covers the management to the projects, ensuring that the subprojects
          were implemented prudently, keeping the operating cost as low as possible, not
          exceeding 13% of the total expenditure. This component covers the cost of rent, fuel,
          vehicles, DSA, staff cost, and other project operating expenses, as well as monitoring
          and evaluation of projects. Keeping the incremental operating cost as per target even
          though the duration of the project was extended by two years was difficult. No additional
          funds were provided to LACE to cover increasing operating cost; LACE relies on the
          GOL subsidy to cover cost overrun and other associated costs.

          For CfWTEP, LACE recruited 5 new staff to the Agency (CfW Project Manager, a CfW
          Project Monitor and three (3) drivers) to provide management and monitoring support for
          the project. This component covered the cost of the staff to be recruited as well as the
          allowances for the existing staff for taking on additional responsibilities under the Cash
          for Work project.

         6.0 Assessment of Project Implementation (Ratings)

                         6.1 Project Development Objectives (PDOs)

         The project objective is to improve communities’ access to basic social services and
         provide economic opportunities to vulnerable households in urban and rural areas
         through a Community Driven Approach, a labor-intensive public works program, and the
         provision of capacity-building at the community and local government levels.
         LACE rates its performance as Moderately Satisfactory, because of the delay in
         completing some of the CEP II subprojects.

         The CEPII (with funding from the World Bank and EU) contributed to the Government of
         Liberia poverty reduction strategy, especially component II- Economic Revitalization and
         component IV infrastructure and basic social services as well as the Agenda for
         Transformation (AFT).Almost all subprojects were completed, and are now providing
         improved learning environment, safe drinking water and improved sanitation, access
         roads, and markets that contribute to ease in movement of goods and people,
         agriculture production, and sale.

         As a result of the effective implementation of these subprojects (though with some
         delays), the government is now assigning similar sub projects to LACE for
         implementation. The Government, through the National Legislature, budgeted US$3.0
         million to LACE for implementation of social infrastructure projects in the various districts
         of Liberia in FY 2012/2013 though not all the funds were released. LACE has started
         implementing some of these projects, including schools, markets, youth centers, etc.

         The CfWTEP was satisfactorily implemented in all 15 counties of Liberia and as a result,
         the Government of Liberia requested the World Bank for a bigger project for 45,000
         vulnerable youths which was approved in 2010. The new Youth Employment Skills



                                                           57
Project grant was US$7.5 million. LACE therefore rates result as satisfactory for this
project.

           6.2 Component implementation

               6.2.1   Component I- Community Driven Development
                       (subgrant/subprojects)

 This component was rated Moderately Satisfactory because of the many challenges
 during implementation of the community subprojects. The CfWTEP subproject activities
 were implemented satisfactorily.

 The subgrants supported subprojects to meet the needs of the beneficiary communities.
 In total of US$11,993,573.82 was paid-out to the community subgrants for the
 implementation of the subprojects. as follow:

           1. Schools constitute 31 US$2,981,603.88 (includes one ongoing with GOL
              funds)
           2. Health post 1 US$85,212.23
           3. Bridges 50 US$4,218,522.09 (includes one ongoing with GOL funds)
           4. Culverts 92 US$2,777,742.70 (includes three ongoing with GOL funds)
           5. Wells and latrines 80 US$1,587,837.95 (includes 11 ongoing with GOL
              funds)
           6. Markets 6 US$342,654.97

Through our school construction and rehabilitation subprojects, LACE has completed 30
schools in the remotest parts of the country. The schools are furnished with furniture,
chairs, blackboards, reading room, teacher’s lounge, Latrines, and wells fitted with hand
pumps to provide safe drinking water for teachers and students while attending classes.
The schools in most locations are the only educational facilities in those communities,
and are enabling many students for the first time to attend school and/or attend classes
in a conducive building with safe drinking water and latrine facilities.

In the area of health hygiene and sanitation, LACE has completed 69 wells and latrine
subprojects, and is implementing 11 other wells and latrines subprojects. The wells and
latrines subprojects are intended to provide safe drinking water and improve hygiene
and sanitary condition for people in towns and villages throughout Liberia approximately
250,000 people will access safe drinking water. Safe water and clear latrines will
improve the quality of lives and health of children and their mothers, and the population
at large. That means productive labors force that can achieve economic growth for the
country.

Where the health post is located in Togbaville, it is the only health facility in the district.
The nearest health post is about 30 Km to Greenville or to Cestos, in River Cess County
either way from Togbaville. The importance of this facility is enormous. It serves the
entire population within the district, approximately 20,000 people. Pregnant women will
be able to deliver safely at the health post, which will contribute to reducing the maternal
and child mortality in that area.

As for bridges and culverts on feeder roads, as well as markets, they support
Government’s effort to revitalize economic activities in the rural areas. With 138 bridges

                                              58
and culverts completed, along with six markets, the CEPII project is enhancing the
standard of living of the rural population throughout Liberia. The project is improving
transport and bolstering rural agricultural production and income for the rural poor. The
bridges and culverts are enhancing transportation to villages and towns. Without such
facilities, it would be difficult for rural dwellers. Before the construction of these bridges
and culverts, they had difficulty to couldn’t commute easily, and to transport their goods
to the villages, and to the main roads and markets for sale; to go to clinics, and for the
children to go to the next accessible school facility.

The market buildings are providing selling spaces for the market women and men,
avoiding selling in the sun and rain. The market buildings also have ware-houses for the
storage of dry goods, and offices for the leadership of the markets. The markets are built
along with handpumps for safe drinking water, and latrines for sanitation purposes.
Approximately 3,000 people will benefit from the market.

Through these construction subprojects, the CEPII provided job opportunities for over
150 small Liberian construction contractors, who also each employed a minimum of 6
artisans, i.e. carpenters, steel benders, masons, manual laborers, etc. As subprojects
were bid and won by small Liberian construction companies, jobs were being created in
the urban and rural construction industry; income was being earned by owners or
employees of small construction companies who were able to pay for education and
health services, acquire household assets, improve their standard of living, and escape
poverty. The impact of the community empowerment project in towns and villages
throughout Liberia cannot be over emphasized. The impact is enormous.

In total, 34 CfWTEP subprojects also were undertaken and engaged 17,000 participants
in temporary employment. A subproject by definition comprises of 500 persons working
together in a town/village carrying out agreed activities. These subprojects were
implemented in all 15 counties of Liberia with the help of the CFs who did the
sensitization, recruitment, assignment, supervision of tasks, oversee payroll preparation,
and the payment process. Of the 17,000 vulnerable people recruited, 54% male, 46%
female. They were recruited on self-selection basis; where there were more people than
the allotted number, a lottery system was used to select participants under the project.
The selection process included screening, selection, signing of a one page contract, and
photographing of each beneficiary worker, which was preceded by sensitization and
social mobilization by CFs. US$2,053,600 or 68% was paid as wages directly to the
beneficiaries, out of a total of US$3.0 million grant. 184 communities benefitted from the
CfWTEP between October 2008 to June 2010 (LACE’s CfWTEP final report).

During project implementation, beneficiary workers were engaged in the rehabilitation,
roadside brushing, drainage clearing and/or reconstruction, backfilling of newly
constructed bridges and culverts, and backfilling of pot holes on the trunk roads, general
clearing of urban and provincial cities, towns and villages, and appropriate disposal of
garbage/debris.

The participants also undertook productive activities such as swamp rice production,
cassava production, specifically, in the area of agriculture; project participants in Bong
County rehabilitated a paddy rice demonstration site used to produce high yielding, short
duration and resilience varieties for rice at the Central Agriculture Research Institute
(CARI) and Kpatawee rice production sites.


                                             59
Similarly, some of the local communities in Grand Cape Mount, and Gbapolu Counties
reclaimed some of their arable land areas and cultivated it in rice and cassava crops for
consumption and for sale to support community-wide development initiatives.
Approximately 2.3 Million square meters of arable land was worked on by the
beneficiaries during the period implementation.

Even though the objective of the project was to put money in the pocket of vulnerable
people in order to smoothen consumption in the wake of galloping increase in the prices
of essential food commodities, fuel and the like, the beneficiaries used two-thirds of their
monies for more sustainable items including household assets, agriculture inputs, repair
of houses, schools and health services (WB assessment study 2010); only about 28% of
the income was used for consumption.


                   6.2.2   Component II- Capacity building, Consultancy Audits

This component was satisfactorily executed. LACE was able to recruit all the needed
NGOs as community facilitators in keeping with the OM and; trained them in project
cycle management. LACE along with the CFs organized and trained the Project
Management Committees in mobilization, sensitization, project management,
procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation. These capacity building
efforts contributed to successful implementation of the subprojects. The community
people, as a result of the training, were able to identify and prioritize their subprojects;
managed their construction works and paid contractors. The PMCs started keeping their
financial records, as well as keeping minutes of their activities on the subprojects. During
the project life, over 2,650 PMCs and 530 local Government authorities were trained in
project cycle management.

Under this component, LACE and the CFs also brought in the local authorities in support
of the projects. The local authorities participated in the same training as the PMCs and
were fully informed about project activities and implementation modalities. Because of
the training, the local authorities were also able to mobilize the community people to
make their 10% community contribution, in the form of land, round poles, sand, crushed
rocks, and other construction inputs. The local authorities (Development
Superintendents) also participated in the monitoring of the project; and follow-up with
LACE whenever there was a problem at a project site.

Also under this component, LACE was able to recruit and maintain competent project
officers and engineers that constantly monitored the implementation of the project in the
villages and towns. The role of these staff contributed immensely in achieving the quality
of structures designed. LACE procurement staff also benefited from procurement


                                            60
training in Ghana (GIMPA) and locally; and as a result, their outputs have improved
immensely.

The CfWTEP activities under this component started in communities through
sensitization and social mobilization. This was followed by orientation workshops on a
regional basis, one in Montserrado County in October 2008 for CFs in northern and
central Liberia, while another one was conducted in Zwedru, Gand Gedeh County for
counties in southeastern Liberia.

The topics covered during the training were: measurement, using the metric system,
writing or quantitative reports, recording of daily attendance, and preparation of workers
payroll and attendance records so as to ensure effective implementation of project
activities. Other topics covered were HIV/AIDS prevention, environmental protection,
community mobilization, and project life cycle management. The workshops lasted for
five (5) days each, and over 51 CFs and community leaders benefitted from the training.

In addition, LACE procured and assigned on loan 15 motorbikes to the 15 CFs that were
recruited and assigned supervisory and monitoring roles under the project. These
motorbikes were retrieved at the end of the project and reassigned to CFs for the
implementation of the YES-CW Component 1 project in the counties.

At the end of the 40 working days, the beneficiaries through their organized group or a
local Government authority (city mayor or town chief) were given the remaining tools so
that the activities carried out under the project could continue after the project. 183 local
government authorities and communities organized structures received the left-over
tools after the close of the project in each community. The transfer of tools commenced
on April 13, 2009 up to the end of the CfWTEP in June 2010 (LACE’s CfWTEP final report).

The CEP II is audited annually by independent auditing firms in Liberia, approved by the
World Bank. The auditors gave qualified opinions, and though with recommendations for
strengthening internal controls, filing, and procurement. Independent procurement
auditors and in-depth financial evaluators have reviewed LACE records and provided
qualified opinions as well. LACE was diligent in its implementation and follow up on the
recommendations from the external audits and other reviews.

                   6.2.3   Component III- Project Management

This aspect of the project was moderately satisfactory. This is so because of two
reasons:
           (a)Procurement capacity deficiency in LACE. LACE’s capacity to effectively
       handle the procurement process as required by the World Bank was weak;

            (b)The sudden change by the World Bank from the use of the Community
       Driven Development (CDD) procurement method (under the Bank O.P8) as
       spelled out in the original Operation Manual, the World Bank required that LACE
       used the World Bank’s standard procurement documents and guidelines, which
       were very difficult for LACE at the time. As a result, LACE lost a lot of time in
       2010 and 2011 for the implementation of project. This is the main reason that
       LACE was not able to complete all the subprojects before the official closing of
       CEP II by the World Bank. No objections were not provided as quickly as


                                             61
       possible on bid documents, and the disbursement for project implementation was
       limited during this period.

When the CEP EU Co-financing project was launched in 2009, the project’s mid-term
review was held in January 2010. For almost one and a half years afterward, very little
was achieved due partly to LACE’s inability to meet up with the World Bank’s new
procurement requirements. Given delays in 2010 and 2011 while LACE and the World
Bank reviewed the procurement process, disbursement and project implementation were
delay.

During the Mid Term Review, it was agreed that the procurement department be
expanded with two additional procurement staff; and that the procurement department
reports to the Executive Director. LACE then recruited two procurement officers to work
in the department. Further, LACE requested the World Bank to field an international
procurement specialist that would help in mitigating the capacity problem. With the
fielding of two international procurement specialists, along with two national procurement
staff, the subprojects were speedily implemented, thus enabling LACE to meet the
project objectives.

With respect to monitoring and supervision, LACE divided the country into four zones,
and assigned its staff to monitor and supervise subproject implementation. This effort
contributed to not only the quality of the subprojects implemented by contractors but also
the speedy delivery of the projects. The community people were also sensitized to
inform LACE staff if the contractors were not working; or if the building materials were
not delivered, or being stolen.

Also, even though the project was extended by two years beyond its original project
period, the World Bank did not grant additional funding to LACE for operations. LACE
managed to implement the project, keeping the operation cost below 13% of the grant.
This was due to effective financial management of the project funds, and by charging
some of the operating cost to the Government of Liberia subsidy to LACE.

Project management for the CfWTEP is rated satisfactory. LACE kept the incremental
operating cost below the 10% ceiling. The LACE maintains a fixed asset registry in order
to account for all assets purchased with the project funds for use by the project. Project
beneficiaries were issued ID cards and were paid directly by commercial bank tellers
either on-site (banking hall) or off-site (on the field where the beneficiaries were
working).

7.0 Social Accountability (Visibility)

LACE is one of few Agencies in Liberia that works very hard in communicating to
beneficiaries about their subprojects. LACE ensures that the community people are fully
informed about their projects, i.e. when a subproject is completed, a sign board is
erected detailing the logos of the donors (i.e. GOL, WB, EU), and LACE, project
name/type, project cost, contractor and LACE. LACE operates a radio program to
explain the CEP II activities in the communities to the public at large. LACE also
publishes annual reports, calendars, T-shirts and flyers depicting the project and the
donors.



                                           62
For the CfWTEP, the public and community people (including the beneficiaries) were
fully informed about project activities in terms of duration of the project (40 working
days); payment time and process; the condition of work through the one page contract,
type of activities to be implemented, payment about and timing, etc.

8.0 Challenges

There were huge challenges in the implementation of this project, namely:
    Procurement: LACE’s capacity to manage the WB’s procurement modalities was
       weak; as a result, when a decision was reached for LACE to follow the standard
       World Bank’s procurement rules, it was difficult; the project stalled for almost a
       year and half until international procurement specialists were hired and deployed
       at LACE. The No Objections were not given fast enough by the World Bank for
       contracts to be awarded.

      Delays on the part of local contractors: majority of the local contractors were
       unable to source the required funding to implement the subproject on a timely
       basis. Some of the contractors took over a year to complete a six-month project.
       They complained of not being able to source loans from the commercial banks to
       start the work on time. As a result, many of the contracts had to be terminated
       and re-advertised. With the approval of the World Bank LACE piloted upfront
       payments to 18 contractors as a means to speed up project implementation.
       However in practice, this did not help to increase the speed of construction; and it
       has to be discontinued. Instead, during the last year of implementation, LACE
       instituted the option for materials advance to contractors. This was more
       successfully at increasing the rate of construction.

      Bad roads/heavy rains: due to the heavy rain in most part of the year, the roads
       deteriorated. This was one of the main factors responsible for the delay in
       completing the subprojects. During the rainy season, the bridges and wells and
       latrines could not be done due to the high water level at the rivers, and
       underground. The work came to a vertical stop during the months of June-
       September because of the heavy rain and bad roads. For the CfWTEP, this was
       a major challenge especially in delivering tools in the communities in
       Southeastern Liberia, and monitoring project activities during the rainy season.

      PMCs 10% contribution: Some PMCs did not make their 10% community
       contribution/work on the project, but insisted on getting petty cash or technical
       supervisors’ and finance officers payments. And will report to their local
       authorities that LACE refused to pay them. Some PMCs said LACE owes them
       10% of the project grant when the project is completed even though they were
       trained to know that the PMCs and the community people were to make 10%
       contribution in kind to the projects.

      Cost overrun: Because of the delay in implementing the project, the cost of
       building materials and transportation increased. This posed a serious financial
       constraint on LACE, as it is the desire of LACE to complete all 260 community
       subprojects that construction was begun on under CEPII.

      Loss of Funds: The loss of the US$500,000.00 due to fluctuation in the
       exchange rate between Euros and USD, also posed a serious financial

                                           63
       constraint. LACE had to drop five (5) subprojects, including two (2) schools, from
       the target of 265 community subprojects. The initial exchange rate was (the
       exchange rate in 2010 was 1.32 Euros to 1 USD, and in 2012 the rate was 1.22
       Euros to 1 USD).

      Client Connection: LACE also experienced some difficulties in getting its
       replenishment from the World Bank, due to Client Connection error messages.
       For every little omission in the withdrawal application, there will be an error
       message. This took a lot of time and delay in disbursement.

      Post Project Maintenance: Contractors and end users of subprojects do not want
       to maintain them but instead, will call on LACE to maintain the facilities after
       three (3) to five (5) years of usage.

      Land Use: In the case of the market project in Sasstown, Caldwell, Montserrado
       County, the community people offered a piece of land for the construction of a
       market building. Upon completion of the building, some persons in the
       community claimed the land. This matter was subsequently resolved when the
       market provided documentary (receipts) proof that they purchased the land from
       the father of the claimer. This was attested to by the aunty of the fellow that was
       claiming the land.

      Uses of subprojects: All subprojects are in use. The challenge is maintenance
       especially in the case of latrines. Some community people will use the latrine
       without cleaning it. They will discourage others from using the latrine. During the
       formation of the PMCs, and at training workshops, LACE will normally encourage
       the PMCs to organize management teams so as to ensure not only the usage of
       the subprojects, but also maintenance of the facilities.

       For the CfWTEP, there were more people showing-up than the targeted number
       in most communities where the recruitment was taking place. Everybody wanted
       to work, but many workers did not get the job, and so were disappointed. In such
       case, more time was spent on counseling and assuring people that they would
       be considered for future projects. To ensure fairness, a lottery system was used
       during the selection process.

9.0 Lessons Learned

    Irrespective of the difficulties, the project was implemented with determination,
     effort, and constraint mitigation.

    When a project delays, the local authorities report to their national leaders,
     Legislators for redress; sometimes the reaction is on radio and can be negative.

    Advance payment to contractor, for most part did not yield the desire result, i.e.,
     to speed up the implementation of the subproject. The subprojects with the worst
     delay records were those whose contractors received the first 30% advance
     payment (18 subprojects). This had to be discontinued.




                                           64
 With the introduction of the material advance as a strategy to speed-up project
  implementation, the result was remarkable. However, some contractors
  misapplied the materials and the cost had to be deducted from them.

 The local authorities took ownership of the subprojects as soon as
  implementation is completed, sometimes with no reference to LACE. The
  projects are dedicated and turned over to the communities.

 Work comes to a complete stop during the heavy rainy season, as well as during
  Christmas, New Year and the July 26 Independence Day celebrations. One can
  hardly get contractors to work during these festive seasons.

 It is now very difficult to get community people to work free of charge on a
  community subproject. They will request for payment.

 For all the subprojects, the local government authorities (LGAs), including the
  commissioners and Paramount and Clan Chiefs, Superintendent and Assistant
  Superintendent for Development are contacted and are involved in the
  identification of the project, and are informed about the subgrant, procurement
  and awarding of contracts. However, when there is a change and a new person
  is appointed, some of the new people will claim not to know about the project and
  will attempt to stop the project except for the intervention of the Minister of
  Internal Affairs or other administrator.

 Information dissemination: increasing public awareness about CfWTEP activities
  helped to ensure confidence in the project and the achievement of the project
  objectives. The community people were fully informed about project activities
  including the type of work, duration, and the amount that they were to be paid.

 Payments through the commercial banking system also ensured confidence in
  the project. Beneficiaries knew that they would get their “correct” payment during
  the payment period.

 Economic empowerment of vulnerable can transform people and transfer
  potential conflict, violence situation into a more productive attitude, behavior, and
  promote social cohesion. The CfWTEP provided some level of protection for poor
  vulnerable household; contributed to improving food security, and access to
  social services/schools, clinics, markets, safe water, etc.). This contributed to
  integration and social cohesion in the communities.

 The community people were happy with the US$3.00 per day paid to them
  (especially women) as wages. They made productive use of their income earned
  during the period of the work. The community people requested for the project to
  continue beyond the 40 days period.

 With little money, the project contributed enormously to transforming lives in war-
  torn communities during the period immediately following the cessation of the
  Liberian civil war in 2008. It helped the vulnerable people returning to their
  villages and towns to settle down with some money to pay for their farming inputs
  and begin farming again; some used their money to rehabilitate their homes; to
  buy uniforms for their children. The project contributed to re-uniting families,

                                        65
       restore trust and confidence in one another again following the conflict; people
       that inflicted so much wounds on each other and could not speak to another
       began to speak again, while working together on the projects thus restoring
       social cohesion and community reintegration and resettlement.

    Cross-organizational collaboration: some farmers used their cash benefits to
     purchase seed rice and begin farming again. Agriculture activities benefitted a
     large number of people, especially in areas where the project supported public
     agriculture seed bank, CARI, in Bong County.

10.0 Bank performance

          10.1 World Bank Grant:

The World Bank performed satisfactorily, working with the Government of Liberia (MOF)
in identifying the funds and in consummating the CEP II and CfWTEP. The World Bank
remitted all the grant funds to the project through the DA managed by LACE.

          10.2 Procurement:

The World Bank performed well by hiring and deploying international procurement
specialists who helped in speeding up procurement documentations, and enabling LACE
to obtain the required No Objection for the disbursement of project funding. Unlike the
CEP II, there were no major procurement problems relative to the CfWTEP.

          10.3 Supervision:

The project supervision on the part of the Bank was effective and adequate. There was
almost continuous monitoring and supervision, setting-up of timelines; holding mid-term
reviews, video conferences, and regular field visits. Financial Management support and
Monitoring was also very effective; which led to improved IFRs presentations. The Social
and Environmental safeguards Specialist of the WB also had supervision missions, field
visits and provided satisfactory capacity building support.

The project was regularly reviewed and discussed with the Government (MOF), and the
aide memoire with timelines were prepared and disseminated.

Overall Bank performance: Satisfactory

11.0 Government

The Government also performed satisfactorily by following up on the project
implementation, and provided needed policy guidance through the Board of Directors
that reports to the President of Liberia.
