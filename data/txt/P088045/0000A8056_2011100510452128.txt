                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project Development Objectives (PDO) continue to be highly relevant for the Government's efforts aimed at improving the investment climate in Kosovo. The business
                         environment component has achieved important progress. However,several important activities remain to be completed. . The number of registered businesses has exceeded the
                         original target: the latest figure is 109 thousand compared to 94 thousand in the latest ISR and to 60 thousand in the original target. Progress in sub-components is summarized as
                         follows:

                          (i) The total number of Municipal Business Centers (MBCs) as of June 14, 2011 is 22. They provide services for: business registration, closing, changes to business registration, and
                         give information and advice to businesses on obtaining permits and licenses. The MBCs are connected on line with the central business registry in Prishtina, which is working very
                         well. As of end August 2011, these MBCs have provided: 1736 new business registrations, 1065 changes in registration, 273 business closures, and 604 work permits.
                         (ii) the third phase for the reconstruction of the last group of 6 MBcs has already started and works are underway.

                         (iii)Technical Assistance to Kosovo Business Registration Agency (KBRA) has progressed well. New and updated software security measures and systems are in place, ensuring
                         greater security of data of KBRA. Additional equipment and upgrades to their software have been done to ensure better services and information flow.
                         (iv)Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Investment Promotion Agency of Kosovo (IPAK) has progressed, with capacity building activities for
                         IPAK staff and significant progress made in inspections review, and licensing and permits review.
                         (v)The work for modernization of Kosovo pledge registry has been progressing successfully and it's software and regulations are in the process of being updated and improved.The
                         registry processes some 100 registrations per day. It has around 20000 registrations per year and a total of over 160000 registrations in its database.The registry has an annual
                         income of 200000 Euro, the expenses of the registry are estimated at around 15% of this amount. Apart from the importance of the pledge system in SME development and increase
                         of access to credit, it contributes to the Kosovo Treasury with an amount of 170000 Euro annually. More emphasis should be given to the increase of capacity of the staff of the
                         registry to operate and maintain the system

                         (2) Immovable property rights component. The implementation is progressing well . The progress on remaining activities by sub-components is as follows:

                         (i) Support for the Establishment of an Immovable Property Rights Registration System . Architectural design for 4 MCO's . The designs of the MCOs Peja, Mitrovica, Lipjan and
                         Skenderaj are under preparation. The final set of the design will be completed by end of September 2011. In the mid-time KCA has signed MoUs about the responsibilities of parties
                         with all MCOs
                         (ii) Cadastre Reconstruction. The work on the reconstruction of cadastral informations and data collection in 26 Cadastral Zones is progressing well. It is expected that the project
                         including the public display will be finalized November 2011. In the same time the Commission established from the KCA is active in the public display process.
                         (iii) Building Cadastre
                         Project of Building Cadastre is finalized with more than 12.000 applications collected in the cities of Prishtina, Peja, Prizren and Gjilan. The Operational Manuals, training needs
                         assessment, and the Building Cadastre Construction (BCC) in 4 pilot cities up to the public display procedure, have been completed. The Public Awareness Campaign (PAC) has
                         also been carried out successfully . As a result of improvement in the system, time to register real estate transactions has been reduced from an average of 40 days to about 15 days,
                         with the objective of meeting the target before project completion. In addition, registered mortgages increased from 2,500 to almost 4,000 according to the latest ISR. The target is
                         6,000. We acknowledge the need to be cautions on the attainability of this target as the real estate market is depressed worldwide.
