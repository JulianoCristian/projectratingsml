                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been proceeding well in both components and is almost completed. The key objectives of the project, improving the business environment and enhancing property
                         rights, continue to be crucial for Kosovo's development. Therefore, the project is considered of high relevance for advancing EU accession efforts. Project outcome targets have
                         been achieved fully or to a large extent. As of the end of March, the project disbursed 93 percent of funds; it is expected to be fully disbursed by closing date. In this regard, the
                         government and the Bank Teams reviewed the schedule of activities under implementation since the last restructuring. Alternative options were explored for few activities that will not
                         be completed within the project's lifetime.

                         The project objectives were largely achieved. Progress in the last 15 months was substantial (almost 40 percent of the funds disbursed ) and some impact of the activities undertaken
                         in the latest period may be evident in the months to come. On the whole, out of five PDO Indicators, One was achieved over 100% , two were partially achieved. There is no solid
                         information on one important indicator, although there is evidence of the progress. The reason for that is that the surveys that were expected to be undertaken by external parties

                         (outside of the project) did not take place for reasons beyond the control of the project and the project did not have funds for the survey. The team plans however to undertake a small
                         survey by the time of ICR completion, to assess the progress. One indicator was not achieved due to a late start of the relevant reform, but progress is ongoing and the results will be
                         seen in the near future. Out of five Intermediate Results Indicators, four were achieved over 100%, while one was partially achieved (See Table of Results). Somewhat better
                         performance was achieved on property rights enhancement than on business services integration, however the reforms started under the business component, with the right
                         commitment and support, will have a positive and important impact in improving Kosovo's doing business environment . A modest but important contribution was made by this project
                         to increase the transparency and accountability of implementing institutions.

                         The Government has reiterated its commitment to continue with needed reforms and activities leading to improved business environment and enhanced property rights. It was
                         acknowledged that the new Country Program Strategy under preparation will be mostly focused on the energy sector thereby leaving no room for Bank financing for further business
                         environment improvement. Support to the enhancement of property rights will continue through the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project (RECAP), approved in 2009.
                         Discussions took place concerning possible support to business environment after this project is completed. This is a major challenge deemed crucial for the sustainability of
                         achievements already attained. In this connection, a new IFC Advisory Services Investment Climate project is under preparation.
