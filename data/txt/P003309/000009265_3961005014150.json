short-term objectives of the project\n            are to: (a) minimize the severity of the power shortage in\n            Zimbabwe caused by the recent drought and facilitate\n            economic recovery by increasing the performance and\n            reliability of the Hwange coal-fired power station,\n            Zimbabwe's largest generating station; (b) reduce the\n            incidence and severity of power blackouts during the power\n            shortage to minimize the economic and social disruption they\n            cause. Over the longer term, the project will: (d)\n            selectively increase the capacity and reliability of the\n            distribution system so as to serve more consumers when the\n            power shortage is alleviated; and (e) reduce the unit cost\n            of power and power system investment by commercializing the\n            power utility, improving the condition of existing power\n            facilities, economic power pricing and by short-term\n            technical assistance and training. The project consists of:\n            (a) operation support, maintenance, spares, and major\n            overhaul services and selective equipment upgrades for\n            Hwange Power Station; (b) distribution system reinforcement\n            through the installation of additional transformer capacity,\n            line uprating, and installation of capacitors and load\n            shedding devices; (c) training and technical assistance; (d)\n            provision of workshop equipment and maintenance vehicles;\n            and (e) completion of Zimbabwe Electricity Supply\n            Authority's management information system."}, "docdt": "1993-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
