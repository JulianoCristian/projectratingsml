                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is continuing its progress in meeting its development objectives, contributing to a more efficient, safe and reliable roads transport system in the participating provinces.
                         Some delays with specific works contracts along the Magi and the Hiritano Highway (Central and Gulf provinces) could somewhat delay achievement of the development objectives.
