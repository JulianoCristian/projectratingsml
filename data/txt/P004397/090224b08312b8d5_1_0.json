The supply and maintenance\n            of roads and related infrastructure in the country was\n            complicated due to the rugged, mountainous landscape, a\n            widely dispersed population, and unconnected road networks.\n            Further, the roads sector suffered from inadequate funding,\n            land acquisition difficulties, law and order problems, a\n            small base of private contractors, and limited private\n            sector and community participation. The primary goal of the\n            Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project funded by World\n            Bank was to promote an efficient, safe, and reliable roads\n            transport system in the participating provinces. It focused\n            on the financing of road maintenance and the rehabilitation\n            of national roads and bridges. The project also strengthened\n            small and medium sized contractors, and provincial\n            administrations, for road maintenance operations. It\n            improved the government\u2019s planning and management of the\n            roads sector to advance the quality of life for Papua New Guineans."}, "docdt": "2010-06-09T04:43:05Z"}
