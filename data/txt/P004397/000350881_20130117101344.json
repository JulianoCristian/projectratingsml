{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Road Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation Project for Papua New Guinea were as follows:\n            overall outcome was satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            There were some important project lessons learned. Firstly,\n            the project design was rigorous and realistic in its\n            identification of potential risks. It accurately\n            pre-identified a number of high risks that surfaced during\n            the course of implementation and as such, could be addressed\n            by the project team in a timely manner. Among the highest\n            risks identified were inadequate or late counterpart\n            funding, potential political interference in drawing up\n            annual work programs, inability of the government to acquire\n            additional land, if required, selection of inappropriate\n            contractors, and inability to motivate participating\n            communities to comply with contract conditions. The second\n            reason for the project's success was that recognizing\n            the small size of the civil service in PNG, and the relative\n            inexperience with Bank guidelines and procedures, the\n            project funded a long term, full time Employer's\n            Project Manager to supplement (not supplant) Department of\n            Works (DOW) staff numbers and capabilities. Thirdly,\n            recognizing the large number of potential risks, the Bank\n            project team was proactive in closely supervising the\n            project through regular missions and site visits with\n            government counterparts to verify implementation progress\n            against agreed work plans, the quality of remote works, and\n            compliance with safeguards. Fourthly, the socio-economic\n            impacts of the project works were systematically monitored\n            across beneficiary and control (non-beneficiary) communities\n            in all provinces. The results of these surveys were\n            presented to DOW and other technical staff during the course\n            of the project, highlighting the educational, health and\n            local economic development benefits of improved access, and\n            also identified some of the negative impacts of the program."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
