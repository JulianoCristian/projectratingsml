All works contracts of RMRP are now\n            completed, apart from two significant roads rehabilitation\n            contracts which were due to be completed in November 2011,\n            but have faced delays and are currently under continuing\n            execution. Delays with the remaining contracts were\n            primarily due to adverse working conditions (mainly\n            extremely adverse weather, which has hindered access to\n            construction materials and delayed overall progress) and\n            under resourcing of plant, labor and equipment by the key\n            contractor of the projects. The performance of the\n            implementing agency has been satisfactory and project\n            implementation is satisfactory despite often challenging\n            circumstances. The construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas\n            pipeline and processing facility has taxed the domestic\n            contracting capacity and caused fierce competition for\n            contractors. The inflationary price environment in PNG has\n            also affected contracting capacity. This project\n            restructuring would extend project closing date from\n            December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012 with the Regional Vice\n            President's approval. The reallocation of amounts among\n            categories consists primarily of the formal allocation from\n            the 'unallocated' category of the original project\n            to rehabilitation of national roads and bridges component.\n            Other minor changes reflect the evolved priorities and\n            respective financing needs among various project components."}, "docdt": "2011-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
