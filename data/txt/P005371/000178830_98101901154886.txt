APPRAISAL OF
BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises Banque Nationale pour le Developpement
Economique (BNDE) for a seventh loan of US$30.0 million to finance the im-
port component of industrial projects. The sixth loan, signed May 14, 1973,
was fully committed as of May 1974.
ii.       Morocco has achieved an acceleration of real GDP growth to 5.6
percent a year during the Second Plan period (1968-72), and at the same time
it has moved its balance of payments into surplus, thanks to good export
performance. For the Third Plan period, Morocco aims at a 7.5% GDP growth
rate supported by rising investment and exports. Targets are 11% for industry,
3.6% for agriculture and 6.9% for services. While the Plan period begain in
1973 with a severe drought that reduced farm output and a slow start in
public and private investment, performance on both counts has improved consi-
derably in 1974. The Plan targets for the industrial sector appear attainable
on the basis of momentum already gained by industrial investment.
iii.      Since its association with the Bank Group in 1962, BNDE has devel-
oped into a sound, well-managed institution capable of appraising projects
and making investment decisions on sound financial and economic criteria. It
occupies a key position in the industrial development of Morocco. In fact,
it is the only institution providing contractual long-term financing to in-
dustrial enterprises--a position which has acquired a particular significance
with the recent increase in investment activity following the implementation
of the Five-Year Plan and the new investment incentives system.
iv.       BNDE's lending rate of 9% p.a. results in an effective cost of 7%
p.a. to sub-borrowers after a rebate of 2% by the Government. Until recently,
this rate was considered reasonable in view of Morocco's very stable cost of
living over the past ten years (growing at about 3% p.a.). Since the second
half of 1973, however, the rate of inflation in Morocco has been growing con-
siderably faster than in the past.  If inflation continues at current levels,
then the present effective rate of interest paid by BNDE's clients for long-
term financing may no longer be justified. The Government is well aware of
the problem and is currently reviewing the interest rate structure as it
affects all aspects of the Moroccan economy. During negotiations for the
proposed loan, the Government recognized that there were strong reasons to
increase BNDE's lending rate but indicated that, in order to avoid disruptions
in the current systems, this should take place as part of an overall change
of all interest rates which is expected to take place by mid 1975.



- ii -
v.         BNDE's level of operations generally reflect the investment climate
in Morocco as a whole. Thus, approvals in the two sluggish years, 1972 and
1973, remained at a low level of about DH 113 million and DH 155 million
respectively.  Commitments for the first eight months of 1974 alone of DH 312
million have already exceeded any previous yearly approvals, and BNDE is aim-
ing for a total commitment of DH 383 million for 1974.
vi.        BNDE in recent months has successfully diversified its sources of
financing and reduced its reliance on Bank funds for its resource needs.
Bank funds, as a percentage of total outstanding resources, declined from 61%
in 1972 to 42% by July 31, 1974. With the additional borrowings foreseen for
the next four years, this proportionate reduction should continue.
vii.       BNDE has a satisfactory record of profitability and its financial
position continues to be sound. In 1973, profits after tax were DH 7.6 mil-
lion or 14.3% of average equity and 23.5% of share capital. In 1973, BNDE
increased the dividend rate on its shares from 7% to 8%. Forecasts of opera-
tions indicate that BNDE will be able to maintain this level of dividends and
profitability through 1977, even after a further increase in share capital in
1975. BNDE's investment portfolio is generally sound and potential losses
adequately covered.
viii.      Total resource needs through December 1976 are expected to be about
DH 1,038 million. Against this, BNDE is fairly certain of obtaining resources
of DII 628 million, leaving a resource gap of about DH 410 million (about $95
million) to be financed through additional borrowings (particularly from oil
exporting countries), a share capital increase and the proposed loan.
ix.       As a consequence of the substantial increase in its level of activ-
ity, BNDE will need to strengthen its staff if it is to maintain and improve
the quality of its appraisal and supervision work. It will also have to con-
tilnue to seek substantial resources and at the same time maintain a sound fi-
nancial structure. During negotiations satisfactory agreements were reached
with BNDE on these matters.
x.         BiNDE is creditworthy and suitable to receive a seventh Bank loan
of UJS$30 million. This amount is well within the absorptive capacity of
BNDE for the next two years and is justified in view of its resource needs,
rie resource diversification it has achieved, and the important role it would
continue to play in the economy of Morocco.

APPRAISAL OF
BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE), es-
tablished in 1959, has received six loans from the World Bank, totalling
$121.5 million.  In 1962, IFC became a shareholder.  The most recent loan
from the Bank, $24 million, was signed on May 14, 1973 and was fully commit-
ted in Mav 1974. Additional but insufficient resources have been mobilized
from diverse sources and BNDE needs further finance to meet its growing
requirements. This report appraises BNDE for a seventh loan and brings up
to date the investment environment in the industrial sector.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
Economic Situation
2.01      The economic situation in Morocco was reviewed in the report en-
titled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Morocco" dated February 7,
1974, distributed to the Executive Directors in March 1974, (R74-47) and a
memorandum entitled "Supplementary Note on the Impact of Recent International
Price Changes in the Moroccan Economy," distributed to the Consultative Group
for Morocco on March 20, 1974.
2.02      Morocco achieved an acceleration of GDP growth to 5.6 percent a
year during the Second Plan period (1968-72), and at the same time moved its
balance of payments into surplus. Good export performance was a major source
of this growth throughout the Plan period, while public and private invest-
ment markedly slowed down in 1971-72 after having experienced sizeable
increases in 1968-70. Sustaining GDP growth, agricultural output benefitted
from generally favorable weather conditions and achieved an average rate of
increase of almost 6 percent a year. Manufacturing, including the large
handicraft subsector, expanded by about 5 percent a year. The sectoral com-
position of GDP changed little over the period; in 1972, non-government
services (including transportation) represented 36 percent of GDP, agriculture
27 percent, and manufacturing and government services about 12 percent each.
Thanks mainly to continued export growth and a slowdown of import growth in
1971-72, the balance of payments began to register annual surpluses in 1969
which brought reserves up to the equivalent of 3.5 months of imports by the
end of 1972.



-2-
2.03      For the Third Plan period (1973-77), Morocco aims at an overall
7.5% increase in GDP per year; industrial output is expected to increase
at an annual rate of 11%, agriculture 3.6% and services 6.9%. Investment
during 1973-1977 is planned at DH 26.3 billion - double the actual investments
in the previous five-year period. Thirty-seven percent of this investment
will be devoted to industry, as compared to 21% during the previous Plan.
Overall, the private and banking sectors are expected to provide about 45%
of the resources needed to finance this investment. Most of the institutional
long-term finance for industrial investment is expected to come from BNDE.
2.04      The Plan began in 1973 with a severe drought that reduced agricul-
tural output by 11%, and with a slow start for public and private investment.
The latter was due essentially to the late publication (in August 1973) of
the Plan document and the measures providing new incentives for private
investment. Sustained almost solely by a further 27% increase in exports,
GDP growth was below 2% in 1973, and the balance of payments remained in
surplus.
2.05      Preliminary indications for the first six months of 1974 are that
the economy has weathered the initial impact of higher petroleum prices.
Morocco has obtained large increases in the price of phosphate, its main
export product, which offset import price rises. Thus, external reserves
have continued to increase. At the same time, agricultural output has
recovered from the low level experienced in 1973, and based on applications
over the past twelve months, investments in the industrial sector is increas-
ing rapidly. There is a general air of confidence and optimism in the business
and banking community.
2.06      To what extent this upward surge is due to various factors including
political stability is impossible to state, but the package of incentives
for investors seems to be one of the important elements stimulating investment.
In general, the incentives for industry are embodied in the new Industrial
Investment Code. This Code, the principal features of which are described
in Annex 1, has been well received. It follows in many respects suggestions
made by the Bank. Its administrative feature of virtually granting incentives
automatically within thirty days after the submission of an application to
the Ministry of Industry, as well as its clear definitions of eligibility,
enable investors to make decisions which previously could be made only with
considerable delay and negotiation.
2.07      Industrial investment is also being encouraged by other measures.
An office for industrial development (ODI) has been established to promote
industrial investment in private and public sectors through Government sponsor-
ed studies and Government participations. During the Plan 1973-1978, ODI is
expected to spend DH 15 million on special studies and the Plan allocates DH
423 million (about $105 million) for participations in industrial ventures.
ODI is making considerable effort to strengthen its staff and is working
closely with BNDE to find suitable entrepreneurs and financing for new enter-
prises.



- 3-
Structure of the Manufacturing Industry
2.08      Available data indicate that, at the end of 1972, the structure of
manufacturing was heavily weighted in favor of consumer goods production,
which represented 63% of the sectoral total, whereas industries producing
intermediate and capital goods were much less important (24% and 13%, re-
spectively). Among firms employing more than 10 workers, food processing
was the largest sub-sector with 43% of the value added in the manufacturing
sector; it was followed by textiles and leather goods (17%), metal working
(16%), chemicals (10%), construction materials (6%), pulp and paper (5%) and
other sub-sectors (4%). Investment in manufacturing totalled nearly DH 1.9
billion in the previous Plan period (1968-72). M4ore than three-fourths was
carried out by private companies. Exports by the manufacturing sector rose
by 13.6% over that period from 17% in 1967 to 24% in 1972 of Morocco's total
merchandise exports. These exports were based predominantly on domestic raw
materials. BNDE provided financing amounting to DH 630 million (43%) for
manufacturing investment during the second Plan period and funds from the
last three Bank loans have for the most part been invested in the important
sub-sectors indicated above. The description of BNDE's characteristics of
operations (paras 4.02-4.16) provides a further indication of the structure
of the manufacturing industry.
Financial Community
2.09      Morocco's financial system is dominated by 18 commercial banks and
five specialized institutions, including BNDE. Long-term finance is provided
to private investors principally through three institutions, the agricultural
bank (CNCA), the housing and tourism bank (CIH), and the industrial bank (BNDE),
each of which services its respective sectors and has received Bank loans.
2.10      BNDE's key position derives from its being the only financial institu-
tion authorized to provide the industrial sector with contractual long-term
financing. In addition, BNDE plays a major role in the distribution of
medium-term loans by commercial banks to the industrial sector. Medium-term
loans, initially extended by commercial banks, may be discounted with the
Central Bank only if appraised and approved by BNDE. These loans have terms
up to five years and bear a minimum interest of 6.5% for the final borrower.
The Central Bank's rediscount rate is 4.5% and BNDE's commission 0.75%. The
primary risk of default is borne by the commercial bank, with BNDE guaranteeing
only against the risk that the commercial banks may fail to pay the Central
Bank. Since the possibility of such defaults is remote, BNDE bears practically
no risk.
2.11      The medium-term rediscounting procedure gives BNDE the opportunity
to determine appropriate terms for the needs of a borrower and to propose its
help to clients who would not otherwise become long-term borrowers. BNDE ap-
praises these discountable loans in the same way as its own direct loans. In
the opinion of the Central Bank, BNDE is the only entity in Morocco equipped
to appraise satisfactorily industrial medium-term loans.

Interest Rates
2.12      The Government follows a policy of strictly regulating the interest
rates of all institutions such as the Central Bank, BNDE and the commercial
banks. As a result, resource mobilization of borrowed funds is basically
controlled by the Government. Interest paid on deposits is low and, in some
instances, the commercial banks are unable to attract significant new deposits
and must rely very heavily on rediscounting operations involving BNDE. It is
generally acknowledged that the interest rate level and structure require ad-
justments, and reforms suggested in a study which was made in 1973-74 by the
Central Bank with IMF assistance are being implemented or under consideration.
Over the past decade, the Moroccan economy has been partially insulated from
international monetary effects. Until recently the rise in the cost of living
has been very modest, averaging only 3.0% during the past eight years includ-
ing a 4.1% rise in 1973 at a time when inflation in Europe has been running at
about 5-7% p.a. Inflationary pressures are becoming apparent, however, and
although the cost of living index has been falling since April 1974 (influenced
,rimarily by favorable agricultural production) the average increase over the
first five months of 1974 was about 13% p.a. This increase was heavily weighted
by events (poor harvest, energy crisis) which had pronounced effects on prices
during the July 1973-January 1974 period. In May 1974, the index was slightly
lower than in January 1974 and it is not unreasonable to expect a 8-10% increase
in 1974. Inflation is now forcing the introduction of changes, the first of
which took place in July 1974 when the Central Bank rediscount rate was raised
from 3.5% to 4.5% and the interest allowed on deposits was increased on a
graduated scale by 0.75% to 2.25% bringing the rate to a maximum of 5.5% for
deposits up to 2 years. Limits on the rate for deposits of more than 2 years
were also removed. In addition, interest rates on treasury bonds were in-
creased with the maximum rate for 15 year bonds rising from 6.25% to 7.5%.
2.13      BNDE is permitted to charge 9% on its loans but 2% is rebated to
its borrowers by the Government, resulting in an effective rate of 7% to BNDE's
borrowers. While this procedure provides a low rate of interest in terms of
world markets and the current inflation rate, this rate is still above the
average cost of money to BNDE (para. 4.08) and is above what is paid by most
other sectors within the economy. In reviewing the Investment Code for in-
dustry, the Bank considered the interest rate as only one element in a total
incentive package. The Bank agreed generally with the Moroccan view that a
substantial incentive was required to ensure a rapid recovery of the invest-
ment climate in the manufacturing sector. Indeed, industrial investment since
the publication of the code has been booming. New projects financed by BNDE
over this period are meeting the objective of the Plan, namely emphasis on
processing manufacturing with export notential.
2.14      The Government is determined to complete its review of interest
rates for the entire economy. A permanent Interest Rate Commission has been
established to study all aspects of the banking sector and to propose recom-
mendations with regard to Morocco's interest rate policies. On the basis of
this review, the Government intends to increase the general level of interest
rates in the light of the recent acceleration of inflation. The study is a
complex task, since the current system has been basically unquestioned for
more than twenty years. The Commission is drawing extensively on the advice



and assistance of the IMF and the Bank, and a constructive and cooperative
dialogue has been established in this respect. An overall reform, based on
the findings of the study is expected to take place by mid-1975.
2.15       In discussions during negotiations for the proposed loan, the Govern-
ment recognized that there were strong reasons to increase BNDE's lending rate,
but indicated that this should take place only as part of the expected overall
change of all interest rates in Morocco in order to avoid disruptions in the
current system. The Government also indicated that the study would focus on the
possibility of passing the foreign exchange risk to BNDE's borrowers; at
present it is carried by the Government. The authorities, however, feel
that it would probably be premature to require BNDE's borrowers to assume
this risk at a time of considerable uncertainty in the foreign exchange
markets.
III. BNDE'S STRUCTURE
A. Corporate Status
3.01       BNDE operates principally from its headquarters in Rabat and, apart
from an office in Casablanca established in 1973 to increase promotional ac-
tivities, has no branches.
B. Ownership and Control
3.02       A list of BNDE's shareholders at June 30, 1974 is given in Annex 2.
In December 1972, BNDE increased its share capital from DHi 20.0 million to
DH 32.4 million through the issue of bonus shares of DH 2.4 million and cash
subscriptions of DH 10.0 million. For the first time, a major proportion (81%)
was subscribed by private shareholders thus meeting in part one of BNDE's ob-
jectives since its association with the Bank in 1962. The share of Govern-
ment ownership has reduced from 43.6% in June 1972 to 38.2% at June 30,
1974, and the share of private individuals increased from 0.4% to 17.3% over
the same period. IFC which held 24.7% in 1972 reduced its share to 14.8% by
June 1974.
C. Board and Executive Committee
3.03       The present composition of BNDE's Board is stated in Annex 3.  The
Board meets four times a year. Since the time of the appraisal of BNDE for
a sixth Bank loan in March 1973, the Bank of Tokyo and the Kuwait Investment
Company have been given seats on the Board. Government and public institutions'
representation now includes CIH (Credit Immobilier et Hotelier), the Director
of the Plan and Regional Development and the Office de Developpement Industriel
(ODI).



- 6 -
3.04      During the previous appraisal of BNDE, it was felt that BNDE's
Board relied too heavily on management's judgements and endorsed uncritically
management's proposals. Developments since then indicate improvement in this
respect. The management is now keeping the Board members abreast of BNDE's
activities, and Board members are more intimately involved in BNDE's opera-
tions. Project proposals, particularly those involving policy matters, are
often discussed at length and more thoroughly examined than before.
3.05      The Board has delegated power to approve loans up to DUi 4 million
to the Executive Committee. It also examines loan proposals above this amount
prior to their presentation to the Board. The Committee, composed of seven
members (see Annex 3), meets once a month. Although the rate of rejection
of projects is less than 5%, BNDE's proposals are thoroughly examined and
changes are often proposed prior to approval or presentation to the Board.
Representation of IFC, both on the Board and Executive Committee, gives an
opportunity to the Bank Group to examine all projects financed by BNDE.
D. Management and Staff
3.06      Mr. Mustapha Faris, former Finance Minister, was appointed President
and General Manager of BNDE in December 1972 - just prior to the Bank's ap-
praisal for the sixth loan to BNDE. Developments since then ciearly show that
Mr. Faris has succeeded in strengthening and ably managing BNDE. He is highly
regarded and respected by the business community, the Government and the BNDE
staff.  Except for the problem related to engineers (para. 3.10) he has succeeded
in retaining staff of high calibre.
3.07      BNDE's activities are divided into two main groups each headed by
a Deputy General Manager -- Mr. Sefrioui and Mr. Mansouri (Organization Chart,
Annex 4). The group headed by Mr. Sefrioui is divided into three departments
handling legal and administrative matters, financial management, project super-
vision and promotion activities. The three departments under Mr. Mansouri
handle principally all project appraisal work including economic evaluation,
equity portfolio, and disbursements. The engineers for technical studies are
also under Mr. Mansouri, although they may be called upon by the follow-up
division as and when required (para. 3.20).
3.08      BNDE's professional staff is well-qualified, adequately experienced
and work effectively as a team particularly at the Department head level.
BNDE also has an effective training program for new recruits and encourages
training for existing staff. About 25% of the present staff have participated
in training programs and seminars in Europe and USA.
3.09      Overall, there has been a considerable improvement in the management
of BNDE since the previous appraisal (for the sixth BNDE loan). This is
largely attributable to the competence and drive brought in by Mr. Faris.
lie has achieved a better internal coordination, streamlined and strengthened
procedures for appraisal and supervision and maintained generally high levels



- 7 -
of staff calibre and morale. With the improvement in the economic and invest-
ment climate, BNDE's staff is better motivated. Outside, Mr. Faris has helped
to improve substantially BNDE's image with investors, Government, and interna-
tionally with potential and actual creditors.
3.10      Engineers.  Since the departure of three engineers, between December
1972 and September 1973, BNDE now has only three engineers, who, in the ab-
sence of a supervisor, report directly to Mr. Mansouri. There is an acute
shortage of qualified engineers in Morocco as a whole. BNDE has been unable
to compete with the private enterprises as well as the semi-private ones,
who have been offering more attractive compensation than BNDE.  The available
engineers in BNDE are increasingly unable to devote sufficient time to study
the new projects thoroughly, and supervision of projects under construction
is inadequate. Engineers are assigned for follow-up action only when projects
are in serious difficulties, some of which could probably have been avoided
through a timely intervention by BNDE engineers.
3.11      With the rapid increase in activities, BNDE needs at least four more
senior qualified engineers, one of which should be capable of leading and co-
ordinating the technical appraisal and follow-up work of BNDE. In addition,
BNDE should also recruit four junior technical assistants both to assist in
the present technical work and as a back-up for future needs of engineers.
Management is aware of the problem and is currently recruiting additional
engineers. It has recently introduced a "premium" in addition to normal
salary in order to make its remuneration package more attractive. With this
change, BNDE has a reasonable chance of recruiting additional technical staff.
During negotiations BNDE confirmed its intention to recruit at least two senior,
and two junior engineers by December 1974 and further two senior and two junior
engineers by June 1975.
3.12      Apart from the engineers, BNDE has also begun to feel the shortage
of financial analysts and economists. The problem is not as acute as for
engineers, and BNDE is taking the necessary action in this respect.
E. Policies and Procedures
Operational Policies
3.13      Annex 5 contains BNDE's Policy Statement.  No changes have been
made since the last appraisal of BNDE in March 1973.
Public Sector Financing
3.14      BNDE has been increasing its financing of public sector projects.
BNDE's Policy Statement restricts its financing of public sector to "special
circumstances and when private capital cannot be found on reasonable terms".
This provision is being interpreted rather liberally. Furthermore, BNDE's
exposure to any single enterprise is limited to 15% of BNDE's share capital,
reserves and outstanding Government loans, with the exception of investments



-8-
which are covered by Government or bank guarantees. BNDE has confirmed that
its involvement in the public sector will continue to be in conformity of
these policies neither of which it considers restrictive for its expected
involvement in the public sector.  Although most of the public sector proj-
ects in BNDE's current pipeline are of medium size, there are a few large
expected ones in 1975 and 1976. BNDE expects to finance these projects
from funds other than the proposed Bank loan. However, to ensure a wider
utilization of Bank funds, BNDE agreed not-to utilize more than 40% of the
next Bank loan for public sector projects.
3.15      Maximum Limit for Single Enterprise.  Under the present Agreement with
the Bank the maximum amount which BNDE can utilize out of the Bank loan to any
single enterprise is limited to US$3.5 million.  Due to the increase in cost of
imports, the Bank,;during negotiations, agreed to increase the limit to US$4.0
million.
Project Appraisals
3.16      BNDE's appraisals have generally showed a steady improvement since
the sixth loan and have reached an acceptable standard, though the lack of
engineers is starting to be felt. A principal shortcoming has been that the
effect of incentives on viability of projects has not been clearly quantified
or discussed in appraisal reports as agreed at the time of the sixth loan.
During negotiations, BNDE agreed that for all future appraisals of projects
above the free limit it will include forecasts of profitability both with and
without the incentives.
3.17      BNDE also calculates the effective rate of protection for all proj-
ects financed through Bank funds (para 4.14) and economic rate of return cal-
culation for all projects enjoying more than 50% protection and projects for
which BNDE's financing exceeds DH 5 million. Experience, as regards effective
rate of protection, indicates that though at times inconsistent in its applica-
tion, BNDE has atapted to the procedure well and is applying it satisfactorily.
The Bank should continue to monitor the procedure and ensure that it is con-
sistently applied to all projects financed by BNDE. Experience with the econ-
omic rate of return has been somewhat limited. However, BNDE is now well-
familiar with the technique.
3.18      Free limit.  The increased cost of imports and the improved quality
of BNDE's appraisals justify an increase of the free limit from US$500,000 to
US$900,000. This will correspond with the investments which BNDE's Executive
Committee is authorized to approve without Board action (DH 4 million - para
3.05). Based upon experience with the sixth loan, such increase should still
allow the Bank to monitor about 75% in amount and 40% in number of BNDE proj-
ects financed under the proposed loan. The aggregate free limit should be
about 25% of the loan i.e.,US$7 million.
Project Supervision
3.19      The supervision of projects by BNDE is handled in two stages.  Proj-
ects under construction are supervised by the Technical Division. The engineers



- 9 -
aim at visiting each project at least twice during the construction period,
essentially to ensure that the project construction and financing thereof is
proceeding in accordance with the appraisal and to investigate any major de-
partures from the plan. Due to the insufficient number of engineers, however,
supervision of projects under construction has suffered in the past two years.
Engineers are currently unable to devote more than 20-25% of their time to
supervision whereas, in the past, their time was roughly equally divided be-
tween supervision and study of new projects. The proposed increase in the
number of engineers (para. 3.11) should enable BNDE to remedy this situation.
3.20      A separate division for supervision of projects in operation was
created in March 1974 under Mr. Sefrioui. Approximately 20 reports prepared
by the new division indicate that the staff is capable of carrying out effec-
tive supervision; the quality of reports shows a definite improvement over
previous ones. However, reports have still a tendency to be descriptive and
there is a lack of judgement as regards the actions which ought to be taken.
The separation of technical engineers from supervision and their shortage
has also resulted in inadequate coverage of the technical aspects of projects.
A more effective coordination with the supervision division should be one of
the principal objectives of strengthening the technical department (para. 3.11).
Due to limited staff available (three economists/financial analysts) the
division has concentrated its supervision work primarily on projects in
difficulties. BNDE is now planning to strengthen the staffing of the divi-
sion to achieve a wider coverage. The Bank should follow progress in this
respect closely over the next two years.
Procurement
3.21      Although BNDE has not, as a rule, required competitive bidding,
procurement procedures are satisfactory. The large clients generally go
through competitive bidding before selecting contractors and suppliers. The
medium and small clients either do an international shopping before presenting
their selection to BNDE or are able to justify their selection, which is exa-
mined carefully by BNDE. However, BNDE's appraisal reports often do not in-
clude a review of procurement nor a discussion on prices, suitability and
basis for selecting the equipment for the projects. BNDE has agreed to in-
clude this subject in future appraisal reports.
Disbursements
3.22      Disbursements are satisfactorily handled by BNDE.  Every disburse-
ment is checked to ensure that BNDE's financing is proceeding pari-passu with
other sources of funds and that the disbursement is justified by the progress
of project implementation.

IV. BNDE'S OPERATIONS
A. Operations
4.01      BNDE is active in three major fields:  direct loans, equity invest-
ments and rediscountable medium-term loans. Annex 6 shows an analysis of
BNDE's operations, the principal features of which are discussed below.
B. Characteristics of Operations
Volume
.02       From BNDE's inception in 1959 to December 1973, BNDE approved 1,116
operations for a total of DH 1.7 billion (US$406 million equivalent). Until
1970, approximately 43% of its total operations were in rediscountable medium-
term loans (para. 2.10). The proportion of these loans in BNDE's total opera-
tions has not changed significantly.
4.03      Since BNDE is the only source of term-financing for industry, its
level of business generally reflects, with some time lag, the level of invest-
ment decisions in Morocco. Thus, its total direct loan approvals declined
from DH 165 million in 1970 to DH 113 million and DH 88 million in the two
sluggisth years of 1971 and 1972. As a result of an upsurge in industrial in-
vestment since the last quarter of 1973, total approvals of direct loans picked
up again in 1973, and approvals from January 1974 through August 1974 alone, of
DH 312 million have exceeded all previous annual approvals. This trend is
continuing.
Size and terms of direct loans
4.04      Through 1970, the size of direct loans approved by BNDE averaged
DH 1.8 million. As a result of the large projects approved in recent years,
the yearly average was about DII 2.6 million in 1971-72 and DH 3.1 million in
1973, resulting in an increase in overall average size of all direct loans
through 1973 to DH 2.1 million. Ninety-one percent of total number of proj-
ects and 53% in total amounts of direct loans approved since inception have
been for loans under DH 5 million. These percentages have not changed signi-
ficantly in the past three years. M-at of BNDE's loans to industry have terms
of 5 to 12 years. Since the take-over of all hotel financing by CIH, BNDE has
virtually made no direct hotel loans for over 12 years. 1/
1/   The major exception was 20 loans to CIH totalling DH 37 million in the
period 1966-70 under a tripartite convention signed in 1966 between BNDE,
CIH and the Bank.



- 11 -
Sector and Purpose
4.05      Sectoral distribution of BNDE's approvals (including rediscountable
loans) has remained basically unchanged in the past three years. Textile and
food processing still account for, roughly, 35% of BNDE's approvals. Ap-
provals for the next major group--mining and petroleum industries-accounted
for about 15% of approvals in the past three years reducing the share of these
sectors in BNDE's total approvals to date to 23% compared to about 28% at the
end of 1970. BNDE's operations reflect approximately the sectoral breakdown
of private industry in Morocco. Traditionally, about half of BNDEts approvals
have been directed towards expansion and modernization. However, due to
several large extension projects financed in 1972 and 1973, the share of such
projects in BNDE's approvals over the last three years amounted to 59%. The
trend is expected to reverse slightly in the next years with an increase in
the number of new projects being generated following the implementation of
the new investment incentives.
Project Sponsors
4.06      BNDE has, in the past, financed primarily privately owned enter-
prises with only about 27% of its total approval through 1970 directed to
public sector projects. The trend has continued in the past three years when
in fact nearly 80% of its approvals were in the private sector. Although BNDE
expects financing several public sector projects in the next three years,
this is not likely to affect the predominant share of private-sector financ-
ing in the short-run.
Import Component
4.07      As in the past, about 85% of BNDE's direct loan commitments continue
to be directed toward financing imported equipment. Although the import com-
ponent of projects financed by BNDE has shown a slight tendency towards re-
duction, it remains between 40% and 45%.
Interest Rate
4.08      BNDE's interest rate was increased from 7% to 8% in July 1971 and to
its present level of 9% in January 1972. BNDE also charges a commitment fee
on undisbursed amounts of 0.75% for the first three months, 0.80% for the next
three and 0.85% for .the period in excess of six months. BNDE's borrowing cost
of all debt has averaged between 4.8% to 5.3% over 1970-73. Average cost of
all of BNDE's outstanding resources at July 31, 1974 amounted to 5.8%. With
the more expensive debt expected to be contracted (para 6.07), average cost
of long-term debt is expected to increase from about 5.5% to 6.8% by 1977.
Taking into account the increase in the level of operations and higher debt
leverage, the current lending rate of 9% is sufficient, for the time being,
for BNDE to maintain and possibly improve its overall profitability (para
6.09).



- 12 -
Maroc Leasing
4.09      An important feature of BNDE's financing is the continuation of its
support to Maroc-Leasing, established in 1965 under the sponsorship of Banque
de Paris et des Pays-Bas and BNDE. Maroc-Leasing is engaged in hire-purchase
financing to small- and medium-size firms. Its annual volume of business which
averaged DH 21 million in 1970-72 reached DH 24.5 million in 1973. Services
offered by Maroc-Leasing complement those of BNDE, and it is performing a use-
ful function in making credit available quickly for small plant expansions.
Equity Investments
4.10      Annual equity commitments in the past three years have increased to
DH 35 million and BNDE's equity portfolio of nearly DH 55 million represented
an increase of two and a half times the level of 1970. BNDE has not made any
concerted efforts at disinvesting its equity holdings as recommended by the
Bank on the occasion of the sixth loan. BNDE feels that the size and quality
of its equity portfolio is not yet such as to allow it to make significant
sales without reducing the overall quality of its portfolio.  While these
reasons are understandable, the Bank should continue to impress upon BNDE the
need to sell its participations in order to broaden company ownership and re-
volve BNDE's resources.
C. Impact of BNDE's Operations
4.11      BNDE plays a significant role in financing industrial projects
(Annex 7). During the five-year period, 1969-73, BNDE participated in the
financing of projects costing DVI 2.4 billion and provided 67% of the external
funds required to carry out the projects; 40% directly, and 27% indirectly
through appraising rediscountable loans (Annex 6). About 75% of these invest-
ments were in the industrial sector (including leasing) and the bulk of the
remainder in the mining and energy sectors.
4.12      Analysis of the investments made under the last three loans to BNDE
by the Bank (Annex 8), indicates that 31% of the 124 projects financed were
new enterprises; 27% of these projects were expected to export more than 10%
of their production; and 45% of the projects financed created employment for
25 or more persons each.
4.13      Export-oriented industry, particularly textiles and food processing,
has occupied an important place in BNDE's effort to support industrial devel-
opment. Funds from the last two Bank loans have been invested in 14 enter-
prises which export over 50% of their production. Seventeen others export
frora 10 to 50%. BNDE expects to continue to favor such projects.
4.14      The greater portion of BNDE's financing, however, continues to be
for import substitution projects. Of the 94 projects financed under the last
two Bank loans to BNDE, 12 (13%) projects have an effective protection rate of
more than 50%. Most of these projects are in enterprises producing pipes,



- 13 -
paper, and building materials. Two food processing industries, sugar and yeast,
have protection rates of more than 130% 1/. On the other hand, 42 projects
(45%) have low or negative rates of protection indicating competitiveness with
imports and potential for exports. A great portion of the other projects
financed by BNDE enjoy natural protection: transport, leasing, public works,
and services. Bank's funds are generally being used for economically viable
projects and not for developing a highly protected industry.
4.15      Creation of employment has not been a prominent feature of the proj-
ects financed by BNDE. New enterprises tend to be small and most financing
is for expansions. An analysis of about forty of the projects financed under
the previous loan indicates a rather high cost per job created--estimated at
about US$30,000 per job. Considering, however, that most projects are expan-
sions which often do not create many new jobs (the expansion of a cement plant
or a refinery adds very few employees), the high cost is not surprising. In
the analysis referred to above, the investment per job created drops to about
US$17,000 if three projects, two expansions and one new tire manufacturing
plant, are eliminated from the analysis. Furthermore, some of the capital in-
tensive projects are providing the raw materials for other enterprises which
export but are not financed by BNDE. For example, a number of textile proj-
ects supply cloth for the labor intensive ready-made clothing industry. Never-
theless, as Morocco moves toward a competitive position in the European Common
Market, its labor cost advantage should be fully exploited and BNDE should try
to promote the employment aspect of its projects. During negotiations for the
proposed loan, BNDE agreed to estimate in its appraisal reports employment ex-
pected to be generated and provide adequate justification where the investment/
employment ratio appears excessive.
4.16      Equally, if not more important than its financing activities, BNDE's
appraisal provides a screening for investments so that resources are used for
projects having reasonable financial and economic prospects. BNDE's construc-
tive assistance to investors in shaping the financial structure, marketing and
project design is well recognized in the Government and business communities
and enhances the impact it exerts on the economy.
V. BNDE'S FINANCIAL STRUCTURE
A. Resource Position
5.01      Total resources mobilized by BNDE as of July 31, 1974 amounted to DII
786.4 million (Annex 9). This represents an increase of Dil 250.1 million (47%)
over the total resources at December 31, 1972, determined at the time of the
previous appraisal of BNDE. Principal increases have been (i) DI 60 million
in Government loans; (ii) DH 46 million in local bonds; (iii) DH 72 million in
1/   SUCRAFOR, the sugar project, had an 11% economic rate of return.



- 14 -
additional lines of credit from Banque Nationale de Plaris; (iv) DR 33.6 mil-
lion from Eksportfinans (Norway); (v) DH 21.5 million from the African Develop-
ment Bank; and (vi) Dii 12 million in retained earnings.
5.02      The Bank, in recent years, has been encouraging BNDE to diversify
its resources and to reduce its reliance on Bank funds. BNDE has made serious
efforts towards this, and the share of IBRD funds in total resources outstand-
ing has declined from 61.0% in 1972 to 41.8% at July 31, 1974. With the addi-
tional resources contracted since then, and those expected over the next two
years, the reduction of IBRD funds in total resources of BNDE is likely to
continue (para. 6.07). Share of Bank funds in BNDE total resources is ex-
pected to reduce to about 30% by 1976.
5.03      Because of substantial increase in business activity since the pub-
lication of the new Investment Code, and particularly in 1974, BNDE has commit-
ted finance to projects almost as fa~t as it was able to mobilize resources.
At July 31, 1974, although it had DH 288 million available for disbursements,
the amount available for new commitments was only about DII 17 million.
B. Financial Position and Performance
Financial Situation
5.04      Annex 10 shows BNDE's audited balance sheets for the past 4 years,
reflecting a growth in total assets from DH 261 million at the end of 1970 to
DII 522 million by July 1974. Total loans outstanding have almost doubled and
equity investments have increased two and a half times since 1970. Most of
the growth was financed through additional borrowing which more than doubled
to a level of DH 423 million. Increase in share capital, and retained earn-
ings, financed approximately DH 23 million of the increase in assets.
5.05      BNDEts balance sheets at the end of 1970, 1971 and 1973 reflect a
negative current position. Current liabilities, however, include DH 10 million
of short-term treasury bills which are continuously and automatically renewable.
BNDE utilizes these funds to disburse against projects which are eventually
refinanced through its long-term resources. If this amount is excluded from
the current liabilities, BNDE's current position reverts to more than 1:1 and
is thus satisfactory.
5.06      BNDE's debt/equity ratio calculated in accordance with the present
Bank Loan Agreements has increased from 3.0:1 in 1970 to 4.7:1 in July 1974.
Under these agreements BNDE includes in its equity base (and excludes from its
total term debt), the part of a DH 40.0 million Government subordinated loan
which matures after the last maturity of any Bank loan. Currently, BNDE is able
to treat Dil 23.3 million of the loan as quasi-capital. Total term-debt/equity
ratio calculated in the conventional manner amounted to about 7:1 at present,
which is reasonable.



- 15 -
Profitability
5.07      Operating results of BNDE, summarized in Annex 11, reflect a satis-
factory record of profitability. Earnings before tax, and net income as a
percentage of average net worth, increased from 13.8% and 11.0% respectively
in 1970 to 16.6% and 14.3% in 1973. BNDE's shareholders received a dividend
of 7% in 1970 to 1972 and 8% in 1973. Book value of shares (par value DH 50)
increased to DII 95 by 1971, principally due to retained earnings, reduced to
DH 79 following the increase in share capital and increased again to about
DH 85 by end-1973.  BNDE's shares are currently quoted at about DH 60 per
share, which results in a dividend yield per share of 6.7% and a price earn-
ings ratio of approximately 5:1.
Equity Investments
5.08      BNDE's total equity portfolio of DH 54.5 million at December 31,
1973 consisted of investments in 39 companies - 22 of which (61% of total
equity portfolio) were operating at profit (Annex 13).
5.09      Dividend income from BNDE's profitable investments increased from
DH 971,000 in 1971 to DH 2.7 million in 1973 (3.7% of BNDE's holdings in pro-
fitable companies in 1971 to 8.1% in 1973). This substantial increase in
profitability was somewhat offset by an increased proportion of BNDE's invest-
ments which were operating at a loss. Principally two major investments -
SUCRAFOR (Sugar refinery) and Cellulose du Maroc (pulp and paper) representing
18% of BNDE's total equity investments - have contributed to the deterioration
of the quality of BNDE's overall equity portfolio. Both companies are under-
going financial and operational reorganization, and BNDE is cautiously optimistic
about their future.
5.10      BNDE makes specific provisions against unprofitable equity investments.
At December 31, 1973, such provisions amounted to DH 4.2 million (7.7% of total
equity holdings). A case-by-case review of BNDE's equity investments carried
out by its auditors in August 1974 indicated that DH 3.2 million would be suf-
ficient to cover potential losses in such investments. Consequently DiH 1.0
million of the provisions have been treated in this report as excess to re-
quirements and included in BNDE's equity at December 1973. Overall, BNDE's
equity portfolio is sound and BNDE continues to follow a prudent policy for
providing against possible losses.
Quality of Loan Portfolio
5.11      As of December 31, 1973, BNIDE's outstanding loan portfolio consisted
of 199 loan operations to 150 clients, 28 of which (comprising 25% of total
loan portfolio) were repeat clients and 122 first time borrowers. Loans in
their grace periods amounted to DII 52 million, or 13% of total loan portfolio.
BNDE's outstanding loan portfolio does not entirely reflect its business with
existing clients since a fair number of repeat operations are for medium-term
loans which are rediscounted. Taking all its activities into account, BNDE
seems to have a satisfactory balance between new and repeat operations. In
1973, of the 179 operations (including rediscountable loans) BNDE participated
in financing 91 new enterprises.



- 16 -
5.12      Arrears of principal and interest in excess of three months amounted
to DH 12.2 million at the end of 1973. Loans to 31 companies, comprising 9.0%
of total loan portfolio (DH 393 million), were affected by such arrears. This
compares with the situation at the time of the previous appraisal of BNDE when
only 21 companies representing 4.5% of the portfolio were in arrears of prin-
cipal.
5.13      Of the 31 companies in arrears, 8 were in arrears only as regards
interest. Most of them are financially sound; the arrears reflect temporary
difficulties and the probability of losses on BNDE loans are minimal (five
companies had in fact paid up the interest arrears by May 1974). Of the 23
companies which have arrears of principal and are in financial difficulties,
15 have a fairly reasonable chance of success, and BNDE should recover its
debt. Three of these had commenced to show profit in 1974. BNDE has entered
into arrangements with most of these 15 companies for liquidation of their
debt. BNDE also holds adequate securities against them and thus no losses are
expected on these loans. BNDE loans which may result in losses thus reduces
to 8 companies against which BNDE had DH 18.0 million of loans outstanding at
December 31, 1973.
Pro-vision against Loan Portfolio
5.14      Unlike provisions for losses on equity investments, BNDE does not
make specific provisions for doubtful loan accounts. However, in order to take
the maximum tax benefits available to BNDE, it carries a global reserve for
loan risks which is increased each year through appropriation of net income.
BNDE, in its published financial statements, treats the total amount of such
reserve as part of its equity.  Until 1971 (Fifth loan), the Bank had accepted
this position since BNDE's arrears were small and BNDEts potential risks ap-
peared insignificant.   In 1972, at the time of appraisal of the sixth loan,
BNDE agreed, at the request of the Bank, to make a case-by-case review of its
portfolio, to determine on that basis the requirement of provisions for each
loan, to obtain the auditors' opinion on the adequacy thereof and to exclude
such provisions from its equity base. In the first of such reviews carried
out after some delay, in August 1974, the auditors have stated that provisions
of D)h 2.3 million are necessary to cover potential losses in BND)E's loan port-
folio at December 1973. BNDE has agreed to review its portfolio each year in
a sJimilar way and to exclude estimated provisions as agreed with its auditors
from its equity.
5.1 5     In summary, a detailed analysis of BNDE's portfolio shows that arrears
are well within manageable limits and BNDE adequately covered.  The position
nad in iact improved by May 1974 when loans affected by major arrears reduced
to) tX.X%.



- 17 -
C. Audit
5.16      BNDE's financial statements are audited by Price Waterhouse & Co.,
an internationally reputed firm of public accountants. There have been some
shortcomings in the audit reports as regards schedules and supplementary in-
formation. This matter has been discussed with the auditors who have agreed
to rectify the shortcomings. The quality of the audits will continue to be
closely supervised by the Bank Group.
VI. PROSPECTS
A. The Environment
6.01      As indicated in Chapter II, there has been a clear and substantial
improvement in business activity and investment climate in Morocco since mid-
1973. Total investment projects approved by the Ministry of Industry in the
last quarter of 1973 amounted to DH 142 million, resulting in a total of DH
450 million for 1973 -- an increase of 42% over the 1972 figure of DE 302
million. Investments approved in the first six months of 1974 alone (DH 470
million) have exceeded the 1973 total.
6.02      In order to achieve the planned annual growth rate of 11% in the
industrial sector, investment requirements for 1973-77 of the sector (exclud-
ing mining and energy) are estimated in the Plan at about DH 3.6 billion.
The acceleration of the growth of exports of manufactured goods is viewed as
a key element of the industrial strategy to achieve the growth objective.
Such exports are expected to increase from 24% of merchandise exports in 1972
to 32% by 1977. Import substitution projects in food-processing, textiles,
motor-vehicle components and chemicals will continue to be an important ele-
ment in the development strategy. The Plan also foresees a better utilization
of production capacity and generation of additional employment of about 90,000
jobs during the 5-year period.
6.03      The Bank's evaluation of the Plan, summarized in the latest economic
report is that the Plan's targets are reasonable and within reach of the
Moroccan economy. Since then, the increased prospects of Morocco's principal
export commodity (phosphates), combined with the new-boom conditions in busi-
ness activity since the publication of the Plan, indicate that the Plan's
targets for the industrial sector will at least be achieved if not surpassed.
In light of these developments, the Government has indicated that the Plan
would be revised in early 1975.



- 18 -
B. BNDE's Operations
6.04      According to the Plan's forecasts, financing for a total of DR 950
million 1/ will be provided by BNDE over 1973-77. BNDE's own recent forecast
of commitments and disbursements over the period are substantially above the
Plan's estimates. Including the actual amounts for 1973, BNDE is aiming at
total commitments of DH 1.9 billion and disbursements of DH 1.7 billion over
1973-77 (Annex, 14).  BNDE's forecast of operations for 1974 and 1975 are based
on its current pipeline of projects, most of which are already under various
stages of study. Total approvals are estimated to be in excess of DH 500 mil-
lion each year in 1974 and 1975.  Discounting these estimates by 10%, net ap-
provals of DR 450 million each for 1974 and 1975 appear fairly reasonable. BNDE
estimates that it will be able to maintain this level in 1976 and that there
will be a 10% slow-down in 1977. This, too, is a reasonable forecast. Fore-
casts of disbursements for the next two years are similarly based on project-
by-project estimates of the current pipeline.
6.05      There are justifiable grounds for BNDE's optimism.  BNDE expects to
finance several large projects in the public sector, particularly in 1976, for
which BNDE's participation does not appear to have been foreseen in the Plan
(para. 3.14). Furthermore, the recent price increases of imported equipment
and the substantial increase in business activity resulting from new invest-
ment incentives, were not fully taken into account in the Plan's estimates
which were prepared in mid-1973. The Bank has estimated the cost of increases
in imported materials over 1973-77 to reach up to 90%. Since BNDE finances
mostly imports, such cost increases alone could justify a substantial increase
in operations. BNDE's total commitments for the first seven months of 1974
alone have amounted to DR 283 million, and total commitments of DR 383 million,
foreseen for 1974, appears attainable.
6.06      BNDE may, however, face staff constraints to process the level of
operations as forecast (both in amounts and number).  Unless it is able to
strengthen its staff commensurate with the increase in work-load, the fore-
cast level of operations may not be fully realized.  Moreover, this substantial
increase, if attained, will have very significant implications on BNDE's fi-
nancial structure.
C. BNDE's Resources and Prolected Financial Situation
6.07      BNDE's resource requirements over the period August 1974 to December
1976 and the expected sources to finance these are shown in Annex 15.  Against
a total estimated requirement of DR 1,033 million, BNDE is fairly certain of
mobilizing domestic and foreign resources of DII 628 million, leaving a resource
gap of about DH 410 (about $95 million) million for this period which it expects
1/   Although not clearly specified in the Plan, this includes BNDE's finan-
cing in mining and energy projects.



- 19 -
to finance mainly through the following sources: (i) Seventh Bank Loan.
BNDE has requested from the Bank a loan of US$30 million (DR 129 million) to
cover commitments for approximately two years. (ii) Additional borrowings.
BNDE is currently pursuing various possibilities for additional borrowings,
principally from oil exporting countries but also from NORAD (Norway) and
US EXIM Bank.  It has particularly strong hopes for US$20-30 million (DH 86-
130 million) from Iran.
6.08      Projected income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements
for 1974-77 are shown in Annexes 16, 17 and 18 respectively and are based on
the assumption that BNDE's activities will increase as currently foreseen,
that it will have sufficient staff, and that it will be successful in obtaining
the required resources. BNDE's success in diversifying its resources over the
past year supports this assumption.
6.09      Principally due to increased loan operations and higher debt leverage,
BNDE's profitability is expected to improve considerably over the next four
years. Earnings before tax and provisions is expected to increase from about
18.4% of average equity in 1973 to between 22 and 25% for 1975-77. 1/ This
level of earnings should enable BNDE to maintain its present level of divi-
dend of 8% to 1975 and increase it to 9% for 1976 and 1977. Interest cover-
age is not expected to change substantially from the current level of 1.5,
which is satisfactory.
Balance Sheet and Debt/Equity_Ratio
6.10      BNDE's total investment portfolio is expected to increase from about
DH 490 million in mid-1974 to DH 585 million by end of 1974 and DH 1.5 billion
by 1977. Total long-term debt is expected to increase commensurately to about
DH 1.4 billion by 1977. The share of IBRD loans as a percentage of BNDE's
total long-term debt is expected to decrease from 56% in July 1974 to about
45% by December 1974 and to about 33% by December 1975.
6.11      Increases of such magnitude raise the immediate question of BNDE's
debt/equity structure. As of July 31, 1974, total long-term debt at DH 423
million was seven times its equity. As mentioned in para. 5.06 this capital
structure is sound based not only on BNDE's good portfolio but also on the
fact that about one third of this portfolio is covered by Government guarantees.
For the future, BNDE is aware that it would have to pay increased attention to
this matter.  First, BNDE plans to increase its share capital in 1975 from DH1
32 million to DH 62 million. This increase, however, would not be sufficient
to ensure a prudent financial structure until 1977 when BNDE plans to double
again its share capital.  Indeed, the current prospects for share capital in-
creases together with expected increases in BNDE's free reserves would lead
1/   Because of charge to future income in respect of provisions against
losses, net income is expected to show a slight drop in 1974-1975--
about 13.5% of average equity compared to 14.3% in 1973 and increase
to around 15.5% in 1976-77.



- 20 -
to an increase of the real long-term debt/equity ratio of BRDE from 7:1 in
1974 to about 11.5:1 by end 1977. Even if some allowance is made for the
portfolio guaranteed by the Government, wiich is expected to continue to
represent about 1/3 of total portfolio, BNDE's debt/equity ratio would still
remain high. BNDE considers that the proposed doublings of share capital in
1975 and 1977 cannot be easily accelerated or increased further because of
the impact this would have on the attractiveness of BNDE's stock and dividends.
Thus, in order to provide adequate protection to creditors, BNDE and the Gov-
ernment have agreed to increase the amount of Government subordinated loans
from DlI 40 million to DH 90 million. During negotiations, the Bank has agreed
to increase the debt/equity limit to 7:1 and to consider, as a temporary measure9,
an increase of quasi-equity in BNDE's borrowing base, but limited to DH 70 mil-
lion, so that BNDE's conventional long term debt to equity ratio would not under
any circumstances exceed 12:1. 1/ This arrangement would cease at the end of
1977 when BNDE's debt/equity ratio under the Loan Agreement would no longer
include any subordinated loans in equity and would be limited to 10:1.
VII. THE LOAN - OBJECTIVES AND JUSTIFICATIONS
7.01      BNDE has been playing a significant role in the development of the
industrial sector in the Moroccan economy. Its position and role have acquired
even more significant importance with the recent improvement in investment
climate and the upsurge in investment activity following almost a decade of
sluggish industrial development. As current business surpasses all previous
years' level of operations, BNDE in fact is at a turning point: its role
within the Moroccan economy is of increasing significance and it is looking
to the Bank for continued support. Justification for the proposed seventh
loan to BNDE therefore can be summarized as follows.
7.02      Provision of Resources.  The Sixth Bank Loan has been fully commit-
ted since May 1974. Although BNDE has obtained substantial alternative
resources, it is in urgent need of additional funds to meet the increasing
demand for investment funds. The proposed amount of US$30 million is well
within the absorptive capacity of BNDE for the next two years and is justified
in view of the diversification of its resources achieved to date, and expected
over the near future.
7.03      Support of Industrial Sector.  The Bank has evaluated Morocco's
current five-year Plan favorably. In particular, the strategies and targets
for the development of the manufacturing sector (export-orientation, higher
capacity utilization and employment creation) are well-chosen, realistic and
reasonable. Bank lending to BNDE will signify support of these objectives
underlying the current Plan.
1/   Normally a debt/equity ratio of 12:1 would be considered excessive.
However, for BNDE one will have to consider that part of the debt has
been used to finance loans guaranteed by the Government. If that por-
tion of debt was excluded from total long-term debt, BNDE's debt/equity
ratio would be only about 7.5:1, which is reasonable.



- 21 -
7.04      Institutional Development.  BNDE has benefited greatly through its
association with the Bank Group in building up an institution considered as
capable of making sound investment decisions. Continued association with
the Bank is expected to result in the further improvement of the institution.
Specific areas in which improvements are hoped to be achieved, and which have
been already discussed in this report, are: (i) more sophisticated applica-
tion of the technique for evaluating the economic merits of projects; (ii)
strengthening and streamlining its supervision procedures; (iii) a more
thorough evaluation of portfolio risks; and (iv) broadening of the ownership
of its share capital.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      BNDE remains a suitable recipient for Bank loans.  A Bank loan of
US$30 million is recommended. The loan would meet part of an estimated re-
source gap of US$95.0 million to cover BNDE's long-term commitments over the
next two years or so. From the time the Bank's last loan was approved by
the Board to the end of 1974, BNDE has raised approximately US$60 million,
including US$30 million in foreign exchange, bringing the Bank's share in
total available resources down from about 61% two years ago to about 40% at
end 1974. The loan recommended now is expected to bring the Bank's share in
BNDE's total resources to about 30% at the end of 1976.
8.02      The Bank's loan, if approved, would meet part of BNDE's requirement
to finance the import component of BNDE's projects over a period of about two
years. During this period BNDE is expected to strengthen its staff to cope
with the considerable growth foreseen in its operations. The recommended loan
will reflect the Bank's continued backing of BNDE which it would need to raise
the substantial funds from the international market it requires.
8.03      The new loan should be made on the normal terms and conditions as
those applied to recent loans to development finance companies, including the
standard commitment charge. The free limit should be increased to US$900,000
and the aggregate free limit should represent about 25% of the loan, i.e.
US$7 million. The present definition of debt/equity ratio should be retained
except that BNDE should be permitted to increase its borrowing-base through
additional subordinated debt up to a maximum of DH 70 million and the limita-
tion should be increased to 7:1 until December 1977. After that date BNDE's
total debt (including subordinated debt) should not exceed ten times its
equity.

ANNEX 5

BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE
Statement of Policy
(Approved by the Board of Directors on March 29, 1963 and amended on
March 7, 1966, September 24, 1968, December 22, 1969, March 26, 1971
and June 6, 1972).
1.        BNDE's general investment policy should be stated along the follow-
ing lines:
(a)  BNDE's objective will be the encouragement of productive invest-
ment in Morocco, chiefly in the industrial field. To that
end it will assist particularly in the financing of private
industrial enterprises to which the major portion of its
resources will be devoted.
(b)  BNDE will assist a non-private enterprise only in special
circumstances, and when private capital cannot be found
on reasonable terms to carry out the project;
(c)  BNDE will assist a non-industrial enterprise only when
capital cannot be found elsewhere on reasonable terms.
(d)  Projects (loans or other investments) which are not exactly
covered by the above criteria, and for which, accordingly,
BNDE does not deem possible to assume the risks, might be
financed when the Moroccan Government finds these projects
justified in the public interest, provided their financial
risk is entirely assumed by the Government, either by a 100%
unconditional guaranty of the Government or of a Government
Agency duly authorized to give such a guaranty or by the
financing of such operation by Government funds at Government's
risks, those resources being segregated from any resources of
BNDE.
An enterprise will not be considered "private" if the Government or any of
its agencies directly or indirectly hold 50% or more of its outstanding
voting stock.
2.        BNDE will consider enterprises only on the basis of their economic
and financial merits. To this end, projects will be analysed as to their
economic desirability, technical feasibility, financial soundness, management
competence, etc., to insure that only sound productive ventures are financed.
BNDE will finance only projects which:



ANNEX 5
Page 2
(a)  have a high economic priority, and
(b)  promise to provide a satisfactory rate of return
on the investment.
BNDE will perform adequate supervision of the operations.
3.        BNDE should, as appropriate, make use of a variety of forms of in-
investment, including, within the limits of sound financial practice, equity
participations, and the underwriting or participation in the underwriting of
securities sold by investment enterprises.
4.        In order to assist the development of the Moroccan capital market,
BNDE should stand ready to sell portions of its investments to other private
investors, with due respect to its own interests and to those of the other
participants in the investments sold.
5S        When one or more commercial bank participates with BI'E in lending
to an enterprise, BNDE should exert every effort to ensure that the terms of
all the loans, taken together, are well suited to the needs of the enterprise.
6.        BNDE should, whenever appropriate, extend technical assistance to
its clients in respect of the formulation, execution and operation of projects.
7.        BNDE should not normally make direct loans or other investments in
favor of one single enterprise aggregating more than 15% of BNDE's paid-up
capital, reserves and outstanding long-term Government loans, with the ex-
ception of such loans and investments which are covered by a Government
guarantee or guarantee from the Caisse Centrale de Garanties or by a bank
guarantee after examination uf the financial position of the bank concerned.
In entering into discounting arrangements with a commercial bank, involving
contingent liabilities, BNDE will limit the amount of its individual commit-
ments on the basis of its assessment of the financial position of the bank
concerrned and in the light of BNDE's share capital and reserves.
8.        In general, BNDE should not take any single equity participation
larger than the smaller of (a) 10% of BNDE's paid-up capital and reserves;
and (b) 25% of the share capital of the investment enterprise concerned. In
the case of underwritings, BNDE might take a large commitment in the faith
that it will not in fact have to take up more than the proportion of shares
here indicated.  In any event, the total aggregate equity investment shall
nolt e-ceed-i
BNDE's share capital plus free reserves plus the maturities
of the government subordinated loans falling due after 15
years, plus that part of the General Loan Reserve which ex-
ceeds realistically estimated loss possibilities.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
9.        BNDE will build reserves consistent with sound financial practice.
It will annually appropriate a portion of its income to reserves. Appropria-
tions will be made so as to build up total reserves to a level that is appro-
priate to the size and quality of BNDE's portfolio of loans and equity invest-
ments, while permitting the distribution of an adequate dividend to BNDE's
shareholders. The Board of BNDE will review every year the situation in this
respect.

its auditors will be excluded from its equity and deducted from total loans outstanding.
