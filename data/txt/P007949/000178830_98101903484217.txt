PORT OF PISCO PROJECT
SUMMARY
The Government of Peru has asked the Bank for a loan to pay the
foreign exchange cost of a project consisting principally of:
a)  the construction of new deep-water port facilities
at Pisco and
b)  studies for the improvement of other ports in
Peru.
The total estimated cost of the project amounts to US$ 1.7 million equivaLent
of which the foreign exchange costs amount to US$ 9.1 million equivalent.
ii.     Pisco is a long-established lighterage port, about 275 ln south
of Callao; the nort for T.ima.  Tt serves an imnortant agricultural and
mining area for which it is the natural outlet.  The lighterage operations
are very uneConomyic ard subject to frequent delays on account of weather
and sea conditions.  The existing facilities are very old, in a bad state
of repair ani badlyv sitedj. and are inadequate to handl e even the existing
traffice
iii.    Traffic through the port has increased very rapidly during the
recent years, because of the rapid expanS    of the  i hmrl industryl    At
the same! time substantial volumes of cargo, both imports and exports are
dlve-r+ed at considerable expense to the port of Callao becIae of the lack of
facilities at Pisco.
iv.     To handle the traffic expected up to 1975 new deep-water facilities

Tile project would provide for the construction of a four-berth margin-I whELrf
at such a site on the western shore of the B ay of PaL*racas, about 35   by road
.rom Pisco. There will be adequate transit sheds, warehouses, open storage
c:.reaF port operating equipment ard water supply.
The project is technically an,d economically sourd. *The cost est>rimAtes
are realistic and the procurement procedures will conform to the Bank's require-
LMP,nts. U UConsulting engineers accep able to Cuzhe BUaink wil bKue employed.
'3i-    The port of Pisco s one of many ports operated and maunaged by the
)ireccion de Administracion Portuaria (D.A.P.), a department of the Ministry
of Finance a.nd Commerce. The D.A.P. is hampered by lack 01 finanCial a-nd
ndlministrative autonomy. The Government, thierehore, decided to set up a
National Port Authority (NPA) to operate all public ports in Peru other t-han
Callao.  The powers, management and financial policies of the Authority, and
the laws under which it will function, haave been discussed during negotiations
and -:Ll beac.cept2Tthe to the Bank. (.-craticn,s consult nts -ill 1)e ciTh)loyCeC to

vii.    The local currency costs of the project will be provided by a
Special Account, fed from special port charges, set up by the Government
for the purpose of financing the port development program,supplemented if
necessary from Government resources. Operations at the new port facilities
will be financially sound at rates which compare favorably with rates
charged at other ports.
viii.   The nroiect is suitable for a Bank loan of US$9.1 million ecuivalent.
A term of 25 years, including a grace period of about five years, would be
appropriate. The loan would be to the Government.



PORT OF PISCO
I. aNITItLROD1JUCTION
1.        The Government of Peru has asked the Bank for a loan to meet the
foreign currency costs of constructing new deep-water port facilities in
the Pisco area in place of the present inadequate and obsolete lighterage
installations, and of technical studies for the improvement of other ports.
The total foreign currency costs would amount to US$ 9.1 million equivalent,
or 62 per cent out of a total estimated investment of US$ 14.7 million
equivalent.
2.        The project consists of the construction of a four-berth marginal
wharf, transit sheds, warehouses and other buildings, provision of a water
supply, the acquisition of port operating equipment, consulting services,
and the technical studies referred to above.
II. GENERAL BACKGROUND
A. The Ports of Peru (Map 1) - Port Development Plan
3.        The 2,000-kilometer long Peruvian coast is rocky with stretches of
shallow, sandy beaches, and few natural harbors whlere berths can be con-
structed without breakwa-ters. Nevertheless, inarnjy ports have been developed
along the coast. mainly at more sheltered beaches near the mouths of the
numerous cultivated valleys. Nost of these ports have no berths for deep-
draft vessels, cargo being transferred by lighters between shallow jetties
and ocean-going ships at anchor in deep water.
4.        Six special purpose ocean ports are owned and cperated by private
companies, princinally for netroleum nroducts and mineral ores. Nineteen
ocean ports and four rivier ports on the Amazonas river system are owned and
onerated hy the crnuernmPe:nt  H-owe.ver, todny, with the gror.muh of trade and
the development of overland transport facilities along the Pacific coast,
it is more ennonomnin1 t.r handle the cargo in a lim.ited nm.her Orf large
ports rather than in a multiplicity of small liglhterage ports. The Govern-
mennt.s nnprt inveP+.tmnt. nlnn is  +.hereforn  foce mninlv nn +.he imnrnovmen+.
of certain selected ports, where modern deep-water facilities can be provided.
and w.Thich can each seer. a sibsta  al area of the coMnt.r.  The investmer.t
plan and its financing are dealt with in Chapter VII.



-2-
*e       Durin g the negotiations for Loan 373-PE - Paita Port Project,
during March, 1964, the Government agreed, because of the limitation of
resources then foreseen, to restrict expenditure on its port investment
program up to 1967 to include prinarily the completion of new port facili-
ties at Salaverry and the payment of suppliers' credits incurred in respect
thereto, and the improvement of the port of Paita. There were also provisions
for minor works at Matarani, improvements to fish meal export ports, and the
supply of port operating equipment for general use. The Government also
agreed to defer starting work on new facilities at Pisco until 1968. However,
the rapid development of the fish-meal industry in the Pisco area, and increas-
ing congestion at Callao, have forced the Government, with the Bank's agreement,
to bring the Pisco project forward as a matter of priority.
6.        The principal public coastal ports are:
(i)  The port of Paita (located about 900 kilometers north of Lima),
the natural outlet for a large part of northern Peru.   Deep-
water facilitiesj exnented to be comnleted by the end of
1966, are now being provided at Paita with the help of Bank
Loan 373-E;.
(ii)  Salaverrv (4On kilometers sonth of Paita), where modern nort
facilities were completed in October, 1964, to serve the
ity.v of Trujillo and nearby sugar-prouci ngareas;
(iii) ( lhjmhr+- fl,rn L--;1-mp+c n-.:+h ^f T.imon  Uzm +hm wric+Ancr

principal port and is managed by an autonomous authority.

general cargo pier, financed partly by Bank Loan 208-PE,
is expected to be completed by the end oI i969.   An
earlier Bank Loan, No. 57-PE, helped to finance a grain

7.        T'ne inland ports, Iquitos, Yurimaguas, Pu?dc pa aL rIdonado,
are all located on the Amazonas river system. Only Iquitos has modern
port facilities. Tne development of the country's eastern region req-ures
new investment in these ports to meet growing traffic requirements. The
port development plan of the Direccion de Administracion Portuaria (D.A.P.)
is described in Chapter VII. Bank financing in connection with the ports
of Peru to date is summarized below:
January 1952, No. 57-PE, Callao              US$ 2,500,000 equivalent
Seotember 1958, No. 208-PE, Callao           uS$ 6,575,000 equivalent
April 1964, No. 373-PE, Paita                US$  3,100,000 equivalent
US$ 12,175,000 equivalent
B. Port Administration
8.        All the public ports of Peru, both coastal and river, other than
Salaverry and Callao are managed by D.A.P., a department of the Ministry
of Finance and Commerce. Callao is operated by a Port Authority set up in
1952. During 1965, a separate Port Authority to operate the port of
Salaverry was also set up.
9.        The D.A.P. is headed by a Director, who is an official of the
Ministry of Finance.  The D.A.P. has no financial autonomy and very little
administrative autonomy. The lack of adequate powers in these respects
already prevents efficient administration.  D.A.P. has been unable, because
of tight budgetary control, to expand its higher management staff to keep
pace with the increasing work load and responsibilities imposed by expanding
traffic and the need to improve Dort facilities. There is a serious shortage
of competent, experienced engineers and of other qualified staff, who are
not attracted by the salary scales allowed by Government. With increasing
traffic this deficiency wjill be increasingly felt, and will adversely affect
the planning and carrying through of the port development plan. At the
individual port level, the relatively small-scale operations at present
involved are reasonably efficiently conducted. However, as traffic grows,
the need for reorganization, with a stronger and more independent local
management wiLLl similar:Ly arise  This question i9 dealt with further in
Chapter VI.



III. THE PORT OF PISCO
A. General (Maps 1 and 2)
10.      Pisco is located in the eastern part of the Bay of Pisco, about
275 km south of Callao by road. The port serves the valleys of Pisco, Ica,
Canete, and Chinca, as well as the mining area south of Huancavelica.
Several irrigation projects, based on diversion of water from the eastern
slopes of the Andes, are under consideration in its service area. Fishmeal
production is increasing ahd the mining industry is developing. Penetration
roads, now under construction in the hinterland, will extend the service
area of the port. Port traffic is increasing, creating considerable con-
gestion, and the existing facilities are deteriorating. The Government has,
therefore, decided to construct modern deep-water port facilities at Pisco.
B. Existing Facilities at Pisco
II.       Pisno is at present a lightarage pirt -rith a timber decked acrew-pile
pier rnnstructed in 185q9   The piqr is 76O meters lng and 9.5 meters widew-ith

fiypxe  a-rick. Thw-p r1iesel lo'romotivPs anrl 12 10-ton flat rars are used for
cargo transport to and from the berths. The pier, crane, track and rolling
stock are in bad condition. D.A.P. operates the shore facilities,

.In addition u Ud Uthe D.AL.P. failities, there are, uea-'Y, a. small
shallow draft fishing wharf at San Andres, owned by fishing intAorasts, and
a silmilar wharf owned and cperated by the Natiounal Fertilizer Cor-ration
at La Puntilla, where there is also a slipway for repairing lighters,     .
T.e International Petroleum Company has a tank farm at San Andres to wnich
petroleum products are transferred by submarine pipeline from ships in the
bay.
North ef Pisco are two small ports, Tambo de Mora and Cerro Azt1.
Tambo de M6ra, located 28 km north of Pisco, is a fish-landing port with'. %
small pier situated in an open roadstead. Because of wind and heavy swells,
difficulties in landing the fish catch arise frequently. There are seven
fishmeal factories in the area which export their prTducts through Pisco.
They will continue to do so after completion of the new facilities at the
latter port.
15.      Cerro Azul, about 80 km north of Pisco, is a minor light-age
port. Operations are frequently closed dow- because of wind and wave

Cerro Azul will be abandoned when deep-water facilities are provided in
Pis Bco .
C. Service Area (Maps 1 and lA)
irSO     The service area of the present port of Pisco is severely restric-
ted by the primitive port facilities, and comprises little more than the
coastal Department of Ica, in which it is situated, and nearby areas of the
adjacent Departments of Lima, Huancavelica and Ayacucho. However, accepting
a degree of marginal overlapping of the service areas of the ports of Callao
to the north and Matarani to the south, the potential service area of a deep-
water port in the Pisco area would be considerably larger and would include,
inland: all or most of the Departments of Huancavelica, Ayacucho and Apurimac,
and parts of Cuzco; to the north the southern parts of Lima; and to the
south, the northern part of Arequipa.
17.      The potential service area covers approximately 160,000 sq. kms.
and has a population (July 1965) estimated at about 1.7 million (see Ap-
pendix 1), about 14% of the estimated total population of the country. In
general the geographical conditions are similar to the country as a whole,
comprising three distinct natural regions: a narrow coastal plain; the high
mountain range of the Andes; and beyond the mountains, the jungle of the
Amazon river basin. The coastal plain alternates between extensive areas of
cultivation, in the river valleys and irrigated areas, and desert. Tho
niourntain area tzs few nossibilities for azricultxure but substantial mineral
resources tThose development is mainly restricted by difficulties of
access,
in.    The Government has plans to promote the industrial and avrinlItural
development of the area. These include hydroelectric projects, irrigation
schemes. roads, hnioine anA Jnn1iigt.Jql areas. A new penet+ratioin road from
the Pan American Highway near Pisco will go through the mountains and is
exneetd.P to ,rea-ch rAirm'heo byhr 1067 an Cuzco yr 1071 . TI+ will  i1rece byir
about 50% the overland route for considerable volumes of traffic, inclutding

ment from, Nazea in Ica Department to Abancay in Apurimac will also extend
the Service area to th.at Depar+ment pd t- par+s of Cuzco Department.
There are plans for further development of the fishing and fishmeal in-
dustriei inhe ar, -an 4-1-h G-overnmer.   alz p-     to develop a new in=
dustrial area near Pisco. Further plans include a new township near the new
port and archeological and tourist zones in that area.
There are about 130 small-scale industrial enterprises in the port's
preen    Interland. In the immediate vicinity ux Pisco there are seven cotton
gins, two baling plants,-three cotton seed mills, two whaling factories, ono

in the area with a total installed capacity of 180,000 tons of fishnmeal
a year. The production of wine and spirits is also an important activity.
D. Past Traffic
2L.       For many years the traffic using the port of Pisco has necessarily
been limited to cargoes for which the port, in spite of high operating costs.
hazardous conditions and shipping delays, was less uneconomic than other
ports. Details of past dry cargo traffic from 1954 to 1964 are given in
Appendix 2 and summarized below for the years 1954, 1959 and 1964. Tonnages
of bulk petroleum products, which are unloaded by two submerged pipelines
direct to tank farms ashore, are not available for most years prior to 1960.

port, and in 1.965, traffic will have beeii approximately 25C,OJ)0 tons.
This expansion is expected to continue because of:
a)  further expansion of fishmeal production and experts;
b)  increased fertilizer imports and cotton exports after the
port of Cerro Azul is closed down and its traffic diverted
to Pisco, and as new irrigation schemes in the port's
service area start operating;
c)  increased mineral exports and general cargo imports as the con-
struction of a modern port in Pisco allows the diversion of part
of this traffic from Callao, eliminating costly trucking
over more than 250 km between the Callao and the hinterland
of' Pisco.
For these reasons, D.A.P. ts consultants, Consultores y Ingenieros Asociados
S.A., of Lima, have projected dry cargo movements of 523,060 tons in 1970,
the first year of full operation of the new port of Pisco, anl 680,000 tons
in 1975. These are believed to be reasonable estimates.
23.      A detailed forecast to 1975 is given in Appen,.ix 3 and summarized

association is aware of the danger of overfishing and intends to ask its
mem'bers for a voluntary agreement on a celling on the total fishmLeal
production in Peru. The association believes that this ceiling should be
between 1.8 and 2.0 million tons, a figure that could be sustained under
normal conditions, This would be reached by 1975 and compares with
actual production of 1.5 million tons in 1964.  "'naile total production
of fishmeal in Peru will thus increase moderately, production in the Pisco
area is foreseen to expand rapidly because the major part of the overall
increase will take place on the southern region and because of relocation
of factories now situated in the Lima and Chimwote areas.
26,        Despite its robust growth, fishmeal production in the Pisco
area had not reached more than 7.5% of total production in Peru' by 1964.
As the area off the coast near Pisco has lately come to be known as an
exceptionally rich fishing ground where the anchovies have two breeding
seasons, fishmeal producers are tending to establish new factories close
to these relatively underfished areas. This movement is reinforced by
the undesirable conditions under which many firms operate in the Lima-
Callao area. Most of them have no direct access to the shore and have
to transport the fish through the extremely congested area between
Callao and Lima. These reasons have led nineteen firms to apply for
licenses to establish new factories in the Pisco area. If installed,
the new factories will increase the area's fishmeal producing capacity
by 300,000 tons annually over the existing capacity of 180,000 in the
present eight factories assuming that variation in the catch will allow
no more than 2,500 hours of factory utilization per year. The con-
sultants have conservatively assumed that by 1970 only 50% of the
additional capacity will actually be installed and have therefore pro-
jected 310,000 tons of fishmeal exports by 1969 and 325,000 tons in
1970. By 1975, fishmeal exports should reach at least 400,000 tons,
27.       During the past 10 years, the annual export of mineral ore,
mostly zinc and copper concentrates, from Pisco fluctuated between
20,000 and 33,000 tons, being 27,000 tons in 196h4 These ores are
mined in Castrovirreyna in the department of Huancavelica about 10C kin
inland from Pisco. Mineral exports from these sources are expected tc
amount to 28,000 tons in 1970. At nresent. all mines further inland in
the area of Huancavelica and even some mines in Castrovirrenya find it



more economical to exnort via Callao thereby avoiaine the bagging of
minerals and the costly lighterage operation in Pisco. Upon completion of
the new nort in Pisco. these minep will export through Plsco resultingz in
reductions in overland transport of between 160 and 250 km according to the
1ocaP+orn or- t.he mines. Miner1s ol 1 riinntina in the -epnartmepntt nf' TIa are at
present exported via Callao. They are transported by truck along the coastaL
highway actuall;y bypassing PiPco   Minerals from these sourcer will also be
diverted to Pisco eliminaating 275 km of trucking between Pisco and Callao.

28.      Apart from this diversion, exports of minerals will rise as new
mUines are openeU anu existing ones exApnued in thlle areas o- Cast rov4-'"rey aV,
Huancav2lica and Ayacucho. With the construction of the new road between
Castrovirreyna and Ayacucho which is expeczed to be completed in 1967, a
major impediment for mining development in the area of Ayacucho will be
removed, resulting in mineral exports from tne area oI 5,000 tons in 1970
and 25,000 tons in 1975. A summary of expected mineral exports through Pisco
and their regional origin is as Ioiiows:

29.       Cottorn was for many years the main export product of the Pisco
hinterland. Exports of ginned cotton during the last seven years averaged
about 43,000 tons. There is, however, a strong tendency among farmers to
diversify their crops. It is estimated that this will. have led to a decrease in
cotton exports from 38,000 tons in 1964 to 32,000 tons in 1965. Only by
1970/71, when the area of cultivated land and yields per acre have increased



through new irrigation schemes, are cotton exports likely to start to
grow again. At the same time, after the new port of Prisco is completed
and the port of Cerro Azul closed down, about 5,000 tons of cotton will
be diverted to Pisco. The combined effect of the new irrigation schemes
and the diversion from Cerro Azul will eventually bring cotton exports
to the present level again.
30.      Fertilizers have so far constituted the only noteworth imports
through Pisco, averaging about 20,000 tons annually during the last five
years. Local production will substitute part of fertilizer imports but
aiversion from Cerro Azul of about 6,000 tons and the additional require-
ments of irrigation schemes should bring fertilizer imports to 22,000 tons
by 1970 and 30,000 tons by 1975.
-3--     General cargo imports through Pisco have always been insignif-
icant. Machinery, vehicles and consumer goods were imported through Callao
and then trucked to the Pisco hinterland. After construction bf a modern port
at Pisco, this traffic will be diverted from Callae. In addition, the im-
plementation of irrigation schemes in the service area will tend to raise
demand for imported farm machinery and vehicles. Completion of the power
projects should promote some industrial development in the Pisco area. The
forecast for imports of general cargo, therefore, is 45,000 tons in 1970
and 62,000 tons in 1975.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General
32.      The increasing traffic, the unsatisfactory transport and storage
facilities, and the poor condition of the existing pier and the liahterage
equipment require construction of new facilities at Pisco as soon as possible.
It would be costly both to constriwet and to mainta-in such facilities at the
present location of the lighterage port in the Pisco town area. Breakwaters
woalid bhe renuiree-i together with a considerabLe amou_nt of dredgine and reclam-
ation. Accordingly, it has been decided that the new facilities should be
si-ted Gn the west side of Paracas bay, where they will be well sheltered
from wind and waves and where a minimum of dredging will be needed.
33.      As shown on Map 2, the new facilities will be situated near Punta
Pe errey, about 3 knm from the existIng towm- and port at Picco. A new 2-lore
road, 18 km long, is required to provide access to the existing road system.

a smill poptulation center at Paracas, an aFU0aeoLo0ical area of aricielnt
Indian burial grounds, and an area allocated the D.A.P. on the Paracas
Peninsuiar.  The Government has defined the land area to be allocated for
purely port purposes, including future extensions, and h1as undertaken that
the land and sea areas to be under the jurisdiction of the D.A.P., will be
defined in due course.
35.       1lithin the area assigned in the zone plan to the D.A.P. a new towm-
ship will be developed in conjunction with the port to be called tne town
of Punta Pejerry. Preliminary plans provide for a population of about 5,000,
and include utilities, housing, schools, mtmicipal buildings, etc. Thlie
to>Tn wrill not be part of the project. IHowrever, it is important, from the
point of viewJ of the effective operation of' the newr facilities, t'hat suitably
located and adequate housing for port workers should be available when the
first of the new facilities is put into operation.   Assurances have been
obtained from the Government that such housing and related facilities will
be provided in due time.
30.      aThe project includes water supply installations which would be
sufficient for the initial requirements of both the new port facilities
ancl the proposed toTm. The continuity of adequate water supply is essential
to port operation, and assurances have accordingly been obtained from the
Governvient that it iill take all necessary measures to ensure this at all
times in the future.
B. Numbser of Berths Reauired
37.       In assessingt the size of the new nort to enable it to handle
the expected volume of traffic up to 1975, annual rates of throughput
per berth have been assumed of 125.000 tons for general careo and 175,000
tons for fish meal and minerals. The relatively low rate for minerals
arises from the smnanll tnsirnTmennts in which the cargo moves and tnh fact
that the total quantity justifies only partially mechanized loading.
On t.his basis t±he cn2aci+ yu of +.fh1rP be-rths V-Molrf1d be e  in 1 97C0 2nd

D. Cost Estimate
LaO.    The estimated cost of the Bank financed items in the project is S/394
mi-lion (us$ 14.7 million equivalent).   The necessary foreign excnange would
amount to US$ 9.1 million. The cost estimate is based on final engineering of
construction items and includes 10% for physlcal contingencies, 25% for
-ncreases in local prices during constructior~ and 8% for increases in foreign
prices. It is considered to be realistic. Details are given in Appendix 6,

V. ECON01MIIC JUSTIFICATION
11 UroucUUb±u1±
IThe new port facilities wo-uld yield  n adequate economic return
on the investment cost of the project. Economic benefits would consist of;
a) reduction in cargo handling cost by eliminating lighterage
of cargo and by more efficient handling on shore, esbimated
at S/. 13.2 million for 1970 and 16.4 million for 1975;
b) elimination of the overland haulage of goods presently im-
ported or exported via Callao, resulting in savings in land
transport cost of SI. 12.6 million in 1970 and 21 million in
1975;
c) reduction of vessel turn-around time, valued at Si. 31 million
for 1970 and SI/ 40.5 million for 1975;
d) reduction of physical losses of fishmeal during the loading
process, valued at SI. 15.5 million for 1970 and S/. 20
million for 1975; and
e) elimination of bagging of minerals presently exported through
Pisco, resulting in savings of S/. 1.5 million in 1970 and
S/. 1.9 million in 1975.
l,5.      The total economic benefits from the project will be in the order
of S/. 75 million in 1970 and increase to S/. 100 million by 1975. No
increase of benefits has been projected for the time after 1975 since any
traffic growtlh thereafter would require further investments. Projected over
the 30-year average life of the facilities, the benefits represent a 16%
return on the investment cost, including the cost of the access road and
housing for port workers. (Appendix 7).
Reduced cargo handling costs
'O.       After completion of the new nort. cargo will be handled to and from
ships at b irth thereby eliminating costly lighterage. Cargo hand-
ling on shore will also be more efficient because of the areater use of
mechanized equipment and more ample working space. No savings in cargo
handling cost can be attributed to trnffir diverted from Callao where a
port with modern handling facilities exists. The savings, therefore, apply to
t-raffic-i whirh wrniili 'h hnntrlad in Pi.c-,( or GePrrn Azil if t.he new fac;'ities,
were not constructed. Applied to the projected volume of traffic not diverted

minerals originating in the Pisco hinterland can be exported via Pisco
rather than Callao. Minerals originating from the Departments of Ica and
Ayacucho and those from Castrovirreyna not actually exported through Pisco,
are at present trucked along the coastal highway to Callao.
For this traffic, the savings will be a reduction in transport of 275 ikm
at SI. 0.55 per t/km.

^9.       Fertilizer imports and cotton exports diverted from Cerro Azui will
bavo to be transported between Piaco and Canete over 95 km at S/. 0.55 per
t/km. Thcee additional transport costs will amount to S/. 700,000 in 1970 and
in 1975.
Total net savings in overland transport will thus be about Sj. 122.6
million in 1970 and S/. 21 million in 1975.
Reduced turn-around time for ships
$1.      Vessels calling at the new port and loading or discharging directly
alongside will be able to turn around much faster than at present. During
1964 an average of about 35 ocean freighters a month normally called at Pisco.
The tonnage they loaded or unloaded normally ranged between 200 and 2,0QO tons;
in some rare instances vessels took up to 4,500 tons. According to the con-
sultants and additional information obtained by the mission, 200 days of
ship time could have been saved in moving the traffic volume of 1964 (203,0ON
tons international dry cargo) if the planned new facilities had been avail-
able to eliminate time-consuming lighterage. As it costs about US$1,500 wr
S/. 40,200 to keep a ship waiting in port for a day, the savings would amount
to SI. 8.2 million. By 1970, the new facilities will prevent the additional
delays which would be caused by moving the increased volume of 515,000 tons
dry cargo through the presently existing facilities. Additional savings will
be realized as larger ships will be loading or unleading larger volumes of
cargo. It can, therefore, be estimated that 775 ship days will be saved in
moving 515,000 tons of international dry cargo in 1970, which represent savings
of S/. 30 million.
52.       The savings of shin time would adt. f1lrst. bhenefit mainly foreian shin-
owners. These savings may, however, eventually accrue to the Peruvian economy
as ConfePrPnCe r=+eA como 1-reflrct+ t-he fn+'r frn-aroend time in pnorts along
the Peruvian coast. Even before this materializes the Government could reap
some of the benefits expected to accrue to for-eign shipowners in Pisco- byr
applying suitable pert charges. Furthermore, fishmeal and minerals will in-
reasingly be e.xported con.      --t ch,4-kre  sh. ps, t ef   ich immediatelyr

Minerals at present being exported through Pisco will no longer "'ave
to be bagged when the new facilities are completed. For 28,000 tons, savings
at S/. 54 per ton will amount to S/. 1.5 million in 1970, and S/. 1.9 million
Ior 35,O'0 tons in 1975.

VI. FUTUiE POflTl ADNIWILSTRATION
55.       During recent years Peru's international trade has expanded rapidly
and will contirue to expand although probably at a reduced rate.   The
expansion imposes an increasingly severe strain on the smaller ports along
the coast operated by the D.A.P., wrhich falls not only on the port facilities
but also on the D.A.P.'s organization.   Tlhis strain on the organization will
be intensified with the coming into use of the new modern deep-water ports,
particularly at Paita and Pisco. As has been explained earlier, the presen;
organization suffers from serious drawbacks.   It has no financial or opera-
tional autonomy and is hampered in organizational development by btudget
considerations.  The present situation is unsatisfactory, and the GovernmnenL;,
tlherefore, intends to set up a National Port Authority (I'.P.A.) to be
responsible for operating all public ports except Callao, which will contimne
to be operated by the existing Port Authority.
56.       The N.P.A. will be established by the end of 1960 and will take
over ooeration of the port of Salaverry from the present Authority uhich
will thenL cease to exist.  The Government has undertaken that N.P.A. iwill
have powers, management, resources, capital structure a-nd financial policies
satisfactorv to the Bank.  In this connection, certain basic Drinciples and
policies to be followsed in the legislation setting up N.P.A. have been agreed
between the Government and the Banlc.  It has been further agreed tihat the
laws, sta.tutes and regulations concerned wfill be discussed withl the Bank

to during the negotiations for the Paita loan (paragraph 6) principally in
the inclusion of an increased amount for improvements at 11o; in bringing for-
ward the Pisco project; and in planning to start improvements at the river
portUs ear'liter. Th l'e pla-n  S I n . two sectUons:  iJ) current wuorks, c.;UrIsin t LLg
principally Paita but also including payment of suppliers' credits. for
Salaverry; and (ii) new works covering projects at Pisco, Matarani, !lo and
the river ports.
59.       The principal source of funds to finance the plan is a special fund
set up by the Government in 1950 to finance the Salaverry port.  It was later
extended to cover development expenditure at all the ports under control of
the D.A.P. and is now known as "Special Account - Port Works in Salaverry and
Other Ports". Part of the existing port revenues were diverted to this ac-
count, which has also been augmented from time to time when additional laws
increased the charges or created new ones, at private as well as public ports.
The receipts credited to this fund rose from Soles 34.6 million in 1956 to
Soles 73.9 million in 1963. In 1964, there was a considerable increase to
Soles 97.1 million, due. mainly to the expansion of fishmeal traffic but also
to a further increase in charges. These receipts are expected to increase
steadily to Soles 133.6 million in 1969.
60.       The plan covering the period to 1969, the year in which construction
of the Pisco project is expected to be completed, is briefly as shown below.
Details are given in Appendix 8 and summarized in Appendix 9. The D.A.P. ex-
pects to be able to finance about 6h% of the total costs, including debt ser-
vice, from Special Account receipts. The Government has indicated that it
would like to borrow from the Bank to help finance the development of the
river ports. Provision has been made in the Pisco cost estimate for engineer-
ing and feasibility studies for this project and for possible new construction
at Chimbote. Cost estimates, other than for Paita and Pisco, are preliminary,
and do not allow for price escalation.

61.       On thes basis of the present estimates, some of which are prel minary,
and assumi.ng the availability of external financing for the river porQs in
addition to Pisco, there is likely to be no shortage of funds for the period
as a whole. A peak shortage of about Soles 52 million would occur in 1968
(Appendix 8), plus further debt service that would.be incurred in financing
this deficit. This relatively small shortage of funds might be avoided if
the commencement of projects at Matarani and Ilo were postponed, but the
practicability of this would depend on the degree of urgency of the works
concerned. During negotiations the program of port development in Peru and
its financial requirements were discussed. The Republic of Peru has declared
its intention of carrying out the program and it has agreed to consult with
the Bank and to give careful consideration to its views, before making any
changes in the program.
62.       In December 1963, the Ley Organica del Presunuesto Functional, Law
No. 14816, provi.ded that; unspent balances in special accounts were to revert

program.  To this effect, an undertaking was given by the Government in a
supp'ieen'ur-DIy 1 et'uer b  Lo UI ktIgremnu&J NAU. g{7D-rnV /in-.J 4 >W_] -34-  A-4  
1964; and on April 24, 1964, immediately after signing of the Paita loan docu-
ments, Supreme Decree No. 65-H, dealing wLth the powers and functions of the
D.A.P., provided that the funds in the "Special Account - Port Works in Sala-
verry and Other Ports" should be -used oniLy for tlhese purposes*. Despite tLis
agreement, substantial unspent balances were transferred to the Treasury at
the end oI 19614 and 1965, since the annuai budget laws did not i,n practice
provide the necessary exemption of this account from the 1963 general law.
In order to ensure that the Special Account funds will be devoted exclusively
to financing port works and equipment in the future, the Government has now
agreed that it wi-l reimburse the Special Account promptly for any year-end
balances transferred to other depositories.
63.       In connection with the setting up of N.P.A., the Government has
agreed that the Special Account charges will be discontinued at Paita by the
end of 1966 and at other public ports by the end of 1969. This has been taken
into consideration in assessing the Special Account receipts shown in the above
table.
B. Future Earnings of the Port of Pisco
64.       The D.A.P. is not financially autonomous.    Port revenues are treated
as income in the State budget and operating expenses are paid out of the budget
as are also the expenses of the D.A.P.'s head office in Lima. Ordinary receipts
from port operations (that is, excluding charges and taxes that are credited to
the Special Account) are usually insufficient to cover expenses, the deficit
being met from the State budget. The tariffs for port services are complicated
and are contained in numerous laws and decrees. The tariffs consist entirely
of charges on cargo loaded or unloaded, no charges being made against ships,
and include ad valorem taxes as well as tonnage c:.arges.    The charges are
arbitrary, and no attempt has been made to relate them to the cost of the ser-
vices provided. Accounts on commercial lines are not kept, and no balance
sheets or revenue accounts can be drawn up either for individual ports or for
the D.A.P. as a whole.
65.       For these reasons, no realistic picture of the Dresent financial
positior of D.A.P. as a whole or of the port of Pisco in particular can be
attempted. It is possible, nevertheless, to estimate future finances in
respect of operations at Pisco, as a specific part of the National Port
Authority.
66.        It has been agreepd that at each puhlic port unrder the jurisdic-i   n
of the National Port Authority, _ncluding the ports of Pisco and Paita, oper-
ati ons will eh carri OPi mt. on en nciln =r,mm,'pi l hzn;ziq  rhi re.r 1.illho
maintained which are designed to produce revenues at each port sufficient to
cover all i -ts ovnraincy nges inluiAing adequ        Ate dpreciationa and to earn
a reasonable return on the value of its average net fixed asset- in use.     In



- 21 -
terms of cash availability, the objective will be to ensure that in-mernally-
generated resources at each port will be sufficient to meet debt interest and
repayments, to provide adequate working capital, to maintain liquid reserves
adequate to meet contingencies and to finance a reasonable portion of the cost
of capital investment programs, including replacement of assets. In additicn,
separate commercial accounts will be kept at each port under the jurisdiction
of N.P.A. As stated above, the charges now credited to the Special Account
will be eliminated no later than the end of 1969, and in their stead port-user
charges will be established for individual services which will be reasonably
related to the costs of providing the indi.vidual services determined in ac-
cordance with modern commercial accounting practices.
67.       The ports of Pisco and Paita will be subject to these general pro-
visions as a part of the N.P.A. In addition, specific agreements have been
reached whereby the objective will be for these ports to earn, not later than
the second comnlAte vyar of fuill onpertion of the new facilities to be con-
structed as part of the Bank projects, a rate of return of not less than six;
per cent on the average net fixed assets valued on a realistic basis.
68.       Based on the foregoing agreements and the assufliptions set forth in
Appendix :10, the port of Pisco estimated-income accounts from 1970, the ex-
nee-ted fi:rst full year of operation at the new facili+ties  toe 1975 are qm-_
marized in Appendix 11, and the estimated balance-sheet data as of December 31,
of each af the years in the 1970-197 period are set forth in Aprnendix 12.
The forecasts assume that: (i) the local-currency costs of the project would
be treated as equity capital in the independent commercial accounts of the
port of Pisco; (ii) the Bank loan would be recorded therein as debt capital;
and 14iiii) 4t1he accounts w-Will. relr" etheaalbiWyo     orking capital and
the reserves referred to above.  However, no specific reserves are set forth.

required to meet future contingencies and investment needs at Pisco cannot
now be determi[ned. *m isese will be agreed between the Bank and the Goverrjfenlt
of Peru in the future after the consultants referred to in paragraph 57 have
madue their recommendations on these points, among other things.
69.       The estimates are based on revenue forecasts prepared by t4E  con-
sultants, and modified by Bank staff.   These modifications involve somewhat
highier operating costs of labor and slightly higher rates and re-venues in. 171
and 1972 in order to achieve a six per cent return in these years. The as-
sumed port charges are approximately the same as those used for similar esti-
mates in the Paita appraisal report and are equivalent, except for 1971 and
1972, to the total of the present charges, including those credited to the
Special Account. The principal charges are the equivalent of US$ 2.31 per ton
of exports and US$ 2.80.per ton of imports. These charges are moderate and
include ships' dues as well as cargo-handling rates, separate revenues being
estimated only for storage and warehousing.
70.       The results of these estimates which are satisfactory are summarized

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RBCOMMENDATIONS
71.       The Bank financed project is technically sound, and the estimates
of cost are realistic.  Final designs have been prepared hy co.metent con-
sultants, acceptable to the Bank, who will also supervise construction. The
pronosd   o-nnstrurtion and procurpment arrangePments are satisfac-torv_
72.       The project has high priority  -ihin the Go.ernm.ent's program for
improving and developing the public ports which D.A.P. operates.  D.A.P.'s
lack of fi.ancial and admiristrative auonomy has a harmfl effect on port
operations and development, and the Government intends to set up a National
Port Authority no take o,er ad-inisrt-ati^n.. of these por
73.       The pow s, managevment, anCd fi.ianci '.1 policies of the Au .r v ,
and the laws under which it will function, will be acceptable to the Bank.
Op erato   cons ultant -w1il be- er,ioyed to ad-vise O[D £JgaLJ.tion and oe r-
ating and accounting procedures.
74.       The project is necessary and is economically justified, showing
an economic rate of return oI i6 per cent.  Operations at the port oI Pisco
will be financially sound. The rate of return on net fixed assets is ex-
pected to reach six per cent in 1971, the second year of full operation and
to improve thereafter.
75.       The local currency costs of the project will be provided out of a
Special Account fund set up by the Government to finance port development
works, supplemented, if necessary, from the general budget.
76.       The project is suitable for a loan of US$ 9.1 million equivalLit
to the Government of Peru.  A term of 25 years, including a grace period of
about five years, would be appropriate.

protected structure with a reinforced concrete deck.    Tihe depbh alongside
the new berths will be 11 meters. There will be one open berth for handling
rinerals and fertilizer, one berth for fish-meal export, and two general
cargo berths.   In addition, a small-boat jetty with an alongside depth of
five meters will be buiit for the accommodation oI harbor craft, tugs and
lighters.
Port Area
3.        Levelling of the port's 12-hectare transit area will require
excavation and transport of about 700,000 cubic meters of fill, partly
rock.  The port will be equipped with the necessary stacking areas, roads,
fire and fresh water mains, sewers, electrical distribution cable, a weigh
bridge, fencing, and two 50-meter high light towers.
Fresh Water Supply
4.        About 2,500 cubic nieters of water are estiriatnd to be needed
daily for the port and a town of 5,000 inhabitants. The water will be
supplied from the Rio Seco arca where several wells are located yielding
from 20 to 30 liters per second. It is expected that no treatment other
than normal chlorination will be required.    Lhree wells with pumping
station and necessary storage will be constructed and water mains about
15 kilometers long, will carry- the water to the port.   A reservoir with
a capacity of 6,ooo cubic meters will be built on the high ground behirdI
the new port facilities.
Annroach Road
5.        Land aecess from Pisco and the Pan Amerinan Riahwrr to the n_e

out and paid $'or by the Government.
Sheds and Other Buildings
6.        The fishmeal berth and the general cargo berths will have transit
sheds with a combined floor space of 9,000 square meters. 'The two general
cargo berths will also have warehouses, each with a floor space of 3,000
square meters.  A two-story administration h-ilding with a floor area of
about 850 square meters and customs and labor offices with floor areas of 430
and 185 square meters respectively will also be constructed together with the
following minor buildings:
(i) a police station;
(ii) a fire station;
(iii) a dangerous goods store;

Technical Studies for LmDrovement_of Port of Chimbote and River Ports
1.        The traffic through the port of Chimbote, which in 1964 was about
780,000 tons, is handled by two deep-water berths and a lighterage pier.
Export amounted to 639,000 tons including 556,000 tons of fish meal, 45,000
tons of fish oil, and 29,000 tons of coal and ores. Import totalled 67,000
tons, mostly scrap iron, coke, and macllinery for the steel plant; and of the
coastal traffic 6.0ooo tons was iron ore for the steel plant, 9,000 tons
guano and 6,000 tons various items.  The continued growth of both import and
exoort; estimated to reach an anrnuel volume of about 2.1 ndllion tons by
1975, makes expansion of the deep-water facilities imperative. The owner
and onerator of Chimbote Steel Mill, Sociedad Siderurgica de Chimbote, Se.A
(SOGESA), is preparing plans for the construction of a two-berth mineral
pier designed to handle all stee'-mir cargo, e-pnected to reach 900000 tons
by 1975, but additional facilities will be needed to handle the remaining
1,200,000 tons of cargo expected by 1975   DnAsPo has accordingly prepared
preliminary plans for a four-berth deep-water pier, about five kilometers
from the steel=..ill pier in the southern part ofP Ferrol Bay  r e plnrs,
which are in a preliminary stage, require more explicit traffic and technical
studies as well as u-to=date cost estim.tes.    The studies wouldrd include the
preparation of traffic forecasts based on an economic study of the port's
service area, assessment of the economic benefits from the project and its
financial viability, and preliminary engineering including soil investigatior.
to the extent necessar-y 'to arrive aet a firm, estimate of cost.  The estm,ated
cost of the study is US$ 200,000 equivalent of which US$ 160,000 equivalent
would be foreign exchalge.
2.he inland ports, Iquitos, 'Yurimaguas, rucallpa, aid Maldonado,
on the Amazon River system must be improved. Development of Peru's eastern
region, the "Selva,i, is under way;  and traific through tne river ports is
growing steadily0 Only Iquitos has modern fa'vilities, consisting of an
anchored pontoon wharf, 105 meters long, 6-10 meters wide, and with sheds
and warehouses covering an area of about 4,000 square meters. The floating
pier provides berthing space for only one ocean-going ship. 'Wnen two vessels
are in port at the same time, it is necessary for one to anchor in the river
using lighterage for handling the cargo. The traffic, at present about
85,ooo tons a year, is expected to reach 130,000 tons by 1975; and the
floating wharf is far from sufficient to handle such volume of traffic.
DOAoP. plans to expand the'pier to alleviate the present congestion and to
accommodate future traffic.
3.        Pucallpa is located on the Ucayali River in an area where con-
siderable erosion of the river bank takes place. There are no port .'>cili-
ties of any kind at Pucallpa. A yearly cargo volume of about 25,000 tons
is handled manually over slippery river banks. The traffic is estimated to
reach 62,000 tons in 1975, and D.A.P. plans to provide a floating wharf and
certain upland facilities to eliminate the present difficulty.

4.        YuriUnaguas, located on the Ucay-ali River, is the only shipplng
outlet for a prosperous agricultural area in the department of San Martin.
The present traffic is about 10,000 tons a year, expected to grow to 17,000
tons by 1975. No port facilities of any kind exist in Yurimaguas, and D.A.P.
plans to build a floating wharf which would allow future relocation, if
required, by changing river-bank conditions.
5.       The port of Maldonado presently handles some 4,000 tons of cargo
a year which may increase to 8,000 tons in 1975.  Also here D.A.P. plans
to provide some facilities to aid in the manual handling of cargo. No final
design has been prepared.
6.        All four river ports mentioned above need improvement or new
facilities. However, studies similar to those described above in the case
of Chimbote will be required before an appraisal of the projects can be made.
The cost of these studies for the four ports is estimated at US$200,000
equivalent of which US$l,000 would be foreign exchange.

Principall Bases andu Assumptions usedu for Estk1imatue%d Financial
'Results in respect of Operations at the Port of Pisco
1.       A new~ National Ports Authority will be established by the end of
1966 and the "Special Account" charges will be eliminated by the end of
1969; and user-charges related to service costs will be assessed exclusively
thereafter.
2.       Construction of the new port would be completed by January 1, 1970.
3.       Except for slightly higher charges in 1971 and 1572, in order to
achieve a 6 per cent return, the tariff of charges for port services would
be as follows, as suggested by D.A.P., such charges covering not only cargo
handling but dockage, etc. and all other services except storage and ware-
housing:
Exports, dry cargo                 Soles 62.0 ($2.31) per ton
Imports,  'I   "                         75.0 ($2.80)  "   "
Coastal trade                        "   30.0 ($1.12)  "   "
Bulk liquid petroleum                "    5.0 ($0-19)  "   "
Fish oil    -                            20.0 ($0.75)  "   r
These overall rates of charges are considerably lower than comparative
charges at Callao, so that there is a reasonable margin for increasing
the tariff should this be necessary, without the risk of encouraging traffic
to use Callao in preference to Pisco.  The rates are also substantially be-
low those at comparable ports in other countries.
4.       The personnel operating expenses would average Soles 10.00 per ton
on dry cargo as compared with the present cost of Soles 6.70 per ton. Pro-
vision has been made for materials, maLntenance, supervision and D.A.P. head
office expenses.
5.       Depreciation has been charged on a straight-line basis on an average
life of the project as a whole of 30 years.
6.       Operations at the port of Pisco would be required to provide for
service of the Bank loan as from January 1, 1970, the loan being for US$ 9.1
million equivalent (Soles 2LL million) for a total of 25 years at 6 Der cent
per annum, repayments commencing on May 15, 1971.
7.       Cperations at the new works of the Port of Pisco would not be ccn-
cerned with the npresnt. ohsole-te nort facilities- at. Piqrr)-
