moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in emergency operations, a delicate\n            balance needs to be found between speed, the implementation\n            risk, and project quality. Tendering procedures be employed\n            in emergency operations should balance the need for speed\n            and the procurement risk. Particularly for emergency\n            operations in fragile countries, for which time is of the\n            essence, strong technical support will need to be put in\n            place timely to mitigate design and implementation risks."}, "docdt": "2014-08-28T00:44:01Z"}
