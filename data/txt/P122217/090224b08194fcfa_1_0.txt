                         conducted between August 2012 and November 2012. A consultant was contracted in December 2013 to assist REGIDESO supervise the installation works and commissioning.
                         Commissioning of the power plant is scheduled in March 2013. The bidding document for the purchasing of fuel (LFO) for the power plant has been launched. The contract for the
                         rehabilitation of Rwegura and Nyemanga hydro power plants became effective in July 2012 with duration of 12 months. Manufacturing of equipment is ongoing in India. Shipment is in
                         January 2013 with the rehabilitation work on site to commence in February 2013 and the commissioning of the two power plants is scheduled to be completed by July 2013. The
                         contract for the MV network rehabilitation works in Bujumbura became effective in February 2012, the manufacturing process is completed and the majority of equipment including
                         power transformers and 10kV panels have been received on site. Cables are expected to be received on site in January 2013 and completion of the MV network rehabilitation works
                         is scheduled to be completed by March 2013. All the 15,000 pre-payment meters have been received in Bujumbura and the bidding document for contracting of a company to
