                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Emergency Energy Project (EEP) which was effective on February 23, 2011 will close on January 31, 2014 after about 3 years of implementation. The main activities of the
                         project have been completed. The thermal plant of 5MW was installed in July 2013 and was commissioned on August, 18 2013. The operation of the 5MW thermal plant has

                         significantly contributed to the reduction of power outages in Bujumbura. Moreover, the installation of 30/10kV transformer of 10MVA and 10kV switchboards at the RN1 substation
                         was completed in March 2013. The rehabilitation of electromechanical equipment of the existing hydro power plant of Rwegura and of Nyemanga under the EEP was completed in
                         July 2013. The implementation of the fuel supply contract for the thermal plant was initially delayed but has reasonably progressed. To enhance the implementation of this contract,
                         the GoB, REGIDESO, and the Bank have agreed to use the fuel storage of the SEP in Bujumbura in order for REGIDESO to continue using fuel purchased under the project for the

                         operation of the Bujumbura thermal plant for 2-3 months additional. The implementation of this measure would enhance the project achieved target in terms of generation. In addition,
                         15,000 prepayment meters have been received in Bujumbura and their installation has progressed and the majority of the meters is likely to be installed before the closing date of the
                         project, achieving the project target.
                         The project is hiring a Consultant to assist the GoB to prepare the implementation completion report of the project. The draft report would be ready by January 31, 2014 and the final
                         report of the GoB is expected to be available in March 2013.
