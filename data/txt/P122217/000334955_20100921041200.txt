                     Entity's fiscal years covered by such review, the Project Implementing Entity
                     shall promptly take all necessary measures (including, without limitation,
                     adjustments of the structure or levels of its tariffs) in order to meet such
                     requirements.
              (b) No later than six (6) months after the Effective Date, the Project Implementing
                  Entity shall establish and enforce a mechanism acceptable to the Association to
                  enable the Project Implementing Entity to pass on to its customers the cost of
  purchasing the fuel used to generate energy and the cost of purchasing energy
  provided by other producers including, without limitation, through adjustments in
  the structure or levels of the Project Implementing Entity's tariffs, if necessary
  (the "Fuel Cost Pass-Though Mechanism").
 i.   Each year starting from the date of establishment of the Fuel Cost Pass-
      Though Mechanism and thereafter, the Recipient shall (with inputs from the
      Project Implementing Entity), for each calendar quarter, prepare on the basis
      of a methodology acceptable to the Association, and furnish to the
      Association no later than two weeks before the beginning of said calendar
      quarter, (a) a reasonable forecast of total operating revenues and of total
      operating expenses (as defined in the Project Agreement) of the Project
      Implementing Entity during said quarter, including in respect of any changes
      in fuel and purchased power costs, and (b) details of any necessary tariff
      revision in order to enable the Project Implementing Entity to meet the targets
      set out in the Performance Contract, taking into account the views of the
      Association in the matter.
ii.   No later than the beginning of each calendar quarter, the Project
      Implementing Entity shall implement such revision as the Recipient has
      determined, in accordance with Section V.B of Schedule 2 to the Financing
      Agreement, is necessary to enable the Project Implementing Entity to meet the
      targets set out in the Performance Contract for such quarter.
I.      INTRODUCTION

 1.     This Emergency Project Paper (EPP) seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to
 provide an Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) in an amount of SDR 10.2 million (US$15.4
 million equivalent) to the Republic of Burundi for the Emergency Energy Project (EEP) in
 accordance with the Operational Policy/Bank Policy (OP/BP) 8.00 ­ Rapid Response to Crises
 and Emergencies. The ERL would be provided as a grant under the International Development
 Association (IDA) Crisis Response Window (CRW), as approved by the World Bank's Board of
 Directors on December 10, 2009.

 2.      Burundi was affected by a severe electricity crisis in the summer of 2009, in which the
 country's power utility REGIDESO (Régie de Production et de Distribution d'Eau et
 d'Electricité) lost 40 percent of its generation and the power supply capacity in the Bujumbura
 capital area was curtailed for a period of four months. During that time, power shortages affected
 for instance Bujumbura's water supply, hospitals, and public services. The next power supply
 crisis affecting large areas of Bujumbura occurred during the summer of 2010. Scheduled
 general technical revision and operation and maintenance works at a key hydro power plant, and
 unexpected technical problems in a key substation and distribution post resulted in unexpected
 outages and heavy load shedding for several days. Burundi's ongoing electricity crisis is due to
 the following two main factors: (i) the increase in electricity demand as a result of the return of
 refugees and investments in capital area has rapidly exhausted the country's limited available
 power supply capacity; and (ii) the country's electricity transmission and distribution system is
 dilapidated due to destruction and lack of investments during the past 13 years of civil war.
 Therefore major system breakdowns with disastrous effects on the economy risk to occur at any
 moment. Due to lack of internal resources, the Government of Burundi has appealed to the
 international community for assistance in reestablishing reliable and affordable power supply to
 the capital.

 3.      The proposed project will therefore provide urgent assistance to REGIDESO to recover
 the capacity and reliability of electricity services with a main focus on the capital Bujumbura. An
 emergency electricity infrastructure investment program has been identified to quickly address,
 over the next 12 months, the main risks of power system failure and lack of supply
 diversification, and alleviate some of the immediate effects of the global financial crisis on the
 country's fragile post-conflict economic growth. The proposed project is fully aligned with and
 complimentary to the IDA financed Multi-Sectoral Water and Electricity Infrastructure Program
 (MSWEIP1) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) Energy Infrastructure Rehabilitation
 and Extension Project, which finances investments in the electricity and water supply and
 distribution systems as well as a comprehensive capacity building program for REGIDESO and
 the Ministry of Water, Energy and Mines (MWEM).

  The MSWEIP was approved on May 13, 2008, with an original IDA grant of SDR 30.4 million (US$50 million
 equivalent). The closing date of the MSWEIP is June 30, 2013. See Annex 10 for further details.

II.      THE EMERGENCY CHALLENGE

 A. Country Context

 4.      Development in Burundi has been set back by several years of recurring internal
 conflict. Burundi is a small, landlocked country that straddles Central and East Africa, with a
 total land area of 27,834 km2, and approximately 8.5 million inhabitants, about 10.6 percent of
 whom live in urban areas. Burundi has emerged from a cycle of political-ethnic conflicts that
 lasted more than 13 years and claimed the lives of about 300,000 people while displacing about
 1,200,000 people, or about 16 percent of the population. The 13 years of recurring conflict has
 had a devastating effect on Burundi's economy. Burundi's per capita income fell by about 40
 percent, from US$180 in 1993 to US$110 in 2007. In 2009 Burundi's Gross Domestic Product
 (GDP) per capita was at US$111, making Burundi one of the poorest countries in the world. A
 simple estimate of the cost of the war indicates that without the conflict Burundi's GDP per
 capita would be about double its current level.2 Burundi is not likely to meet many of the
 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Nearly all social indicators have sharply
 deteriorated as a result of the civil war. By most measures of health and human capital, Burundi
 lags behind the world and other countries in the region. Among children less than five years old,
 undernourishment reached 57 percent in 2000, but has improved in recent years. An estimated 67
 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line and the country ranked towards
 the bottom of the Human Development Index in 2009.

 5.      In the time following the Arusha Peace Agreement of 2000, Burundi has
 experienced both great strides and major setbacks on the road to lasting peace. Following
 13 years of civil war, 39 politico-ethnic groups signed a comprehensive peace and reconciliation
 agreement in Arusha (Tanzania) in August 2000. This significant political turning point paved
 the way for the establishment of a transitional government in 2002, and the approval of a new
 constitution in February 2005 providing for appropriate ethnic checks and balances. With the
 establishment of this basic constitutional framework, presidential and parliamentary elections
 were held in August 2005, and the new government took office in September 2005. In September
 2006, a cease-fire accord was reached with the last hold-out rebel movement, the FNL-
 PALIPEHUTU faction.

 6.     Following the remarkable progress made in 2005 and 2006, the political and
 security situations deteriorated somewhat over the course of 2007 and early 2008. In early
 2007, following the removal of the old leadership of the ruling party (CNDD-FDD), the political
 tensions increased as the government lost its parliamentary majority, leading to a political
 deadlock. The security situation deteriorated somewhat following the last rebel group's (FNL)
 withdrawal from the peace negotiations in July 2007. A turning point came in May 2008, when
 FNL-PALIPEHUTU leadership again declared their willingness to reach a negotiated peace. In
 June 2008, following pressures from the international community and intervention by regional
 powers such as South Africa and Tanzania, the FNL leadership returned to Bujumbura, including
 Agathon Rwasa, the movement's leader. They rejoined the Joint Agreement of Verification and

 country-specific background studies prepared by the Government of Burundi, the World Bank, other donors and
 academics. The CEM provides a synthesis of various recommendations, including the prioritization and sequencing
 of key actions for Burundi to raise its growth path in the next few years.

leadership. A major breakthrough came on December 4, 2008, when the government and the last
rebel group, the FNL-PALIPEHUTU, signed a power sharing agreement. On April 21, 2009,
FNL became Burundi's 42nd political party. The country held its second presidential and
parliamentary elections from May 2010 to August 2010 and a new government was installed on
August 30, 2010.

7.      Overall, notwithstanding the general progress towards the consolidation of peace,
the underlying economic forces leading to recurrent conflicts in Burundi will need to be
addressed to achieve lasting peace and stability. While the country is agriculturally rich, there
is strong competition for resources, especially for land in rural areas where 90 percent of the
population lives. The peace era is seeing the return of large numbers of internal and external
refugees to land that has been cultivated by others in their absence. This is leading to tensions
about resource ownership and use and affects earning potential of past and present users.
Furthermore the risk of unforeseen power supply breakdowns could result in nearly complete
lack of electricity supply for a prolonged period, thus resulting in deterioration of the fragile
security situation and adversely affecting water supply, hospitals and public services. The 2010
post-election period could be considered as another critical moment in the peace consolidation
process.

8.     The severe infrastructure deficit aggravates Burundi's constraints resulting from its
landlocked and isolated position. Burundi suffers from extreme infrastructure gaps in road
access, power generation, communications infrastructure, and access to water and sanitation.
Poor roads, bridges and rail infrastructure hinder internal trade and reduce opportunities to
exchange between Burundi, the region and the rest of the world. The internal obstacles are
compounded by the high costs of use of the sea ports of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and Mombasa
(Kenya), on which Burundi's trade depends. Electricity supply, covering only two percent of
households, is extremely limited. The poor state and coverage of infrastructure imply high costs
and delays that lower the expected rate of return on capital, discourage domestic and foreign
investment and constrain economic growth.

9.      After about 25 years of protracted decline in GDP per capita, Burundi's economy is
beginning to experience positive growth with the gradual return of stability. Burundi's per
capita income in 2008 was at about one-ninth of the Sub-Saharan Africa average, roughly on par
with its 1975 income per capita level. Consolidation of the peace process has helped start
reconstruction and created positive prospects, but the country has not experienced the typical
post-conflict bounce in GDP growth, in large part due to periodic internal instability and a
generally poor investment climate linked to heavily dilapidated infrastructure.3 The agriculture
sector currently dominates Burundi's economy, representing 46 percent of GDP and providing
90 percent of the population with income and employment. Recent growth in the service sector,
which accounts for 37 percent of GDP, is largely due to a rise in public services. Burundi's
industrial sector only contributes to 17 percent of GDP however the construction industry has
3
  The lack of post-conflict rebound for Burundi is explained by the continued instability in the country, even after
the beginning of relative peace in 2001. This has had adverse consequences on the level of private investment
which, unlike that of neighbors like Rwanda, remains low. The difference in growth performance between Burundi
and Rwanda five years after the end of conflict can be almost completely attributed to differences in private
investment.


                                                         3
shown considerable dynamism since 2001. The rate of growth of Burundi's GDP is projected to
increase from an estimated 3.5 percent in 2009 to 4.8 percent in 2012. A short term strategy for
the country's commercial and industrial development suggests that Burundi should focus on five
main export subsectors, namely coffee, tea, tourism, horticulture and mining.

10.     The Government of Burundi has requested CRW financing to fight the adverse
economic and social impacts of the global financial crisis on the country's fragile post-
conflict economy and protect core development spending to the Infrastructure sector.
Compared to similar post-conflict economies, Burundi has not been able to attract private sector
investment capital and spur non-farm growth to the extent needed to fuel a strong economic
recovery. The impact of the global financial crisis should be seen in the context of a prolonged
set of sustained economic shocks during 2008-2009 affecting the country's growth prospects and
recovery, starting with the effect from the Kenya post election violence on the country's cost of
imports, the large oil price fluctuations and the rapid increase in agricultural commodity prices.
Strengthened macroeconomic policies have contributed to stabilized and increased growth,
although the global financial crisis has led to lower expected growth in 2009 and a reduction of
domestic tax and non tax revenues as percentage of GDP by approximately 8% for 2009 and
2010 (WB/IMF estimates). The CRW financing will thus assist the government of Burundi to
maintain the core development spending despite this revenue shortfall. Looking forward, the
continued global economic crisis is likely to affect Burundi further through declining
international aid, as donor countries are likely to cut back assistance to developing countries due
to budgetary constraints; delayed private sector investments; and reduction in migrant
remittances. To reduce the dependence on increasingly volatile commodity prices and external
aid, Burundi would need to rapidly improve the conditions for private sector investment, starting
in the Bujumbura capital area. In a recent survey of Burundian businesses 72 percent of the
respondents rated poor access and reliability of electricity supply as the primary constraint to
new investment and growth. Provision of an adequate electricity supply at competitive prices can
be considered as one of the core pillars of Burundi's economic growth path, as identified in the
2009 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM).

B. Sector Context

11.     Sector Organization: Two main organizations are involved in the supply and
distribution of electricity and water in Burundi. The first is REGIDESO, a public water and
power utility with autonomous legal and financial status, operating under the supervision of the
Ministry of Water, Energy and Mines (MWEM). The second institution is the General
Directorate of Water Supply and Energy (DGHER - Direction Générale de l'Hydraulique et des
Energies Rurales), also an autonomous entity operating under MWEM's supervision, that is
responsible for the provision of electricity and water in rural areas of Burundi.

12.     Domestic hydro power supply: Most of the country's electricity supply is generated by
REGIDESO through seven hydroelectric plants, which have a combined installed power capacity
of 30.6 MW.4 Two of these hydro power plants deliver 85 percent of the domestic power supply:
Rwegura (18 MW) and Mugere (8 MW). Burundi's energy supply therefore depends to about 95

4
  In addition DGHER operates eight small and micro hydro plants in rural areas while non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and some non-profit organizations operate another twelve micro hydro plants.


                                                 4
percent on hydro power. This makes the country highly vulnerable to droughts which frequently
decrease the electricity production by depleting the limited water storage capacity in the
associated hydro power reservoirs.

13.     Domestic thermal power supply: REGIDESO also owns a 5.5 MW thermal power plant
in Bujumbura, which has been mostly idle since its acquisition in 1995. Low electricity tariff
levels and high diesel prices did not allow REGIDESO to finance fuel payments, and the plant
has therefore been kept as an emergency back-up in case of hydro power production failure.
Considering the adverse effects of the widening supply deficit on Burundi's domestic economy,
and especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), funding for diesel fuel subsidies for the
Bujumbura thermal plant was allocated under the IDA-financed MSWEIP in 2008. The
Bujumbura thermal power plant started regular operations in September 2009, following a
complete technical overhaul and operation and maintenance (O&M) training of REGIDESO
staff.

14.    Regional power supply: Burundi imports electricity from the regional hydro plants of
Ruzizi I and II, which are operated by SINELAC (Société Internationale des Pays des Grands
Lacs) and SNLE (Société Nationale d'Electricité), respectively. The operation of these power
plants has been fluctuating, mainly due to complex ownership issues on maintenance and
payments for power delivery. Plans for new regional power plants and regional power
interconnections are still in the feasibility stage.

15.     Energy access and demand growth: The average per capita consumption of electricity
in Burundi is among the lowest in Africa at 23 kWh/year. During the years of civil conflict, the
electricity access rate in connected areas halved as the urban population doubled, while the
number of REGIDESO's customers remained barely unchanged. Less than two percent of the
country's households currently have electricity service in their homes. Looking forward, national
electricity demand is likely to increase between 8-12 percent per year.5 With no immediate relief
from new power generation projects under construction, the power sector in Burundi needs to
immediately reinforce its production capacity by increasing the thermal, diesel based generation,
while waiting for the installation of new, less expensive hydro power plants to be implemented in
the next 4-5 years.

16.      Electricity tariffs: REGIDESO's electricity tariff was revised last time in 2008 and
remains one of the region's lowest average electricity tariffs.6 REGIDESO's average tariff of
US$ 0.08 per kWh does not reflect operating costs nor allows the utility to properly maintain its
assets and honor multi-lateral agreements to pay for power imports from regional hydro power
plants. REGIDESO will undertake a complete review and overhaul of both water and electricity
tariff levels and structure during 2010, taking into account the increased reliance on fossil fuel
based generation for the coming 3-4 years. In this regard a detailed tariff study is being finalized
with support from the IDA financed MSWEIP. An official confirmation of the GOB's energy
sector policy has been received in June 2010, committing the GoB to gradually introduce cost

5
  REGIDESO's household electricity access program targets 3,000 new connections per year. Industrial electricity
demand is also growing, for instance a newly constructed cement plant and a plant making steel re-bars for the
construction sector have requested supply of 3 MW and 2.5 MW respectively by mid 2010.
6
  Average electricity tariffs in the region are 2-3 times higher than in Burundi: 0.21 US$ per kWh in Rwanda (2010);
and 0.15-0.18 US$ per kWh in Uganda and Kenya (2010).


                                                         5
reflective tariffs including a fuel cost pass-through component with a quarterly adjustment
mechanism reflecting the variable cost of diesel based electricity production.

17.      Growing power supply-demand gap: During the 2004-2006 regional droughts,
REGIDESO's hydro power production decreased to 137 GWh per year, representing a 35
percent decline compared to the 2009 supply level. The total annual supply of electricity
increased slightly from 188.8 GWh in 2007 to 208 GWh in 2009 due to rehabilitation of some
smaller hydro plants and increased generation from the Bujumbura thermal power plant. Supply
reliability is further hampered by a severely dilapidated electricity grid in urgent need of repair.
The absence of key system protection and control functions make outages more frequent and
difficult to monitor and address in time. The fast growing power supply deficit is due to a
combination of several factors including: (i) lack of investments in the country's hydro power
generation capacity during the last 13 years of civil war; (ii) rapidly increasing power demand in
the Bujumbura capital area (further increased by the REGIDESO's electricity access program for
new connections); (iii) over-reliance of hydro power, immediately affecting power supply during
droughts; (iv) degradation of the catchment area upstream of main hydro power plants due to
deforestation and increased land usage during the years of conflict; (v) high technical and
commercial losses in the electricity distribution network and (vi) failure to operate the existing
(yet limited) thermal capacity due to lack of funds for fuel purchase, poor maintenance and lack
of available spare parts. Assuming that the economic growth continues at the current pace and
the 5 MW extension of the Bujumbura thermal power plant is realized by 2011, the supply
deficit may reach 21 MW and 36 MW respectively during the wet and dry seasons of 2014, at
which point additional small scale hydro generation capacity could be added. Large scale hydro
power developments, such as Kabu 16 in Burundi (20 MW) and the two regional plants Rusumo
Falls (60-80 MW) and Ruzizi III (145 MW), can be expected to contribute to Burundi's power
supply in 2017 (see Annex 1 for a detailed supply-demand analysis).

18.    Service issues. Due to the lack of maintenance and the supply deficit described above,
the quality of service and operations is currently insufficient, with an estimated 43 GWh in
combined technical and non technical losses for 2009, representing 20.5 percent of total supply.
Technical losses are deemed to make up a large portion of these losses given the poor condition
of the network, of the high voltage (HV) and medium voltage (MV) stations, and of the low
voltage (LV) distribution posts. The numbers of power interruptions are high both on the LV and
on the HV/MV backbone network. The quality electricity supply suffers from poor frequency
and significant voltage deviations estimated to be in excess of 10 percent below and above 220
Volts.

19.     Electricity collection issues: Many municipalities and public customers, such as the
military and universities, are not paying their electricity bills thus forcing REGIDESO to run up
significant arrears only partially compensated by the Ministry of Finance in budget transfers. For
billed electricity, the cash collection rate is estimated to be 76 percent. However this should be
seen in the context of a relatively high collection rate (> 90 percent) among private households
and small businesses, benefiting from the region's lowest tariffs, and reversely a very low
collection rate among public customers such as municipalities (~ 50 percent). When long term
outstanding arrears to the public sector are taken into account REGIDESO collects on average
only 55 percent of the outstanding payments due. As a result, the utility does not generate



                                                 6
enough revenues to cover its increasing operating and maintenance costs. The financial situation
is worsened by the increasing cost of regional hydro power supply from Ruzizi I and Ruzizi II.

20.      Power supply crises in the dry seasons of 2009 and 2010: Burundi was affected by a
severe electricity crisis in the summer of 2009, in which REGIDESO lost 40 percent of its
generation and supply capacity in the Bujumbura capital area was curtailed for a period of four
months. During that time, power shortages affected for instance the water supply, hospitals, and
public services. The return of ample rainfall and additional electricity production spurred by the
MSWEIP diesel subsidies improved the situation temporarily and helped avert a humanitarian
crisis. However the severe load shedding and impact on basic services led the GoB to issue a call
to the development partners to help restore reliable and sustainable electricity supply to the
capital. The next power supply crisis affecting large areas of the Bujumbura capital area occurred
during the summer of 2010. Scheduled general technical revision and O&M works at the 8 MW
Mugere hydro power plant, requiring to shut down the power plant for a period of about one
month starting in mid-August 2010, and unexpected technical problems in a key MV substation
and distribution post in Bujumbura, mainly due to surcharges in the country's transmission
system only two days after the start of Mugure revision works, both resulted in unexpected
outages and heavy load shedding in large parts of Bujumbura capital area for several days,
adversely affecting the water supply, hospitals, public services and households.

21.      If no urgent measures are taken, the electricity crisis experienced in 2009 could
recur in an even more severe form leading to high socioeconomic cost or even a
humanitarian crisis. There is a substantial risk of major power supply breakdowns that, in the
worst scenario, could result in nearly complete lack of electricity supply for a prolonged period.
A possible scenario with a combination of drought conditions during the 2010 rainy season (to
start in October 2010), immediately affecting the hydro power production, together with a major
technical breakdown of key generation or transmission substations could bring public services
and the (urban) economy to a standstill. Emerging from financial restructuring in 2008,
hampered by low electricity tariffs, that are not reflecting operating costs, REGIDESO lacks
funds to perform vital maintenance and rehabilitation of its dilapidated infrastructure.
Adjustment of these sector imbalances will take time and in the meanwhile increased support
from the donor community will be a vital component of a necessary turnaround.

C. Government Strategy

22.     Government power sector strategy for recovery: The GoB's power sector strategy in
the short to medium term consists of (i) increasing thermal (petroleum based) electricity
generation capacity to stem the immediate supply deficit; (ii) develop national hydro power
resources as well as other renewable energy resources able to replace thermal base load power
production in 3-4 years; (iii) complete the rehabilitation of the national power grid and
distribution services so badly damaged during the conflict, creating a base for sustainable
electricity access expansion; and (iv) strengthen REGIDESO's financial and operational
performance by introducing cost reflective tariffs, debt restructuring, performance based
management and technical assistance for commercial operations, including the introduction of
pre-payment meters to reduce losses.




                                                7
23.      Government response to the 2009 and 2010 power supply crises: The GoB responded
to the 2009 power supply crisis by ordering systematic load shedding, fast tracking the re-
forestation of the main hydro power plant catchment areas and most importantly, using IDA
funds under the MSWEIP to procure additional diesel fuel to operate the existing 5.5 MW
Bujumbura thermal power plant. To avoid the next power supply crisis the GoB decided to
install 10 MW of rental thermal power supply for a period of 6 months, in order to deliver
additional power supply during the 4 peak hours each day from September 2010 onwards. These
investments did not prevent another power supply crisis to occur in the Bujumbura capital area in
the 2010 dry season, as acute supply shortages and outages negatively affected the country
during its critical second presidential and parliamentary election period from May to August
2010. Due to lack of internal resources, GoB has appealed to the international community for
assistance in reestablishing reliable and affordable power supply to the capital. REGIDESO's
technicians are constantly repairing failing generation equipment; but this is not sustainable, as
the electricity infrastructure needs major rehabilitation and due to the old age of the equipment,
in many cases spares are no longer available. REGIDESO's revenues are not sufficient to cover
all its operating cost, let alone rehabilitate its infrastructure. The GoB does not have the means to
intervene financially in the electricity sector. The recently installed rental power generation will
substantially increase the financial pressure on GoB and REGIDESO from September 2010
onwards, in the beginning of the post-election period. The country is therefore relying on
external financing for the required emergency electricity infrastructure investments and short
term operational subsidies to sustain the power sector while gradually developing cheaper
domestic hydro power generation resources and adopting cost reflective tariffs to cover the
operating and maintenance costs in the medium term.

24.      Government commitment to strengthen implementation of urgent infrastructure
investments: The focus on improved energy and water infrastructure project performance is
anchored at the highest levels of government and utility management. The GoB's "Rapid Results
Initiative (RRI)" launched on March 4, 2010, is aiming to accelerate the commitment rate of
MSWEIP funds to reach 20 percent by end of June 2010. The MSWEIP disbursement rate
increased to 25 percent by the end of August 2010, thus reaching the targets set forth in the RRI
with a minor delay. The RRI includes a detailed action plan tied to an updated MSWEIP
procurement and processing time table with clear individual responsibilities, tight deadlines and
over-sight from both MWEM and the 2nd Vice Presidency.7 The efforts have been successful in
fast-tracking the procurement activities of the MSWEIP and the proposed Emergency Energy
Project (EEP) will benefit from the measures taken within the GoB's RRI to strengthen project
management and procurement processes in REGIDESO to ensure rapid implementation of these
urgent investments.

D. Complimentarity with other Bank- and donor-financed Projects

25.    The activities under the proposed EEP will be closely coordinated with development
partners active in supporting Burundi's electricity and water sectors. In particular, the African
Development Bank (AfDB) is implementing complementary programs in both the electricity and
water sectors. The emergency electricity infrastructure components have also been discussed

  with representatives of the Belgian cooperation and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
  explore possibilities of parallel co-financing in the areas of emergency diesel power generation
  and sustainable energy development with special emphasis on the development of small scale
  hydro power plants. It is expected that potential Belgian parallel co-financing financing of the
  proposed project could be confirmed prior to project effectiveness.

  26.     The proposed project is fully aligned with and complimentary to the IDA financed
  MSWEIP and the AfDB Energy Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Extension Project, currently
  under implementation, that finance investments in the electricity and water supply and
  distribution systems as well as a comprehensive capacity building program for REGIDESO and
  MWEM. Especially, the implementation of the EEP will build on the capacity of the already
  operational and experienced project implementation unit (PIU) within REGIDESO and the
  fiduciary and safeguard instruments that have been established under the MSWEIP. Over the
  past six months significant progress in MSWEIP implementation has been made by REGIDESO.
  All scheduled procurement activities have been launched and are nearing completion, which is
  reflected in a steadily increasing MSWEIP disbursement rate from about 16 percent in June 2010
  to about 26 percent in September 2010. A summary of the scope, implementation arrangements
  and implementation progress of the MSWEIP are presented in Annex 10.

III.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION

  A. World Bank's Strategy of Emergency Support

  27.     The proposed Emergency Energy Project is aligned to the GoB's power sector strategy of
  financing high-impact activities that address urgent unmet electricity needs with quick return on
  investment for the utility REGIDESO. In the short-term, the proposed emergency electricity
  infrastructure program aims to improve the quality and reliability of electricity services. The
  project will also make substantial strides to rehabilitate the national power grid and underpin
  REGIDESO' corporate restructuring and reform program.

  28.    Bank experience to date with emergency response operations has underscored the need to
  approach the immediate challenge with realism and simplicity, and to work with organizations
  that have proven experience in the type of activities that are proposed. As such, the project's
  proposed implementation arrangements take into consideration the lessons learned during the
  implementation of the MSWEIP and build on the capacity of the existing PIU.

  29.      The medium- to long-term term objective of the World Bank engagement in Burundi's
  power sector is to enable Burundi to develop locally available sources of energy, especially
  hydro power that would be less costly and more environmentally sustainable. In the long term (a
  realistic target date is 2017), Burundi will be also able to benefit from regional electricity
  interconnections and jointly developed power generation from regional hydro power plants such
  as Ruzizi III and Rusumo falls, resulting in a reduced cost of electricity production.

  B. Project Development Objective

  30.     The project's development objective (PDO) is to improve the capacity and reliability of
  electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.

C. Summary of Project Components

31.     An emergency electricity infrastructure investment program has been identified under the
EEP to quickly address, over the next 12 months, the main risks of power system failure and lack
of supply diversification. The project components are dictated by the nature of the emergency
affecting the power system as well as by considerations of sustainability and equilibrium, i.e.,
bringing demand and available supply into closer balance. The project design and financing have
been closely coordinated with the GoB and its development partners. The project design has
been kept simple and proportionate with the local implementation capacity and includes further
support to project management.

32.    The proposed EEP will finance five emergency electricity infrastructure components that
are summarized below. A detailed description of project activities is provided in Annex 1.

33.     Component 1 - Extension of the Bujumbura Thermal Generation Plant (US$5
million): Increasing REGIDESO's thermal generation capacity and improving fuel management
in the Project Implementing Entity's existing diesel-fueled 5.5 MW thermal generation plant in
Bujumbura, through the supply and installation of diesel engines (representing additional 5 MW
of thermal generating capacity) as well as associated electromechanical equipments and critical
spare parts, and the installation of an accurate fuel metering system.

34.     Component 2 - Rehabilitation of Hydro Power Plants (US$3 million): Supporting the
upgrading, renovation, modernization and operation of the REGIDESO's hydropower plants in
Rwegura and Nyemanga, through: (i) the replacement or refurbishment of mechanical equipment
including, inter alia, cooling system, and associated equipments; (ii) the replacement or
refurbishing of electrical equipments including, inter alia, alternators, control and regulation
system, protection system, medium voltage equipments; and (iii) the availability of spare parts.

35.    Component 3 - Rehabilitation of Electricity Transmission and Distribution Network
(US$1.25 million): Improving the quality of supply, especially in the Bujumbura area, through
the rehabilitation and expansion of REGIDESO's medium voltage transmission and distribution
system including, inter alia, the upgrade of the distribution voltage level from 6 kV to 10 kV,
and the replacement of the transformer and associated equipments to rehabilitate and expand
sub-transmission substations, especially in the Bujumbura area.

36.      Component 4 ­ Pre-payment Meters (US$ 1.55 million): Improving the management
of billing, arrears and payments by REGIDESO and of electricity consumption by its customers,
through the supply and installation of payment meters.

37.    Component 5 - Fuel Procurement and support to Project Management (US$3.75
million): Support: (i) the Project Implementing Entity's gradual adaptation to increased
production costs and its implementation of tariff adjustments over two years; and (ii) the Project
Implementing Entity's and the Recipient's institutional strengthening, including in management,
procurement and execution of contracts.

D. Eligibility for Processing under OP/BP 8.00

38.     The 13-year civil war left Burundi facing formidable challenges to rebuild its economy,
reestablish security and reconstruct the country's damaged infrastructure. Burundi was affected
by a severe electricity crisis in the summer of 2009, again repeated in 2010, in which
REGIDESO lost 40 percent of its generation and supply capacity in the Bujumbura capital area
as supply was curtailed for a period of four months. Power shortages affected adversely basic
services, including drinking water supply, hospitals, and public services. There is a substantial
risk of major power supply breakdowns that, in the worst scenario, could result in nearly
complete lack of electricity supply for a prolonged period, thus resulting in a deterioration of the
fragile security situation and adversely affecting water supply and health services in Bujumbura.

39.    The proposed project will reduce the risk of such a crisis reoccurring by addressing some
of the main risks of power system failure and lack of supply diversification. Lack of electricity
would affect the GoB's ability to provide key services such as the supply of potable water in the
Bujumbura capital area (pumping and water treatment plants are all depending on electricity
supply) as well as quality health services. The breakdown of electricity supply would also risk
post-conflict recovery in a wider sense by limiting provision of public lighting and access to
information, important for the population's perception of security and personal safety. Similarly,
the heavy reliance on hydro power generation (95 percent of current output) leaves the country
severely exposed to fluctuations in seasonal rainfall, even for shorter periods.

40.     The World Bank's response is adapted in form and scope to the particular circumstances
of the emergency experienced by the power sector in Burundi. It is mainly limited to restoring
reliable power supply to the capital Bujumbura and preventing the future recurrence of the crisis.
The proposed project will provide visible benefits in terms of reduced load shedding, increased
supply reliability and improved service quality to the population of Bujumbura after 12 months
of implementation. Processing the proposed project as an Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL)
under Operational Policy/Bank Policy (OP/BP) 8.00 rapid response procedures will ensure
continuation of emergency power supply in the Bujumbura capital area with minimal operational
disruption, thus mitigating the potential effects of future energy crises and supporting the
Government of Burundi's fragile post-conflict economic recovery. Specifically, the proposed
project responds to three key objectives of OP/BP 8.00, namely: (i) rebuilding and restoring
physical assets with regards to electricity generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure;
(ii) restoring the means of production and economic activities by ensuring continuation of
emergency power supply; and (iii) restoring essential services, particularly electricity services for
basic services, including drinking water supply, hospitals, and public services.

E. Consistency with Country Assistance Strategy

41.     The World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board of
Directors in August 2008, presents a medium-term vision of sustainable development by
assisting Burundi's transition from a post-conflict economy to a developing country. The CAS
provides a framework for World Bank Group support from FY 2009 through FY 2012 and
focuses on two strategic objectives: (i) promote sustainable and broad-based economic growth;
and (ii) improve access to social services and consolidate social stability. Governance is a cross-
cutting CAS objective. Electricity services will play a crucial role in accelerating industrial and


                                                 11
commercial activity and hence contribute to the country's economic growth. The proposed EEP
contributes to both CAS objectives by improving access to and reliability of electricity services,
which have been identified as core requirements to achieve sustained higher growth performance
and to restore essential basic services, such as water supply, health and public services. These
goals are aligned with those of the Burundi's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of
September 2006, which aims to promote sustainable economic growth and to develop human
capital. Provision of an adequate electricity supply at competitive prices is also considered as one
of the core pillars of increased and participatory growth identified in the 2009 Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM).

F. Consistency with Crisis Response Window Objectives

42.     The IDA Crisis Response Window (CRW), approved by the Board of Directors on
December 10, 2009, is aiming to assist countries in developing, implementing and monitoring
programs to manage the poverty, social, and economic impact of the global economic crisis and
to provide financial assistance to protect core spending on health, education, social safety nets,
infrastructure, and agriculture. As discussed above, the proposed EEP will scale up the Bank's
assistance to the energy sector in Burundi to alleviate some of the immediate effects of the global
financial crisis on the country's fragile economic growth and reduce risks of severe supply
interruptions due to heavily dilapidated electricity equipment and infrastructure. The emergency
electricity infrastructure investment program has been designed to quickly address, over the next
12 months, some of the main risks of power system failure and lack of supply diversification.

G. Expected Outcomes

43.   The proposed Emergency Energy Project (EEP) will achieve the following main
outcomes:

       (i)     increased electricity generation capacity;
       (ii)    improved transmission and distribution reliability; and
       (iii)   improved revenue recovery of REGIDESO.

44.    The expected main outputs under the proposed EEP include:

       (i)     5 MW of thermal generation capacity constructed;
       (ii)    20 MW of hydro power capacity and 1 key MV substation rehabilitated;
       (iii)    Reduced average number of unplanned power interruptions and reduced
               electricity losses; and
       (iv)     15,000 additional pre-payment meters installed.

45.     The results framework, outcome indicators and target values of the proposed project are
provided in Annex 2, taking into account the recently established IDA core indicators for energy
sector operations.

IV.     APPRAISAL OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES

 A. Technical

 46.     Technologies considered for the emergency electricity infrastructure investment
 program under the EEP, are proven globally and pose no major technical concerns. With
 exception for the 5 MW extension of the Bujumbura thermal power plant, all activities proposed
 are identical or very similar to the activities already included under the complementary
 MSWEIP, i.e., procurement of diesel fuel, refurbishment of electrical and electromechanical
 installations in the national electricity grid and installation of pre-payment meters. Considering
 the emergency supply deficit situation, while waiting for the commissioning of new hydro power
 investments for the medium and long term planning, REGIDESO will invest in high speed diesel
 generators (1,500 rpm) that offer several advantages (e.g., higher flexibility in operations
 because of scalable capacity, lower initial purchase price, easily manageable fuel supply
 logistics, shorter manufacturing time and quicker installation) compared to medium speed diesel
 and Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) based engines. The design would allow the utility to operate the
 Bujumbura thermal power plant as follows: (i) during the initial 3-4 years as base load power
 supply to support business demand, (ii) in the medium term to supplement hydro power plants
 during the dry season, and (iii) eventually as a standby facility when large scale, lower cost
 generation resources come on-line in 2017 at the earliest. A financial analysis of various
 technology options, including rental power supply, can be found in Annex 9.

 B. Economic Analysis

 47.     The proposed project is economically justified. The economic analysis has been based
 on a 5-year REGIDESO investment program. The results show that the project's economic
 returns would be positive and remain robust even under less favorable scenarios. The projected
 base economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the proposed project is 18 percent.

 C. Financial Analysis

 48.     The proposed project is financially justified. Under the MSWEIP REGIDESO
 improved its accounting and financial management and an integrated accounting system was
 introduced. The MSWEIP also included measures for helping REGIDESO improve its operating
 efficiency, in particular, the installation of prepaid meters with a focus on government buildings,
 as well as reaching agreement between the Government of Burundi and REGIDESO on a
 financial restructuring plan and anchoring both parties' obligations in a performance contract
 between them. REGIDESO's tariff was last revised in FY 2008, at about US$ 0.08 per kWh,
 which does not reflect operating costs nor allows the utility to properly maintain its assets and
 honor multi-lateral agreements to pay for power produced by the regional hydro power plants.
 Using the existing MSWEIP proceeds, REGIDESO will undertake a complete review and
 overhaul of both water and electricity tariff levels and structure during 2010. In this regard a
 detailed tariff study is being finalized with support from the IDA financed MSWEIP. A letter to
 clarify the Energy Sector Policy, committing the Government of Burundi to cost reflective tariffs
 and the introduction of a fuel cost pass through mechanism, reflecting the variable cost of diesel
 based electricity production, was signed in June 2010.



                                                 13
D. Environmental and Social Safeguards

49.     The safeguard category of the EEP was determined as B after review by Bank
safeguard specialists since there are no significant and/or irreversible adverse
environmental and social issues expected from electricity infrastructure components financed
under the proposed project. With exception for the extension of the existing diesel power plant,
all activities proposed are identical or very similar to the activities already covered under the
existing MSWEIP safeguards framework, i.e., procurement of diesel fuel, refurbishment of
electrical and electromechanical installations in the national electricity grid and installation of
pre-payment meters. The safeguards implications of the 5 MW extension of the existing power
plant is expected to be minor and will be fully reflected in updated and re-disclosed safeguards
documents. The expansion of the existing power plant, by addition of four new diesel engines to
the existing 4 diesel engines installed in 1996, can be done inside the existing engine hall of the
power plant or at another location within the confines of the current REGIDESO industrial plot
perimeter. Therefore only minor environmental impacts could be expected from the installation
activities and site works, similar to the impact of the subcomponent for substation rehabilitation
covered within the existing MSWEIP safeguard framework. As the new engines are likely to be
less noisy and cleaner than the existing ones currently under operation no significant noise or air
pollution is expected. As the rehabilitation works proposed for the two hydro power plants does
not concern the existing dam structure (only replacement and repair of power and relay
equipment in the generating station, no civil works) hydro power related safeguard policies such
as safety of dams and international waterways are not deemed to be triggered by the investments
proposed under the EEP. While no adverse affects on dam safety is expected, the task team will
pay special attention to dam safety aspects during supervision.

50.     REGIDESO will continue to be responsible for the implementation of the ESMF
and RPF. An environmental and social specialist is already in place in the MSWEIP PIU with
satisfactory performance and would be supervising implementation of the EEP components. The
two safeguards policies triggered under the MSWEIP will be applied under the EEP:
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). No long
term adverse impacts were identified in the prepared safeguards instruments during the
implementation of the MSWEIP: Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). All Environmental Assessments and Resettlement
Plans for electricity infrastructure components under the EEP will continue to be handled
according to the provisions made in the ESMF and RPF. These safeguard documents were
completed in December 2007 during MSWEIP preparations and were satisfactory to the Bank.
The "in-country" disclosure took place on February 6, 2008, and the documents were submitted
to the World Bank's Infoshop on February 21, 2008. Both safeguard frameworks were re-
disclosed under the proposed project. The "in-country" re-disclosure of the safeguard
frameworks will take place on September 15, 2010, after these documents were re-submitted to
the World Bank's Infoshop on August 30, 2010. MSWEIP supervision confirms that all
safeguard aspects of energy infrastructure components are overall implemented in a satisfactory
manner. Further details are provided in Annex 8.

V.      IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS AND FINANCING PLAN

 A. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements

 51.     The EEP will strengthen existing institutional and implementation arrangements
 within REGIDESO. REGIDESO will continue to be responsible for the implementation and
 supervision of the project. The project implementation unit (PIU) established within REGIDESO
 under the MSWEIP will conduct the daily tasks of project implementation and periodic
 assessments of its progress. The unit is reporting to REGIDESO management and to the Director
 of Energy and Water in MWEM. The PIU will continue to work closely with all of the relevant
 departments within REGIDESO to ensure the timely allocation of additional resources and
 execution of both investment and technical assistance (TA) activities. The PIU will also continue
 to be responsible for the financial management of the project and for the preparation of financial
 reports regarding the project. The PIU will continue to rely primarily on in-house staff in order to
 build and maintain capacity and institutional memory, but additional funds have been allocated
 to ensure that consultants can be hired for critical tasks such as procurement management and
 contract supervision.

 B. Project Costs and Financing Plan

 52.     The proposed Emergency Energy Project (EEP) will result in the following allocation of
 project costs:

            (i) US$14.55 million will be allocated to five emergency electricity infrastructure
                components; and
            (ii) US$0.85 million will be allocated for contingencies.

 53.    A description of financing allocation by component is provided in Annex 3.

 C. Procurement Arrangements

 54.     Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in accordance with the World
 Bank's « Guidelines : Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credit », dated May 2004,
 revised October 2006 and May 2010, and « Guidelines : Selection and Employment of
 Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, » dated May 2004, revised October 2006 and May 2010
 ; Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD
 Loans and IDA Credit and Grants, dated October 15, 2006 and the Board approved modifications
 as stipulated in the Financing Agreement. REGIDESO has concluded its initial identification and
 feasibility of the proposed EEP components and is now preparing a revised Project
 Implementation Plan including a detailed Procurement Plan. As most of the proposed project
 components are either a direct scale-up of ongoing MSWEIP activities with already prepared
 bidding documents or activities that were initially prepared for other donor funded projects, the
 procurement documents are ready in draft and have been discussed in detail with the World Bank
 technical and procurement experts. It is expected that the large majority of bidding documents
 for the proposed project would be ready by September 30, 2010, for IDA no objection.




                                                 15
55.     The Bank's Procurement Specialist evaluated REGIDESO's ability to implement the
project's procurement plan and found it to be satisfactory. The PIU is adequately staffed to deal
with the workload associated with the project, as they expect other projects to be phased out as
this project begins. To allow for fast implementation of the new emergency operation, the project
would finance for a period as needed (i) an international consultant to supervise the extension of
the Bujumbura thermal generation plant; (ii) an international consultant to supervise the
rehabilitation works of hydropower plants; and (iii) an additional procurement consultant with
experience in the World Bank's procurement guidelines and procedures (for a period of 6-9
months or as needed) to accelerate the processing of large scale contracts under international
competitive bidding procedures, and advice on negotiations and tender evaluation. Detailed
procurement arrangements of the proposed project are presented in Annex 5.

D. Financial Management, Reporting and Auditing

56.     Fiduciary management of REGIDESO is satisfactory and no new fiduciary risks are
expected under the project. REGIDESO has been submitting its FMRs and project audits on
time. There are currently no overdue audit reports or unresolved ineligible expenditures under
projects being implemented by the Project Implementing Agency (REGIDESO). The financial
management (FM) system of REGIDESO has been determined to be satisfactory by the Bank's
Financial Management Specialist (FMS) and meet the Bank guidelines as stated in OP 10.02.
REGIDESO is adequately staffed to deal with the workload associated with the project, as they
expect other projects to be phased out as this project begins. An appropriate and adequate
number and mix of skilled and experienced staff are working in the Financial Management (FM)
unit of the PIU. In addition, an integrated information system was installed and is operational at
the PIU and it is expected that the same information system will be used for the Emergency
Energy Project (EEP). REGIDESO will be required to submit quarterly Interim Unaudited
Financial Reports (IFR) within 45 days following the first day of each calendar quarter after
effectiveness. The formats and the content of the IFR and of the Annual Financial Statements
have been discussed and agreed upon. Independent auditors acceptable to IDA will audit the use
of all funds available under the project grant, including the Designated Account and the
statements of expenditures. Audit reports will be submitted to IDA no later than six months after
the end of the fiscal year. The format and the frequency of periodic reporting will be maintained
as defined in the Project Manual. Detailed financial management arrangements are presented in
Annex 4.

E. Disbursement Arrangements

57.    The project will finance 100 percent of all expenditures, excluding taxes. This is
consistent with the Country Financing Parameters for Burundi. The proposed disbursement
arrangements include the establishment of one Designated Account managed by REGIDESO.
Detailed disbursement arrangements are presented in Annex 4.

F. Supervision, monitoring and evaluation

58.      Three supervision missions per year will be conducted by the World Bank task team in
the first two years of project implementation, followed by supervision missions conducted twice
a year for the remainder of the project implementation period. The supervision team will


                                               16
 continue the sector dialogue with the GOB and incorporate the right mix of expertise in order to
 cover all project components. Implementation support and supervision, through missions as well
 as direct involvement by the Burundi Country Office will focus, in particular, on the
 implementation of the fuel cost pass-through mechanism, performance of REGIDESO in
 managing contracts, procurement and financial management, as well as in completing the agreed
 implementation plans.

 G. Implementation Schedule

 59.    As the proposed EEP mainly targets a scale-up of already ongoing activities under
 the MSWEIP and new activities initially prepared for donor co-financing, there is high
 readiness for implementation. As mentioned under the procurement section above, it is
 expected that the large majority of bidding documents for the proposed project would be ready
 by September 30, 2010, for IDA no objection. Commitment of funds and initial disbursements
 can be expected shortly after Board approval and effectiveness. Key milestones for the
 implementation of contracts are provided in Annex 5.

 60.     Considering the high readiness for implementation the closing date of the proposed
 project is set to three years from expected effectiveness and will be January 31, 2014. A mid-
 term review is planned in 2012.

VI.     PROJECT RISKS AND MITIGATING MEASURES

 61.     The proposed EEP would enhance the economic impact of the MSWEIP in a number of
 ways. First, the majority of the Emergency Recovery Grant would be dedicated to increasing
 electricity supply during business hours allowing businesses to stay open and consume electricity
 at a considerably lower cost and higher quality than the alternative, self generation or complete
 lack of electricity supply. Secondly, part of the proposed financing would be dedicated to
 refurbishment of the country's key electricity infrastructure installations. Following 13 years of
 conflict and lack of maintenance, the poor state of the installed electricity infrastructure
 constitutes a substantial risk of prolonged technical outages if the installed base is not urgently
 rehabilitated. Complete or partial lack of power supply for prolonged periods would immediately
 cripple the Burundian economy and its attractiveness for investment.

 62.      Key project risks and mitigating measures are presented in Table 1 below. The overall
 risk after mitigation measures for the proposed EEP is rated Moderate as (i) its outcome is
 contingent on improvement of the sectors' governance and on GoB's commitment to restore the
 financial viability of REGIDESO (including the implementation of adequate cost recovery
 policies and the budgeting and timely payment of public bills); and (ii) it will be implemented in
 a fluid international environment with regard to energy prices. The risk exposure to fluctuating
 world petroleum prices will increase with the extension of the diesel power plant and will be
 mitigated by putting in place the fuel pass through mechanism allowing for quarterly tariff
 adjustments reflecting the cost of fuel purchases. IDA's experience in helping Sub-Saharan
 African (SSA) countries to overcome energy crises and developing efficient investment
 programs will be a critical mitigation factor, as well as the lessons drawn from the electricity and
 water supply portfolio regarding capacity building and performance improvement for national
 utilities.

                       Annex 1: Detailed Description of Project Components
                          BURUNDI: EMERGENCY ENERGY PROJECT

Burundi Background and Outlook

1.    Burundi is a small, landlocked country that straddles Central and East Africa, with a total
land area of 27,834 km2, and approximately 8.5 million inhabitants, about 10.6 percent of whom
live in urban areas. Burundi's frontiers are formed by natural borders, particularly Lake
Tanganyika, the Rusizi River in the west, and the Kagera and Kanyayru Rivers in the north.

2.    Burundi has emerged from a cycle of political-ethnic conflicts that lasted more than 13
years and claimed the lives of about 300,000 people while displacing about 1,200,000 people, or
about 16 percent of the population. The years of recurring conflict has had a devastating effect
on Burundi's economy. Burundi's per capita income fell by about 40 percent, from US$180 in
1993 to US$110 in 2007. In 2009 GDP per capita stands at US$111, making Burundi one of the
poorest countries in the world. A simple estimate of the cost of the war indicates that without the
conflict Burundi's GDP per capita would be about double its current level.8 Burundi is not likely
to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Nearly all social indicators have
sharply deteriorated as a result of the civil war. By most measures of health and human capital,
Burundi lags behind the world and other countries in the region. Among children less than five
years old, undernourishment reached 57 percent in 2000, but has improved in recent years. An
estimated 67 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line and the country
ranked towards the bottom of the Human Development Index in 2009.

3.    After about 25 years of protracted decline in GDP per capita, Burundi's economy is
beginning to experience positive growth with the gradual return of stability. Burundi's per capita
income in 2008 was at about one-ninth of the Sub-Saharan Africa average, roughly on par with
its 1975 income per capita level. Consolidation of the peace process has helped start
reconstruction and created positive prospects, but the country has not experienced the typical
post-conflict bounce in GDP growth, in large part due to periodic internal instability and a
generally poor investment climate linked to heavily dilapidated infrastructure.9 The agriculture
sector currently dominates Burundi's economy, representing 46 percent of GDP and providing
90 percent of the population with income and employment. Recent growth in the service sector,
which accounts for 37 percent of GDP is largely due to a rise in public services. Burundi's
industrial sector contributes to only 17 percent of GDP, however the construction industry has
shown considerable dynamism since 2001. The rate of growth of Burundi's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is projected to increase from an estimated 3.5 percent in 2009 to 4.8 percent in
2012. A strategy for the commercial and industrial development of Burundi suggests that
Burundi should focus on five main export subsectors in the short term, namely coffee, tea,
tourism, horticulture and mining.

  The lack of post-conflict rebound for Burundi is explained by the continued instability in the country, even after
the beginning of relative peace in 2001. This has had adverse consequences on the level of private investment
which, unlike that of neighbors like Rwanda, remains low. The difference in growth performance between Burundi
and Rwanda five years after the end of conflict can be almost completely attributed to differences in private
investment.

4.    The Government of Burundi has requested CRW financing to fight the adverse economic
and social impacts of the global financial crisis on the country's fragile post-conflict economy.
Compared to similar post-conflict economies, Burundi has not been able to attract private sector
investment capital and spur non-farm growth to the extent needed to fuel a strong economic
recovery. The impact of the global financial crisis should be seen in the context of a prolonged
set of sustained economic shocks during 2008-2009 affecting the country's growth prospects and
recovery, starting with the effect from the Kenya post election violence on the country's cost of
imports, the large oil price fluctuations and the rapid increase in agricultural commodity prices.
Looking forward, the continued global economic slowdown is likely to affect Burundi further
through declining international aid, as donor countries are likely to cut back assistance to
developing countries due to budgetary constraints; delayed private sector investments; and
reduction in migrant remittances. To reduce the dependence on increasingly volatile commodity
prices and external aid, Burundi would need to rapidly improve the conditions for private sector
investment, starting in the Bujumbura capital area. Provision of an adequate electricity supply at
competitive prices can be considered as one of the core pillars of this strategy as identified in the
December 2009 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). In a recent survey of Burundian
businesses 72 percent of the respondents rated poor access and reliability of electricity supply as
the primary constraint to new investment and growth.

Sector Background

5.    During the years of civil conflict, the electricity access rate in connected areas halved as the
urban population doubled, while the number of REGIDESO's customers remained barely
unchanged. Less than two percent of the country's households currently have access to electricity
services. The average annual electricity consumption in Burundi is among the lowest in Africa,
with only 23 kWh per capita.

6.    With the prevailing supply constraints, highly limited electricity access, dilapidated power
infrastructure and expected electricity demand growth, the GoB's power sector strategy in the
short to medium terms consists in (i) increasing thermal (petroleum based) electricity generation
capacity to stem the immediate supply deficit; (ii) develop national hydro power resources as
well as other renewable energy resources able to replace thermal base load power production in
3-4 years; (iii) complete the rehabilitation of the national power grid and distribution services so
badly damaged during the conflict to establish a base for sustainable electricity access expansion;
and (iv) strengthen REGIDESO's financial and operational performance by introducing cost
reflective tariffs, debt restructuring, performance based management and technical assistance for
commercial operations, including the introduction of pre-payment meters to reduce losses.

7.       The main organizations involved in the supply of electricity and water for Burundi are:

     ·        REGIDESO, a public water and power utility with autonomous judicial and financial
              status that operates under the supervision of MWEM;
     ·        DGHER (Direction Générale de l'Hydraulique et des Energies Rurales), also an
              autonomous entity operating under MWEM's tutelage and responsible for the
              provision of electricity and water in rural areas.




                                                  22
      ·       SINELAC, the Société Internationale des Pays des Grands Lacs, was established by
              Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo to operate the Ruzizi II
              regional hydro power plant.

 Status of Burundi's Power Generation, Distribution and Transmission Facilities

 8.    Hydro Power Plants: Electricity in Burundi is almost exclusively generated through seven
 main hydroelectric power plants with a domestic installed capacity of 32.2 MW. These domestic
 hydro power plants are mainly managed by REGIDESO, only 1.6 MW of smaller hydro plants
 are managed by DGHER. As shown in Table 2 below, the large majority of Burundi's power
 production stems from two main hydro power plants: (i) the Rwegura hydro power plant with an
 installed capacity of 18 MW and (ii) the Mugere with an installed capacity of 8 MW
 respectively. Burundi's electricity production includes electricity imports of about 85 GWh per
 year from two regional hydro power plants: (i) Ruzizi I operated by SNEL and (ii) Ruzizi II
 operated by SINELAC. Burundi's power generation currently depends to about 95 percent on
 hydro power generation, thus making the country highly vulnerable to droughts. During the
 2004-2006 regional droughts REGIDESO's hydro power production plummeted to 137 GWh per
 year, representing a 35 percent decrease compared to the 2009 supply level. The total annual
 supply of electricity increased slightly from 188.8 GWh in 2007 to 208 GWh in 2009 due to
 rehabilitation of some of the smaller hydro plants as well as increased thermal generation from
 the Bujumbura diesel power plant. The reliability of Burundi's power system is furthermore
 adversely affected by the persistent lack of funds for the maintenance of both national and
 regional power plants, thus risking extended outages of hydro power plants and the connecting
 networks.

 9.    Thermal Power Plant in Bujumbura: REGIDESO also owns a 5.5 MW diesel power
 plant acquired in 1995, which up to 2009 had been mostly idle (only 1,000 hours of use) due to


                                                   23
the lack of funds to pay for the fuel. The average cost of thermal (diesel) electricity is
approximately US$ 0.35/kWh, while the average sale price was FBu 88.5 per kWh (about US$
0.075 per kWh) in 2009. The Bujumbura thermal power plant has been used as back-up in case
of hydro power production failure. More recently, and in the face of the increasing supply deficit,
the Government of Burundi has requested funds from the IDA MSWEIP to finance fuel subsidies
adequate for eight hours of operations during five days per week to support the business sector
while longer term supply options are being developed. The Bujumbura plant started regular
operations in September 2009 following a complete technical overhaul and O&M training of
REGIDESO staff and is scheduled to produce 11 GWh during the first year of operation.

10. Transmission and Distribution System: During the years of conflict much of the
transmission system (especially 110 and 70 kV switchgear equipment) was damaged by technical
malfunction and in some cases direct hostilities. Spare parts are not available for a majority of
the installed equipment, as much of the switchgear equipment has long since been phased out
from manufacturing. Repairs of key switchgear have instead been made by stripping parts from
stand-by equipment for needed seals, gaskets, etc. This move has enabled REGIDESO to re-
establish the needed functionality of the transmission system but will not sustain the system for
more than a short period of time.

11. The distribution system is in equally poor condition, with much of the essential switchgear
beyond repair due to limited availability of spare parts and lack of resources for maintenance.
Key load centers such as Bujumbura are already heavily saturated, resulting in increased
technical losses and poor quality of supply. Some of the outages are due to the lack of spinning
reserve and the high dependence on regional generation resources that offer little flexibility to
bridge sudden supply interruptions.

12. The control, protection and communication equipment are also severely dilapidated and
does not permit the utility to operate even the simplest maneuvers without manual intervention.
Lack of adequate earthing systems and protection functions are causing occasional high voltage
surges (up to 1.73 times nominal voltage) with destroyed consumer equipment and appliances as
a result. The limited functionality of key relays result in more frequent and longer lasting outages
and damage to transformers and other equipment.

13. The quality of electricity services is thus insufficient, with an estimated 43 GWh in
combined technical and non technical losses for 2009, representing 20.5 percent of total supply.
Technical losses make up a large portion of these losses given the poor condition of the
electricity network, high voltage and medium voltage stations, and low voltage distribution
posts. The number of power interruptions is high both on low voltage and on high/medium
voltage backbone networks. The quality of the electricity that is delivered also suffers from poor
frequency and significant voltage deviations, estimated to be greater than network voltage
standards require (larger than 10 percent below and above the nominal value of 220 Volts).

Supply Demand Gap and 2009/2010 Electricity Crises

14. Burundi has experienced a deepening electricity supply crisis in 2009 resulting in large
scale and systematic load-shedding with severe effects on the country's post-conflict economic
recovery. The fast growing power supply deficit is due to a combination of several factors
including: (i) lack of investments in the country's hydro power generation capacity during the
last 15 years; (ii) rapidly increasing power demand in the Bujumbura capital area (further
increased by the REGIDESO's electricity access program for new connections); (iii) less than
expected rainfall during the September 2008 to May 2009 rainy season; (iv) degradation of the
catchment area upstream of main hydro power plants due to deforestation and increased land
usage during the years of conflict; (v) high technical and commercial losses in the electricity
distribution network and (vi) failure to operate the existing (yet limited) thermal capacity due to
lack of funds for fuel purchase, poor maintenance and lack of available spare parts. The supply
deficit and load-shedding was further reinforced during the June to September 2009 dry season
with the shortfall reaching approximately 40-50 percent of existing demand during peak hours.
The Government of Burundi responded to the crisis by ordering systematic load shedding, fast
tracking the re-forestation of the main hydro power plant catchment areas and most importantly,
using IDA funds to procure additional diesel fuel to operate the existing 5.5 MW Bujumbura
thermal power plant.

15. During the rainy season in October 2009 to May 2010, the electricity supply has improved,
due to higher than normal levels of rainfall further reinforced by the start of daytime power
generation at the Bujumbura thermal power plant. It is however likely that the improvement will
only be temporary as the demand continues to increase and would soon outstrip even theoretical
generation capacity levels (see Figures 1, 2 and 3). The newly constructed cement plant and the
plant making steel re-bars for the construction sector have requested supply of an additional 3
MW and 2.5 MW respectively by mid 2011, representing more than 10 percent of national
supply capacity.

16. The next power supply crisis affecting large areas of the Bujumbura capital area occurred
during the summer of 2010. Scheduled general technical revision and O&M works at the 8 MW
Mugere hydro power plant, requiring to shut down the power plant for a period of about one
month starting in mid-August 2010, and unexpected technical problems in a key MV substation
in Bujumbura, mainly due to surcharges in the country's transmission system only 2 days after
the start of Mugure revision works, both resulted in unexpected outages and load shedding in
large parts of Bujumbura capital area for several days, adversely affecting the water supply,
hospitals, public services and households. To avoid another power supply crisis the GoB decided
to install 10 MW of rented thermal power supply for a period of 6 months, planned to deliver 4
additional hours of electricity supply per day for the Bujumbura capital area from September
2010 onwards.

17. As the economy improves, returning refugees re-establish themselves, and standards of
living increase, national electricity demand is likely to continue to increase between 8-12 percent
per year without accounting for any impact from a future access expansion program. With no
immediate relief from new power generation projects under construction, the power sector in
Burundi has little choice but to turn to thermal, diesel based generation for added power
generation and supply diversification, while waiting for the installation of new, less expensive
renewable energy sources such as small hydro power plants possible to be developed in the next
4-5 years. The supply deficit varies between approximately 11 MW during the wet season and
app. 26 MW during the dry season (See figure 2 and 3). This deficit may reach 21 MW and 36
MW respectively during the wet and dry seasons by 2014 (with the proposed 5 MW power plant
extension), at which point additional small scale hydro can be brought online. Large Hydro
power developments such as Kabu 16 (20 MW) and Rusumo Falls/Ruzizi III (regional) hydro
power plants can be expected to contribute to Burundi's power supply in 2017.

Regional Context

18. In the long-term, Burundi will rely on regional power generation to supply its domestic
market. A number of regional hydroelectric projects are being considered by the Government of
Burundi. However, the technical and especially the financial feasibility and the sources of
financing of these projects have yet to be confirmed.

19. Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Development will be located on the border between Rwanda
and Tanzania, close to Burundi, on the Kagera River, at a highway crossing between Rwanda
and Tanzania. The project is strategically placed in the region to: (i) strengthen the backbone
electricity transmission system, which is necessary for an equitable distribution of benefits from
regional power planning; and (ii) meet the new loads from the mines in the Kagera District,
Tanzania, that are being implemented. The power plant is estimated to have an installed capacity
of 60-80 MW with an estimated levelised tariff of US$0.10-0.14 per kWh. The project would
increase downstream flows in dry periods, and potentially improve the viability of the Kakono
hydro-project and the Kyaka irrigation project. The design would include a dam (around 15 m in
height, 472 million m3 in reservoir capacity, and 313 km2 in reservoir area). Current estimates
indicate that the full reservoir option would affect a large number of households through loss of
farmland or, to a smaller number, resettlement. The associated costs include the environmental
and social mitigation as well as local area development works. A power sharing agreement
between Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania will have to be negotiated.


                                               28
20. Ruzizi III Hydroelectric Development will be located on the Ruzizi River, which forms
the border between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, 25 km downstream (south)
of the outlet of Lake Kivu. The project would be located downstream of the Ruzizi I and II
existing plants, and flows would be nearly completely regulated by Ruzizi I operation of Lake
Kivu as a reservoir. The power plant is estimated to have an installed capacity of 145 MW with
an estimated levelised tariff of US$0.10 per kWh.

21. Kabu 16 Hydroelectric Development will be located on the Kaburantwa River 16 km
above confluence with Ruzizi, 50 km north of Bujumbura. The Kabu 16 hydro power station has
been identified in the Nile Basin Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SSEA) study
of regional power generation options to be among the most suitable sites to meet the region's
medium-term energy needs. The site has been designed for run-of-the-river operation. The
feasibility study done by Sogreah (1995) needs updating, including technical specifications and
bidding documents, as well as a thorough review of safeguard aspects such as an environmental
impact analysis and resettlement plan. The project would comprise a small conventional gravity
dam in the main river channel with live storage equal to two hours of plant output. Power
facilities would include intake above the dam, a 3,400 m of power tunnel and penstock, and a
two unit powerhouse with an installed capacity of 20 MW under a head of 191 m.

22. To support the development of larger regional energy resources, the Nile Basin Equatorial
Lakes Subsidiary has recently commissioned a study to strengthen the supply from DRC and
EAC through the following projects:

   ·       Voltage upgrade from 70 kV to 220 kV for the Burundi­DRC­Rwanda transmission
           line: This project would enable Burundi to benefit from power trading and regional
           transmission integration with the neighboring countries (including Uganda and Kenya
           when the planned transmission link is completed). The area around Kivu Lake
           represents a potential regional source of power generation both through the hydro
           potential on the Ruzizi River and the significant methane gas deposits in the Kivu
           Lake, currently being developed for power generation by Rwanda through a first 100
           MW Independent Power Producer (IPP) with an American developer.
   ·       Rusumo Falls Transmission links: The transmission line from the proposed Rusumo
           Falls Hydro Power station would, in addition to delivering Burundi's share of the
           generated capacity (estimated to 20+ MW), interconnect it with the national networks
           of Rwanda and Tanzania to enable further resource sharing and optimization.

Detailed Description of Project Components

23. The project will scale up the World Bank's assistance to the energy sector in Burundi to
alleviate some of the immediate effects of the global financial crisis on the country's fragile
economic growth and reduce risks of severe supply interruptions due to heavily dilapidated
electricity equipment and infrastructure. The proposed project will mainly scale-up the electricity
component of the MSWEIP and to address part of the financing shortfall stemming from cost
overruns in projects funded by other sector development partners.




                                                29
Component 1 - Extension of the Bujumbura Thermal Generation Plant (US$5 million)

24. To stem the short term supply deficit while lower cost hydro power resources are being
developed, the GoB has requested assistance to increase the country's thermal generation
capacity. The proposed project would finance the procurement and installation of an additional 5
MW of thermal generating capacity to the existing diesel-fueled 5.5 MW Bujumbura thermal
power plant, thus leading to a total power plant capacity of 10.5 MW. The relatively long period
of the projected power supply deficit in Burundi (see above, Figures 1-3) and the continuous
need for thermal power generation during the dry season for at least the next 6-8 years makes
diesel-fueled rental power production prohibitively expensive (see Annex 9). As REGIDESO has
proven operational and maintenance capability in running the existing 5.5 MW Bujumbura
thermal power plant, an extension of the utility owned and operated power plant with strong
manufacturer maintenance support is the preferred option.

25. Considering the country's emergency situation, it is proposed to invest in high speed diesel
engines with 1,500 rotations per minute (rpm) that offer the advantage of lower initial purchase
price and quicker installation compared to medium speed and heavy fuel oil (HFO) based
engines, but in return have a slightly shorter lifetime during continuous operation 24 hours per
day. The proposed engine technology would allow REGIDESO (i) to operate the extended
Bujumbura thermal generation plant during the next 3-4 years as day-load capacity to support
electricity demand during business and evening hours, and (ii) to be scaled down in the medium
term to dry season use and back-up functionality as lower cost hydro generation resources will
come on-line. A financial analysis of various technology options for the extension of the
Bujumbura power plant as well as rental production can be found in Annex 9. The team is in
discussion with bilateral development partners to explore possibilities of parallel co-financing of
this component.

26. The proposed investment in high speed (1,500 rpm) diesel engines which offer the
advantages of:

           Suitability to the Burundi power supply emergency need due to the fact that the
           power plant will be commissioned significantly quicker than other alternatives;
           Lower initial purchase price compared to medium speed diesel and HFO based
           engines;
           Facility of operation and ease of maintenance.
           These advantages outweigh the slightly shorter life time at continuous operation and
           less robustness compared to low/medium speed engines.

27. In addition to the procurement of high speed diesel engines, associated electromechanical
equipments and critical spare parts, the installation of an accurate fuel metering system will be
included in the tender to ensure a good management of fuel as the fuel consumption represents
more than 85 percent of the electricity generation cost.




                                                30
Component 2 - Rehabilitation of Hydro Power Plants (US$ 3 million)

28. As Burundi emerges from conflict most of the country's electricity generation assets are in
urgent need of rehabilitation to ensure continued operation and power supply. It is evident, with
the country's current energy crisis, that any break-down in the power production of the hydro
plants would result in additional limitations to the country's already severely constrained
electricity supply with resulting negative effects on the economy and growth prospects. Most of
these main hydro power plants are equipped with more than 20 years old electrical and electronic
equipment for which there are today no available spare parts. Equally the mechanical and
electromechanical equipment (turbines, generators, etc.) are in dire need of technical overhaul
and refurbishment. The project therefore proposes to provide financing to replace outdated
electrical and mechanical equipment to ensure a continuous operation of the main hydro power
plants. These investments have been identified in a detailed study completed by REGIDESO
consultants10 and would modernize the operation of existing hydro power plants and significantly
reduce the risk of breakdowns due to dilapidated equipment.

29. This component would focus on the replacement of critical electro-mechanical equipments
of the 18 MW Rwegura and the 2 MW Nyemanga hydro power plants to increase their
reliability. It would include (i) the replacement or refurbishment of mechanical equipments,
among others, cooling system, and associated equipments (ii) the replacement or refurbishment
of electrical equipments such as alternators, control and regulation system, protection system,
medium voltage equipments and (iii) the procurement of spare parts. The implementation of the
activities under this component would guarantee the technical availability of the existing hydro
power plant outputs at their original performance and would prevent the country to further
increase investments in costly thermal generation.

Component 3 - Rehabilitation of Electricity Transmission and Distribution Network (US$1.25
million)

30. The project proposes to finance of priority rehabilitation works on the Bujumbura medium
voltage (MV) distribution system in an amount of US$1.25 million. These investments were
initially foreseen to be funded under the African Development Bank's Energy Infrastructure
Rehabilitation and Extension Project. Due to cost overruns in this AfDB project a financing gap
emerged for REGIDESO, risking not completing the envisaged urgent rehabilitation works of the
electricity transmission and distribution network. The proposed investments under the IDA
Emergency Energy Project will therefore include required rehabilitation works of key
transmission and distribution substations in the Bujumbura area (such as the main Bujumbura
substation: the RN1 substation). These investments will contribute to establish an upgraded
distribution voltage level (from the current 6 kV to 10 kV) to improve the quality of supply to
five recently connected neighborhoods in the Bujumbura capital area.

31. The proposed activities will include the replacement of an old 10 MVA 30/6,6 kV
transformer of the RN1 substation by a new 30/10 kV transformer with the same capacity. The
replacement of associated equipments such as MV cubicles, cables and auxiliaries would also be
included to allow REGIDESO to increase the quality of service.

                                               31
Component 4 ­ Pre-payment Meters (US$1.55 million)

32. As the cost of electricity production will increase with the extension of thermal generation,
REGIDESO will be under pressure to improve its revenue stream and reduce commercial losses.
To assist REGIDESO to better manage its billing and revenue flow, the ongoing MSWEIP is
financing the replacement of 15,000 meters scheduled to be installed during 2010. The remaining
15,000 meters were initially supposed to be funded by AfDB but had to be put on hold due to
lack of funds. It is therefore proposed to include financing for the second phase of REGIDESO's
pre-payment metering program under the proposed emergency electricity infrastructure
investment program. This investment would enable REGIDESO to improve its cash flow and
reduce the amount of billing arrears from public, commercial and household customers. Pre-paid
metering would also enable improved management of electricity consumption for REGIDESO's
customers and, especially for poorer households with limited and uncertain cash income, reduced
risk of power cuts.

Component 5 ­ Fuel Procurement and support to Project Management (US$3.75 million)

33. The project proposes to increase the diesel generating capacity at the Bujumbura thermal
power plant (from 5.5 to 10.5 MW) to scale up power production in Bujumbura during business
hours. The additional diesel production would increase Burundi's limited supply diversity, to
ensure a minimum of electricity services to power vital public services such as water supply and
hospitals, in the case of drought affecting the country's hydro power production representing 95
percent of supply.

34. The increase in thermal generation based on diesel fuel would, while stemming the power
supply deficit, dramatically increase the utility's electricity production costs. REGIDESO will
therefore need to mobilize significant additional revenues to make the operation of thermal
power plants economically and financially sustainable. The annual fuel cost required to operate
the Bujumbura thermal power plant with an extended capacity of 10.5 MW is estimated at
US$16 million per year. This would require a 140 percent surcharge to the current average
electricity tariff to allow REGIDESO to pay for fuel and maintenance costs to sustain the power
plant operation at a level equivalent to 12 hours per day. To reduce the immediate price impact
of increasing tariffs on already vulnerable small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) and the
general population, the project would accompany the financing of the extension of the generating
plant with a gradually declining subsidy of the operating cost.

35. During the 2009 dry season, the electricity crisis forced small and large businesses in
Burundi to prioritize the purchase of back-up generators and diesel fuel to keep their businesses
operating instead of investing in the long term growth of their enterprise. It is estimated that the
running cost of small diesel generators is approximately US$ 50 cents/kWh compared with the
current average grid tariff of US$ 8 cents/ kWh. With the proposed fuel procurement for thermal
electricity generation (additional to the remaining amount of US$3.5 million from the MSWEIP)
the average electricity tariff could be increased in steps over two year (reaching a total fuel
surcharge of approximately FBu 125 per kWh in 2012). The precise electricity tariff adjustment
levels, structure and timing will be determined in the recently launched electricity and water
tariff study, funded by the MSWEIP.



                                                32
36. The proposed component 5 also includes additional support to provide technical assistance
and strengthen the implementation capacity of REGIDESO, especially with regards to
procurement and contract supervision. The project would finance for a period as needed (i) an
international consultant to supervise the extension of the Bujumbura thermal generation plant;
(ii) an international consultant to supervise the rehabilitation works of hydro power plants; and
(iii) an additional procurement consultant with experience in the World Bank's procurement
guidelines and procedures (for a period of 6-9 months or as needed) to accelerate the processing
of large scale contracts under international competitive bidding procedures, and advice on
negotiations and tender evaluation.

Monitoring arrangements

1.    The REGIDESO PIU will be responsible for monitoring and will provide quarterly
progress reports on the project to REGIDESO's management and to the Bank. The REGIDESO
PIU has been established under the Bank-financed MSWEIP and has sufficient capacity to
compile a number of simple results indicators necessary to monitor progress, and each quarterly
report will provide a detailed update on these indicators. For ease of reporting, the format of the
report is simple and streamlined and builds on existing operational manuals. The indicators for
the proposed project are harmonized with the ongoing MSWEIP project, thus avoiding the
duplication of already existing indicators for energy sector activities. Both IDA financed projects
will therefore facilitate a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of REGIDESO's
performance.

2.    Based on the audit report of the performance management contract between REGIDESO
and GoB, most of the baseline data reflect REGIDESO's actual performance as of December
2009. Given the country's fragile, post-conflict environment, REGIDESO's data collection
capacity and quality has been assessed as weak in the last audit. Indicators that require very
accurate utility data, currently not available, and complex monitoring methodologies, currently
not established, have therefore been excluded for the ease of monitoring and reporting under the
proposed emergency operations. In the context of regular independent audits of the performance
management contract, World Bank supervision missions will ensure a close dialogue with
REGIDESO on strategies to improve the data collection and monitoring methodologies, and the
accuracy of performance indicators and target values.

3. The proposed EEP will achieve the following main outcomes:

            increased electricity generation capacity;
            improved transmission and distribution reliability; and
            improved revenue recovery of REGIDESO

        Direct project beneficiaries are estimated as follows: number of private clients (mainly households, but also including religious organisations, NGOs, small
     businesses) multiplied by an average householdsize of 6 people. In the end of 2009 REGIDESO served 45,000 private clients. It is projected that at least 2,000
     new private client connections will be achieved each year. Female project beneficiaries are estimated as 50% of total direct project beneficiaries.

                      BURUNDI: EMERGENCY ENERGY PROJECT

Executive Summary

1.    This Annex is a record of the results of the assessment of the existing financial
management arrangements at the project implementation unit (PIU) in preparation of the Burundi
Emergency Energy Project (EEP). The objective of the assessment is to determine whether: (i)
REGIDESO has maintained adequate financial management arrangements to ensure additional
funds will be used for purposes intended in an efficient and economical way; (ii) REGIDESO's
financial reports have been and will be prepared in an accurate, reliable and timely manner; (iii)
arrangements exist for an independent audit of the sources and uses of funds; and (iv) the
entities' assets are being safeguarded.

2.   The financial management (FM) assessment for this project was carried out in accordance
with the Financial Management Practices Manual issued by the Financial Management Sector
Board on January 2010.

3.    The supervision mission carried in January 2010 revealed that the risk assessment of the
existing financial management arrangements put in place by the PIU was rated as moderate.

Budgeting Arrangements

4. The budgeting arrangements are well documented in the updated/new procedures manual.
REGIDESO's budgeting arrangements are undertaken by the inspection (control) department and
will guide the PIU in the budgeting process. Budget analysis will be conducted to ensure budget
variances are addressed on an adequate and timely manner.

Accounting Arrangements

Books of Accounts

5.    For the purpose of this project, adequate books of accounts which shall include ledgers,
journals and the various registers will be maintained by the PIU's FM unit. The accounting
system already developed in the Financial Management Manual will be used to track, record,
analyze and summarize its financial transactions and adequately capture those of the
implementing agencies. The PIU's accounts will be prepared on a cash basis in accordance with
the finance agreement, the laws and regulations in Burundi and best accounting practice. The
accounting system will allow for the proper recording of project's financial transactions,
including the allocation of expenditures in accordance with its components, disbursement
categories, and sources of funds. Appropriate controls over the preparation and approval of
transactions should be put in place to ensure that all transactions are correctly made, recorded,
and reported upon.




                                               39
Staffing arrangements

6.  REGIDESO has hired a qualified accountant/FMS to strengthen the FM unit of the PIU.
However the overall responsibility for finance will remain of the Director of Finance.

7.   The Director of Finance will be responsible for approving payments to contracted service
providers, suppliers of equipment and goods, and implementing agencies and for submitting
consolidated financial monitoring and audited financial statements to IDA.

Information systems

8.    REGIDESO currently uses TOMPRO accounting software under the Bank-financed
MSWEIP which will allow the PIU to manage more than one financing agreement. The PIU will
use the same software to maintain the books of the EEP.

Financial Reporting and Monitoring

9.   The PIU has been submitting the Interim Financial Reports on a quarterly basis for review
to ensure that they provide quality and timely information to the PIU and various stakeholders
monitoring the project's performance. A single IFR will be submitted and will comprise:

       Sources and uses of funds statement; and
       Uses of funds by project activity.

10. The accounting policies and procedures adopted and notes to the financial statements will
be disclosed in the report.

Audit Arrangements

11. The recruitment process of an independent external auditor for the MSWEIP has been
finalized and the auditing work is being done. The initial audit report was submitted to the World
Bank on June 23, 2010. The EEP audit arrangements will follow the same arrangements as set
for the MSWEIP.

Internal Control and Internal Audit

Internal Controls

12. The project internal controls have been documented in a newly developed Project
Implementation Manual (PIM) complemented with a Financial Management Manual (FMM).
The accounting systems, policies and procedures employed by the PIU to account for and to
manage project funds have thus been documented in the PIU's updated PIM and FMM. The
accounting policies specify the accounting treatment for the PIU financial transactions and
constitute basic principles designed to ensure that the accounting records are complete, relevant
and reliable and that accounting practices are followed consistently.




                                               40
13. The EEP internal controls will be based on the existing PIM and FMM developed by the
PIU for the activities of the MSWEIP.

Internal Auditor

14. The Internal Auditor will review the financial monitoring reports and will carry out regular
internal audit controls. These controls will include ex post verification of expenditure eligibility,
as well as physical inspection of works and goods acquired during the implementation of the
project. The findings and recommendations of the Internal Auditor will be used by REGIDESO
to improve PIU's implementation in areas related to financial management and procurement. The
internal audit capacity will however need to be strengthened under the project's capacity
strengthening component to enable it achieve efficient quality work and reporting.

Disbursements arrangements and methods

Bank Account

15. A separate Designated Account (DA) dominated in US dollars will be opened in
commercial bank acceptable to IDA for the purposes of implementing the Emergency Recovery
Grant.

16.   Monthly bank reconciliation will be carried out by the appropriate designated personnel.

17. Account signatories as documented in the Financial Management Manual (FMM) by
defining the positions of those authorized as signatories will remain the same for this Emergency
Recovery Grant.

Funds Flow: IDA and Counterpart Funds

Initial Advance and Other Disbursement Methods

18. Upon grant effectiveness, IDA will make an initial advance (Advance method) from the
proceeds of the grant by depositing it into the borrower's designated account (DA) opened in a
commercial bank under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The DA ceiling is US$1.2
million which has been calculated to represent four months of eligible local project expenditures.
Actual expenditure of goods and services will be reimbursed (reimbursement method) through
submission of withdrawal applications and against statements of expenditures(SOEs) which will
be prepared and approved in accordance with the Financial Management Manual. The direct
payment method, whereby the IDA may send payments directly to a third party for eligible
expenditures at the Recipient's request supported with records evidencing eligible expenditures
(e.g., copies of receipts, supplier invoices) is also offered as a disbursement option. Another
acceptable method of withdrawing proceeds from the IDA grant proceeds is the special
commitment method whereby IDA may pay amounts to a third party for eligible expenditures

Use of Statement of Expenditures

20. Disbursements for all expenditures under components of the project would be made against
full documentation, except for the following items of expenditures: (i) contracts for goods in an
amount inferior to US$150,000; (ii) contracts for works in an amount inferior to US$200,000;
(iii) contracts for consulting firms in an amount inferior to US$100,000 equivalent per contract;
and contracts for individual consultants in an amount below US$50,000 equivalent per contract,
as well as all operating costs, which would be claimed on the basis of Statement of Expenditures
(SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained at the PIU within
REGIDESO to be readily available for review by periodic IDA supervision missions and internal
and external auditors.

21. IDA will have the right to suspend disbursements should the Recipient fails to comply with
reporting requirements specified in the Financing Agreement.

Supervision plan

22. Given the Moderate risk rating associated with existing FM arrangements, two on-site
supervision visits will be conducted each year to commensurate with the risk levels. The
objective of the supervision missions will be to ensure that strong financial management systems
are maintained for the grant throughout the life of the project. Reviews will be carried out
regularly to ensure that expenditures incurred by PIU remain eligible for IDA funding. The
Implementation Status and Result Report will include a Financial Management rating for the FM
component and will be arrived at by the Financial Management Specialist after an appropriate
review.

                      BURUNDI: EMERGENCY ENERGY PROJECT

A.     General

1.      Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's « Guidelines : Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credit », dated May 2004,
revised October 2006 and May 2010, and « Guidelines : Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, » dated May 2004, revised October 2006 and May 2010
; Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD
Loans and IDA Credit and Grants, dated October 15, 2006 and the Board approved modifications
as stipulated in the Financing Agreement. The general description of various items under
different expenditure categories are described below. For each contract to be financed by the
Emergency Recovery Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods,
the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are
agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan. The
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

2.      Procurement of Works: Works procured under this project will include the
rehabilitation of power plants and networks. Works estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$3,000,000 or more would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB).
Works estimated to cost more than US$100,000 up to the equivalent of US$3,000,000 will be
procured through National Competitive bidding (NCB) in accordance with the provisions of
paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of the Guidelines for procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
above mentioned. Small works estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract
up shall be procured on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three qualified contractors
in response to a written invitation. The written invitation will include a description of the works,
basic technical specifications, completion date and if necessary the plan of the works. The
Project Implementation Manual (PIM) will furnish the standard bidding document to be used for
NCB and shopping.

3.      Procurement of Goods: Goods to be procured under this grant will include fuel,
lubricants and essential parts for existing plants, and networks. Goods to be procured would also
include high speed diesels generators and pre-payment meters. The above mentioned goods will
be procured through a combination of the following procurement methods: (a) international
competitive bidding for contracts estimated to cost more than US$500,000 equivalent; (b)
national competitive bidding for contracts of valued at more than US$50,000 equivalent but less

   B. Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to implement Procurement

6.      Procurement under this project will maintain existing procurement arrangements for
Bank-financed MSWEIP. REGIDESO will continue to be responsible for the implementation
and supervision of the project. REGIDESO established a project implementation unit (PIU)
under the MSWEIP, which is fully operational and conducts the daily tasks of project
implementation including procurement activities. The PIU operates under the oversight of the
General Manager of REGIDESO and includes the following key staff: (i) a project coordinator;
(ii) an electrical or hydraulic engineer; (ii) a second engineer (electrical/hydraulic); (iii) a
financial management specialist and certified accountant; (iv) a procurement specialist and (v) a
social and environmental specialist. The PIU will use consultants when needed to accomplish
certain specific tasks, such as technical execution studies, preparation of bidding documents, the
receipt of goods and equipments and the supervision and receipt of works.

7.      An assessment of the capacity of the PIU to implement procurement actions for the
project has been carried out in February 2008. The assessment reviewed the organizational
structure of REGIDESO, and the interaction between staff responsible for procurement in the
implementing unit, the Ministry of Water, Energy and Mines (MWEM) and the Ministry of
Finance. The assessment revealed that procurement capacity of REGIDESO was limited mainly
because this institution did not get the opportunity to procure works or goods using Bank


                                               45
procedures or similar procedures over the last ten years. The number and the value of contracts
managed by REGIDESO using its own procedures over the last ten years are also modest due to
the lack of resources.

8.      The major issues concerning procurement activities for project implementation have been
identified and it was also agreed to undertake other measures aimed at minimizing procurement
risks, including: (i) the PIM would include the standard bidding document for NCB, Shopping
and model of evaluation report; (ii) the creation of filing and monitoring systems for
procurement activities to be followed by REGIDESO and its PIU; and (iii) conducting a yearly
technical audit.

9.      Although it was agreed to use REGIDESO staff as much as possible to better ensure
sustainability, based on the findings of the procurement capacity assessment it was deemed
necessary to hire consultant services on time-basis contracts for specific tasks in order to
strengthen the capacity of REGIDESO and reduce the risk. The objective of the consultant
assignment would be two-fold: (i) to produce and review the bidding documents considered
complex or critical; and (ii) to train REGIDESO staff and PIU staff in procurement planning and
the whole procurement process. Technical assistance and training for procurement aspects would
be established based on the findings of the technical audit that will be conducted and the finding
of prior and post review to be conducted by IDA.

                      BURUNDI: EMERGENCY ENERGY PROJECT

1. REGIDESO will be responsible for the implementation and supervision of the project. An
implementation supervision committee has been established under the original project,
comprising the General Manager of REGIDESO, its directors, and a representative of the
Ministry of Water, Energy and Mines (MWEM). This committee will be charged with providing
overall guidance to the project to ascertain the project results, ensure coordination of the project
with the country's overall electrification and water service improvement programs (including the
MSWEIP), and ensure that the main beneficiaries' expectations are met.

2. REGIDESO established a project implementation unit (PIU), which conducts the daily tasks
of project implementation and periodic assessment of its progress. The PIU operates under the
direction of the General Manager of REGIDESO and includes the following professional
profiles:

           A project coordinator who is also an electrical or hydraulic engineer
           A hydraulic engineer
           An electrical engineer
           A financial management specialist and certified accountant
           A procurement specialist
           A social and environmental safeguards specialist
           An administrative assistant

3. The REGIDESO PIU is receiving collaborative support from existing REGIDESO focal
staff, such as electrical engineers and hydraulic engineers and a billing and collections manager,
to monitor the corresponding project sub-components. The PIU is using consultants when
necessary to accomplish certain specific tasks such as technical execution studies, preparation of
bidding documents, the receipt of goods and equipments, and the control and receipt of works.

4. The PIU will oversee the execution of the project components and corresponding contracts
for works and services. It will prepare quarterly progress reports for IDA and the Monitoring
Committee, including detailed comments on the execution of the project. These will highlight
project achievements but also provide detailed description of any difficulties encountered and
how these are being addressed. The PIU will facilitate the coordination between the contractors,
consultants and any public entity or service related to the project.

5. The PIU is also responsible for the project financial management and for the preparation of
project financial reports. It will ensure that all project activities are performed, and quarterly
progress reports and annual financial audits submitted, in a timely manner. The PIU is
maintaining a separate accounting of assets generated by the project, which will only be merged
with REGIDESO's assets at the end of the project.




                                                48
6. REGIDESO's PIU will be responsible for the implementation of the project's safeguard
frameworks (ESMF and RPF). The PIU builds on experienced staff, including an experienced
environmental and social specialist who will be responsible for managing safeguards issues as
and when they arise during project implementation. Consultants will be engaged to prepare
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) or
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) as and when necessary. Capacity building sessions
will be provided by the team or consultants to insure smooth implementation and safeguards
compliance. As for the complimentary MSWEIP, all safeguard aspects in the context of the
proposed emergency electricity infrastructure investment program will continue to be part of
REGIDESO's project progress reports.

Potential indirect and/or long-term impacts

2. The proposed project falls into environmental category B as no adverse long term impacts are
anticipated. The project is expected to positively impact the beneficiary communities and
individuals in a number of ways. The rehabilitation of electricity infrastructure will not only
improve the way of life of the people in terms of having improved access to electricity, but will
also serve as the basis for their social and economic empowerment and reduction in poverty
levels. More importantly, the project is determined to avoid as much as possible, relocation
issues.

3. The proposed project is fully aligned with and complimentary to the IDA financed Multi-
Sectoral Water and Electricity Infrastructure Project (MSWEIP), under implementation since
2008 that finances investments in the electricity and water supply and distribution systems as
well as a comprehensive capacity building program for REGIDESO and the Ministry of Water,
Energy and Mines (MWEM).

4. All emergency electricity infrastructure activities proposed under the project are very similar
to activities currently implemented under the electricity component of the complimentary, IDA-
financed MSWEIP, focusing mainly on the rehabilitation of existing electricity infrastructure. No
long term adverse impacts of electricity infrastructure activities were identified in the
Environmental and Social Assessment Instruments prepared, approved and disclosed under the
MSWEIP in 2008. Both safeguard frameworks were re-disclosed under the proposed project.
The "in-country" re-disclosure of the safeguard frameworks will take place on September 15,


                                               51
2010, after these documents were re-submitted to the World Bank's Infoshop on August 30,
2010. The proposed project will build on these two safeguard instruments currently being
implemented by REGIDESO's PIU: the Environment and Social Management Framework
(ESMF), and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). Provisions under these frameworks will
guide the implementation of emergency electricity infrastructure activities under the proposed
project.

5. The proposed project will not fund activities that would cause an adverse effect on the
environment or any form of land acquisition or restriction of access to sources of livelihoods.
The potential environmental and social impacts of the proposed project activities are expected to
be small-scale and site-specific; and thus easily remediable typical of category B projects. The 5
MW expansion of the existing thermal power plant can be done inside the existing engine hall of
the power plant and easily kept within the confines of the current REGIDESO industrial plot
perimeter. The new engines are likely to be less noisy than the existing ones currently under
operation and no additional noise pollution is expected. Therefore only minor environmental
impacts could be expected from the installation activities and site works, similar to the impact of
the subcomponent for substation rehabilitation covered within the existing safeguard framework.
The rehabilitation works proposed for the two hydro power plants does not concern the existing
dam structure (no civil works) additional hydro power related safeguard policies such as safety
of dams and international waterways are not triggered by the investments proposed under the
additional financing. During supervision the task team will pay special attention to dam safety
aspects.

6. Where project activities will potentially impact negatively on people living and/or working
on or near the project areas, the procedures as described in the existing RPF will become
applicable. Accordingly, people will be compensated and/or resettled for any loss that they may
incur due to project activities. Likewise, no project activities will be implemented until a
resettlement action plan (RAP) has been prepared, approved of (by the GoB as well as by the
World Bank) and disclosed.

Measures taken by the Borrower to address safeguard issues and borrower's implementation
capacity

7. Prior to appraisal of the complimentary MSWEIP, the borrower prepared an Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for
the purpose of identifying and mitigating potential negative environmental and social impacts at
the sub-project planning and implementation stage. The two safeguard instruments are currently
implemented, after review and approval by World Bank safeguard specialists and disclosure in-
country on February 6, 2008, and at the Bank's on February 21, 2008.

8. The ESMF outlines the environmental and social screening process for sub-projects and
proposes capacity building measures, including cost estimates. The ESMF includes (i) an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP); (ii) environmental guidelines for contractors; and (iii)
environmental and social checklists for sub-projects screening.

9. The RPF provides the overarching framework by which potential resettlement issues will be
addressed. The RPF outlines the policies and procedures to be followed in the event that sub-


                                                52
projects require land acquisition. In cases where resettlement is unavoidable, the project will rely
on the RFP and RAPs mechanisms for ensuring that the relocation and resettlement is done in
accordance with the Burundi and the Bank safeguards policies in consultation with key
stakeholders.

10. REGIDESO's project implementation unit (PIU) will be responsible for the implementation
of the ESMF and RPF. The PIU is already operational and builds on experienced staff, including
an experienced environmental and social specialist who will be responsible for managing
safeguards issues as and when they arise during project implementation. Consultants will be
engaged to prepare Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and Environmental Management Plans
(EMPs) or Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) as and when necessary. Capacity building
sessions will be provided by the team or consultants to insure smooth implementation and
safeguards compliance.

11. A supervision mission of World Bank safeguard specialists in May 2009 evaluated
REGIDESO's safeguard implementation capacity under the MSWEIP and proposed the
following main measures to strengthen future safeguard implementation: (i) conduct a campaign
to disseminate ESMF and RPF in the local language; (ii) establish a work program for PIU's
safeguard specialist; (iii) promote partnerships with project partners, including the Ministry of
Environment and a HIV/AIDS program; and (iv) establish a safeguard capacity building and
training plan. All measures proposed during the safeguard supervision mission were satisfactory
implemented by REGIDESO's PIU by June 2010, except a delay in the safeguard capacity
building and training plan. This plan is currently being prepared with the help of a consultant.
Due to delays in the procurement processes for infrastructure investment components under the
MSWEIP, no sub-project related safeguard instruments were prepared to date.

                               Annex 9: Economic and Financial Analysis
                          BURUNDI: EMERGENCY ENERGY PROJECT

Economic analysis of the proposed project: Economic rate of return

1. The proposed project offers the prospect of high economic returns to the economy of
Burundi, which is suffering from inadequate electricity supply. Lack of power has severely
affected the commercial and industrial sector, with adverse consequences on employment,
exports and prospects for growth. The services rendered by REGIDESO have been inadequate
and declining during the years of crisis due to insufficient investment and neglected
maintenance. Resource constraints meant that REGIDESO was not in a position to either extend
service or to increase its generating capacity in a timely, least-cost manner despite the country's
ample hydroelectric potential. These issues are all being addressed under the five-year
investment program for the electricity sector.

2. Given the diverse nature of the physical investments envisaged as part of the program, the
economic analysis is based on a five-year period (2009-2013) within the electricity sector's total
investment program, which has been reviewed and found to be least-cost in nature (see Table
10). Assigning specific benefits to particular project components in such a rehabilitation
program would have been both arbitrary and nearly impossible.

3. The physical benefits from these investments that have been quantified stem from the
incremental electricity supplied to consumers following increased generation and expected
reduction of technical losses from rehabilitation of the severely dilapidated network (Table 11).
Benefits from improved reliability and quality of service have not been quantified in the
economic analysis and represents added benefits brought by the project. The base case estimate
of the EIRR is 17.7 percent.

4. Burundi is expected to face continuing capacity constraints during the period of the
investment program. The analysis is therefore based on the assumption that the limited additional
supply made available will be fully consumed, as it will essentially reduce the active load-
shedding16 done by REGIDESO. Total electricity supply is projected to increase from about 189
GWh in 2008 to 298 GWh in 2012, equivalent to an annual average increase of 6 percent.

5. The minimum economic benefit of the incremental sales has been estimated by assuming
recipients in two categories: (i) the productive sector that is currently using captive diesel
generators (the alternative cost is an estimated US$ 0.35 per kWh; the average cost of running
the Bujumbura thermal power plant); and (ii) connected households that increase their
consumption due to reduced load-shedding, the benefits have been valued at the average tariff
across all customer categories charged by REGIDESO in 2009, i.e., US$ 0.08 per kWh. The
added supply is assumed to be distributed evenly between the two groups.

6. Details of the analysis and the parameters used in estimating the EIRR are given in the tables
below. The EIRR is particularly sensitive to variations in investment cost, delays in completing
generation investments, and to assumptions regarding reductions in technical losses. As can be
seen from Table 10, the EIRR varies from 15 percent to 19 percent, depending on the
combination of negative factors assumed.

Comparative analysis of additional thermal generation for Bujumbura plant

7. Increased thermal (petroleum based) generation for continuous operation can essentially be
made in three main categories, (i) low speed engines using Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO); (ii) medium
speed (1,000 rpm) diesel engines; and (iii) high speed (1,500 rpm) diesel engines. The
installation of high speed diesel engines has been assessed as the most appropriate option to
address Burundi's short term emergency power supply needs. The factors considered in the
assessment of options are as follows:

       Investment cost: The fuel investment cost of a high speed engine is about 50 percent less
       expensive compared to medium speed engines. In turn the medium speed engine is
       slightly more fuel efficient.



                                              57
       Manufacturing and Installation time: A high speed generator with a standard
       specification is in many cases available in stock from leading manufacturers and if it is
       not the case, it can be manufactured within six months. Transport and on-site installation
       is significantly faster and less costly compared to medium speed diesel engines.
       Fuel logistics: HFO engines require to be run with Light Fuel Oil (LFO) during the start
       up and before shutting down the engines. In this case, fuel supply and storage capacity
       for two fuels (HFO and LFO) needs to be considered. Given that Burundi has no existing
       HFO plants, the price difference between the HFO and the LFO delivered in the country
       would not be significant. Therefore HFO is not considered as the best fuel option.
       Capacity and flexibility of operations: Containerized HFO generator sets available on
       the market have an average output power starting from about 4 MW. Medium and high
       speed engines offer more flexibility in terms of operation, as smaller capacities below 1
       MW are available, allowing to operate several engines in parallel.
       Life time: Depending on the running hours, the average lifetime of a high speed prime
       power generator is approximately ten years. This is suitable for four to five years of
       interim operation envisaged in Burundi while waiting for the realization of longer term
       and lower cost generation projects. Then, for the second five years, the power plant can
       be used as a standby application especially during the dry season and during the
       maintenance period of hydro power plants.

8. Three scenarios can be considered for the extension of the Bujumbura thermal power plant.
These scenarios are summarized in Table 14 below and discussed in detail in the next
paragraphs.

               (existing
               5.5 MW)
  Scenario 2   5           84          45            15.3 Million     125           140
  Scenario 3   10          84          67            22.5 million     167           200

       Scenario 1: Maximizing the energy production of the existing Bujumbura thermal
       power plant of 5.5 MW: This option aims to increasing the running hours of the existing
       plant from 8 h/5days to 16 h/7days during three years (2010 to 2012). The energy
       production per year of the thermal generation would increase from 11 GWh to 30.8 GWh.
       The equivalent in tariff increase (fuel pass trough cost) is about FBu 90.0 per kWh that
       represents 101.2 percent increase of the current electricity tariff. This scenario would
       enable Burundi to nearly triple the energy produced but it would not add to the power
       capacity and would thus not be able to reduce the supply demand capacity gap during
       peak hours with continued load shedding as a result.



                                              58
       Scenario 2: Adding new 5 MW diesel power plant ­ Increase in Energy production and
       available capacity while keeping investment cost and impact on tariffs lower. This
       scenario consists in installing new generator sets and operating both the existing and new
       plants 12h/7 days. The new plant will be operational starting 2011. The total energy
       production per year from 2011 onwards will increase from 11 GWh to 45 GWh, thus a
       fourfold increase in production from current levels. To recover the cost of fuel, the
       government would need to increase the tariff to FBu 125.00 per kWh, the equivalent of
       140 percent increase of the current tariff. This can be seen as a compromise solution
       where energy production is significantly higher and the capacity gap is reduced while the
       impacts on tariffs are lower than the 10 MW option. With a good production plan, the
       country can avoid power outages during the peak demand hours for most of the year and
       make well managed load shedding during the dry season.
       Scenario 3: Adding new 10 MW diesel power plant ­ Maximal energy production and
       capacity increase with high impact on tariff levels. The scenario aims to install new
       thermal generation and to operate both the existing and new plants 12 h/7 days. The new
       plant will start producing from 2011. The production will increase from 11 GWh to 67
       GWh. The option represents a tariff increase of about FBu 167.0 per kWh to be reached
       in 2012 (equivalent of 200 percent increase of the current electricity tariff.) The power
       peak demand will be satisfied during the wet season but the impact on the tariffs or
       demand for government subsidies would be very high. In summary, it will be difficult for
       the Burundian economy to afford this option in the short term.

Financial analysis of additional thermal generation for the Bujumbura thermal power
plant: NPV comparison

9. When comparing the net present value of the proposed investment for the extension of the
Bujumbura thermal power plant (5 MW with high speed engines) with equivalent investment in
rental diesel engines, the net savings are estimated to US$8.4 million over five years. The same
comparison based on the expansion of existing thermal capacity with medium speed engines
show lower savings over a five year period (US$2.6 million) due to a longer installation time (24
months compared to 12 months for high speed engines). An additional third scenario was added
to compare the investment with an extension of the contract for the existing 10 MW rental plant
currently under installation for six months 4h/day service. The savings of the proposed extension
compared to this scenario has been estimated to US$ 4.0 million. A main cost factor is the price
of rental diesel capacity and the associated fuel consumption required under all discussed
scenarios. Detailed calculations and key assumptions are discussed below.




                                               59
10. Electricity imports from the surrounding region have not been considered to be an alternative
to domestic least-cost generation expansion as the transmission capacity for imports to Burundi
remain very limited. Even as the transmission links are built as part of the East Africa Power
Pool initiative, the ongoing energy crisis in the surrounding countries will likely limit their
ability to export significant amounts of low-cost power to Burundi during the next five year
period. Pricing and quantities of electricity available for regional trade remain therefore
uncertain.

11. The following tables will summarize the NPV comparison for the different scenarios for the
Bujumbura thermal power plant. The results of NPV comparision show that the proposed
investment in high speed engines to allow for a 5 MW extension of the Bujumbura thermal
power plant is the best option.

Financial analysis of REGIDESO

Summary of historical financials

12. A detailed financial analysis of REGIDESO has been carried out under the MSWEIP in
2008, based on REGIDESO's annual reports 2003-2006 and the annual operations report of the
Commercial Department for 2007. Under the MSWEIP REGIDESO improved its accounting and
financial management and an integrated accounting system was introduced. The MSWEIP also
included measures for helping REGIDESO improve its operating efficiency, in particular, the
installation of prepaid meters with a focus on government buildings, as well as reaching
agreement between government and REGIDESO on a financial restructuring plan and anchoring
both parties' obligations in a performance contract between them.

13. REGIDESO was technically bankrupt and a financial restructuring plan was developed to: (i)
in the short-term, restructure REGIDESO's balance sheet to provide an adequate capitalization
of the company's operations; and (ii) in the-medium-term, ensure the financial sustainability of
REGIDESO through cost-reflective tariffs, combined with efforts to improve its operating
efficiency. While REGIDESO's revenues have continuously increased since 2002, the utility
recorded deteriorating Earning Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization margins and
negative operating income from 2005 to 2008. Factors behind this development include
increasing equipment prices and increased personnel costs, among other issues. The government
is REGIDESO's largest debtor, as it pays its bills with a significant delay. Government
accumulated a total of FBu 11,914 million in arrears to REGIDESO by December 31, 2006,
including the arrears of government and government-related organizations. Significant arrears in
government entities to REGIDESO were causing significant arrears, in turn, by the utility to its

own suppliers and preventing it from carrying out necessary network rehabilitation and
maintenance to reduce technical and non-technical losses.

Financial Restructuring of REGIDESO by December 31, 2008

14. To restore REGIDESO's financial viability, the Burundian government agreed to restructure
REGIDESO by December 31, 2008, in a memorandum signed by the Minister of Economy,
Finance and Development Cooperation on April 7, 2008. The 2008 restructuring plan was based
on the following principles: (i) compensation of debts and accruals between the State and
REGIDESO; (ii) tripartite compensation between the state, SINELAC and REGIDESO to deal
with the arrears of the latter; (iii) an increase in capital by means of cancelling debts related to
the equipment financed by external donors; and (iv) forfeiting of accumulated losses. Since the
majority of these measures were accounting measures, the overall fiscal impact on the
government budget was limited (see Table 18 below).

15. In order to recapitalize REGIDESO as part of restoring the equilibrium of its balance sheet, a
capital increase of FBu 39,116 million was achieved through the cancellation of the following
debts or their conversion into equity (see Table 19 below):

     Total                                         39,116


16. Following the recapitalization, REGIDESO's capital was sufficient to forfeit its cumulative
losses of FBu 22,621 million as of December 31, 2006, through a reduction of its capital. To
enhance the ongoing financial sustainability of REGIDESO going forward, GoB undertook to
allow for additional fiscal measures, in particular (i) allowing for tax deductibility of provisions
on accounts receivable, stocks, fixed assets and other assets which have recorded a loss in value
and (ii) allowing for the deduction of realized or unrealized exchange rate losses on conversion
of assets or liabilities. A summary of a pro-forma balance sheet of the situation as of December
31, 2006, and the restructured balance sheet as of January 1, 2007, is presented in Table 20
below.

 On the other hand, SINELAC owes Burundi in concept of reimbursement for debt service an amount of SDR 42.3
million, equivalent to about FBu 64 billion.

Performance Management Contract (2008 ­ 2012)

17. Following the financial restructuring of REGIDESO, a five year performance management
contract, valid from 2008 ­ 2012, was signed between GoB and REGIDESO on September 29,
2008. The performance management contract includes detailed obligations of both parties to
ensure the financial sustainability of REGIDESO. An independent audit of the performance
management contract was carried out in April 2010, analyzing through more than 35 indicators
the technical and financial status of REGIDESO.

18. With regard to the financial restructuring and recapitalization of REGIDESO the audit
analyzed the real financial situation as of December 31, 2007, based on the 2007 financial
statements, updated the pro-forma balance sheet and made recommendation how to adjust
differences. REGIDESO's financial performance indicators showed first progress toward
achieving the annual performance contract targets. In addition the following main
recommendations were made in order to ensure REGIDESO's financial equilibrium: (i) establish
an accounting system separated by activity and service; (ii) update internal controls; (iii)
establish 5-year investment plans; (iv) conduct a tariff study based on long-term marginal costs;
and (v) improve the management of material stocks.

Current financial situation (2007-2009)

19. On the operating side, REGIDESO made improvements in reducing technical and non-
technical losses in electricity from 28% in 2005, 24% in 2007 and 20% in 2009. Revenue
collection rates (excluding public arrears) improved markedly from 80% in 2008 to 99% in 2009.

20. REGIDESO's balance sheet situation improved significantly following the implementation
of the restructuring plan, the ensuing capital increase and debt forgiveness. As a result,
REGIDESO's leverage (debt/(debt + equity)) dropped from 64% in 2007 to 12% in 2009.
Government arrears to REGIDESO were cut in half between 2007-2009 and total accounts
receivable dropped from 28% of total assets in 2008 to 15% in 2009.

21. REGIDESO's profitability suffered in 2009 as a result of a strong increase in the cost of fuel
from 3.4% of operating expenses in 2007 to 12.1% in 2009. As a result, REGIDESO recorded
an operating loss in 2009. REGIDESO's future profitability will depend on the application of
the agreed tariff increases in combination with the gradual phasing out of the fuel subsidies.

22. A summary of REGIDESO's financial performance from 2007-2009 is provided in Table 21
and Table 22.

Electricity tariff adjustment

23. The GoB is committed to maintain REGIDESO financial viability throughout this process by
adjusting, in regular intervals, the tariffs applicable to electricity sales in Burundi to reflect the
increased cost of fuel purchases. The financing of fuel requirements for power generation would
follow the following principles (see Energy Sector Policy Letter):


   (i) The GoB has agreed on the principle of setting the tariff to allow REGIDESO to recover
       its total operating cost, including fuel for power generation, and achieve a positive return


                                                 68
     on its assets. The long term tariff structure will be adjusted based on the
     recommendations made in the ongoing tariff restructuring study, funded by proceeds
     from the MSWEIP.
(ii) To reflect the temporary increase in fossil fuel based power generation and the ever
     fluctuating price of petroleum products, the government will require REGIDESO to apply
     a fuel cost pass-through mechanism to directly reflect the increasing cost of diesel fuel on
     the electricity tariff. The provision of fuel subsidies from the IDA financed MSWEIP and
     the proposed project will allow a gradual adaptation of this principle during 2010-2011.
(iii)The request for tariff adjustment based on fuel cost pass-through and available subsidies
     will be made by REGIDESO on a quarterly basis. The results of the government review
     of the request, including underlying cost structure and rationale for the adjustments, will
     be shared with participating development partners in the sector working group.

               Annex 10: Summary of the complimentary IDA-financed MSWEIP
                      BURUNDI: EMERGENCY ENERGY PROJECT

Introduction

1. The IDA-financed Multi-Sectoral Water and Electricity Infrastructure Program (MSWEIP)
is the first IDA investment project focusing on investments in the energy and water sector since
the end of Burundi's long civil war and conflict. The MSWEIP is helping REGIDESO to restore
its financial and commercial viability and the quality and continuity of services in the face of the
increasing demand from individual consumers and economic agents. At the same time, the
project supports strategic planning activities and studies, as well as strengthening the operational
capacity of the main sector institutions in order to avoid or effectively reduce future gaps. The
MSWEIP was approved on May 13, 2008, with an original IDA Grant of SDR 30.4 million
(US$50 million equivalent). The closing date of the MSWEIP is scheduled for June 30, 2013.

MSWEIP Project Development Objective and Components

2. The project development objective (PDO) of the MSWEIP is to: (i) increase access to water
supply services in peri-urban areas of Bujumbura; (ii) increase reliability and quality of
electricity services; (iii) increase water supply quality and reliability in Bujumbura; and (iv)
strengthen REGIDESO's financial sustainability.

3. The MSWEIP consists of three components: (i) the electricity component (US$29.5
million), which supports urgent investments to rehabilitate the electricity supply system and
reduce the supply/demand gap; (ii) the water component (US$14.1 million), which supports
short-term investments to increase access to water supply, reduce losses and reinforce the
capacity of the supply and distribution system; and (iii) the institutional component (US$3.3
million), which will support the strengthening of the capacities of both REGIDESO and MWEM.

4. The MSWEIP electricity component will focus on restoring a quality electricity supply by
financing major rehabilitation of the backbone transmission and distribution grid and increasing
generation capacity, while financing demand side activities to increase efficiency and reduce
consumption at peak hours. In addition, the component will address medium to long-term
energy needs by supporting technical studies on alternative energy sources, particularly for small
run of the river type hydro power plants. Specifically, the following activities are planned under
the MSWEIP electricity component:

       1(a) Operational subsidy for thermal generation of electricity. The MSWEIPsupports
       the operation of the existing thermal generation plant, which will add 5.5 MW capacity to
       the system during peak hours, by providing funding to procure diesel fuel lubricants and
       critical parts for an average 8 hours per week-day operation over three years. The three
       year period will allow REGIDESO to address part of the existing energy deficit,
       especially during the dry seasons, while it develops additional hydropower capacity in the
       short-to-medium-term through micro-hydro power plants. The funding is in the form of a
       declining yearly subsidy (100 percent in the first year, 75 percent in the second year, and
       50 percent in the third year).



                                                70
        1(b) Rehabilitation of transmission and distribution network. The MSWEIP finances
        urgent investments in the transmission and distribution system as identified by
        REGIDESO and consultants in a recent review of rehabilitation needs. When completed,
        the rehabilitation will improve security, reduce outage times and increase quality of
        supply in the national grid. These investments will re-establish the back-bone grid supply
        function paving the way for future access expansion.
        1(c) Pre-feasibility and feasibility studies of small sized hydro power plants. To
        minimize the need for expansion of costly thermal generation capacity to supply the short
        and medium-term demand growth, the MSWEIP finances a study in three phases: (i) an
        initial scoping of the most promising six to eight sites identified in a 1983 study18 of
        hydro generation options; (ii) pre-feasibility studies of the most promising sites; and (iii)
        detailed feasibility and bidding documentation of the two best evaluated candidates from
        the previous phase. The plants would be of run-of-the-river type, thus not requiring any
        major dam works and could therefore be realized with limited environmental impacts in
        approximately two years. Small sized hydro power generation offers a credible low-cost
        alternative to bridge some of the expected medium-term supply deficit before larger
        hydro developments such as Kabu 16, Rusizi III and Rusumo Falls can be made
        operational.
        1(d) Improved revenue collection. This MSWEIP subcomponent is financing the
        acquisition and installation of pre-payment electricity meters for household consumers
        and public institutions, adapted metering for large consumers/industries, and renewal of
        obsolete electricity meters. The component will also finance updated billing and client
        management systems to improve REGIDESO's ability to manage its client base and fight
        fraudulent practices.
        1(e) Demand side management program. This MSWEIP subcomponent is focusing on
        energy savings by households, public institutions, industrial and large commercial
        customers. A key component of the efforts to bridge the supply/demand gap will be
        geared towards reducing consumption by consumers through promotion of energy
        efficient technologies and policies. This subcomponent includes the following activities:
        (i) Distribution and promotion of Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFL), (ii) Utility Energy
        Audit and (iii) Promotion of Energy Efficiency Investments to Large Consumers.

5. The MSWEIP water supply component is focusing on reducing Non-Revenue Water ,
expanding production facilities and networks, and extending the service to underserved northern
and eastern peri-urban areas of Bujumbura. This component is coordinated with the African
Development Bank with regards to the rehabilitation of the existing system and the extension of
the southern primary network of Bujumbura. An update of Bujumbura's water master plan was
prepared by international consultants as part of project preparation, and is guiding the
implementation of the MSWEIP water component. Specifically, the following investments and
studies are planned under the MSWEIP water component:

        2(a) Reduction of Non-Revenue Water program. This MSWEIP sub-component is
        comprising (i) technical assistance to REGIDESO for the development of a

18
  The study identifies 14 sites suitable for run-of-the-river operation with an installed capacity between 1 and 7.5
MW. "Etude du Développement des Ressources Hydro-Electriques du Burundi" Lahmeyer International, February,
1983.


                                                        71
       comprehensive action plan for the reduction of technical and commercial losses in the
       system; and (ii) purchase of specific equipment (leak detection equipment, water flow
       meters, regulator pressure/pressure reducing valves), and equipment for the
       standardization of the connections, to allow for the implementation of the action plan.
       2(b) Expansion of water treatment capacity. The MSWEIP funds the addition of a
       fourth slow sand filter to the existing water filtration plant (Usine du Lac), a reservoir
       (2,000 m3), and a pumping station equipped with one pump. The construction of this
       additional capacity will allow REGIDESO to increase its daily water production by
       33,000 m3.
       2(c) The expansion of the northern primary distribution network. The MSWEIP
       funds the construction of 15 km of transmission mains, three additional storage reservoirs
       (3,000 m3; 1,600 m3; and 1,600 m3 respectively), the construction of a new pumping
       station (three pumps installed) and the replacement of three existing pumps to serve the
       northern and eastern peri-urban areas of Bujumbura.
       2(d) Extension of secondary distribution networks and expansion of standposts. This
       sub-component funds investments to (i) extend secondary distribution networks in those
       areas to reach a large number of additional standposts as a priority; (ii) rehabilitate and
       upgrade approximately 45 existing public standposts to convert them into more
       functional standpost kiosks, and (iii) to install approximately 85 additional standpost
       kiosks to improve supply to these areas. This MSWEIP sup-components focuses on the
       five peri-urban zones located north and east of Bujumbura that are characterized by deep
       poverty and a high proportion of displaced and resettled residents: Buterere, Kamenge,
       Kinama, Gihosha, and Musaga. These neighborhoods will benefit directly from the
       above-described extension of the primary network.
       2(e) Engineering services for the detailed technical designs and the supervision of
       works. The MSWEIP funds consultant services to support the preparation of technical
       designs and specifications for the required bidding documents and conducts for
       REGIDESO supervision of works associated with the expansion of production capacity
       and the expansion of the primary and secondary networks in the project area, as detailed
       in components 2(b), 2(c) and 2(d) above.

6. The objective of the MSWEIP institutional strengthening component is to enhance sector
capacity, efficiency and effectiveness enabling REGIDESO and MWEM to deliver improved
electricity and water services. Specifically, this MSWEIP component is helping REGIDESO to:
(i) meet specific performance indicators to improve operational and financial performance,
through the execution of a performance contract with the state; (ii) provide institutional
strengthening of REGIDESO including capacity building, technical assistance and investments
in modern information systems to provide real time reporting and aggregated data to REGIDESO
general management and finance functions; (iii) improve the planning and monitoring capacities
of MWEM and its ability to provide support guidance to REGIDESO and other service
providers; (iv) assist REGIDESO in launching a delegated standpost kiosk management program
in the periphery of Bujumbura to improve service delivery at existing and new standposts; and
(v) finance the operational costs and capacity building needed to establish the PIU in
REGIDESO. A key objective of this component is to strengthen the contractual relationship
between REGIDESO and the government (MWEM, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of
Planning). The following activities are carried out:


                                               72
   3(a) Technical assistance to monitor the REGIDESO performance contract. This
   MSWEIP sub-component provides funds necessary to monitor and enforce the
   performance contract. In addition to a monitoring unit composed of government and
   REGIDESO representatives, a periodic external evaluation of the performance contract
   would be prepared. This will help to provide independent oversight and ensure
   accountability and transparency to the public in the execution of the performance
   contract. This regulatory mechanism is conceived as a first step toward the establishment
   of a permanent regulatory entity, as envisaged in the Law 1/014 of 2000.
   3(b) Institutional strengthening, REGIDESO. This MSWEIP sub-component provides
   financing for technical assistance, capacity building and investment to facilitate corporate
   management and improve financial performance. The subcomponent includes financing
   to establish reliable information systems including interconnecting the four main offices
   of REGIDESO and main production and customer centers, an update of systems for
   enterprise resource planning and management information; and training and technical
   assistance to increase capacity of REGIDESO's financial and commercial functions. This
   MSWEIP sub-component also finances capacity building and training according to an
   agreed annual training plan for key personnel responsible for general management,
   technical, administrative and commercial functions.
   3(c) Institutional strengthening, Ministry of Water, Energy and Mines. This
   MSWEIP sub-component funds capacity building activities within MWEM to enhance its
   ability to formulate policies and sectoral strategies. Among others, it is providing
   technical assistance for: (i) drafting the regulations for Law No. 1/014 (of 11/08/2000)
   that defines the principles, forms and conditions for private sector intervention; (ii)
   establishment of annual sector budget and execution reporting delivered in a timely and
   efficient manner; (iii) comprehensive tariff study to recommend a revised tariff structure
   that reflects the cost of service while providing necessary protection for the poor through
   the provision of an appropriate lifeline tariff block and adopted tariff scheme for public
   standposts; and (iv) monitoring sector operations, and the use of the financial model that
   has been developed during project preparation to evaluate and forecast REGIDESO's
   performance under different scenarios. This MSWEIP sub-component is also financing
   capacity building and training according to an agreed annual training plan for key
   personnel responsible for monitoring of utilities, and sectoral strategy and policy
   formulation.
   3(d) Establishing within REGIDESO a program to delegate and oversee the services
   of standpost operators. This MSWEIP sub-component is supporting improved service
   and cost-recovery at new and rehabilitated standpost service points, and to build the
   capacity of standpost operators themselves through appropriate training and technical
   assistance.
   3(e) Public information and consultations. A key objective of this MSWEIP sub-
   component is to disseminate information on the compliance of REGIDESO and the
   Government of Burundi with the obligations established in the performance contract in
   order to create social accountability. This MSWEIP sub-component funds the following
   activities: (i) Public consultation and information campaign and (ii) collection of
   monitoring data through recurrent surveys.




                                           73
       3(f) Support to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within REGIDESO. This
       MSWEIP sub-component finances the consultant services and operational costs of the
       PIU within REGIDESO.


MSWEIP Implementation Arrangements

7. REGIDESO is responsible for the implementation and supervision of the project. A project
implementation unit (PIU) was established within REGIDESO, which conducts the daily tasks of
project implementation and periodic assessments of its progress. The unit is reporting to
REGIDESO management and to the Director of Energy and Water in MWEM. It is coordinating
closely with all of the relevant departments within REGIDESO to ensure the timely allocation of
resources and execution of both investment and TA activities. The PIU has the ability to
contract consultants but relies primarily on in-house staff in order to build and maintain capacity
and institutional memory. The PIU is also responsible for the financial management of the
project and for the preparation of financial reports regarding the project. The PIU is receiving
financial support through the project, thus ensuring that it has the technical and management
resources necessary to oversee the technical studies as well as the technical and financial aspects
of implementation. REGIDESO's PIU is responsible for safeguards implementation. Two
safeguards instruments were prepared during the implementation of the MSWEIP:
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF). All Environmental Assessments and Resettlement Plans for electricity and
water infrastructure components are handled according to the provisions made in the ESMF and
RPF. An environmental and social specialist is already in place in the MSWEIP PIU with
satisfactory performance.

MSWEIP Progress to date

8. The MSWEIP faced difficulties in the initial stages of implementation to launch the
procurement process. The disbursement of the MSWEIP as of June 2010 was at US$7.8 million
(representing approximately 16 percent of the original IDA grant). The delay is largely attributed
to the utilities' lack of experience in implementing large scale investment projects and
completing international competitive procurement processes.

9. Over the past six months, significant progress has been made by REGIDESO to improve
procurement processes. The joint IDA water and energy sector task team has provided intensive
implementation support and the construction and rehabilitation of main electricity and water
infrastructure is expected to start in the third quarter of 2010. Currently, all scheduled
procurement actions have been launched and are nearing completion (see Annex 5). With this
recent progress and REGIDESO's updated action plan for finalizing the procurement process it
is reasonable to estimate that 70-80 percent of the project funds allocated to the electricity
component would be committed by end-July 2010. Similarly at least 70-80 percent of the project
proceeds allocated under the water component are expected to be committed by December 2010.
The construction of additional capacity to allow REGIDESO to increase its daily production by
30,000 m3 (30 percent of the installed capacity) has been contracted out since April 2010. The
package for the expansion of the northern primary distribution network and extension of
secondary distribution networks and expansion of standposts has been elaborated and contracting


                                                74
is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2010. Disbursement projections for 2010
point towards a marked improvement (from about 11 percent in June 2010 to about 26 percent in
September 2010) and are likely to reach 30 percent by December 2010 The ongoing
improvement in the procurement and disbursement performance would put the implementation
back on track for completion of the project activities by the original project closing date of June
30, 2013, and would upgrade the performance ratings to "moderately satisfactory" by December
2010.

10. The focus on improved MSWEIP performance is anchored at the highest levels of
government and utility management. The "Rapid Results Initiative" (RRI) launched March 4,
2010 is aiming to accelerate the disbursement rate of the MSWEIP to reach 20 percent in the
following three months.19 The RRI includes a detailed action plan tied to an updated MSWEIP
procurement and processing time table with clear individual responsibilities, tight deadlines and
over-sight from the Ministry of Water, Energy and Mines and the 2nd Vice Presidency.20

11. The joint IDA water and energy sector task team are providing intensive implementation
support to REGIDESO to address the limitations in implementation capacity. This includes
increased field presence with extended implementation support missions and monthly meetings
and bi-monthly video conference sessions with the utility management and the PIU.

   The MSWEIP disbursement rate increased to 25 percent by the end of August 2010, thus reaching the targets set
forth in the RRI with a two months delay.

   The Burundi Ministry of Water, Energy, and Mines reports to the 2nd Vice Presidency. The World Bank team has
reviewed the arrangements in place for high level supervision of the MSWEIP RRI and is satisfied with these.
