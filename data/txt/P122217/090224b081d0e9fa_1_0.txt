                         achieved on site compared to the situation of three months ago. The installation of 30/10kV transformer of 10MVA and the installation of 10kV switchgears at the RN1 substation was

                         completed in March 2013. The rehabilitation of the existing hydro power plant of Rwegura and of Nyemanga has advanced. The majority of equipment has arrived on site. Works
                         have progressed and are likely to be completed by August 2013. The installation of the 5MW thermal plant has slowly progressed during the first six months of contract
                         implementation. The generator sets, power transformers, control panels, and MV switchboards were received on site. Civil works were slowed down due to the presence of ground
                         water table under the footprint of the thermal plant which needed a change of the design of the concrete pads and other civil works. The implementation plan was revised to

                         commissioning of the power plant is rescheduled to be completed by June 30, 2013. The contract for the purchasing of fuel (LFO) for the power plant was signed in April 2013 with
                         duration of twelve months. All the 15,000 prepayment meters have been received in Bujumbura and a contractor was selected in May 2013 to undertake the installation.

                         The implementation of major activities of the project, excepting the purchase of fuel, is likely to be completed by its closing date. The Government and the Bank is discussing on the
                         condition to be met for the extension of the closing date of the project.
