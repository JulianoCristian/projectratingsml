 the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an\n            Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) to the Republic of Burundi for\n            the Emergency Energy Project (EEP) in accordance with the\n            Operational Policy/Bank Policy (OP/BP) 8.00 - Rapid Response\n            to Crises and Emergencies. The ERL will be provided as a\n            grant under the International Development Association (IDA)\n            Crisis Response Window (CRW), as approved by the World\n            Bank's Board of Directors on December 10, 2009. The\n            project will therefore provide urgent assistance to Regie de\n            Production et de Distribution d'Eau et\n            d'Electricite (REGIDESO) to recover the capacity and\n            reliability of electricity services with a main focus on the\n            capital Bujumbura. An emergency electricity infrastructure\n            investment program has been identified to quickly address,\n            over the next twelve months, the main risks of power system\n            failure and lack of supply diversification, and alleviate\n            some of the immediate effects of the global financial crisis\n            on the country's fragile post-conflict economic growth.\n            The project is fully aligned with and complimentary to the\n            IDA financed Multi-Sectoral Water and Electricity\n            Infrastructure Program (MSWEIP) and the African Development\n            Bank (AfDB) Energy Infrastructure Rehabilitation and\n            Extension Project, which finances investments in the\n            electricity and water supply and distribution systems as\n            well as a comprehensive capacity building program for\n            REGIDESO and the Ministry of Water, Energy and Mines (MWEM)."}, "docdt": "2010-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
