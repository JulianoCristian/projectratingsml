                         signing of contract for the installation of additional 5MW to the existing Bujumbura Thermal Power Plant. Civil works have started and the commissioning of the plant is expected by
                         March 2013; (ii) signing of contract for the rehabilitation of existing hydropower plants; (iii) signing of contract for MV network rehabilitation works in Bujumbura; and (iv) procurement
