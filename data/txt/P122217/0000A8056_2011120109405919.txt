                         Burundi's chronic electricity demand supply deficit is continuing to put a high burden on the entire population and the economic development of the country, further enhanced by
                         increased fuel prices. The project makes progress towards achievement of the project development objective. During the first 6 months, REGIDESO has successfully undertaken the
                         following major actions: (i) launch of bidding documents for the 5 MW extension of the Bujumbura Thermal Power Plant; (ii) launch of bidding documents for rehabilitation works for 2
