   Project is partly a conventional three year area-based rural\n            development project and partly a sector adjustment program\n            that will undertake structural reforms in the cotton\n            subsector. Specifically, the project involves two\n            components; namely a rural development component and an\n            institution building component. The first component includes\n            (a) provision of incremental inputs, improved extension and\n            animal traction for farmers in the Borgou province; (b)\n            applied food-crop and cotton research; (c) environmental\n            protection and (d) infrastructure development programs. This\n            component further entails (e) pilot rehabilitation of 100 ha\n            of bottomlands and construction/rehabilitation of 65 wells\n            and (f) rehabilitation and maintenance of about 300 km of\n            feeder roads. The institutional component aims at (a)\n            strengthening the financial management and procedures of\n            certain agencies; (b) preparing a medium-term development\n            program; and (c) establishing cotton Stabilization Fund and\n            a central audit as well as an accounting and financial\n            training unit for the cotton subsector as a whole. Lastly,\n            it provides for studies and consultant services to help\n            prepare a medium-term restructuring and development program\n            for the rural sector."}, "docdt": "1988-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
