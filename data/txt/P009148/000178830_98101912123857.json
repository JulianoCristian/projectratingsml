date. The loan covenants were\n            substantially complied with although an undertaking to\n            construct access roads was considerably delayed in\n            execution. Most of the overruns in project costs can be\n            explained by the devaluation of the Dinar in January 1971 by\n            20 percent and by price escalation. The main benefits from\n            the newly constructed roads are savings in transport costs.\n            There is now little prospect and justification of the\n            construction of the second carriageway. In view of the\n            investment already made to provide for a future second\n            carriageway, the question of an entirely new alignment to\n            Novisad from the project road is one that should have been\n            discussed very much earlier with the Bank so that the\n            optimal least total cost solution could have been mutually agreed."}, "docdt": "1977-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
