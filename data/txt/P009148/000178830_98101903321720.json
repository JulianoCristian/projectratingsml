The six\n            project sections are located in three Republics:\n            Bosnia-Hercegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia, and in the two\n            Socialist Autonomous Provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. The\n            section in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Sarajevo-Zonica, would be the\n            first stage of a planned four-lane expressway linking the\n            Central and Adriatic Highways, both of which were improved\n            with a Bank financed loan (344-YU of 1963). The section in\n            Montenegro, Bar-Ulcinj, would be an extension of the\n            Adriatic Highway. It would replace an inadequate road and\n            help the development of an attractive tourist area. The\n            Belgrade-Novi Sad section, located mainly in the Autonomous\n            Province of Vojvodina and partly in Serbia, would be part of\n            the international highway, London-Istanbul (E-5). The three\n            remaining project sections, located partly in the Autonomous\n            Province of Kosovo and partly in the Republic of Serbia,\n            would complete the upgrading of the Pec-Pristina-Nis road to\n            higher standards. In total, the project works comprise the\n            construction of 218 km of new or improved two-lane roads\n            with paved surfaces. The proposed investments in the\n            individual road sections would yield rates of return ranging\n            from 14 to 29 percent."}, "docdt": "1970-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
