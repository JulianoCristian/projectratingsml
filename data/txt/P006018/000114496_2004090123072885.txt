Dear Minister Cavallo:
Please refer  to the Loan Agreement for the above project dated 
December 5, 1995 entered into between the Republic of Argentina (the 
Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(the Bank), as amended.
In response to the letter of Ing. Walter A. Ceballos, Secretario de 
Provincias, dated March 17, 2000 requesting to change the aggregate amount 
for procurement of works and goods  set forth in Part C.2, of Section I of 
Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement, the Bank hereby agrees to increase the 
aggregate amount from $3,200,000 equivalent to $5,000,000 equivalent for 
goods contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of price quotations 
obtained from at least three suppliers and decrease the aggregate from 
$5,200,000 equivalent to $3,400,000 for works contracts awarded on the same 
basis.  Accordingly, Section 1 of Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement is 
amended as follows: 
(i)
Part C.2 is amended by replacing the figure "$3,200,000" with 
the figure "$5,000,000" and  the figure "$5,200,000" with the 
figure "$3,400,000".
This Amendment Letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of 
which shall be an original.  Upon receipt by the Bank of one fully executed 
original of this Amendment Letter, this amendment will be effective as of 
the date first above written.  Please confirm your agreement to the 
foregoing amendment by signing and dating the two counterparts of this 
Amendment Letter.
