The lessons\n            learned include the following: 1) The appropriateness of a\n            Project Implementation Unit outside of the civil service\n            structure is based on considering the long-term development\n            role of the project's implementation arrangements, and\n            the need for inter-ministerial coordination and\n            collaboration in implementing the project's development\n            objectives. 2) The Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP)\n            was the key source of counterpart funding under the project.\n            A key lessons learned is that the mixing of fiscal and\n            financial policies of central government in\n            intergovernmental relations is not sustainable and not\n            desirable in implementation of sound decentralization\n            policy. 3) Local government projects needs to recognize the\n            diversity of local capacity and to include mechanisms to\n            improve this capacity. 4) The role of a central ministry\n            responsible for local government policies should result in a\n            policy shift from an emphasis on \"command and\n            control\" to more devolution. 5) Networking and\n            dissemination have proved to be very important and\n            effective. 6) Fiscal and financial instruments for support\n            to local government need to be carefully separated, with\n            appropriate policy and implementation arrangements being\n            formulated and implemented."}, "docdt": "2000-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
