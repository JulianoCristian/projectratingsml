The borrower, Comision Federal de Electricidad\n            (CFE) was highly effective, with a strong commitment from\n            the executing agency, which exceeded in some instances, the\n            targets of the project. However, a disappointing result was\n            the demand coincidence factor, overestimated by the\n            consultant, and not detected during supervision. It is\n            important to mention that Mexico was selected as a pilot for\n            testing verification of carbon savings, and a technical\n            audit will validate project results in terms of greenhouse\n            gas emissions. The key lessons learned suggest that: 1) the\n            establishment of independent trust funds was a key factor\n            for successful sales and coverage goals, showing to be\n            efficient, expeditious and inexpensive; 2) the choice for\n            fluorescent bulbs (FLs) with high technical specifications\n            and reliability favored consumer acceptance. Furthermore,\n            from an overall marketing/ sales point of view, the price\n            subsidy was an asset. 3) an adequate tariff policy should be\n            in place, providing in turn, incentives to low income\n            consumers; and, 4) decentralization of Implementing Units\n            was paramount in achieving sales and distribution goals."}, "docdt": "1998-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
