It is considered\n            that the project succeeded in demonstrating the technical\n            feasibility of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, and\n            simultaneously reducing local contamination, through\n            widespread installation of high efficiency lighting,\n            however, the project failed to demonstrate the financial\n            feasibility of such endeavor, contributing only modestly,\n            towards building the institutional capacity for\n            technological change, energy conservation, and demand-side\n            management at the implementing utility. Among the many\n            lessons, it is suggested that: 1) replicability, and\n            sustainability are essential elements in demonstration\n            projects, and deserve close consideration, and, be\n            explicitly incorporated in the project design, strategy, and\n            activities; 2) the well planned implementation scheme -\n            based on decentralized units, and independent trust funds -\n            was successful, giving the implementing agency an overall\n            project control; and, 3) bulk procurement can be an\n            important leverage."}, "docdt": "2001-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
