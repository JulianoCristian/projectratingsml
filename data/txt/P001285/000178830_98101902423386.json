National Extension Project will\n            promote sustained increases in agricultural production in 30\n            of Kenya's 41 districts by reorganizing and\n            strengthening Kenya's agricultural extension system and\n            improving linkages between research and extension. This will\n            be achieved through: (a) incremental staff; (b)\n            transportation, office and training equipment; (c)\n            construction of a number of modest offices at the district\n            and division levels; (d) incremental operating costs and\n            travel allowances; (e) training of extension staff; (f)\n            technical assistance; (g) support of adaptive research and\n            improvement of research extension linkages; and (h)\n            monitoring and evaluation. The project will extend over a\n            four-and-a-half year period and constitute the first phase\n            of multi-phased development effort."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
