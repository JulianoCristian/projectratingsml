resources for economic development;\n            and (b) strengthen management and planning skills at senior\n            levels in the education sector.  The project would:  (i)\n            provide in-service training for teachers of science,\n            mathematics and English and for provincial school\n            supervisors and headmasters.

Finally, the project would;\n            (iv) strengthen management and planning performance in the\n            Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) through a fellowship\n            training scheme and a management study."}, "docdt": "1984-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
