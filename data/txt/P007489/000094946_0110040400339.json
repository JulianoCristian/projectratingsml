          objectives. Project sustainability is adjudged as highly\n            likely. Both World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            adjudged as satisfactory overall. Lessons learned include\n            the following: Legal changes aimed at strengthening the tax\n            administration's enforcement powers should be\n            accompanied by proactive efforts to explain their rationale\n            and purpose to taxpayers, representative associations, and\n            legislators. Changes in the organizational structure and\n            functions of different departments and offices should\n            precede IT system development. Senior management positions\n            in new organizational structures should be filled as early\n            as possible. Implementation teams should be created in\n            different functional areas; these teams should act as a link\n            between line departments and the project. Off-the-shelf\n            application software, though attractive, should be adopted\n            only after careful analysis of business requirements and a\n            detailed evaluation of available packages. Experts in IT as\n            well as tax administration should be used. Individual\n            modules of large information systems should be implemented\n            as soon as they are ready. A lump sum contract for delivery\n            of pre-defined outputs is preferred over a contract based on\n            time spent by the contractor in system development."}, "docdt": "2001-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
