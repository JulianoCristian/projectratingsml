To improve the quality of education, the project\n            will assist in: (a) developing and implementing common\n            curricula and providing learning materials to all students\n            and teachers at the primary and lower secondary levels; (b)\n            expanding and improving the training of primary and\n            secondary teachers; and (c) increasing field support and\n            training for inservice primary teachers. The efficiency of\n            the education system will be increased by reinforcing the\n            educational planning and investment implementation capacity\n            of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and by carrying out\n            studies to improve the cost effectiveness of education."}, "docdt": "1988-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
