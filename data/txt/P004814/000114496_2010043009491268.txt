Dear Mr. Minister:
1.    We refer to the above Development Credit Agreement between the
Republic of Vanuatu (the Borrower) and the International Development
Association (IDA) dated January 27, 1989. We also refer to your
letter of April 14, 1993 proposing: (a) a reallocation of the Credit
in accordance with the revised financing plan prepared jointly by
representatives from the Borrower and the recent March 1993 IDA
mission; and (b) a request to utilize about US$40,000 equivalent of
Project funds to repair the roof of the Lycee Louis Antoine de
Bougainville destroyed by the recent cyclone.

IDA has agreed to the above request.  Accordingly, the Development
Credit Agreement is amended as follows:
