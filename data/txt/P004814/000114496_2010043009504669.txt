Secondary Education Project) between the Republic of Vanuatu (the

allocated under the Special Account from $400,000 to $800,000 to
enable payments of larger contracts under the Project.

consideration, it has agreed to the above request. Therefore
Paragraph 1 (c) of Schedule 4 is amended to read:
      " (c) the term 'Authorized Allocation' means an amount
      equivalent to $800,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit
      Account and deposited in the Special Account pursuant to
      paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule."
          Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment
by signing and dating the enclosed copy of this letter and by
returning it to us for our records .
                                     Sincerely yours,
