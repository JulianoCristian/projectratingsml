MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF VANUATU FOR A
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Vanuatu for SDR 6.3 million (US$8.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a primary
and secondary education project. The project would be cofinanced on a grant
basis by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB)
for US$7.7 million equivalent.
2.        Background.  Vanuatu is a group of about 80 small islands in the
South Pacific with approximately 135,000 inhabitants, called the ni-Vanuatu.
Development efforts since independence (1980) have baen seriously constrained
by a chronic lack of skilled workers and of technical and managerial staff,
which has led to a heavy reliance on expatriates for senior level posts in the
public and private sectors. Human resource development continues to be a
priority objective in government plans. Vanuatu inherited parallel education
systems in the French and English media from the colonial period, and
integration of the two systems has been a continuing government concern.
Access to education is good at the primary level (about 80% of six-year olds
are enrolled in primary school), but more limited at the post-primary level,
where enrollments represented about 17X of the relevant age group for lower
secondary and 2Z for upper secondary, respectively, in 1985. In 1986 the
Government launched an ambitious expansion of lower secondary education by
establishing 11 new single-stream schools in temporary facilities, which would
have inc-eased lower secondary enrollments by 601. In view of the
difficulties encountered in financing and implementing such an accelerated
increase in secondary student places the Government decided in mid-1988 to
consolidate the 11 streams to 6 stresms, which would not unduly strain the
Government budget nor the supply of qualified secondary teachers. The
implementation of this consolidation plan would be supported under the
proposed project.    -
3.        The quality of learning is also a major issue at all levels of
education, due to: Ci) the difficulties of learning in a second (and often
thiz-d) language; (ii) the continuing use of curricula, textbooks and
examinations that are modeled on the education systems of the former colonial
powers and ill-adapted to the learning needs of ni-Vanuatu; and (iii) poorly
prepared, and supervised teachers.  Unit costs of education are high (US$23u
and US$950 for primary and secondary education, respectively in 1985), due to
low pupil:teacher ratios (24:1 at primary and 17:1 at secondary) and the use
of boarding, which in turn result from the highly dispersed population, and
high teacher salaries. A-weak capacity for educational planning and
administration further exacerbates the inefficient tse of resources. The
education sector absorbs a high proportion (24%.) of the government recurrent
budget, despite considerable extrabudgetary assistance from external donors.
In view of general budgetary constraints, the Government would need to
restrain the growth of the education budget.



-2-
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Human resource development is key
to the modernization of agriculture and the expansion of the service sectors,
which are the principal axes of government development policy. However, the
Government has had a limited capacity to define an overall strategy for the
balanced development of the education sector, and past education investments
have been largely donor-driven and piecemeal. The Bank Group has been able to
assist the Government in formulating a coherent sector investment program,
which addresses priority objectives and is consistent with its absorptive
capacity. This medium-term framework facilitates the coordination of the many
sources of external assistance to the education sector. The Bank Group has
also been able to engage the Government in a policy dialogue on key issues in
the sector, particuLarly concerning the importance of balancing expansion and
quality improvement objectives in education investment decisions, the need for
improved sector planning and management and the implementation of cost-
containment measures. While the majority of Bank Group projects in the
Pacific Islands are cofinanced operations with the Asian DeveLopment Bank
(ADB) in the lead role, as were the two ongoing projects in agricultural
extension and multi-sector infrastructure in Vanuatu, the Bank Group takes the
lead role in general education, a sector where the ADB has not been active.
5.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would assist in
implementing the education sector objectives of the Government's Five-Year
Development Plan (1987-1991), and would comprise the principal investments in
primary and secondary education over the medium term. The project would
support the following sector objectives: (a) increasing the availability of
skilled manpower, through expanded and more equitably distributed access to
secondary education, as the basis for further academic or technical training;
(b) improving the quality of education and continuing progress towards the
unification of the French and English medium systems, through the development
and implementation of common adapted curricula and educational materials, and
through improvement and expansion of teacher training and inservice teacher
support; and (c) increasing the efficiency of the education system, by
strengthening the capacity of the Ministry ci Education (MOE) to plan,
implement, monitor and evaluate education investments and cost-containment
measures.
6.        Project Description.  The project would support expanded access to
secondary education through the construction and equipment of facilities for
560 additional lower secondary students and 200 additional upper secondary
students, in regions not now served. To improve the quality of education, the
project would assist in: (a) developing and implementing common curricula and
providing related educational materials in the two language media for all
primary and lower secondary students and teachers; (b) expanding and improving
the training of primary and lower secondary teachers; and (c) increasing and
upgrading field support and training for inservice primary teachers. The
management efficiency of the education system would be increased by
reinforcing the educational planning and investment implementation capacity of
the MOE and by carrying out studies to improve the cost-effectiveness of
education services. The project, to be carried out over eight years, provides
funds for: civil works; vehicles, furniture, equipment and educational
materials; local and overseas training; technical assistance; and incremental
recurrent costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.89



-3-
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$10.04 million
(56%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
Schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Vanuatu are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is provided. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6606-VAN,
dated October 14, 1988, is distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
7.        Agreed Actions.  Agreement was obtained from the Government during
negotiations on the following actions: (a) establishment and initial staffing
of a Planning and Implementation Unit (PIU) within the MOE, as a condition of
Credit effectiveness; (b) effectiveness of the AIDAB cofinancing grant, as a
condition of Credit effectiveness; (c) implementation of initial measures in
the agreed lower secondary consolidation plan, as a Londition of disbursement
against the project-financed lower secondary schools; (d) recruitment of
remaining staff for the PIU by June 30, 1990; (e) submission of a staffing
plan for the project-financed secondary education facilities one year before
opening such facilities; (f) submission of a program for the rationalization
of primary teaching posts, by December 31, 1989; of a study on the financing
of education, by December 31, 1990; and of a study on teacher incentives, by
December 31, 1991; and implementation of the prDgram and the recommendations
of the studies according to an agreed timetable; (g) allowing direct
importation of project-financed building materials as well as the importation
of necessary skilled labor for project-financed construction; and (h) ensuring
that the project would be implemented according to agreed critical
implementation dates.
8.        Benefits.  The project would contribute to national unity, through
harmonization of the French and English-medium curricula and learning
materials, the establishment of model dual-lingual schools and increased
regional distribution of secondary school facilities. Student achievement
would be promoted through the provision of educational materials to all
teachers and students at the primary and lower secondary levels (about 30,000
students). Teacher training would be streamlined, unqualified primary
teachers would be upgraded, lover secondary teachers would be trained, and all
primary teachers would be reached by supervisory visits and inservice
workshops. The lower secondary enrollment ratio would be raispd to 20X and
the output of the secondary graduates needed to fill critical manpower
shortages would be increased by 20% and 100% at the lower and upper secondary
levels, respectively. The management of the education system would be
improved and the growth of the education budget would be restrained.
9.        Risks.  Possible risks include budgetary constraints and government
inability to implement cost-containment measures, which may prevent the
alLocation of the required national staff and counterpart funds to the
project, and limited MOE experience in project implementation, particularly as
regards IDA procedures. To minimize these risks, project-related incremental
recurrent costs have been included in the project and would be financed by IDA
on a declining basis, technical assistance for helping identify and implement
cost-containment measures to reduce the education burden on the budget would
be provided under the project, and the MOE's implementation capacity would be
strengthened.

10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
