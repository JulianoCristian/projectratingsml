Re:   Development Credit No. 1964-VAN, Primary and Secondary
      Education Project - Amendment of the Development Credit
      Agreement
Dear Mr. Minister:
               We refer to the above Development Credit Agreement
between the Republic of Vanuatu (the Borrower) and the International
Development Association (IDA) dated January 27, 1989. We also refer
to your letter of August 21, 1992 requesting that the costs for the
distribution of furniture and equipment be included as part of
Section 1 Part A of Schedule 2 and of Category 2 of Schedule 1.
               The Association is pleased to inform you that, after
due consideration, it has been agreed to support your request
requiring the following adjustments to the Development Credit
Agreement:
      (a) That the first line of Section 1 of Part A Schedule 2 be
      amended to read "Construction, furnishing and equipping
      (including distribution of furniture and equipment to an
      amount equal to 15% of purchase price) of two lower secondary
      schools ......... teachers."
      (b) That Category 2 of Schedule 1 now read "Goods and
      Distribution". Please note that the allocation for Category 2
      remains the same.
      Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by
signing and dating the enclosed copy of this letter and by returning
it to us for our records .
                                  Sincerely yours,
                                   Marianne Haug
