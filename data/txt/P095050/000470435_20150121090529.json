The first request, submitted on\n            January 2, 2013, was sent by members of the Sengwer\n            Indigenous community from four areas of the Cherangany Hills\n            in the Western Highlands of Kenya; the second one, submitted\n            on June 28, 2013, was sent by four representatives of the\n            Cherangany indigenous people's community on behalf of\n            people living in the Cherangany hills. The two requests\n            address overlapping issues. Throughout the report, the Panel\n            refers to these communities as Cherangany-Sengwer.\n            Management in its response acknowledges the challenging\n            environment in which the NRMP was designed and implemented,\n            and notes that the original Project design was overly\n            ambitious with respect to solving land rights issues. It\n            states that the Bank took an active approach in responding\n            to the concerns raised in the Requests. It also states that\n            'although the evictions were not the result of the\n            project, Management acted swiftly upon learning about such\n            incidents by securing a moratorium on evictions from the\n            Government.' Other actions taken during the\n            restructuring aimed at addressing indigenous peoples'\n            concerns related to restriction of access to forests and\n            loss of customary rights."}, "docdt": "2014-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
