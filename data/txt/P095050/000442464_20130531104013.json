On\n            January 14, 2013, the Inspection Panel received a request\n            for inspection related to the Natural Resource Management\n            Project for Kenya. According to the request, Kenya Forest\n            Service (KFS) has burned over 500 houses and property in\n            Empoput forest since 2007 in the process of carrying out\n            forceful evictions. The Requesters state that the Empoput\n            forest is part of the ancestral land of the Sengwer people\n            as an ethnic minority hunter-gatherer people. The Requesters\n            state that second phase and the demarcation of Sengwer land\n            was stopped so 97 Sengwer families who were to be settled\n            under second phase moved to the land that belonged to them\n            but were arrested and charged with encroachment in the\n            forest. The Request indicates that this case related to\n            arrested community members is pending in the Kitale courts\n            since 2009 and has cost the communities hundreds of\n            thousands of Kenya Shillings in legal fees and other\n            expenses. The Request concludes with a number of\n            recommendations including; that the Government recognizes\n            the rights of the Sengwer to live in their ancestral home in\n            Kapolet and Empoput forest, and that it compensates the\n            families whose houses and property were destroyed, and those\n            who were arrested in Kapolet and the woman who was shot."}, "docdt": "2013-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
