       1.8 Summary of Overall Project Performance:
           Observed implementation challenges include:
           (i) Lack of reliable water sources and drought that affected the establishment and the success of
                  the developed farm forestry enterprises. The farmers struggled to get water to irrigate the
                  established enterprises. Ensuring that the farmers establish drought tolerant species and at
                  the same time apply soil and water conservation measures for purposes of maximum
                  water retention especially when it rains.
           (ii) Low disbursement rate of funds to beneficiaries by the Financial Service Provider - Equity
                  Bank. Joint appraisal of farmers by both the financial service provider and KFS for
                  purposes of reaching more farmers and disbursement of more loans also. The project has
                  also encouraged farmers who have cleared loans to take more for up scaling their
                  enterprises.

       1.9 Summary of Project Compliance:
       There are no Issues of non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the financing agreement.

            SERVICE

            REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

            I have audited the accompanying financial statements of Support to Community Based
            Farm Forestry Enterprises in Semi Arid Areas in Kenya Project (IDA Grant TF 093520-
            KE) set out at pages 1 to 11, which comprise the statement of financial assets and
            liabilities as at 30 June 2014, and the statement of receipts and payments, statement of
            cash flows and statement of comparative budget and actual amounts, and special
            account statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting
            policies and other explanatory information in accordance with the provisions of Article
            229 of the Constitution of Kenya, Section 14 of the Public Audit Act, 2003 and Article II
            part 'C' 2.06 (c) of the Grant Agreement No. TF 093520 KE dated 7 September 2009
            between International Development Association and the Government of Kenya. I have
            obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of my knowledge and
            belief, were necessary for the purpose of the audit.

            Responsibility of the National Treasury, the Director and the Project Manager for
            the Financial Statements

            The Principal Secretary - National Treasury, the Director - Kenya Forestry Service and
            the Project Manager are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
            financial statements in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting
            Standards (cash basis) and for such internal control as management determines is
            necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
            misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

            The management is also responsible for the submission of the financial statements to
            the Auditor-General in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Public Audit
            Act, 2003.

            Auditor-General's Responsibility

            My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on the
            audit and report in accordance with the provisions of Section 15 of the Public Audit Act,
            2003. The audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.




                                          Promoting Accountability m the Public Sector
Those standards require compliance with ethical requirements and that the audit be
planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Project's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by the management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial statements.

I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for my audit opinion.

Opinion

In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects the
financial position of the Project as at 30 June 2014, and of its financial performance and
its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Public Sector
Accounting Standards (cash basis) and comply with the Grant Agreement No.TF
093520 - KE.

In addition, the Special Account statement presents fairly the transactions for the year,
and the ending balance has been reconciled with the books of account.

              Reports and Financial Statements
              For the financial year ended June 30, 2014

       8. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

              The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out
              below:

              8.1 Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
                     The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with International
                     Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) with particular emphasis on Cash Basis Financial
                     Reporting under the Cash Basis of Accounting. The financial statements comply with and
                     conform to the form of presentation prescribed by the Accounting Standards Board of Kenya.

                     The financial statements are presented in Kenya Shillings, which is the functional and reporting
                     currency of the Project and all values are rounded to the nearest one Shilling. The accounting
                     policies adopted have been consistently applied to all of the years presented.
                     The financial statements have been prepared on the cash basis following the Government's
                     standard chart of accounts. The cash basis of accounting recognises transactions and events only
                     when cash is received or paid out by the Project.

         1.          Recognition of revenue and expenses
                     The Project recognises all revenues from the various sources when the event occurs and the
                     related cash has actually been received by the Project. In addition, the Project recognises all
                     expenses when the event occurs and the related cash has actually been paid out by the Project.

        11.          In-kind donations
                     In-kind donations are contributions made to the Project in the form of actual goods and/or
                     services rather than in money or cash terms. These donations may include vehicles, equipment
                     or personnel services. Where the financial value of in-kind donations can be reliably
                     determined, the Project includes such value in the statement of receipts and payments both as
                     revenue and as an expense in equal and opposite amounts; otherwise, the donation is not
                     recorded.

       111.          Cash and cash equivalents
                     Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash at bank, short-term deposits on call
                     and highly liquid _  investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are
                     readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in
                     value. Bank account balances include amounts held at the Central Bank of Kenya and at various
                     commercial banks at the end of the financial year/period. For the purposes of these financial
                     statements, cash and cash equivalents also include short term cash imprests and advances to
                     authorised public officers and/or institutions which had not been surrendered or accounted for
                     at the end of the financial year/period.

           Reports and Financial Statements
           For the financial year ended June 30, 2014

           SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

     iv.                 Pending bills

                         Pending bills consist of unpaid liabilities at the end of the financial year/period arising from
                         contracted goods or services during the year/period or in past years/periods. As pending bills do
                         not involve the payment of cash in the reporting period, they are simply disclosed as an Annex
                         to the financial statements. When the pending bills are finally settled, such payments are
                         included in the statement of receipts and payments in the year in which the payments are made.


     v.                  Budget

                         The budget is developed on the same accounting basis (cash basis), the same accounts
                         classification basis, and for the same period as the financial statements. The Project's budget
                         was approved as required by Law and National Treasury Regulations, as well as by the
                         participating development partners, as detailed in the Government of Kenya Budget Printed
                         Estimates for the year. A high-level assessment of the Project's actual performance against the
                         comparable budget for the financial year/period under review has been included in an annex to
                         these financial statements.

-    Vl.                 Exchange rate differences

                         The accounting records are maintained in the functional currency of the primary economic
                         environment in which the Project operates, Kenya Shillings. Transactions in foreign currencies
                         during the year/period are converted into the functional currency using the exchange rates
                         prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Any foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
                         the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of
                         monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the
                         statements of receipts and payments.

    vu.                  Comparative figures

                         Where necessary comparative figures for the previous financial year/period have been amended
                         or reconfigured to conform to the required changes in financial statement presentation.

    vm.                  Subsequent events

                         There have been no events subsequent to the financial year/period end with a significant impact
                         on the financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2014.
