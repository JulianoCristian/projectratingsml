Some lessons learned included: the\n            project offers a number of lessons on institutions,\n            investments, information and implementation for future GOK\n            programming and external financial support to natural\n            resources and the sectors it drives or helps protect. It\n            also provides important lessons for Kenya as it devolves to\n            lower levels of political and resource management. The\n            project adds to the evidence base that natural resources\n            including water, forest, and soils typically benefit from\n            strong and fair participatory approaches to managing the\n            resource and sharing the benefits from the resource,\n            underpinned by robust resource monitoring and grievance\n            redress. Sustainable NRM actions should therefore consider\n            including: (i) strong environmental and socio-economic\n            monitoring underpinned by strong data gathering and\n            information management, (ii) good incentives for local\n            resource users to avoid free rider behavior that degrades\n            natural wealth, (iii) secure and predictable rights to\n            resources by local communities, and (iv) effective\n            coordination on planning and prioritization among\n            stakeholders and sectors, given that changes in an upstream\n            area (forested watersheds) affect downstream actors\n            (villages, irrigation users, cities) and can drive conflict."}, "docdt": "2014-07-22T00:00:00Z"}
