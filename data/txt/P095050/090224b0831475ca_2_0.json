The\n            request for inspection was submitted by individuals from\n            Sengwer communities who live, and represent other members\n            who live, in four areas of the Cherangany hills in the\n            western highlands of Kenya, namely the Kapolet forest (in\n            Trans-Nzoia county), Talau and Kaipos (in West Pokot\n            county), and Embobut forest (in Marakwet county). The\n            requesters claimed that they had been forcibly evicted from\n            their lands within the forests as a result of the project,\n            and that there had been a lack of recognition and protection\n            of their customary rights during project implementation. The\n            Panel determined that no evictions were supported by the\n            NRMP, but more attention should have been given from the\n            outset to identify risks for affected people and adequately\n            mitigate such risks as required by Bank policies on\n            environmental assessment, project appraisal, indigenous\n            peoples, and involuntary resettlement. The Panel also found\n            an inadequate institutional analysis of the implementing\n            agency, the Kenya Forest Service (KFS). The investigation\n            report and the management report and recommendation were\n            discussed by the Board on September 30, 2014. The Board\n            approved the proposed management action plan and management\n            was requested to report back on its implementation within 6\n            to 12 months\u2019 time. This report is intended to provide a\n            summary of the progress on the implementation of the action plan."}, "docdt": "2015-09-17T01:55:04Z"}
