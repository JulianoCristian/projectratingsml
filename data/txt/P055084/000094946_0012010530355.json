the Republic, is to\n            advance the nation's international competitive standing\n            and accelerate its economic growth. The Competitiveness\n            Project aims to advance the Program's objective as well\n            as those of the nation's Peace Accords by helping\n            primarily small and micro businesses to generate higher\n            incomes and reduce high rates of poverty in Guatemala. There\n            are five main project components. The first increases\n            domestic market competition by adopting laws and\n            regulations, establishing the functional capacity of the\n            Competition Commission, acquiring public support for\n            competition policy, and completing an investigation of\n            competitiveness. The second component accelerates foreign\n            investment by providing full investor services. The third\n            component expands in-firm skills training and information\n            markets. The fourth component upgrades firm product and\n            process quality by establishing a training system, and\n            setting up government agencies with accredited labs or\n            certification programs. The fifth component increases firm\n            investments in learning and innovation."}, "docdt": "2000-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
