F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The purpose of the Guatemala National Competitiveness Program (PRONACOM), a
public-private partnership under the Comisionado de Inversion y Competitividad and the


                                                 ii
Ministry of Economy, is to advance the nation's international competitive standing and
accelerate its economic growth. The Project aims to advance the Program's objective as
well as those of the nation's Peace Accords by helping primarily small and micro
businesses to generate higher income and reduce high rates of poverty in Guatemala. To
do so, the proposed Project supports a diversified and mutually reinforcing set of
initiatives on two levels:
  (a) in the business environment, seek to increase the competitiveness of product and
factor markets via regulatory changes and new public-private institutional partnerships in
the areas of: (i) domestic competition, (ii) foreign investment, (iii) in-firm skills training
and information; and (iv) product quality infrastructure; and
  (b) at the firm level, aim to broaden micro- and small business participation in national
economic growth by (i) promoting increased investment in firm-level pre-competitive
learning and innovation, (ii) piloting service and delivery innovation in information
technology-based business development services (BDS), and (iii) expanding business
development clusters and social responsibility.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The project development objective remained valid over time, but the key performance
indicators were changed in 2005 to address weaknesses in the original design of the
project components and adjust the expected outcomes.

1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1   Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance):

The project was appraised in a post-conflict environment. In 1996, Guatemala emerged from
36 years of civil war, and the government undertook a vast effort to rebuild the economy,
provide basic services, and improve the overall infrastructure through legislative actions and
privatizations. This came at the expense of larger fiscal deficits, which reached 4 percent of GDP
in 1998. Despite significant remittance inflows from Guatemalans living abroad, the current
account deficit ranged around 5 percent due to weak export prices for Guatemala's traditional
exports in combination with elevated levels of imports. Interest rates in the country were high, in
part due to the government's tendency to borrow on the domestic market. Inflation rates ranged
around 5 percent annually.
Guatemala's international competitiveness was considered to be comparatively weak.
While Guatemala's economy was overall perceived as open and business-oriented, some
oligopolistic market structures and business practices in selected sectors diminished competition
in those areas, and established de facto barriers to entry. Although a rudimentary legal
framework was in place to foster competition1, actual implementation was weak. FDI inflows
stagnated at around 0.5 percent of GDP in 1997 (compared to 1.1 percent for the Latin American
Region, and 3.1 percent for Asia), as a foreign investment law was only adopted in 1998, and
investment promotion to establish Guatemala as an attractive investment country within Central
America was in its infancy. Exports mostly consisted of low value-added primary products such
as coffee and sugar, and the overall export of goods and services stagnated at around 19 percent
of GDP. Investments, both in capital and human resources, were low and available training
resources not adequate, which contributed to low labor productivity and poor product quality.
Furthermore, product quality and certification systems were not available to most firms, and the
awareness of benefits from adhering to quality standards was not well understood by most
enterprises. Overall, economic growth was moderate, and in combination with elevated
population growth rates, led to only marginal increases in GDP per capita.
In the late 1990s, the Government and private sector leaders became interested in
competitiveness, particularly in the topic of cluster formation. A competitiveness office was
established in 1998 in the Ministry of Economy to set a competitiveness agenda, make
recommendations to the government on needed policies and institutional reforms, and coordinate
national efforts related to economic competitiveness. Also, based on the results of North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and preliminary discussions concerning a Central
American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the Government was motivated to seek financing
and technical assistance in the area of competitiveness from the World Bank. This interest led to
the preparation of a Competitiveness Project (the first for Guatemala, and the second, after El
Salvador, in Central America), which was approved on December 14, 2000 by the World Bank
Board. The project was part of the World Bank's strategy to help the government implement the
Peace Program and reduce poverty in the country.

  The Commercial Code of 1970 provides some specifications to protect the rights of competitors and consumers,
including sanctions. Furthermore, the constitution of Guatemala (passed in 1985) includes three articles that address
competition issues.


                                                          1
1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

The project aimed at advancing the objectives of Guatemala's National Competitiveness
Program (PRONACOM) as well as those of the nation's Peace Accord by helping primarily
small and micro businesses to generate higher income and reduce high rates of poverty in
Guatemala2. The proposed Project was to support a diversified and mutually reinforcing set of
initiatives on two levels:
(a) in the business environment - seek to increase the competitiveness of product and factor
markets via regulatory changes and new public-private institutional partnerships in the areas of:
(i) domestic competition, (ii) foreign investment, (iii) in-firm skills training and information; and
(iv) product quality infrastructure; and
(b) at the firm level - aim to broaden micro- and small business participation in national
economic growth by (i) promoting increased investment in firm-level pre-competitive learning
and innovation, (ii) piloting service and delivery innovation in information technology-based
business development services (BDS), and (iii) expanding business development clusters and
social responsibility.

Performance Indicators:
Key performance indicators were specified in detail in Annex 1 of the Project Appraisal
Document. As overarching outcome metrics the document determined the incremental value
added and employment generated among participating micro and small businesses, as well as the
achievement of institutional development plans for the Competition Commission, "Invest in
Guatemala", the National Training Council, and the National Statistics Superintendency.
Furthermore, Annex 1 provided detailed and quantifiable performance indicators for each
individual subcomponent. It was suggested that project performance at closing would be
measured by a representative sample of Project clients stratified by income segment,
geographical location and sales market, and compared with the baseline control group of 296
firms surveyed in 1998 to help define the project design. Annex 2d provides detailed information
on the actual achievements made under those initial indicators.

1.3      Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

The project development objective remained unchanged during project implementation,
but the key performance indicators were adapted to match changes in the national
competitiveness framework and institutional arrangements. As will be described under 2.1.,
the original key performance indicators were overly ambitious, and some of the data was not
readily available or progress strongly hinged on the approval of institutional reforms. Thus, after
the project components were regrouped in 2004 (see 1.6.), four new key performance indicators
were introduced in the status reports (see Section F upfront) which measured the results of the
reforms supported by the two key agencies in charge of reform implementation, PRONACOM
and INVEST. The suggested survey at project closing was not carried out, as the group of

  In should be noted, that the legal agreement uses a different wording, namely "to foster economic growth and
reduce poverty in Guatemala by assisting primarily micro and small businesses in expanding their activities, creating
employment opportunities and generating higher income". The ICR will use the objective and intermediate
objectives as stated in the PAD, which was also used during supervision.

beneficiaries and the type of support they received under the project had been rather diverse,
which made tracking the direct impact of the project through a single survey difficult.. Instead,
the Bank and the counterpart conducted two ICAs and two special surveys on informal firms
during project implementation, which provided some information on MSMEs and key barriers to
their development.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries:

This project supported a two-folded approach with regard to key beneficiaries. According
to the project appraisal document, the direct target population of the project was expected to be
the institutions and stakeholders involved with the Competition Commission, the Investment
Promotion Agency, the National Training Council and the National Statistics Superintendency.
Additionally, micro- and small medium sized enterprises were determined to be the target
beneficiaries of direct interventions under the firm-level components. In the long run, it was
expected that micro-, small and medium sized enterprises would profit the most from the reforms
to enhance the business environment and investment climate in Guatemala. The main
beneficiaries remained unchanged during implementation.

1.5    Original Components (as approved):

The project had 7 components:
   1. Increasing Domestic Market Competition: support for (i) Drafting a competition law
       and its regulations for its implementation; (ii) In case of adoption of the law, technical
       assistance to the Competition Commission and support for a public information strategy
       to inform the public in general about the law; and (iii) Design of a corporate competition
       policy program (analyses and case studies of anti-competitive business practices).
   2. Accelerating Foreign Direct Investment through (i) Establishment of an FDI promotion
       council provision of training for its institutional strengthening; (ii) Analysis of the legal
       and regulatory framework for foreign investment registration; (iii) Analysis of the legal,
       regulatory and institutional framework governing the transport of exported goods.

       the payroll training levy framework and design of reform strategy to improve its
       application and administration; (ii) Design and implementation of a training promotion
       campaign and extension services to assist businesses in assessing in-firm training needs:
       (iv) Preparation of a draft law and regulations to strengthen the Borrower's statistics
       system; (v) In case of adoption of the law, provision of technical assistance to the newly
       created National Statistics Superintendency and design of a public information campaign
       including seminars, workshops and conferences to inform the public about the law.
   4. Upgrading firm product and process quality. Under this component it was foreseen to
       provide for (i) Training programs in quality assurance practice for SME and selected
       public entities; (ii) Establishment of a Standards and Conformity Information Center; (iii)
       A program for the certification of non-traditional exports (ISO 1400); and (iv) Technical
       assistance and training to strengthen the institutional capacity of the national quality
       system.

                                                 3
         and business development plans; (ii) Grants for the implementation of said plans; (iii)
         Vouchers to benefit from business development services; and (iv) Promotion of said
         program in the business community.
      6. Enhance Information Technology-based Business Development Services: through (i)
         The design and implementation of a pilot program to provide information on information
         technology-based business development services; (ii) Support the construction of about
         10 community-based centers; (iii) The provision of technical assistance to develop
         product services; and (iv) Delivery of training based on an impact evaluation.
      7. Expand Business clusters and social responsibility programs: support to (i) Develop a
         cluster program for businesses; provide technical assistance to facilitate the organization
         of clusters, carry out assessments of cross-cluster issues, and promote and disseminate
         said program; and (ii) Develop a business social responsibility program, which links
         large-scale businesses with SMEs and communities to increase SME productivity and
         enhance socio-economic interests.

Additionally, support for the project implementation unit was foreseen, but not mentioned
separately in the legal document.

1.6      Revised Components:

In 2004, a separate component was added in the legal document to provide technical
assistance, equipment and capacity building support for the revamped management unit
PRONACOM. The latter had become necessary as PRONACOM was transformed into a
public-private partnership housed logistically outside the Ministry of Economy, which helped
shield the unit from political influence and enhanced its credibility with the private sector and
civil society. Furthermore, the unit not only managed the project administratively, but also
                                                                                                   provided       strategic

Additionally, the project components were modified to add flexibility with a view to the
evolving Competitiveness Agenda for 2005-20153. The new political context under the Berger
administration, as well as recommendations emerging from the signing of the CAFTA agreement
and the Investment Climate Assessment (both in 2004) led to the development of a new
Competitiveness Agenda in 2004/05 with PRONACOM support. As can be seen in Annex 2a,
the agenda was based on a broad consensus among the government, the private sector and civil
society and aimed at promoting the country's competitiveness through a broader array of topics
than initially foreseen in 1999. In anticipation of the new agenda, which was eventually launched
in September 2005 and supported through a series of development policy loans (DPLs), the
amendment in 2004 enabled new activities to be added under the existing components through
exchange of letters and mutual consent between the government and the World Bank. This
allowed greater flexibility in the scope and implementation of individual components, helped
address reforms supported under the three DPLs and facilitated the use of alliances among public
and private sector actors. However, it further increased the complexity of the project.

With hindsight, this restructuring came too early and failed to correct the overly ambitious
design. The strategic axes (the so-called "ejes") of the government's competitiveness agenda
launched in late 2005 were broader and used a different terminology. Thus, the project
components were not fully aligned with the government's new agenda, and PRONACOM since
2005 had the dual task of promoting the broader government agenda and at the same time
implementing the already complex project. Additionally, none of the suggested institutional
reforms were abandoned or the expected outcomes adjusted to the political and cultural realities
in the country. In retrospect, the restructuring ­ triggered by the change in the institutional
change for INVEST and PRONACOM ­ came too early, and prevented a more thorough
restructuring in 2005 after the launch of the new agenda.

Since 2005, funds allocated for individual components were adjusted twice through third-
level restructurings to better reflect actual project implementation 4 . Efforts to launch
matching grants on a larger scale proved unsuccessful, and the voucher scheme was not
implemented due to lack of government commitment. Both schemes were eventually abandoned,
and the funding allocated to them reduced or cancelled in 2007. Instead, several smaller
initiatives were supported, as discussed in more depth under outcomes. With regard to the IT-
based development services, the project did not develop a new network, but supported the
enhancement of a project launched by third parties. This lowered disbursements under this
component. As the drafted legal frameworks to create a competition commission and the
statistics superintendency were not approved, the two institutions could not be created and
resources allocated for works and goods were reduced accordingly. On the other hand,
components to stimulate domestic market competition and foster business clusters had higher
disbursements to fund a marketing campaign for competitiveness and to help create additional
clusters, and available funds were reassigned to those areas. The evolution of allocated resources
and actual levels of funding by component and expense category are provided in Annex 1.

  See letters to the Minister of Finance on September 2007 and December 2007 for this third-level project
restructuring. Since the expense categories had a close link to the individual project components, the change was
done through revising the project costs by procurement arrangements.

As these changes in scope did not affect the overall objective of the project, and none of the
original components were formally dropped, the completion report uses the initial labeling of
components to facilitate comparison of the reforms suggested at appraisal and actual
achievements made.


1.7    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):

The project became effective with a delay of one and a half years. Congressional approval
took 11 months, as the incoming Congress needed time to become operational and review and
discuss all the presented laws and projects. The government further delayed effectiveness by
signing the loan agreement only in May 2002 - after all the conditions for effectiveness were
fulfilled5 . This slowed project implementation in the initial 18 months after Board approval,
although a few small activities were commenced due to available bridge financing under a
PHRD grant.

The loan was extended twice, and disbursed around three quarters of the initial loan
amount. Loan closing, which was initially foreseen for end of December 2004, was extended
twice to close on June 30, 2009. The extensions became necessary as project implementation was
placed on hold during 2003 due to detected irregularities in the expenditures, general corruption
concerns as well as a lack of government commitment (see 2.2). Thus, by end of 2003, the
project had disbursed only 3.4 percent of its available funds, far short of the original foreseen
targets. Under the Berger government, project execution was initially slower than expected due
to the task of starting the project again, forming a technically qualified team and develop of a
strategic framework for competitiveness. In 2007, US$ 1.5 million were cancelled with view to
remaining timeframe. A further US$ 3 million was cancelled upon project closing due to delays
in implementation under the current Colom government. Despite the many delays and the
dropping of the matching grant and voucher scheme, the project disbursed over 75 percent of the
Bank's initially foreseen project funds, received the expected share of government funds and
generated more than US$ 10 million in other contributions through project alliances, cost-sharing
arrangements in conferences, free newspaper coverage, and office space made available to
PRONACOM and INVEST. Two staff were also seconded from the MOE and the Central Bank
to PRONACOM to work on specific strategic activities, including business environment and
process improvements and develop a statistical basis for tracking national competitiveness.

Procurement regulations were amended twice to facilitate the cumbersome overall process.
In 2004, the legal amendment adjusted a few contracting procedures and thresholds for
consultant services, i.e. allowing small contracts for consultants to be done through direct
contracting up to a certain threshold. A second amendment was signed in March 2007 to
introduce the 2004 World Bank procurement guidelines and to permit procurement based on a
pre-approved annual project and contracting plan. These changes had become necessary due to
the multitude of small procurements that had to be approved by the Bank in the earlier years, and

5
 Amongst the conditions for effectiveness were the establishments of financial management systems, the staffing of
PRONACOM, and the elaboration of a Management Agreement for the Competitiveness Learning and Innovation
Program and the creation of a supervisory committee for it.


                                                        6
which proved to be cumbersome and time consuming for both parties and led to considerable
frustration particularly on the part of the implementation agency. Despite these changes, some of
the procurement problems persisted as PRONACOM did not fully adhere to the pre-approved
plans and continued to add new items.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

The project was government driven and benefited from close collaboration between the
government, the Bank and other stakeholders. It was based on prior in-depth analytical work
to assess bottlenecks to competitiveness6, and benefitted from experience gathered in the only
existing competitiveness project in Central America, the Competitiveness Enhancement
Technical Assistance project in El Salvador approved in 1995, as well as other private sector
projects in the LAC region. The project complemented various other Bank projects, and FIAS
and IFC were closely involved in the design of the investment promotion components. In
parallel, some grants were provided to foster the work program on the competitiveness agenda. A
PPIAF grant supported in the early years of project implementation the preparation of concession
strategies for ports, airports and roads, and also provided bridge funding for project start-up. A
follow-up grant supported the development of a draft concession law.

Despite the solid analytical base and good collaboration, quality at entry is rated as
moderately unsatisfactory. The project design was complex and included too many
components. While this was not unusual for a competitiveness project at the time and can add
flexibility into a project to accommodate variations in government focus and market
opportunities over time, it nevertheless comes with the risk of spreading human and capital
resources too thinly over individual components and thus losing traction. Furthermore, the
project's strong focus on institution building proved overly ambitious for the Guatemalan context
and its outcome targets were ambitious for a timeframe of four years. As identified during
appraisal, oligopolistic market structures in selected market segments created strong vested
interests in Guatemala, which first needed to be overcome to pass a competition law and
establishing a Competition Commission. Furthermore, the incoming government in 2000 did not
seek the assumed private sector participation in its reform program, and competitiveness issues
did not get the expected attention despite its earlier promise to include competition issues in its
economic plan. Thus - with hindsight - the expectation that the concerted effort by the outgoing
government to promote the competitiveness agenda undertaken during 1997 and 1998 had
created a lasting platform for reforms, proved to be wrong. Finally, the original monitoring and
evaluation indicators were well specified, but ambitious in their targets. For example, the
expectation that 800 smaller companies would establish quality systems within 4 years grossly
underestimated the effort needed to establish a "quality culture" in the country, especially when
starting from such a low base and given the lack of local certification service providers.

2.2     Implementation (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project
at Risk status, and actions taken, as applicable):

6
  The project benefitted for example from a Skills, Technology and Productivity survey of 296 SMEs carried out by
the Bank prior to project preparation, as well as from a FIAS investment promotion strategy developed in 1998.


                                                        7
By early 2003, indications of problems with project implementation became apparent. Staff
turnover in both PRONACOM and INVEST was high in the initial years, in part due to low
remuneration, but also frequent changes in the ministries and management level of PRONACOM
and INVEST. Thus, some of the initial institutional capacity building undertaken by MIGA for
INVEST7 became obsolete when the trained staff left the agency in 2002 and 2003. Furthermore,
implementation of project components was delayed with view to budgetary constraints, a change
in government priorities, a deterioration in the relationship between the government and the
private sector8, and a perceived risk of corruption at various levels of government. Given the
above, the Bank opted to stall project implementation in 2003, and all project activities came to a
full standstill until the Berger government came to power in 2004. During this time, project
performance was flagged as unsatisfactory.

Overall, the country's low revenue base, which limited fiscal space, and cumbersome
budget procedures negatively impacted project implementation. Since 2000, the different
administrations were committed to fiscal stability, and believed in containing government
expenditures to avoid raising taxes. With a government debt ratio of 17 percent of GDP in 2000,
Guatemala was one of the least indebted countries in Latin America, but the low tax rate (around
10 percent of GDP in 1999) in combination with the government's fiscal prudence also meant
that available funds for infrastructure, education and overall economic development programs
were comparatively scarce. Additionally, project funds had to be approved by Congress, both at
appraisal for the entire loan amount and also annually for the expected yearly spending envelop
as part of the overall budget exercise. This procedure was cumbersome, and led to frequent
downsizing of project funds planned for disbursement in a given year 9 . The lower annual
spending envelope remained an issue throughout program implementation, despite an emerging
pattern that towards the end of the fiscal year additional fiscal space would be offered for
planned project activities due to the project's track record of being able to use all allocated
resources (compared to 30-40 percent for other Bank projects in Guatemala). At times, the lack
of fiscal space also curtailed available funding to follow-through on elaborated reform programs
such as infrastructure investments, and lowered the available funding for the institutions
supported under this project (i.e. the Statistics Institute INE, the Metrology Lab, and
PRONACOM and INVEST after project closing).

The project was implemented under three different governments, which led to changes in
focus and slowed implementation in the transition years.
    The Portillo government was not interested in reforms in the area of business
       development services for micro-enterprises, transport, training, and business social
       responsibility, and implementation of those components was temporarily placed on hold
       upon the government's request. Furthermore, there was little trust between the

7
  Then still called PROGUAT
8
  As a result of the lack of communication between the private sector and the government, the Executive Committee
of PRONACOM did not meet to approve the work program for 2003, thus putting funding of new initiatives on
hold.
9
  In many instances, PRONACOM was only able to get about two-third of the annual funds it requested approved by
Congress, although the money was available through the project. On the positive note, PRONACOM was able to
execute between 97-103 per cent of those approved funds every year, with on some occasions funds from slow-
disbursing projects being assigned mid-year to PRONACOM as supplement.


                                                       8
        government and the private sector, and ­ as discussed above - the overall pace of
        implementation of reforms during these years was low.
        With the assumption of power by President Oscar Berger in January 2004, the tone of
        public-private sector discussions became much more constructive. This led to the
        development of more refined National Competitiveness Agenda for 2005-2015, a long-
        term plan to unify private and public sector efforts to improve national competitiveness10.
        While this plan provided the overall roadmap, it was not an action plan and lacked
        sequencing, priorities, timelines and measurable outcome indicators. The Berger
        government initially placed a stronger focus on export markets, and fostered reforms in
        the ports, airports and customs area, but also supported reforms in the area of quality and
        certification / accreditation. The Berger administration formed the Office of the
        Commissioner for Investment and Competitiveness to lead efforts to improve the
        business climate, attract foreign direct investment, and help make national firms more
        competitive in international markets. The creation of this high-level position, which
        reported directly to the President and participated in the Economic Cabinet, gave a clear
        signal of the government's ownership of the competitiveness reform agenda, and helped
        coordinate and implement needed reforms.
        The current Colom administration places greater emphasis on inclusive and broad-based
        growth, mostly through rural development, improving productivity and investment, but
        also through stronger social spending to the poor. Within PRONACOM, infrastructure
        and energy, reduction of informality and bridging the economic gap between Guatemala
        City and the rest of the country have become core issues.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The original monitoring and evaluation indicators were too ambitious, and cumbersome to
track. The project appraisal document provided an extensive list of key performance indicators,
which included quantifiable targets at a time when this was not yet an official requirement in the
Bank. The indicators were well suited to track the impact of the suggested reforms, but
individual targets were too ambitious and the indicators hinged strongly on the success of
institutional reforms. When the latter did not materialized due to the political and cultural context
in the country11, the indicators became obsolete. Furthermore, most of the interventions on the
subcomponent level were implemented by NGOs, think tanks, private firms or government
agencies operating in Guatemala. This made tracking the data on a sub-component level
complicated, as each entity had a different (or no) approach to monitoring and PRONACOM had
too little leverage to make them change their systems12. Furthermore, data on SME development
was not readily available due to a lack of statistical information, and could thus not be monitored
regularly. To bridge some of the data gap, it was suggested to conduct a survey at the end of the
project to assess the project's impact on micro, small and medium sized firms, with particular

   The National Agenda also reflected results from the Investment Climate Assessment delivered by the Bank in
2004.
11
   i.e., the Competition Commission and the Statistical Superintendency could not be launched as strong vested
interests prevented the necessary changes in the legal framework.
12
   Several efforts were done for example to enhance the information systems of the grupo gestores or AGER to track
output and outcomes, but with little success. In the absence of solid information, the support was eventually
dropped.

focus on those beneficiaries which had received matching grants and participated in the voucher
scheme. However, as the latter two did not materialize, and much of the individual reform
measures supported under the other components reached out to a diverse group of beneficiaries,
no survey was conducted upon completion.

Instead of the original indicators, the Bank team introduced four new performance
indicators in the status report in April 2005 (after the formal restructuring of the project
components). The new indicators focused on the institutional capacity and sustainability of the
two main institutions of the project, which were the key drivers of the reform process,
PRONACOM and INVEST. The Bank also regularly monitored outcomes based on the
indicators in the Doing Business and Global Competitiveness Reports13, and used information
available from the two ICAs delivered during project implementation14. Furthermore, missions
regularly visited different sub-projects to discuss progress on the ground. The mid-term review in
2007 also provided additional indicators to track outputs under individual initiatives and the
position of a monitoring expert was created within PRONACOM to follow up on them. As a
result, since 2007 PRONACOM sent the Bank quarterly information on the status of individual
sub-components. PRONACOM and INVEST also produced a number of presentations and
publications to make progress achieved towards the implementation of the competitiveness
program of the government available to a broader audience, and reported regularly to the Comite
Ampliado, in which various stakeholders and government officials were represented. This
allowed for transparency, as well as enhanced understanding and ownership within the country
for the reform progress. This approach proved effective to monitor the pace of implementation
and guide project activities while keeping costs of monitoring at bay. However, as the focus was
mostly on the planned outputs, this led to a paucity of readily available information on actual
outcomes achieved under individual sub-components and to measure the impact on MSMEs
benefiting directly from the project.


2.3    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as
applicable):

The Bank had a strong focus on fiduciary compliance during project implementation, and
much time was devoted to procurement reviews. Project irregularities were discovered in
2003, but settled under the new government after a careful review of the documents. The Bank
pushed for the hiring of procurement specialists and an upgrade in the computer system of
PRONACOM in 2004, and focused strongly on procurement issues and capacity building in
supervision missions between 2004 and 200615 and through the resident mission procurement
specialist afterwards. Weak capacity was a common feature of almost all bank projects in
Guatemala, and the resident mission provided regular training to the procurement specialists in
individual project implementation units of the government. As a result of those efforts, no further
13
   Those reports were not yet available at the time of project appraisal. The Global Competitiveness Report was
launched in 2001/02, and Doing Business in 2003.
14
   The first ICA was delivered in 2004, and had a focus on the manufacturing sector. The second ICA was conducted
in 2007, with a broader focus, and delivered in 2008. Each had a sample size of more than 450 firms, and provided
statistically valid insights into the progress and problems faced by SMEs.
15
   This included several missions by financial management and procurement specialists of the World Bank, who
provided technical assistance and reviewed in-depth the procurement processes undertaken.


                                                       10
systemic issues were found after 2003, as the available fiduciary systems improved markedly.
Nonetheless, the project required an inordinate amount of fiduciary review by the Bank, as
demonstrated by the number of no objections (in 2005, over 350 no objections; more than 240 in
2006).

2.4      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase:

There are several projects ongoing or planned to further Guatemala's competitiveness.
Since the current government has a strong focus on rural development, most of the Bank, IDB
and bilateral donor support is now tailored to rural areas, but include competitiveness
components such as business development support or export and investment promotion 16 .
Additionally, the Private Sector Group of the World Bank is currently working on an assessment
of impediments to growth for SMEs, which will provide input into the development of a new
SME project planned for 2010.

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:

The objectives of the project were relevant. Guatemala is one of the countries with the highest
income inequality of the world, and the project aimed at bridging this gap through direct support
for a stronger inclusion of small and medium businesses in the economy, as well as through
policy support to foster an enabling environment for broad based growth.

Although the various governments had a different focus within the competitiveness agenda,
the National Agenda for Competitiveness remains valid. As can be seen in the Chart in Annex
2a, the agenda was developed with strong stakeholder participation, and discussed on various
levels of government. This created lasting ownership for the reforms and contributed to the
agenda's continued relevance. The Bank supported the agenda through a series of three annual
development policy loans17, and continues to place strong focus on broad-based growth in its
new Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-12. A new project to address competitiveness on the
peri-urban level is currently planned for FY11. The new project will build on a Country
Economic Memorandum on barriers to SME development, which is currently under preparation.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives:

The supported reforms helped the country make progress towards its stated
competitiveness objective. The Colom government aims at becoming the most competitive
country within the region, and to increase the per capita income to US$ 8.500 at the end of 2030,

16
   To give a few examples, the Bank is currently implementing a program to enhance rural development, which
focuses on infrastructure provision and The BID has recently approved projects to foster exports and promote
foreign investments, to foster cadastre registration and to support competitiveness in the South West of the country.
USAID is particularly active in the area of cluster development, and other bilateral donors support the quality
infrastructure in Guatemala.

and August 2007.

in order to bring poverty down to 20 per cent of the population18. The project made a clear
contribution towards this goal. Having traditionally been on the low side, growth since 2004
picked up and reached 4.4 percent on average between 2004 and 200819, compared to 3.1 percent
between 2000 and 2003. Gross fixed capital formation in the private sector peaked at 17 percent
of GDP in 2006 compared to 13.7 percent in 2000.GDP per capita grew 1.9 percent annually
between 2004 and 2008 (compared to 0.6 percent during 1986-96), in spite of the comparatively
high population growth rates. GNI per capita (Atlas method, 2008) now stands at US$ 2670,
compared to US$ 1730 in 2000.

Guatemala made substantial progress in improving its business enabling environment and
increasing its competitiveness since 2004. Due to project supported reforms undertaken in
areas such as starting a business, obtaining a construction permit and registering property,
Guatemala now ranks on place 110 worldwide in the ease of doing business indicator20, ahead of
most of its neighbors. It was praised as a top ten reformer worldwide in the Doing Business
report of 2005/06, and was the top reformer in Central America a year later. The Global
Competitiveness Report rankings confirm the overall favorable evolution of Guatemala's
competitiveness. Guatemala's GCI score increased from 3.38 in 2004 to 3.96 in this year's
report, thus closing some of the measured gap towards regional top performers (see Chart 2). As
will be discussed in more detail below, foreign direct investment as a share of GDP more than
tripled due to efforts by INVEST to promote Guatemala as an attractive investment destination,
and in 2007 and 2008 accounted for 2.1 percent of GDP compared to 0.6 percent in 2003.
However, as can be seen in Chart 2, this is still at a comparatively low level. Exports in both
traditional and non-traditional exports expanded by 44 percent since 2004 (9.4 percent on an
annual basis). Project support through INVEST and the cluster work contributed to a change in
the composition of exports, and facilitated a broader diversification across export destinations.
Exports to the USA now only accounted for 41 per cent in 2008 (52 per cent in 2000), while
exports to Central America surged to 29 percent (21 percent in 2000) and to the European Union
to 24 percent (compared to 17 percent in 2000)21.

On the firm level, there is some indication that small and medium sized enterprises were
able to profit from the undertaken reforms of the business environment. Based on regular
perception based surveys undertaken by ASIES, a local think tank22, the perception gap between
large and small enterprises regarding their production, income and employment evolution has
narrowed over the years (see Chart 2 for income evolution). Fewer MSMEs reported a reduction
in production between 2004 and 2007; however many micro-enterprises continued to see their

   The initial competitiveness agenda did not provide a measurable outcome indicator, thus the project's
achievements are described based on the indicators introduced under the current government.

   It should be noted that - as in many other countries in the region and worldwide ­ growth and investments
dropped off again since late 2007 due to the impact of the international economic and financial crisis. Also, the
effects of CAFTA have not yet fully materialized (see US Trade Statistics for 2007-2008.
20
   Doing Business does not offer the rankings for the earlier years, as the number of countries participating in the DB
surveys has grown, thus making a comparison of overall rankings between the year difficult.

businesses shrink in the face of competition from the informal sector23. Income and employment
evolution also show a positive trend prior to the economic crisis, with most SMEs reporting
positive income since 2005/06 and a surge in employment. The biggest reported improvement
appears to have been in the in-firm investments, which increased strongly over the years for all
sizes of enterprises. Most of these indicators deteriorated again after the outbreak of the
international financial crisis in the fall of 2007, but the perception gap between large and small
enterprises continued to be narrower. The more negative data for MSMEs reflects the strong
competition in the economic areas where MSMEs are active, and also mirror a normal transition
of businesses that enter and leave the formal market. However, some of the data also reflects the
high costs for security, which affects smaller enterprises to a larger extent, and also the lack of
integration of small enterprises into larger networks. The latter stems from cultural preferences,
but also reflects the prevailing oligopolistic structures amongst larger companies in some sectors.

The project had some measurable direct impact on the development of micro, small and
medium sized enterprises, but there is no comprehensive data available to show overall
impact. For example, supported through the tourism cluster, almost 2000 new hotels and other
lodgings emerged throughout Guatemala ­ mostly small in size, with between 10 to 15 beds -
and income from tourisms increased by around 50 percent between 2004 and 2008. The ICT
cluster supported the development of over 500 small web-designers, and hard- and software
dealers. In the ornamental plants cluster, project support helped the mostly small producers
increase their production by 13 percent annually. MSMEs also received business planning
support through a variety of small initiatives, such as " Idea tu Empresa".




23
  It can also be assumed that some of the smaller enterprises have an incentive to downplay production and income
with view to taxation.

3.2.1 Progress towards enhancing the business environment.

A, Increasing domestic market competition (moderately satisfactory)

In the absence of true government ownership, a new competition framework was not
approved, leaving Guatemala as the only country in Central America without a functional
legal and institutional framework for competition. It was expected at appraisal that a new
regulatory framework and functional competition commission could be established to reduce
unfair market competition in Guatemala, and improve consumer protection. A first draft
                                                        competition law was developed in 2002,

                                                        industry24. Other means were also pursued
to improve the competitiveness of key sectors. For instance, the Ministry of Energy and Mining
started to execute a plan in early 2008 to improve competition in this key sector, with direct
support from PRONACOM.

While reforms to the institutional framework failed, some achievements were nevertheless
made with project support to improve competition in selected economic sectors. As shown
in Box 1, competition in the juice and beverage industry increased with project support.
PRONACOM also supported the newly established regulatory agency in the telecommunications
sector (SIT) through the development of a software to assess pricing and costs in the sector. The
tool enabled the regulatory agency to trace potentially unfair market behavior. Guatemala made
excellent progress in the last years in the area of telecommunications, with the largest fixed line
provider, Telgua, now only representing 56 percent of the market, compared to 82 percent in
2004. Prices for mobile phones are reportedly amongst the lowest in the region, with
international calls to the US and Central America comparing favorably to the neighboring
24
     . See ECLAC (2006) for a more in-depth discussion of the legal framework and existing market structures.

countries25. The available ICT infrastructure in the country was one of the core factors for the
successful establishment of the call center industry in the country, which has doubled in the last
4 years with INVEST support to over 50 companies. Furthermore, as part of a PRONACOM
supported larger modernization package, the Aurora airport underwent certification under the
International Aviation Safety Assessment, which allowed for direct flights to the US and Europe
out of the airport. There are now 10 international airlines operating around 240 weekly flights
into Guatemala, 80 of which are operated by American companies. A large share of the
American tourists use the airport as entry point, and passenger and cargo transport has become
more competitive.

                             The project should also be credited for having brought
                             competition and the broader competitiveness issue to the level of
                             a national agenda. To foster understanding of competition issues,
                             PRONACOM launched a competitiveness campaign to disseminate
                             knowledge and raise awareness. The project financed the
                             development and broad dissemination of the National
                             Competitiveness Agenda in 2004 and 2005, and also commissioned a
                             publication on Guatemala's competitiveness potential in 200626. The
                             latter was widely distributed among universities, high schools,
                             stakeholders and other potential multipliers, and trainings were
                             developed based on the information. As one of the results, one of the
                             universities in the country now offers a course on competitiveness.
Additionally, PRONACOM launched or participated in numerous national and sub-national
workshops with the objective to foster awareness for competitiveness issues, disseminated results
of initiated reforms over the web (generating over 15,000 visits on their webpage in 2007 alone)
and through publications, and launched an impressive media campaign in 2008. Overall,
PRONACOM managed to get good media coverage through its work, with for example 178
articles written by journalists on competitiveness issues in local newspapers during 2008. Based
on estimates for the cost of advertisement by size and newspaper, it estimated that the "free"
media coverage achieved between 2005 and 2008 equates to US$ 1.6 million. PRONACOM's
efforts were praised by CEPAL (2006), which highlights that PRONACOM has been the key
driver in the competition area and recommends sustained efforts in order to foster an informed
and objective debate in the country and eventually create the needed broad support for
competition reforms.

Efforts were also made to raise domestic awareness of key international competitiveness
indicators and Guatemala's positioning in the global context. FUNDESA, a local NGO,
promoted the indicators within the country, and also became the main counterpart for the
indicator work with the international counterparts. This not only led to more serious efforts to fill
out the surveys for the indicators within the country, but also enhanced knowledge on the DB
and GCI rankings within the public and private sector and facilitated reform progress27. Similar

   Most stakeholders interviewed during the ICR mission mentioned this area of work, and were aware of the core
international indicators.

efforts were made in the area of country risk classification, where PRONACOM served as
platform for key stakeholders and government official to discuss issues and strategies to improve
Guatemala's overall standing. These efforts led to a significant amount of press coverage of the
indicators and Guatemala's positioning worldwide, and also helped improve Guatemala's risk
classification by the key rating agencies, as the Table below reveals. PRONACOM has been a
member of the Country Risk group since its inception, based on a Presidential Decree. This has
been an important example of public-private partnership to promote the country. The
international risk ratings have been stable over the past year, despite the global financial crisis.

B: Accelerating Foreign Direct Investment (satisfactory)

Increasing the level of foreign direct investment was one of the core elements of the project,
with a quarter of all funds being earmarked for this component. The project was designed to
accelerate FDI through reforms on three areas: (i) the creation of a public-private Investment
Promotion Agency, (ii) an improvement of the one-stop facilitation services, and (iii) improving
the international supply chain of services. As progress on all three areas was achieved, this
component is rated to have been satisfactory.

During 2004 and 2007, the project created an operational and institutional platform that
enabled the Investment Promotion Agency INVEST to rapidly generate tangible results.
Through the Presidential Degree in 2004, INVEST became a quasi public private partnership
with a supervisory board consisting of both government and the private sector. Reporting directly
to a committed Commissioner (and Vice-Commissioner) to the President, INVEST received the
needed political mandate and support for its work, and profited from comparatively stable
funding under the project (the absence of both had prevented its predecessor PROGUAT to
function properly).

INVEST executed a fully fledged investment promotion strategy which translated into
better than expected outcomes. With MIGA support, a business development plan was
elaborated, and its implementation funded by the project. INVEST developed a significant
number of activities in all the key areas of investment promotion: image promotion, investor
servicing and investment generation. It promoted Guatemala as an investment destination at over
37 international trade and investment fairs, produced around 130 international publications and
developed over 20 promotional road shows. As a result of INVESTs promotional activities,
Guatemala was put on the map of potential investors and its foreign direct investments as a share



                                                17
of GDP more than tripled. Those who became interested in Guatemala received direct and
personal support from INVESTs staff. Proactive promotion was undertaken in strategic sectors
such as agri-business, manufacturing, call centers, and tourism (for a more detailed description of
activities, see Annex 9). INVEST succeeded in attracting, supporting and facilitating US$ 944
million of new FDI and over 24,000 new jobs between 2005 and 2008, according to the estimates
from a study evaluating the effects of the investment (see Annex 9). Thus, INVEST was able to
exceed by 350% its investment generation objective (US$ 206 million) and by 20% its job
creation target (20,000 new jobs). This is a remarkable and rapid success for a new agency which
had to operate in a highly competitive environment where decisions tend to take over 18 months
to materialize. The promotion and development of the call centers industry is a successful
showcase of INVEST's proactive sector-specific promotion (see Box 2). The positive
performance was also recognized by FIAS and the World Bank in the latest Global Investment
Promotion Benchmark 2009 which tracks the performance and capabilities of 181 investment
promotion intermediaries and which labeled INVEST as one of the better performing investment
promotion agencies.

                                                                            INVEST gradually lost

a further deterioration in the institutional capacity and resulted in some more staff turn-over.
Since 2009, insecurity of funding after the closing of the project finally brought the institution to
the point of being practically dismantled; much to the regret of many stakeholders who gave
INVEST high marks for its performance prior to 2009.

With regard to one-stop facilitation services, the project successfully introduced reforms
pertaining to business registration and operation. Measurable progress was made to facilitate



                                                   18
the registration of business, namely through the establishment of a single registration form and
electronic linkage of processes between the various agencies involved (the so-called ventanilla
agil). Furthermore, a live chat facility to clarify issues on-line between the registering party and
the mercantile registry was created. Those efforts succeeded in reducing the number of
procedures from 15 to 11, and the time needed for registration from a measured 39 days in 2004
to 26 in 200828. The live-chat was praised by users as very helpful29. However, the underlying
electronic platform for business registration was placed on hold during the current government
for legal reasons30, thus increasing the measured time again to 29 days (DB 2010). A law to
allow electronic signatures has been approved recently, and could potentially foster the
digitalization of registration, particularly on regional levels31. Efforts to facilitate administrative
hurdles were also successful in the area of property registration, obtaining work visas for
foreigners32, and obtaining sanitary licenses33. .

Progress was also achieved to enhance the international supply chain of services, but
infrastructure continues to be one of the biggest bottlenecks in the country. PRONACOM
facilitated reforms in the Superintendencia de Administracion Tributaria, which led to a
significant drop in customs clearance times for imports and exports34. To modernize the Aurora
Airport in Guatemala City, the project funded new computer equipment and helped facilitate the
reforms. As described above, ten international airlines are now coming into the airport, and the
number of passengers and overall air traffic increased to over 4 million passengers per year over
time. Furthermore, several legal initiatives were supported, such as the drafting of the maritime
law to enhance the functioning of the sector and establish a Maritime Port Authority, and a
recent private-public partnership law to allow private investments into infrastructure projects.
The laws are still pending government approval. Finally, a Spanish / US consultancy helped
develop a list of the 10 most critical road projects to be financed over the next few years (the so-
called "plan multimodal") to help prioritize government expenditures for infrastructure.

C: In-firm skills training and information markets (moderately satisfactory)

Efforts were made to enhance the national training system and foster private training
companies, but a broader reform has not been achieved. Low education and skill levels were
and are considered to be a key constraint across a variety of sectors. The component aimed at

   This is however still high, both in regional and international comparison. Under "starting a business", Guatemala
ranks 28 out of 32 countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region, despite the recent progress.

   For example, one of the interviewed stakeholders mentioned that the live chat could help clarify whether a
company name was already taken, or to clarify other arising questions.
30
   The current government criticized that the ventanilla agil was based on voluntary agreement between the agencies,
and not in line with the law which foresees consecutive processing of the registration by individual agencies.
31
   Since applications are only processed centrally in Guatemala City, business registration applications are sent via
mail from local government agencies to the registry for processing, which adds at least another 6 days to the overall
time needed.
32
   The requirement to leave a "deposit" upon entry was eliminated, thus reducing the number of administrative steps
needed to 5. However, obtaining a visa still poses a significant hurdle to doing business as a foreigner in the country,
as reported by companies during the mission.
33
   Time needed to get a sanitary license dropped i.e. from 60 days in 2005 to 20 days at the end of 2007.
34
   According to data provided by the SAT, clearance time for air cargo dropped from twelve hours, and for seaports
from 4 days to less than a day. The Doing Business Indicators confirm this positive development, with time for
importing dropping from 35 days to 17 days.

enhancing the human capital in the country through improving the national vocational training
system, opening up the market to private sector participation, and fostering the use of training
courses by the enterprise sector. With project funds, a study to assess options for modification of
the training system was conducted in 2001, and discussed at a workshop with key stakeholders35.
Furthermore, a survey to assess demand and supply of training was done in 2003, and guidelines
for the accreditation of private trainers developed upon request of the Minister of Labor.
However, it eventually became clear that there was not sufficient political support to push
through a more systematic revamping of the training system in the country (including the
elimination of the levy), and the focus on opening up the market was eventually dropped. A new
effort to push for broader reform was funded in 2006 and 2007 through a benchmarking study of
the national system with the systems in Chile, Peru and Mexico, but again without triggering
major changes. The project also supported reforms on the small scale. It pushed for
enhancements to the general education system in the country, sponsored a campaign to promote
bilingualism, and provided funding to INTECAP, various NGOs and universities to offer
entrepreneurial training, English tutorials36, and ICT training.

Measurable progress under this component has been limited in institutional terms, but
there have been several impressive examples of in-firm training. Data to determine how
many private in-firm training providers have started operation in the last few years is not
available. Based on a survey conducted in 200637, only 8 per cent of the interviewed micro and
small enterprises used any external training compared to 22 percent in 2001. However, 93
percent of those that did receive training indicated that the training had been beneficial for their
work, compared to only 43 percent in 2001. Similar results are reported in the latest ICA38. The
reduction in use of external trainings reportedly stems from the inadequate training offer in the
market and almost all enterprises visited during the ICR mission mentioned that they had to
provide training in-house to bring employees up to quality standards. On the positive side,
INTECAP, the national training and productivity enhancement institute, launched a
modernization plan in 2006 with the aim to increase its efficiency and outreach. In 2007, it
became licensed to grant internationally recognized Microsoft certificates, and successfully
underwent ISO 9001 certification. Additionally, INTECAP is about to launch a new Technology
Information Center, which will enhance its capacity to train in the area of information
technology. INVEST and PRONACOM also launched a marketing campaign "Quetzales for
talking" as part of the call center cluster, which aimed at familiarizing the population with the
work of call centers and persuade potential employees to seek English training. As a result of this
initiative and the strong demand for bilingual staff from call centers, a vibrant private market for
English courses has developed. More than 14,000 jobs with intensive training in language skills
and customer service were created, with salaries significantly higher than in other sectors for
similar skills levels. Another example is the training provided by the six tourism technical

38
   Based on the Enterprise Surveys conducted for the Investment Climate Assessments in 2004 and 2007, the
percentage of companies in the manufacturing sector that provide training to their employees dropped from 58 per
cent in 2003 to 42 per cent in 2007. Particularly small companies did not offer their employees training.

assistance offices, which provided in-firm training to approximately 1500 managers and workers
in tourism, customer service, and environmental issues.

Reforms to revamp the National Statistics System stalled, and ­ despite accomplishments
during the middle of the project - institutional capacity weakened again in the absence of
solid budgetary resources and institutional independence. Several attempts to create an
independent national statistics system failed in Congress due to vested interests in combination
with a lack of culture in the country to request and discuss official data. None of the governments
had a serious commitment to enhancing the working of INE, and various ministries pushed for
maintaining their status quo of collecting their own data. Nevertheless, a national strategy to
revamp the statistics system in Guatemala (ENDE) was launched in 2006, and PRONACOM
funded new computer equipment and the development of manuals to enhance INE's institutional
capacity. With substantial donor support, INE published and disseminated several annual surveys
and statistics between 2006 and 2008, thus bridging some of data gaps mentioned at appraisal39.
However, INE's budget envelope was reduced in 2008 and the available funding was channeled
into new products. Additionally, a new management team was appointed by the president, which
led to staff turnover and loss of institutional capacity. Much focus is now on continuing the
digital mapping of the country. The project funded the equipment for the digitalization process,
and also supported the roll-out throughout the country. Currently Peten and El Progreso have
been fully mapped, which facilitated land registration and cadastre reforms in these regions40. It
is hoped that the mapping exercise will facilitate the national census planned for 2010/11.

Two more examples show positive effects of in-firm training supported directly by the project.
One of the outstanding in-firm training examples supported directly by the project is the call
centers and business services sector, where intensive English training is provided to new
employees. The training has raised incomes for the employees while creating 14,000 additional
jobs. The second is the training provided by CentraRSE to the member firms, which are large
and medium sized firms involved in international trade. They have received training in corporate
social responsibility, fair labor practices and other production issues that permit them to meet
international requirements.

D: Upgrading firm product and process quality (moderately satisfactory)

The project facilitated the development of a national quality infrastructure in Guatemala.
According to the literature, enhancements to the quality infrastructure eliminate technical hurdles
in trade and are mostly beneficial to SMEs41. Together with other donors, the project supported
the development and discussion of a preliminary legal plan to determine the type of regulatory
and institutional framework to be implemented, and also supported the final drafting of the law.

39
   For example national agricultural surveys were conducted annually between 2006 and 2008 to estimate the output
in the agricultural sector, and since 2004 annual environmental statistics to measure i.e. water quality and forest
coverage of the country. Statistical data on the financial situation of the individual departments of the country were
published in 2007, and in 2006 a Living Standards Measurement Study (ENCOVI) was carried out.
40
   Reforms to the cadastre system were supported through the series of DPLs, in combination with a land
administration project currently under implementation.
41
   Unlike larger companies, SMEs usually do not have their own calibration and testing capacities, and thus depend
on the quality infrastructure in a country or ­ if unavailable ­ abroad. See also "A national quality infrastructure",
PTB, OAS and SIM, 2007


                                                         21
In a second stage, the project facilitated the implementation of the government's quality
enhancement agenda42 through support to establish a national metrology lab and the purchase of
additional measuring equipment, as well as contributions to annual National Congresses for
Quality to raise awareness of quality standards and their benefits. Project funds were used to
support a "certificate y compite" program at the Chamber of Construction to help SMEs
implement quality systems. Under this program a course was developed, including information
material, to guide SMEs through the certification process. In 2007, the course was given on four
occasions, including more than 60 participants from around 40 companies. Finally, the project
supported a regulation developed by the National Quality Commission from early 2008 to mid-
2009.

The new law was passed in 200543, and progress has been achieved towards improving the
use of quality standards in the country. Based on the new law, the specific tasks of the five
institutions are clearly distinguished, all norms determined to be voluntary in nature, and the
standards and accreditation bodies are allowed to charge for their services44. The new legal and
regulatory framework has led to new activities, such as for example the signing of a MOU
between the standards setting body COGUANOR and ASTM, and the adoption of over 100
international ASTM standards in the area of construction. The metrology institute now has 12
standard measures at its disposition, but lacks financial and human resources to operate the
equipment. The Accreditation Office (OGA) appears to be functioning well, and received
international recognition to accredit testing laboratories 45 . OGA has so far accredited 18
laboratories46, up from only one in 2004. This is still a comparatively low number of certification
bodies, which means that many firms continue to hire international firms to get a certification. At
the same time, it appears that at least among exporters product quality standards appear to
become more important. Overall, in March 2009 around 80 enterprises were registered nationally
to be certified with the ISO 9001 label, and another 30 enterprises with other international
standards. Overall, the ICA (2008) concluded that now 16 per cent of the surveyed enterprises
had an ISO certification from a domestic or international provider, up from 3 per cent in 2003.

E: Increasing firm-level pre-competitive investment in learning and innovation and
promotion the development of clusters (moderately satisfactory)

Under this component, the project aimed to directly support micro, small and medium sized
firms in their endeavor to grow and become competitive. Three different areas of support were
foreseen under this component, namely (i) the promotion of competitiveness learning and
innovation programs targeted at MSMEs, (ii) the piloting of technology based business

42
   In 2005, the government elaborated a "Plan Nacional de Calidad 2006-2010", and launched a specific program
call "Certificate y compite" to foster the quality infrastructure in Guatemala.
43
   Government Decree 78-2005, "Ley del Sistema Nacional de la Calidad". Based on the degree, 5 bodies are to
operate in the country: A national standardization body (COGUANOR), an Accreditation Body (OGA), and
Metrology Institute (CENAME), a Commission for technical regulations (CRETEC), and an information center
(CEINFORMA).
44
   According to OGA, income received for their services currently constitute around 40 percent of their budget.
45
   It has recently signed MOUs with the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), the International Laboratory
Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and the Inter-American Accreditation Cooperation (IAAC), which certifies that
the institution is independent and competent, and that its accreditations are internationally recognized

development support services, and (iii) the promotion of MSMEs through cluster programs. The
project tested these three approaches, and when the business clusters proved to be the most
effective, a stronger focus was placed on this area. Based on the good results of the cluster work
and selected initiatives under the other areas, the outcome under this component is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

A, Expand Business Clusters and social responsibility programs

The project provided a variety of support to clusters to help them get organized, enhance
efficiency along the value chain, and implement outreach strategies. By linking producers,
developing market intelligence and implementing sales strategies, cluster initiatives can be

                                                           companies and also foster rural

  number of hotel beds in the country. As most of the      development, as described in more depth
  new establishments were small, the average number of     in Annex 10. For example, together with
  rooms per establishment dropped from 25 in 2004 to       INVEST, PRONACOM created a
  only 17 in 2008. The drop was particularly
                                                           cluster for ICT, which helped build a

and helped market Guatemalan textile products at trade fairs. In forestry, the project financed a
variety of measures to help implement an action plan which was based on prior analytical and
benchmarking work. Other clusters that received support were tourism (see Box 3), ornamental
plants, avocado, manufacturing, and cacao.

The cluster initiatives produced impressive results. In forestry, exports more than doubled
between 2000 and 2007, and 37,000 new jobs were created. The production and export of
ornamental plants grew on average by 15 percent annually, with exports being stronger
diversified geographically. The support provided in the area of textiles was incremental for
cushioning the impact of growing competition from countries like China and helped existing
enterprises develop niche products. Similarly positive results were achieved in the other sectors,
as detailed in the comprehensive assessment of the cluster program in Annex 10.




                                                 23
With regard to social responsibility initiatives, Guatemala has produced a number of
trendsetting schemes in the last years. McDonalds launched the "Happy Boy" and "Dia Feliz
por los Ninos" initiatives in Guatemala, before exporting them worldwide. The "aprende futuro"
initiative by the government resulted in 70 percent of all teachers now having access to
computers in Guatemala. This initiative was recognized by Microsoft, and replicated in other
countries (i.e. Dominican Republic, Honduras). FEDEX also highlighted this initiative in one of
its regional publications. Efforts are currently underway to help link schools to the internet. The
"Escuela Demostrativas del Futuro" initiative provided computers and software to 137 schools
throughout Guatemala. With support from Microsoft and Teleguat, over 40,000 students now
have access to a computer, and in part also to the internet. A recent evaluation of the program,
based the usage and familiarity with the internet in two rural schools, came to the conclusions,
that a significant share of students have become proficient in using Word and Powerpoint and
that more than 90 percent of the students used the computer for more than 2 hours per week47.

B, Support to carry out a Competitiveness Learning and Innovation Program (CLIP) for MSMEs

Attempts to launch a comprehensive matching grant and voucher scheme were not
successful. Only one round of matching grants was initiated in 2004, and 448 enterprises applied
for funding. After an intensive vetting process, 4 companies received grant funding. No
additional competition was held, as several rounds of bidding did not lead to the contracting of a
suitable implementation agency which had the capacity and knowledge to roll out the component
on a larger scale throughout Guatemala. Additionally, both the Portillo and Berger government
were not committed, and an IDB study in 2006 concluded that Guatemala lacked important
preconditions for a successful roll-out of matching grants48. Given that better results were being
achieved by the work on clusters, funding for this component was adjusted. (see 1.6.).

Between 2005 and 2007, the project also supported various small initiatives to foster
competitiveness learning and innovation, mostly on the rural level. The " Idea Tu Empresa"
­ Initiative from Technoserve was launched with USAID and PRONACOM support in 2005, and
helped a total of 280 enterprises refine their business ideas and develop business plans before
entering into the competition to win seed funding of US$ 10,000. Overall, 15 companies were
awarded a prize during 2005 and 2007 and many benefited from increased business linkages,
access to finance and technical assistance. Technoserve estimates that the incremental sales
evolution generated by the program exceeded the cost of the program (including on-going
training and support) threefold 49 . CEDE / EMPRENDEC developed a workshop to raise
awareness in enterprises about the need to be competitive and to adhere to quality standards, and
provided training to over 100 enterprises. The project also provided seed funding for AGER, an
NGO aiming at fostering rural enterprise development through the development of producer
cooperatives. With project support, AGER promoted the building of local business associations
in the area of forestry, fruits, vegetables and herbal teas, and also executed a competition to
award productivity enhancement initiatives launched by individual associations. The Red
Nacional de Grupos Gestores, a regional network of local community organizations to foster

   A similar IDB effort providing for matching grants for science and technological innovation also went badly due
to similar implementation arrangement issues
49
   Technoserve also lists some results of individual business projects on their webpage www.technoserve.org


                                                        24
decentralization and rural development, organized technical assistance for 25 local chapters to
help members develop, implement and assess business plans and establish local development
plans to prioritize and fund needed infrastructure. Project support faded eventually out in 2007
and 2008, which forced the initiatives to scale down their services. Finally, PRONACOM helped
AGEXPORT develop a methodology for targeted productivity enhancement support. In 2007, a
pilot exercise was conducted with 8 companies, which were able to save an estimated US$ 1.2
million through implementation of suggested workflow and marketing measures. While some of
these initiatives reported impressive results, the overall impact under this sub-component was
smaller than initially foreseen under the matching grants and voucher schemes, and available
funding was redirected to support business cluster development.

C. Enhance ICT based Business Development Services

Efforts to launch ICT Centers to foster the use of information technology in MSMEs did
not achieve measurable results. At project launch, it was expected that a MicroNet hub and 10
community based business development centers would be launched throughout Guatemala to
demonstrate to MSMEs the benefits of using ICT services for their business development. Initial
efforts to set up the Centers stalled in 2002, as the developed organizational and financial plans
were insufficient, and the government withdrew its support for the component. In 2004, 30
CONTACTO centers were launched by USAID, AGEXPORT and Microsoft which a similar
focus, and the decision was taken to use project funds to provide institutional strengthening to
the newly emerged centers instead. The project funded business development experts for the
Centers and provided office equipment and supply. It also pushed for a closer collaboration with
the Business service center within AGEXPORT to use synergies, and the provision of statistics
to track impact. This however did not materialize. Even a change in the methodology, moving
from a centralized system to franchising to individual entrepreneurs and agricultural
cooperatives, failed to increase measurable effectiveness, and project support was eventually
discontinued. Based on information during the ICR mission, only 10 CONTACTO centers
continue to operate in Guatemala today, but mostly offer only basic printing, faxing and
communication services to their clients.

PRONACOM facilitated alliances between the public and private sector to promote the use
of computers throughout the country. It developed the second phase of software programs for
ENLACE Quiche, a NGO started initially by USAID with the aim to foster the use of technology
in Mayan regions. With project funds, an on-line tool for indigenous entrepreneur to learn about
competition issues, study English and improve their knowledge of information technology was
developed in 4 Mayan languages, and rolled out in the intercultural technology centers of the
initiative. Other initiatives are described under Social Responsibility programs.

3.3    Efficiency:

The project generated a positive economic rate of return. Invest received a total of US$ 5.7
million in funding from the Bank and the government, and it is estimated that the agency helped
attract DI of US$ 944 million through its work. Thus, each Dollar invested into INVEST helped
to generated US$ 166 in foreign direct investment and increased the tax revenue through i.e. the
creation of 24,000 direct jobs. In the area of clusters, the project spent US$ 231,000 to support



                                               25
the forestry cluster, which together with contributions from other cooperation partners
contributed to a duplication of forestry exports from US$ 37 million in 2000 to a peak of US$ 87
million in 2007. Positive returns on investments were also reported from the communication
strategy (in terms of press coverage) and the other clusters.
It should also be noted, that the use of strategic alliances helped leverage project resources
and allowed PRONACOM to focus on reform facilitation, provision of strategic advice and
support, as well as promotion of reforms throughout its constituency. This helped stretch the
financing effectively over a broad network of alliances, which were focusing on individual
reform areas, and allowed PRONACOM to focus its scarce human and financial resources on
coordinating and facilitating reforms through seminars, training, and major international events.
Those were areas where PRONACOM had a clear comparative advantage given its business plan
and the participation of high level government officials and influential private sector
stakeholders on its Board. However, more efforts could have been done by PRONACOM to
consolidating dispersed reform efforts, and to use synergies in its work programs.

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:

Rating: moderately satisfactory

As discussed above, the project objective was and remained relevant, and substantial
progress was achieved towards the overarching objective to enhance economic growth and
foster income generation amongst small and medium sized enterprises. With regard to the
business environment, project support led to a reduction of administrative barriers, as measured
by the leading international competitiveness indicators. PRONACOM also facilitated the
development and passing of 4 new laws, with another 3 still pending Congressional approval50.
The incremental FDI attracted with project support was higher than expected at appraisal,
reaching around US$ 944 million between 2005 and 2008 (from a low base), and creating over
24,000 new direct jobs. Progress was also made in the area of quality standards, with a
measurable increase in the number of companies now being ISO certified. On the firm level,
many small initiatives provided valuable direct support to enhance productivity and planning for
MSMEs, leading to improved productivity and outputs in particular under the cluster initiatives.
The project should also be credited for having facilitated and implemented some of the reform
measures that were included as conditionality under the three development policy loans, whose
outcomes were deemed to be satisfactory.

However, the project did not achieve many of the institutional reforms envisioned at
appraisal. As the legal reforms were not approved in Congress, the Competition Commission
and the Statistical Superintendency were not created. Furthermore, some of the institutional
capacity built, in particular in INVEST and INE, has been lost again as a result of staff turnover,
political interference and lack of funding in the final year of project implementation. This
reduced overall impact of the project, and lowered the potential benefits that could have been
generated by the project.

50
   The five new laws are (i) to establish the Free Trade Zone in Santo Tomas de Castillo, (ii) to reform secured
transactions, (iii) allow electronic signature, and (iv) to establish the National Quality System. Pending are the Law
to Establish a National Port Authority, to legalize Public Private Partnerships and reforms to the legal framework
governing Free Trade Zones.


                                                          26
Overall, given the good progress achieved towards implementing the Government's
competitiveness agenda, and the measurable achievements made as described above, the
outcome of the project is rated to have been moderately satisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts:

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project provided limited and targeted supported to initiatives which directly targeted poverty
reduction and social development under the government's Health and Education component of
the Competitiveness Agenda. Amongst the initiatives were for example "Creciendo Bien", an
effort to increase the well-being of newborns, for which the project funded a study to set up a
monitoring and evaluation system. With the quality of education being one of the core
bottlenecks, the project also supported various efforts to enhance the quality of education on
various levels of the formal education. For example, the project helped sponsor a national
competition for teachers (Maestro 100 puntos), in which 166 teachers presented innovative and
successful teaching techniques in order to win one of the 10 monetary prices offered. The
competition is now held annually, with both entrepreneurs and government supporting the
initiative.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening:

The project contributed to a significant amount of institutional capacity building, but with
varied longer term results. The project delivered numerous diagnostic and benchmarking
studies, which allowed for a more methodological and rational approach of reform
implementation by individual agencies such as AGER, the grupos gestores, the CONTACTO
Centers and in the cluster area. The impact of this support is documented in the area of the
clusters, but limited evidence of achievements was provided for the other agencies. Furthermore,
the institutional capacity of INE was strengthened, but the long-term impact has been negligible
(see above). Most importantly, the project was instrumental in establishing PRONACOM and
INVEST as quasi-independent agencies in their respective areas. Both institutions received high
marks for their functioning and efficiency during project implementation, and much of the
project's success can be attributed to them. However, despite frequent calls for action by the
World Bank task team, the two institutions never moved beyond the structure created by the
Presidential Degree in 2004, and failed to get financially independent and become true public-
private partnerships. This led to the risks to development outcomes described below.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: moderate

There has been some concern over the long-term financial and institutional sustainability
of the institutions supported under the project. Given the tight budget situation, no
government budget for PRONACOM and INVEST were foreseen for 2009, and it is not yet clear
whether the 2010 budget will include sufficient funding. The current government has a lower
commitment to competitiveness reforms and with view to the tightened budgetary situation
during the current economic downturn places stronger focus on rural development and social
inclusion. PRONACOM has now been placed in charge of implementing the Bank's rural
economic development project, and also will implement an IDB loan to foster competitiveness,
once it has been signed by Congress. Thus, the risks to PRONACOM's sustainability have
temporarily subsided. INVEST, on the contrary, has not yet been able to secure substantial new
resources for its operation, and has lost a significant share of its staff due to the political turnover
in 2008, and also lately due to the lack of funds. Furthermore, INE's capacity has deteriorated,
and will need substantial new capacity building to improve again.

Despite these visible risks to development outcome, there seems to be agreement among
stakeholders that both PRONACOM and INVEST will continue to be the key players in their
respective areas, and various alternatives are currently being discussed on the political level to
make both institutions sustainable on the longer term, even without donor funding. For example,
consideration is currently being given to establish a trust for INVEST, and to bring PACIT and
INVEST activities under one institutional umbrella. In view of this, overall risk to development
is rated to be moderate.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:

Rating: moderately unsatisfactory

As discussed above, the project was based on solid prior analytical work, supported "home-
grown" reforms that remained relevant during implementation, and provided satisfactory
implementation arrangements. However, the strong institutional reform focus proved to be
overly ambitious given the existing vested interests in the country, and the project was complex
with its many components. Furthermore, the provided monitoring indicators were ambitious and
not readily available. The Bank performance at entry is thus rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision:

Rating: satisfactory

The Bank was proactive in the identification of opportunities and resolution of problems.
Throughout project implementation, the focus remained on development impact, and the task


                                                  28
team did not shy away from pushing for phasing out funding for initiatives that did not provide
sufficient evidence of results, such as in the case of CONTACTO, the support for the Red
Nacional de Grupos Gestores and the PACIT program. At the same time, the Bank remained
open for new initiatives, and left sufficient room to the implementation unit to be creative and
explore new reform options, programming opportunities and new alliances to attain the project
development objective efficiently. Furthermore, fiduciary aspects were carefully monitored and
acted upon, and the performance ratings reflected actual progress on the ground. In its dialogue
with PRONACOM's Board, INVEST's Board and the Commissioner of Investment and
Competitiveness, the Bank also highlighted early on the need to elaborate and implement
transition arrangements to prevent the institutional collapse of INVEST and PRONACOM upon
project closing, albeit with limited results. Finally, the task team pushed for a stronger focus on
monitoring and evaluation, and a new position was added in PRONACOM in 2007 to track
implementation and improve monitoring.

The project should have been restructured to eliminate some of the design issues mentioned
above and to better align the project components with the country's competitiveness
agenda of 2005. The team refocused funding towards components which had the greatest
impact, and simplified and revamped indicators to better reflect the program. In retrospect ­
although funds were reallocated ­ project components and monitoring indicators should have
been formally restructured. As implemented, the project components contributed to the nation's
competitiveness as a subset of measures pursued under the competitiveness agenda.
PRONACOM was guided by the project, but was also in charge of implementing the broader
government program and being organized internally along the government's strategic axes. This
contributed to some of the gaps in readily available project information, and added complexity
into an already complex program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: moderately satisfactory

While the design was flawed and the project should have been formally restructured, the Bank's
performance was in many ways strong and contributed to the improvements in Guatemala's
competitiveness. When the government strengthened its relationship with the private sector in
2004, the Bank moved quickly to assist in improving systems and relationships that contributed
directly to improved competitiveness, for the country as a whole and for the target population of
micro, small and medium enterprises. Thus, a rating of moderately satisfactory for Bank
performance is justified.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: moderately unsatisfactory

Borrower performance was mixed, and strongly hinged on the respective administration..
The Portillo government only showed limited interest in competitiveness reforms and project



                                                29
implementation stalled during those initial years. In contrast to this, the Berger administration
placed a strong focus on private sector led growth, and many competitiveness reform initiatives
were launched or implemented during its tenure. Since 2008, the Colom government focuses on
inclusive growth, refocusing some of the reform initiatives towards rural areas.

As to be expected, the readjustment of focus slowed down project implementation during the
transition years. It however also let to some reversal of reforms, such as in the area of the
ventanilla agil and INE, or the shifting of priorities, such as in the area of supported clusters or
legal reforms. Counterpart funds were made available during the Berger and Colom
administration, but the general lack of fiscal space in combination with the shift in priorities led
to underfunding of some institutions like INE, INVEST and the metrology institute, resulting in
some instances in a reversal of the built institutional capacity. Furthermore, support for the
modernization of the competitiveness framework and the actual implementation of anti-
monopoly regulations was luke-warm at best, thus helping preserve the status quo in a number of
areas. Finally, despite repeated reminder from the World Bank, transitional arrangements did not
receive the needed attention early on, which led to the risk to development as described above.
Thus, despite the solid progress made in the area of competitiveness particularly during the
Berger administration, overall borrower performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: satisfactory

The implementing agency PRONACOM received excellent marks from the stakeholders
interviewed during the mission regarding their cooperation, efficiency and overall
contribution to helping improve the business environment in Guatemala. It has become the
core agency associated with competitiveness reforms in Guatemala, and profits from a solid
reputation. Throughout the implementation of the project, the staff of PRONACOM remained
fully committed to the Competitiveness Agenda, actively sought alliances to leverage funds and
was able to juggle a broad variety of initiatives simultaneously. PRONACOM was able to
consistently draw wide participation in the Comite Ampliado, the Supervisory Board comprised
of private and public sector stakeholders, and attract broad attention to competitiveness issues in
the public through its outreach activities.

While PRONACOM played a crucial part for the project's achievements, its performance
had some shortcomings. Despite continuous training, procurement processes continued to be
slow and at times imperfect between 2004 and 2007, due to understaffing in combination with
some key staff turnover. While the planning and monitoring of project activities improved
significantly since 2007, the tracking of agreed performance targets for individual sub-projects
was uneven. While this was a natural consequence of the multitude of programs that were
supported by PRONACOM, it nevertheless negatively impacted the availability of information
on the actual outputs that were delivered, as well as impact of the supported reforms. Finally,
PRONACOM's system to track project outputs, expenditures and counterpart funds was a
manual system, not aligned with the project's components and changed over time, making a
reconstruction of project activities cumbersome.




                                                30
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: moderately satisfactory

With view to the outcomes achieved under the project, the high praise given to PRONACOM
from stakeholders, and the many dedicated staff involved in the operation, the overall borrower
performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

6.        Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

The project provides a number of important lessons for the futures:

      -   Long-term financial and political sustainability of the created institutions need to be
          focused early on and transition arrangements should be elaborated far in advance of
          project closing. By delaying the reform of the institutional framework for INVEST and
          PRONACOM, the government missed an important opportunity to make the two
          institutions financially sustainable by turning them into true public-private partnerships
          funded by both government and private sector funds. Additionally, while the Comite
          Ampliado served as a supervisory board, it lacked the mandate to set the agenda, and
          could not provide continuity in the institutional framework and strategy of the two
          institutions during political changes.
      -   Moving ahead, PRONACOM might want to focus more strongly on setting
          priorities and harmonizing and mainstreaming existing initiatives. There are many
          reform initiatives ongoing in the country by the government, stakeholders and donors,
          leading to a duplication of efforts and a scattering of resources. PRONACOM, through its
          supervisory board, could provide an active forum to bring donors, stakeholders and the
          government together to help reduce reform segmentation, and scale individual reform
          initiatives up.
      -   Finally, a common lesson from projects, monitoring and evaluation frameworks
          need to be more carefully designed and implemented. Providing a multitude of
          indicators, which are not readily available and hinge on third parties, makes monitoring
          time consuming, cumbersome and as a consequence unlikely. Furthermore, target rates
          need to be realistic and reflect the country's actual capacity to change given cultural and
          political factors in the country. Finally, key performance indicators should be formally
          adjusted when it becomes apparent that reforms will not be implemented as foreseen, or
          indicators are clearly too ambitious. Clarifying and reducing the indicators to core
          indicators facilitates not only the monitoring through the implementation agency, but also
          provides clarity and focus in the discussions on expected outcomes with the government
          and stakeholders.


7.        Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)       Borrower/implementing agencies:

The Competitiveness Program was implemented by the Ministry of Economy through the
National Program of Competitiveness (PRONACOM), with the support of the World Bank


                                                  31
(Loan No. 7044-GU approved by the Congress of the Republic under Decree 57-2001). This
formed part of the actions undertaken by the Government of the Republic of Guatemala with the
help of IBRD, to strengthen the competitiveness of the country, especially for micro and small
enterprises, in the framework of the Peace Accords. It is important to underscore that the role of
the Ministry of Economy was to implement the overall program, and it supported PRONACOM
as the executing agency of that program.

The National Program for Competitiveness is recognized as the most important actor when
providing strategic guidelines for both government and private sector initiatives aimed at
promoting competitiveness and productivity. Its public-private institutional set-up has allowed
PRONACOM to facilitate the conformation of strategic alliances representing both sectors with
more than 100 organizations, through the implementation of at least 170 projects from 2005-to
date.

PRONACOM created an Extended Committee (Comité Ampliado), conformed by
representatives of more than 70 institutions, both public and private, with a mandate of
promoting the inclusion and coordination of the actions carried by the Program under the
National Agenda of Competitiveness (NAC). The Extended Committee also represents a
platform of accountability for PRONACOM, as it promotes transparency and efficiency in all
actions taken not only by the Program, but by the different institutions represented. This
platform has been the most strategic tool to share and maintain the importance of the message
brought to the country through the National Agenda for Competitiveness.

Finally, PRONACOM has been the strategic partner to government and private sector
representatives when developing a long-term development vision for the country. It has
articulated and coordinated efforts at different levels within government, academy, business
executives and the general workforce in order to work together under the shared umbrella of a
common vision.

As the executing agency of the project, PRONACOM has read this evaluation report presented to
us through the Project´s team leader, Mr. Mike Goldberg. We agree with its content and have no
further comments.

Annex 3.       Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

The project generated a highly positive economic rate of return. Invest received a total of 5.7
million US$ in funding from the Bank and the government, and attracted FDI of US$ 944
through its work. Thus, each Dollar invested into INVEST generated US$ 166 in foreign direct
investment. In the area of clusters, the Bank spent for example US$ 231,000 to support the
forestry cluster, which together with contributions from other cooperation partners contributed to
a duplication of forestry exports from US$ 37 million in 2000 to a peak of US$ 87 million in
2007. Positive returns on investments were also reported from the communication strategy (in
terms of press coverage) and the other clusters.

El Préstamo BIRF-7044-GU del Banco Mundial, aprobado por el Congreso de la República,
mediante Decreto No. 57-2001, para ser ejecutado por el Ministerio de Economía por medio de
la Unidad de Administración del Programa Nacional de Competitividad ­PRONACOM-, inicio
su ejecución en el año 2001, con el objeto de "Fomentar el crecimiento económico y reducir la
pobreza en Guatemala, ayudando primariamente a la micro, pequeña y mediana empresa a
expandir sus actividades, creando oportunidades de empleo y generando mayores ingresos",
alcanzó el objetivo propuesto y superó las expectativas de inversión planteadas en los
componentes estratégicos del documento de préstamo.

Debido a que el entorno económico del país varió desde el año que se iniciaron las negociaciones
(1998) hasta la suscripción del Convenio de Préstamo (2002), y que se tuvieron tres gobiernos
con ideología diferentes, algunos de los componentes originales fueron reenfocados para
implementar otros de mayores resultados. Las intervenciones realizadas con los aportes del
Préstamo han permitido ubicar a Guatemala como una nación con un alto potencial competitivo,
aunque todavía hay mucho por hacer para incrementar la productividad y lograr un mayor
crecimiento económico y reducir los índices de pobreza. Es por ello que el rol del PRONACOM,
ha sido clave en liderar y posicionar una visión de país en el largo plazo a través de la
articulación de esfuerzos entre los gobiernos, las autoridades locales, los empresarios, la
academia y los trabajadores. La visión de país planteada es: "Ser el país más competitivo de la
región centroamericana y del Caribe, e incrementar el producto interno bruto per capita a
US$8,500 para lograr reducir la tasa de pobreza en menos del 20% para el año 2030."

El Proyecto inicialmente fue fundamentado en seis componentes estratégicos: Clima General de
Negocios, Promoción de Inversión Extranjera Directa, Innovación y Aprendizaje de
Competitividad, Información de Servicios de Desarrollo comercial en base a tecnología,
Iniciativas locales de competitividad y Coordinación de Actividades de competitividad nacional
e internacional. Sin embargo, en el año 2004 se definió una Agenda Nacional de
Competitividad, con participación de diversos sectores que permitiría dar cumplimiento en una
forma ordenada a los componentes del Préstamo, así como marcar las prioridades que
fortalecerían la competitividad de país, determinando la ruta a seguir por los próximos diez años.
A lo largo del periodo de ejecución del préstamo, se fueron replanteando los ejes y los programas
y proyectos para el cumplimiento de los objetivos del mismo de acuerdo a las prioridades de
cada gobierno. Las intervenciones y acciones realizadas por PRONACOM e Invest in Guatemala
influyeron positivamente en el desempeño económico del país.

Las acciones llevadas a cabo tuvieron resultados positivos tales como:

La conformación de redes de aliados que permitieron realizar proyectos que respondieran a los
ejes de la Agenda Nacional de Competitividad; crecimiento de las exportaciones nacionales;
aprobación de leyes relacionadas con el clima de negocios (Garantías Mobiliarias, Firma
Electrónica, cabildeo para la aprobación de leyes como Alianzas para el Desarrollo, Ley de
Competencia, Ley de modificación del INE, Reformas a ley de Minería, Reformas a Zonas
Francas y Decreto 29-89). También se llevaron a cabo acciones de mejora en la calidad de los
sistemas de información estadística y de calidad del país; el fortalecimiento de las instituciones
relacionadas con trámites aduaneros y mercantiles; descentralización y alineación institucional


                                                   49
con el fin de mejorar el clima de negocios del país; apoyo a los gobiernos locales; incidencia con
acciones puntuales para mejorar los índices en mediciones internacionales en temas municipales
y de negocios; conformación de once clusters (conglomerados) en todo el país; realización de
inteligencia de mercados para generar nuevos oportunidades de inversión en el país, entre otras.
Durante el período 2004-2008 la mayoría de programas ejecutados respondieron a los seis ejes
planteados en la Agenda Nacional de Competitividad.

Al revisarse lo relacionado a los resultados de impacto, se identificó que en el 2005 y 2006 en el
Programa de Reactivación Económica Vamos Guatemala, impulsado por el Gobierno del
Presidente Oscar Berger, la competitividad, la armonía social y la confianza eran los pilares
dentro de los cuatro ejes estratégicos planteados: Guate Solidaria, Guate Crece, Guate Compite,
Guate Verde. La Agenda Nacional de Competitividad fue el pilar de una de las dos grandes
estrategias de Gobierno para la reactivación económica. La ANC planteó metas hasta el año
2015, que incluyeron metas intermedias, las cuales fueron cumpliéndose a lo largo de los cuatro
años de gobierno del Presidente Oscar Berger. El enfoque de acción fue orientado a la
descentralización de las acciones a favor de la competitividad y alianzas entre los sectores
público y privado para su ejecución.

En lo relacionado al clima de negocios en 2007 el informe Doing Business de ese año calificó a
Guatemala como uno de los diez países más reformistas del mundo en favorecer el clima de
negocios. En el 2006 el índice global de competitividad reportó que el país subió 20 posiciones,
pasando del puesto 95 al puesto 75. Otro de los logros fue lo relacionado a la eficiencia
administrativa con la creación de la ventanilla ágil que permitió la reducción a un solo
procedimiento para el registro de empresas, trámite en 24 horas para comerciante individual y
para sociedad patente provisional en 24 hrs. y definitiva en 17 días implementándose en 13
departamentos de Guatemala. También en el 2005 se logró reducir los trámites para los estudios
de Impacto Ambiental, obteniendo éste un plazo no mayor a 60 días, cuando anteriormente se
otorgaba en dos años. Se trabajó en el Convenio de Agilización y Simplificación de
procedimientos en el tema ambiental entre MARN / MSPAS, con el fin de no duplicar los
expedientes de los instrumentos evaluación ambiental. Otro de los logros importantes fue lo
relacionado a Visas, Residencias y Permisos de Trabajo estableciéndose por medio de un
diagnóstico que el trámite era de aproximadamente 90 días y que el listado de países exentos de
visas era poco ampliado el listado de países de 42 exentos de visas a 82.

Se elaboraron los procedimientos para la flexibilización de la Política Migratoria a países de
Categoría Consultada (República de China Popular, Cuba y Colombia) y se logró la
implementación de Visa Centroamericana a partir de 10 de diciembre desde Guatemala a
Nicaragua. Asimismo se logró reducir el pago de capacitación indirecta para el otorgamiento de
permisos de trabajo de Q10 mil a Q3 mil anuales, a nivel técnico y ejecutivo. Además, se trabajó
en la emisión del Acuerdo Gubernativo 111-2006, del 7 de marzo 2006, en el cual se elimina el
pago de Q3 mil por capacitación indirecta a nivel ejecutivo por permiso de trabajo. El trámite de
los permisos de trabajo se ha reducido a cinco días. En lo relacionado a Licencias Sanitarias y
Registros Sanitarios se creó una Ventanilla de Servicios del MSPAS para reducir los tiempos de
autorización de licencias. Se estableció el Arancel por Servicios prestados por los Departamentos
de la Dirección General de Regulación, Vigilancia y Control de la Salud, el cual entró en
vigencia a partir del 20 de junio del 2006. En agosto 2007 se crea la nueva Ventanilla de

Autorizaciones Sanitarias MSPAS en CIG para el tema de alimentos, medicamentos, productos
afines y materia prima.

Otro proyecto importante fue lo relacionado a actividades de e-government. El 14 de noviembre
de 2007 se lanzó el Sistema en línea E-regulations con el objeto de facilitar a los inversionistas
extranjeros y locales el poder hacer negocios en Guatemala.

En el tema de infraestructura y logística, el PRONACOM apoyó en la elaboración del Plan
Mutimodal de Obras de Infraestructura Prioritarias. El objetivo del Plan es establecer los
lineamientos para que el país cuente con la infraestructura y con un sistema de transporte
multimodal integrado, que permita mejorar el acceso de los productos al mercado nacional e
internacional, y de las personas a los servicios públicos, dando cumplimiento a la ANC. En el
componente de Iniciativas de Desarrollo Local se realizó una inversión del 24% del préstamo,
del el 61% fue el apoyo a la conformación de clusters. Esta fue una iniciativa que ha perdurado y
generando a la fecha 13 clusters activos e inversiones superiores los US$475.000,000 y 14,000
empleos.

Este proyecto fue un catalizador para unificar las demandas del sector público y privado. La
participación del sector privado hizo que éste se apoderara de la Agenda y por ende que la
continúe empujando a lo largo de las diversas administraciones. Se puede concluir que la
sostenibilidad y el impulso de una Agenda Nacional de Competitividad debe realizarse en un
marco público privado, con el fin que ambos actores puedan impulsarla y apoderarse de ella. La
modernización del estado y su fortalecimiento institucional son elementos claves para mejorar en
los índices de competitividad y competir en el mercado de atracción de inversiones a nivel
mundial. Se debe contar con una visión de país medible para plantear acciones orquestadas que
permitan alcanzarla y que involucren al sector público y privado. Se requiere de una voluntad
política y los esfuerzos necesarios para alcanzar las metas propuestas. La inversión extranjera
directa (IED) tiene el potencial de generar empleo, aumentar la productividad, transferir
conocimientos especializados y tecnología, aumentar las exportaciones y contribuir al desarrollo
económico a largo plazo de los países en desarrollo de todo el mundo. Es la fuente más
importante de financiación externa para los países en desarrollo.

Los resultados obtenidos en las diferentes mediciones en las que a la fecha participa El País,
como calificaciones de riesgo país, Doing Business, Municipal Scorecard, WEF, etc. deben ser la
guía para los gobiernos para implementar acciones coordinadas de mejora a corto y mediano
plazo. La mejora del clima de negocios del país está íntimamente relacionada con la atracción de
IED, por lo que tanto PRONACOM como INVEST IN GUATEMALA deben de continuar
trabajando conjuntamente para dar continuidad a cambios legislativos requeridos, procesos de
modernizaciones institucionales implementadas, y otras acciones futuras que se consideren
oportunas.

Finalmente, se requiere continuar con las acciones de la Mesa de Riesgo País y dar a conocer los
resultados de la calificación obtenida. A nivel local se requiere de iniciativas locales apoyando a
las municipalidades en su gestión, para que puedan medirse con otros municipios de
Latinoamérica y se mejoren de esta forma los indicadores del Doing Business. Además es
importante no distanciarse del sector educativo, con el fin de mantener vivo el tema de la
competitividad y la productividad a través de los centros de formación técnica y universitaria del


                                                51
país. Es recomendable fortalecer la capacidad de ejecución de la unidad ejecutora, a través de la
realización de un plan estratégico para los próximos años, así como impulsar la agenda
legislativa pendiente, para que se aprueben las leyes necesarias para mejorar el clima de
negocios, la modernización de las instituciones del estado, y la participación público privada en
el sector de inversiones en infraestructura.

Es importante destacar el proceso de aprendizaje de la unidad ejecutora del proyecto, la cual a
través de los 8 años de implementación, logró llevar a cabo la ejecución del proyecto, realizando
los ajustes necesarios al mismo para el logro de los objetivos y construyendo capacidad
institucional (Ministerio de Economía), para continuar impulsando la competitividad del país
en los ámbitos público y privado. PRONACOM continua impulsado programas financiados
con recursos reembolsables y no reembolsables de la cooperación internacional en apoyo al
sector productivo del país.

1.       Evaluation Scope

The present report provides a technical review and evaluation of Invest in Guatemala (INVEST) as one of
the components of the Competitiveness Project (the Project) which received financial support of the
World Bank via a US$ 20.3 million loan.

The evaluation was focused in evaluating the performance of INVEST in respect to the Key Performance
Indicators defined by the Project: foreign Investment generation and job creation. The analysis was
further extended as to appraise all other aspects were INVEST made a direct or indirect contribution to
the Project objectives. Special attention was made to the institution building and sustainability aspects
which were specifically mentioned in the Project Appraisal document

The evaluation and analysis was based on:
    desktop analysis of existing reports and data provided by INVEST, World Bank and other sources
    meetings and interviews performed during a field trip on September 21 to 25 2009
    meetings in Washington DC with World Bank and MIGA during October 2009

2.       Initial Considerations
In 2002, Guatemala initiated the implementation of an ambitious, comprehensive and strategic
Competitiveness Project (the Project) which was designed to advance the nation in an increasingly
competitive development environment and leverage its economic growth. The Project, which was mainly
financed by a World Bank loan of US$ 20 million, supported a wide array of initiatives that targeted both
the business climate enhancement and the competitiveness factors at the firm level.
Accelerating foreign Investment was one of the main objectives of the Project. The country ranked
well behind other Central American countries as inflows of foreign direct Investment were hindered by:
     business climate barriers,
     Investment registration bottlenecks,
     an inefficient supply chain services
     and weak foreign Investment promotion
The unit in charge of implementing this Project component, INVEST in Guatemala, was the single
most important element of the Project, in terms of allocated funds. The original Project Appraisal
document prepared by the World Bank and dated November 20, 2000, indicates that 24% of the Project
funds, US$ 7.8 million, were assigned to the Accelerating FDI component.

The above mentioned data regarding the FDI component indicates that the government was expected to
provide US$ 4.2 million as matching funds for this specific component of the Project.


The Project was designed to accelerate foreign direct Investment inflows through:
        the creation of a public-private sector Investment Promotion Council
        improving the one-stop facilitation services
        introducing regulatory changes to reduce the cost and time of transport of exported goods by the
        international supply chain
This report addresses exclusively the aspects related to the creation of a public-private sector Investment
Promotion Council
Two tangible figures were selected as key performance indicators for the FDI component of the
Project:
        incremental FDI inflows of US$ 206 million by the end of the Project
        20,500 new jobs and 40,000 indirect jobs resulting from linkages by the end of the Project


The support provided by the World Bank loan was expected to support the development of a
sustainable Investment promotion agency (IPA). Proguat, the existing investment promotion unit
which operated from the Ministry of Economy would be used as starting point in order to build the full
fledged investment promotion agency. The new institution would have the required expertise, capacity
and resources to continue its mission well beyond the end of the Project. Once consolidated after three to
four years, the Project implementation unit would evolve toward a non-profit organization co-owned and
managed by the private and public sectors.

3.      Historic Background to INVEST

The intention of developing an IPA in Guatemala dates back to 1997. In May 1997, the Government
of Guatemala initiated the establishment of a national promotion agency, Proguat. This first and informal
step was intended to pave the way to a full fledge promotion agency that should operate as a mixed,
public-private entity and would be established through the passing of the appropriate legislation. In its
initial stage, this initiative received financial support from the Inter-American Development Bank in order
to finance the agency until it was formally established. In the following years the initiative did not receive
the required support from the government and did not succeed in securing the necessary funding or in
obtaining the supporting legislation for its enactment. Proguat, which later became Invest in Guatemala,
did not become the IPA that it was meant to be and remained for many years an informal unit within the
Ministry of Finance with limited structure and resources and lacked a strategic approach to its mission.

Substantial capacity building support was provided by MIGA and the World Bank between 1998
and 2000. An investment promotion strategy, which was developed by a specialized private consultancy
group and financed by the World Bank was presented to INVEST and to the key stakeholders involved in
the Investment promotion initiative at the beginning of 2000.

All these efforts proved unsuccessful in creating an on-going operation capable of developing
investment promotion activities. As of 2003, there was no real institutional set-up as the initiative
lacked public sector support and commitment; there was no private sector participation and no financial
resources that could create the enabling conditions for an IPA to start operating.


                                                     55
4.     An enabling Platform for a performing and successful Project Implementation Unit


The Project provided a fundamental, unquestionable and much needed support to the kick-off of
the investment promotion unit, INVEST. The financial resources, institutional guidelines and clear
objectives that were provided by the Project, combined with the government's vision and understanding
of the importance and need of attracting foreign direct investment created an enabling platform for the
rapid and effective operational kick-off of INVEST.
Taking aside the year 2004, which was a set-up year, the five year period 2005 ­ 2008 can be considered
the golden years of INVEST as it was able to operate as a full fledge investment promotion agency with a
high degree of autonomy, a proactive support from both the public and private sector, adequate funding
and top quality human resources.
INVEST, in a short period of time was recognized as a successful entity in Guatemala and abroad.
Its activities were fundamental in attracting a significant number of foreign investors to Guatemala which
generated a large number of new jobs, raising the image of the country among potential investors and
generating initiatives which aimed at improving the attractiveness of the country as an investment
location. All stakeholders interviewed during the evaluation visit to Guatemala recognized the
effectiveness of INVEST and its positive contribution to the country's development efforts. The quality of
the staff was also confirmed during the interviews with former staff members and was praised by
investors which had received support from the entity. INVEST was considered a very prestigious and
attractive place to work. It can be said that, during 2005-2007, INVEST was a very well performing
implementation unit, operating close to international best practices which was receiving the support of the
key stakeholders in Guatemala.
INVEST´s positive performance was also recognized by FIAS and the World Bank in the latest
Global Investment Promotion Benchmark 2009 which tracks the performance and capabilities of
181 investment promotion intermediaries. Invest overall ranking improved since 2006 and significant
positive changes were made in the area of handling a manufacturing investment enquiry by a potential
investor.

                 a. Overachievement in terms of the Key Performance Indicators

INVEST managed to rapidly obtain positive and tangible results in terms of the Key Performance
Indicators identified in the Project. During the four year period 2005-2008, INVEST supported
Investors responsible for US$ 944 million. This figure does not include the investments generated in the
first semester of 2009, period still under the Project timeline.

INVEST clearly surpassed the expected target of US$ 206 million which was established at the
beginning of the Project. Another way of highlighting this positive result is to say that INVEST
achieved 458% of its target. A closer look at these figures indicate that these results should also be
praised in qualitative terms as the underlying Investments have been made in a number of sectors,
including the new and emerging call centers, by high-quality investors.

Some key aspects of these FDI inflows should be highlighted:
        investment was spread over five economic sectors: call centers, manufacturing, agri-business,
        tourism and energy
        Call centers is a new sector for Guatemala which has been promoted from scratch by INVEST.
        While it only accounts for 6% of total FDI inflows it generated over 40% of the new jobs.
        INVEST statistics indicate that there were 84 investments recorded during 2005-2008
        representing 73 Investors. Each investor made had an average investment of US$ 12 million and
        generated 337 jobs.
In a more macro perspective it is possible to confirm the positive performance of Guatemala in terms of
capturing foreign direct investment. While the above data corresponds to the investment flows were
INVEST claims to have provided some level of support, the statistics provided by the IMF and the Banco
de Guatemala provide a more complete picture of what the country has attracted in terms of foreign direct
Investment. Table 3 shows how the rate of FDI/GDP has grown consistently during the period 2005-2008
confirming the results shown in the INVEST data.
The investors supported by INVEST represented a significant share of total foreign direct investment
inflows during the 2005-2008 period in particular during the years 2006 and 2007. See Graph 2.

The 73 companies that were supported by INVEST were responsible for generating over 24,000
new direct jobs. Considering that the key performance indicator was set at 20,000 it is fair to say that
INVEST exceeded this target by 20%. It is important to highlight that 40% of the new jobs are in the call
centers. These jobs represent a very specific market segment as they target a young, bilingual person and
they represent a very attractive alternative for this type of individuals.

No information was available in terms of the indirect jobs that were created as a windfall from the
primary investment. In this respect the evaluation was not able to confirm whether the target of 40,000
indirect jobs created was met.

           b. Support to Business Climate Enhancement Initiatives

By being in close, permanent and proactive contact with both potential and existing investors, INVEST
was in a unique position to identify, monitor and address the key aspects that constituted a barrier for
foreign Investors, INVEST staff was able to channel business climate concerns to Pronacom in order to
identify a solution or initiate a the necessary steps to alleviate these obstacles.

The close relation between INVEST and Pronacom was a tremendous asset when it comes to being able
to identify the problems and initiate business climate enhancement actions. There was clearly a
tremendous synergy between the two units.

           c. Institutional Building Support

The Project was relevant in supporting the implementation of key institutional elements that provided an
enabling framework for INVEST. Most of these elements were included in the list of structural
recommendations made by MIGA/FIAS. Table 4 provides a summary of the implemented actions.

In a short period of time, INVEST had put together most of the factors that constitute the platform of a
successful investment promotion agency. The key factors responsible for such positioning were:
     an excellent team of dedicated, skilled and motivated professionals
     a world-class investment promotion strategy
     an autonomous but influential position within the key decision, policy and opinion makers
     involvement from both the public and private sectors
    

           d. Financial Analysis: Doing More with Less

Invest can be praised for its effectiveness in reaching its operational objectives but also for its
efficiency in operating with less than budgeted resources. From a financial analysis perspective,
INVEST was able to use the majority of the allocated financial resources and reach the objectives while
not receiving all the funds that were budgeted.

As was previously mentioned, INVEST was called to be the single most important implementation unit
when measured in terms of allocated budget. While the foreign investment component was expected to
represent circa 18% of the total loan, the fact is that it ended accounting for over 28% of the disbursed
amounts. According to the figures provided by Pronacom, as of March 2009 (3 months before the project
completion date), INVEST accumulated 4,4 million of the US$ 15,6 million that were effectively
disbursed by the World Bank, representing over 28% of the total amount. What these figures reflect is
that INVEST was one of the few units that were able to fully execute its allocated share of the loan (and
even slightly exceed it!)

The original Project outlines a budget of US$ 7.8 million for the foreign Investment component. A closer
look at the financial statements indicates that INVEST received a total of US$ 5.6 million, or 28% less
than originally planned. This provides a better than planned return on invested funds. In other words each
million US$ invested in INVEST generated additional foreign Investments for US$ 165.6 million
compared to the original target of US$ 26.4 new investments per million US$ invested.

The previous figures provide another relevant aspect of the foreign Investment: limited financial
support from the Government of Guatemala. Whereas the funding from the public sector was planned


                                                   61
to represent 54% of the Component Cost, the fact is that no funding was provided by the government.
Such figures confirm the absence of financial support, commitment and ownership from the governmental
entities.


While Invest operated as a sub-agency under the umbrella of Pronacom, the reality is that its
administration in terms operational accounting, reporting and monitoring was much decentralized. Invest
was required to define and present to Pronacom its own budget requirements as well as its annual
statements. Over the timeline for the project, Invest provided timely delivery of budgets and financials.
Continuous governance and administrative monitoring was provided by Invest´s Executive Committee
which met on a monthly basis to oversee its operation.

It must be noted that financial information was produced as to comply with the projects administrative
requirement and lacked the details, formats and scope that could allow a financial analysis of how the
money was effectively spent and determine the effectiveness of the budget. No detailed financial
statements were found and the evaluation team had to compile the information necessary to assess the
overall budget of the organization. It would seem that the focus of the organization was more in
obtaining the funds than controlling how it was spent.

5.     Successful Execution of an investment promotion strategy

As was previously highlighted, INVEST was able to deliver positive, tangible and outstanding results in
terms of increasing foreign Investment inflows and new jobs created during the period 2005-2008. Such
effective performance drastically compares to the period 2000-2004 when the unit was unable to operate.

One of the most valuable legacies from Proguat was the Investment promotion strategy plan that was
presented in 2000. Having a focused, world-class and tailor made Strategy Plan which was developed in
1999 and presented in 2000, allowed INVEST to sharply reduce the planning phase and rapidly get into
the execution mode.

INVEST´s business plan was to execute in a 5 year period a comprehensive investment promotion
strategy. Technical support for developing this strategy took place between 1998 and 2000 and
culminated with a detailed strategy and business plan objectives. Technical support took place between
1998 and 2000 and culminated with a detailed business plan objectives. The proposed strategy was
delivered by The Services Group, a specialized consultant group hired by the World Bank.

The strategy recommended an activity mix that included:
                    i. Country Image Building
                   ii. Proactive promotion
                  iii. Investor servicing
                  iv. Investment generation

Activities were reported on a regular basis to the unit's management which held a weekly
operational meeting with the keys staff. During these meetings the investor's pipeline was reviewed as
well as all relevant investment promotion initiatives. Program execution was also closely monitored by
INVEST's Executive Committee which reviewed the unit's operation on a regular basis. They would
meet monthly and receive a detailed report of activities from INVEST's management. These reports
indicated that INVEST tracked each individual potential investor and had a much updated pipeline of all
the contacts that were in their radar screen.

During the life of the project, INVEST executed a number of relevant activities, including:
    promotion of Guatemala as an investment destination at over 37 international trade and
        investment fairs,
    presence in more than 130 international publications
    performed over 20 promotional road shows
    produced relevant promotional material including an investment guide and sector specific
        investment profiles for agri-business, manufacturing, tourism and call centers
    investors received direct and personal support to their investment queries
    targeted proactive promotion was undertaken in the key sectors including identifying, contacting
        and supporting potential investors

     Companies                                              Considerations

Cap Gemini, 24/7 , GE   These call centers can be considered as key success cases for INVEST as they were
(Genpact), Digitex      targeted from scratch by the entity. The potential of the sector was identified a sector
                        study produced. INVEST then proceeded to identify the key players in order to make
                        direct contact and promote Guatemala as an investment location. The role of INVEST
                        was also important in terms of creating the competitive advantage for the development
                        of the sector (incentives for language courses, national campaign for call centers
                        "Quetzales for talking"..)

Fersan                  This bottling company was brought to Guatemala by INVEST. The proactive promotion
                        and facilitation work provided by INVEST was key in providing to the Mexican owner
                        the key arguments to locate in Guatemala. INVEST went to the extent of training the
                        workers In Mexico in order to provide the necessary skills to the company.

Colombina               This Colombian candy manufacturer came to Guatemala without the help of INVEST
                        but its decision to increase its investment and locate its regional manufacturing unit was
                        supported by the entity.

In order to execute its strategy, Invest was able to create a performing team by hiring motivated, skilled
and proactive professionals. The entity became an attractive place to work. The quality of the staff was
also confirmed during the interviews with former staff members and was praised by Investors which had
received support from the entity. INVEST was considered a very prestigious and attractive place to work.

6.       INVEST 2008-2009: A rapid and drastic institutional decline

 Despite the positive track record during the years 2004 to 2008, the key stakeholders of INVEST in
 Guatemala did not succeed in consolidating the implementation unit into a solid institution with the
 necessary guidance and financial commitment that this type of organization requires to perform
 successfully on the long run.

 This represents a clear setback for the Project which intended to foster a unit that would become a strong,
 autonomous and well equipped institution with the backing of both the private and public sector. As of
 September 2009, three months after Project completion, INVEST has practically been dismantled. A
 significant part of the unit's staff has left leaving the organization with only 5 people on board.

 The reasons for such a drastic decline can be found in:
     lack of financial support
     no real protection to political changes and transitions
     lack of ownership and commitment by the key stakeholders responsible for institutional building

           a.            No financial support from the government

 As previously indicated, INVEST did not receive any financial support from the government during the
 lifeline of the Project. The various managerial and direction authorities of INVEST were unable neither to
 generate the commitment from the public sector nor to create the conditions that would provide the
 financial sustainability of the unit after Project completion. Three months after the Project was closed,
 nothing has been achieved in terms of securing funds from the budget of the Ministry of Finance.

 Due to the lack of financial resources, all promotional activities have been scraped and the team has been
 dismantled. The remaining five professionals have recently received the payment of their salaries (three
 months later!) but without any kind of assurance in terms of what will happen in the coming months.

 The government did not stand up to its commitments during the life of the project nor has shown any
 signs of being willing to do it. As of the end of September 2009, no provision had been made in the 2010
 national budget to assign resources to INVEST.

           b.    Limited continuity in both the operation and strategic direction

 Political transitions have generated significant repercussions on investment promotion activities in
 Guatemala. This was true prior to the genesis of INVEST in Guatemala as Proguat was unable to
 effectively set up shop during two government changes. And it took a couple of years for INVEST to find
 the adequate political conditions that would allow it to receive the political support required to start
 operations.

 One of the key objectives of bringing the private sector on board an investment promotion agency is to
 provide continuity to both the direction and the operation and avoid the disruptive aspects of government
 transitions and changes. This was not achieved in the case of Guatemala. The discontinuity in both the
 direction and the management that have prevailed since 2008 and which have severely hampered the
 performance of the agency is a clear indication that the existing structural set-up is still too vulnerable to
 political changes.




                                                      64
          c.    No real institutional building

INVEST was an excellent project implementation unit but was not able to consolidate its initial success
and become a sustainable, autonomous and financially sound institution.

Building a sustainable organization that would outlive its support Project has always been a fundamental
objective of the World Bank assistance projects. As confirmed by MIGA / FIAS officials, the on-going
support provided to INVEST paid special attention to the sustainability aspect and the development of an
autonomous and financial sound institution. INVEST suffered from what could be called a perfect storm,
a set of events and conditions that drastically affected the operational capacity of the organization:
     Change of government created political transition tensions.
     Change of management and direction in 2008, generated major strategic changes which translated
         into a high level of discomfort in the existing team. Participation of private sector was not
         sufficient to secure strategic and operational continuity. A number of key staff preferred to leave
         the unit.
     Lack of financial security for the organization by the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009
         contributed to increased uncertainty within the organization. Most of the remaining staff left.

 A positive sign came in January 2009, when government passed a Presidential Decree that gave INVEST
an institutional character. But such gesture was not complemented by a real commitment from the
government as no financial support was provided.

Investment promotion is not part of the government's political agenda and no support is therefore granted
to a task that has proven its positive, tangible and dynamic contribution to the country's economic
development. Without real political support INVEST runs the risk of reconverting into Proguat, a unit
which had neither operational capacity nor resources. Unless the key stakeholders assume ownership of
the unit, INVEST will become an empty shell.

   7. Conclusion

The Project can claim that it played a relevant, influential and protagonic role in the operational start-up
of INVEST in Guatemala. The entity succeeded in attracting, supporting and facilitating US$ 944 million
of new foreign direct investment and over 24,000 new jobs between 2005 and 2008. INVEST was able to
exceed by 350% its Investment generation objective and by 20% its job creation target.
While the World Bank can legitimately claim that the Project was highly successful in the area of
accelerating foreign investment, it must also acknowledge the fact that INVEST clearly failed to become
a sustainable Investment promotion agency. Despite constant lobby by World Bank and FIAS officials,
the key stakeholders of INVEST in Guatemala did not succeed in consolidating the implementation unit
into a solid institution with the necessary guidance and financial commitment that this type of
organization requires to perform successfully.

Annex 10.        Background Report on Cluster Development by the Project


Análisis del Impacto del Proyecto de Competitividad en Guatemala en el Desarrollo de Clusters
y Cadenas de Valor en Guatemala51

1. El modelo de Fortalecimiento de Clusters mostró su efectividad medida en incremento de
exportaciones en primer lugar y en generación de empleo. Es claro que durante los años analizados, el
ambiente económico mundial fue favorable, pero pareciera observarse que el fortalecimiento de aquellos
grupos empresariales con mayores ventajas "comparativas", pudo concretar aumentos importantes y
sostenidos en el volumen de las exportaciones, casi todas ellas,
exportaciones no tradicionales. Así mismo, el modelo permitió avanzar en la integración de empresas
pequeñas y medianas a cadenas exportadoras, que generaron un mayor empleo y un aumento de la
productividad ­medido en productos de valor agregado y reducciones de costos-. Es de resaltar que
algunas ventajas comparativas, se consolidaron como competitivas, como el posicionamiento en
mercados crecientes.

2. El fortalecimiento de cluster siguió un modelo sistematizado de apoyo. Aquellos grupos
empresariales y sectores conexos del sector público y privado que siguieron el proceso de: a) diagnóstico
de competitividad; b) benchamarking; c) plan estratégico; d) monitoreo de indicadores, pudieron crecer en
exportaciones y en empleo de forma sostenida en un ambiente económico favorable, en comparación de
otros que solamente tuvieron un apoyo en actividades puntuales.

3. Dependiendo de la conformación y dinámica de algunos sectores, es mucho más valioso un
enfoque "bottom ­ up" para el establecimiento de cadenas. En algunos clusters fue evidente que tener
un liderazgo nacional fue inapropiado, pues las decisiones relativas a la competitividad en el nivel micro,
se toman en niveles locales. En estos niveles, lo que pareció ser más importante fue el apoyo en definir el
plan estratégico de cada cadena y la capacidad de generar un "networking" regional por un líder
reconocido y aceptado.

4. El liderazgo del sector privado institucionalizado fue clave para la sostenibilidad económica y
social de los sectores. En su mayoría, los clusters que iniciaron su trabajo bajo su propia iniciativa y
lograron institucionalizar la "gerencia" del cluster, han sido los que avanzaron más rápidamente en la
integración de la cadena y aún continúan trabajando, aun sin el apoyo de PRONACOM. Dado que el
préstamo y la política de competitividad fue cambiando en los últimos tres gobiernos, la visión y el
liderazgo del sector privado fue clave para que se mantuvieran las acciones pro-competitividad en el país.
En los casos en donde el sector privado estuvo dispuesto a compartir el financiamiento de los programas
de apoyo, el fortalecimiento puedo darse de forma más expedita y enfocada hacia el logro del Plan
Estratégico que cada sector definió. En los casos en donde el soporte financiero del sector privado fue
débil, la institucionalidad también lo ha sido.

5. Exportaciones como motivador del proceso de integrar cadenas o clusters. Si bien el apoyo a las
PYMES no fue un objetivo expreso de los clusters, si parece ser que la búsqueda de economías de escala
permitió que muchas PYMEs en los clusters se convirtieran en exportadores directos o indirectos. El
interés de concretar ventas en mercados más grandes y crecientes, permitió que todas las empresas

participantes contrarrestaran la competencia directa que podría haberlos dividido si se hubieran
encontrado compitiendo por los mismos clientes, en un mercado geográfico pequeño como el local.

6. En varios clusters, el mercado provino de inversionistas extranjeros, por lo que la coordinación
con el Programa de Inversión ­Invest in Guatemala- es clave. En los casos en donde la exportación no
era posible, la posibilidad de tener una demanda grande, local y permanente, puede ser también una
motivación importante para integrar cadenas que alcancen la economía de escala de la oferta PYME.
Planes de atracción de inversión y de promoción de competitividad macro, meso y micro coordinados
pudiera hacer que se avance más rápidamente.

7. Los programas de apoyo de los clusters se enfocaron en búsqueda de mercado ­ferias-,
capacitación y asistencia técnica en productividad y certificación de calidad. La mayor parte de los
planes estratégicos desarrollados por los clusters, privilegiaban este tipo de programas, reconociendo que
el mercado era el ancla más importante, con el apoyo de esquemas de productividad y calidad específica
para mantener estos mercados crecientes. El sector privado, especialmente aquel en donde Comisiones de
la Asociación Gremial de Exportadores ­AGEXPORT- fue el líder, mostró una alta eficacia en la
organización y participación en ferias nacionales e internacionales que abrieron o consolidaron mercados.
La eficacia de las ferias en el aumento de las exportaciones, sin embargo, dependen del grado de
preparación de los participantes. En todos los casos, se pudo observar que los organizadores hicieron
esfuerzos importantes en la búsqueda de clientes y en la promoción de los eventos, sin embargo, los
participantes que lograron hacer contactos y posteriormente exportaciones, fueron aquellos que: i) tenían
productos que demostraban llenar las expectativas de los clientes; ii) mostraban dominar los instrumentos
para exportar ­webpages, cotizadores por volumen, mecanismos de pago fáciles y accesibles y
certificaciones que amparaban la calidad, por ejemplo-; iii) dominio del inglés o el idioma del país de
destino, lo que hace tener una comunicación fluida; y iv) servicio post-venta.

8. El apoyo del PRONACOM provino de diferentes ejes complementarios. La construcción de una
Agenda Nacional de Competitividad de largo plazo, permitió identificar áreas en donde la competitividad
mostraba brechas, que limitaban el desarrollo del sector privado. Si bien el Eje 6, trabajó con en los
niveles messo ­sectoriales- y micro ­empresas-, es innegable que el trabajo proveído en el sistema de
capacitación técnica o en aspectos de modernización de procesos ­ventanilla ágil, impuestos, visas,
información-, legislación y en infraestructura ­aeropuertos, puertos, carreteras-, permitieron que el sector
privado se enfocara en superar las brechas inherentes a los sectores o a la empresas.

Estas lecciones derivan en las siguientes recomendaciones:

a. El apoyo a cadenas productivas o clusters debe partir del mercado y las ventajas competitivas que
la oferta tiene para alcanzar este mercado. El diagnóstico de competitividad, determinando el tamaño,
características y cuellos de botella del mercado es clave para saber si existe una motivación que facilite la
integración de una cadena de valor que aumente la productividad, la especialización y la innovación de
todos los participantes. El diagnóstico de la demanda específica debe el primer paso para constituir una
cadena.

b. Para integrar una cadena debe existir un liderazgo aceptado en el sector privado. Es probable que
exista un mercado accesible para una oferta integrada; sin embargo, si no existe un líder capaz y aceptado
por todos los participantes en la cadena es muy probable que no se logre concretar ventas crecientes y
sostenidas. El diagnóstico de los actores y su capacidad de liderazgo debe constituir otro elemento clave
para procesos de fortalecimiento de cadenas.




                                                     67
c. El diagnóstico debe ser validado por los actores antes de elaborar el Plan Estratégico de la
cadena. El papel de un plan con una visión clara y acciones de todos los participantes debe partir de la
aceptación del diagnóstico por todos los que participan. El compromiso de esta aceptación es su
capacidad de aportar recursos propios para la implementación de un plan para superar las debilidades o
cuellos de botella encontrados.

d. El apoyo del sector público y de la cooperación internacional debe ser complementario y
coherente con el Plan Estratégico de la cadena. El punto focal para que una cadena se integre es su
propio plan de trabajo y los recursos que la cooperación puede aportar deben apoyar ese plan.

Esto impone la flexibilidad de las agencias de cooperación y de los programas de gobierno, puesto que
muchas veces su propia agenda de desarrollo, podría hacer que la cadena acepte la cooperación
"disponible" y no la que necesita.
