  construction, reconstruction and improvement of trunk and\n            other roads totalling about 717 km largely serving rural\n            areas. The project comprises: (a) improvement of the\n            Nairobi-International Airport road (14 km) to dual\n            carriageway standard; (b) construction or improvement of\n            seven roads (totalling 315 km) serving rich agricultural\n            areas; (c) construction or improvement of 388 km of roads of\n            varying standards required for the Mumias Sugar Development\n            Scheme; and (d) technical assistance for transport planning\n            and coordination. The main economic benefits of the project\n            would take the form of lower vehicle operating costs, user\n            time savings and the increased rate of agriculture\n            development induced by the improved infrastructure. The\n            estimated economic rate of return on the project as a whole\n            is about 20 per cent."}, "docdt": "1973-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
