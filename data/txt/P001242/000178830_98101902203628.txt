REPORT AND PECOM1MEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJEGT
1,        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Kenya for the equivalent of US$29.0 million to help
finance a project for construction or improvement of high priority trunk and
other roads giving access to high potential agricultural areas. The loan
Wo-ld have a term of 25 years including 5 years grace, with interest at
7-1/4 per cent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report of a Bank economic mission which visited Kenya in
September 1971 to review progress made under the current 1970-74 Developnent
Plan entitled '"Economic Progress and Prospects in Kenya" (Report No. AE-22
Of March 3, 1972), was distributed (R72-60) to the EKecutive Directors on
March 17, 1972.
v.        A basic economic mission visited Kenya during March/April 1973 to
examine the progress made by the economy during the first decade of Inde-
per.dence and to assess the strategic choices -hich face the Kenya GIovernxnent
as the country prepares to embark upon the second decade.  It is expected
that the complete report, Including an evaluation of the Government's draft
Third Development Plan for the period 1974-78 and a review of all the manor
sectors of the economy, will be ready for distribution to the Executive
Directors about the end of 1973. The following section on the present
position of the Kenya economy and the prospects for the future incorporates
the preliminary conclusions of the basic mission.
ii.       In terms of overall growth, Kenya's economic performance since
Independence has been impressive in almost all respects. During the period
since 1964, GDP has growrn at an average rate of about 7 per cent in real terms,
which has allowed significant gains in per capita income despite the high
population growth rate. Investment has been sustained at a high rate
in both the private and public sector and in recent years fixed capital forma-
tion has accounted for over 25 per cent of monetary GDP.  This rate of invest-
ment has been made possible by one of the highest domestic savings rates in
the developing world (19-20%), and a large inflow of external aid.
5.        The Governmentts fiscal and monetary management has been one of the
factors responsible for the generally sound performance of the economy. On
the fiscal side, the public sector's performance has been very impressive.
In FY1964, Kenya had a recurrent budget deficit, a relatively insignificant
development budget and was heavily dependent on external aid. Since then,
by virtue of its determined taxation policies and disciplined control on



- 2 -
spending, the Government has converted its recurrent deficit into a sub-
stan.tial surplus (which in 1970/71 accounted for 23 per cent of all national
sa irngs), has expanded its development budget at an average rate of 27 per
Cent a vear, and has considerably reduced its relative dependence on external
aid. 'he fact that, t-hroughout most of this period, Kenya achieved these
reualts without any significant resort to deficit financing or expensive
forms of external financing, and that internal inflation was almost negligible,
makes this performance even more imnpressive.
6.        As Kenya prepares to enter its second decade of independence, how-
ever, -t faces a number of critical issaes about the future course of economic
management.  In several respects   the Kenya econoTrV has reached a turninrg
point in its development.  In agriculture, the impetus provided to the mone-
U3zataun of the smallholder sector by the major programs of land transfer and
settlement is slackening.  There is nowv little scope for further import sub-
sti'tntion, and market constraints face most of the major export crops.  In
manufacturing, the policy of import substitutlon has rnot only reached the
point o. diminishing returns but has proved cost-y to the extent that it
has erncouraged inefficient industries and discouraged exports. In a mcre
general sense, the economic managers can expect to find their task iricreas-
ingly difficuilt now that mranz-y of the easier things have been accomplished
and that the ecornomy 's pushhing nearer to the litius of i-ts resources.
Finally, in tackling the development tiask, Keniya is riot helped by detorio-
rating terms of trade, the periodic world financial crises, and the dis-
ruptions which have occurred in the East African Community.
7,       iWhile Kenyaf s performaance in mobilizing domestic savings
and maintaining a high rate of capital formation has been very satisfactory,
capital output ratios have been increasing, and thae progress made in gener-
ating employment and distr:ibuting income ecuitably has been genarally dis-
appo.intinga0  This is partly due to the heavy empha sis during the early years
of independence to building up infrastructure and social services in the
economy. But it also reflects the fact that much OIf the investment in the
llproductivell sectors has not given as hiA¢gh a return as it should. -le there-
fore see a need for a greater emphasis on the directly productive sectors
in resource allocation and a more efficient 2tilization of resources within
the productivre sectors themiselves,
SD        A recrientation of investment policy directly focuses attention
on the two major productive sectors: agriculture and resource-oased manu-
facturing. CuIr studies ir,licate that agriculture uses resources more
'efficientlyr' in all senses in creating incomes and employment, conserving
scarce capital and skilled manpower, redistributiLng income, generating
foreig,n exchange and perhaps even stimulatinrg savings than other sectors.
.r-eover, in the context of Kenya, the possible policy dilemma of harVin  to
ltr,ade-cffPl crowtnh against employment (and income distribution) does not seeTr
tc arise since both gowth and equit.y =coals can be achieved through this kind
o: restructured growth pattern.  it would appear that the agricultural sector
h-!s been widel-y- discriminated against, particularly by the trade protective
system and, to some extent, by dornestic pricing policies and we believe that
these impediments should be removed.



9.        In manufacturing, it appears that while Kenya may wel" have a
3omparatire advantage in agricultural-based processing, the protection
given  o 40 import substitution has not only encouraged the establishment of
manr inefficient industries and discouraged exports, but has discriminated
against agriculture.  Improved incentives for efficient resource allocation
may result from the incipiert moves towards uniform tariffs and incent-ives
for exports, which the Kenyan author-ties are already contemplatingc in col-
laboratiDn with the other two partner States of the East African Community.
10.       Dit restructuring growth is not easy, in any country, and Kenya
will face a number of particular problems of her own.   Lhe first is to create
the appropriate environment in which these developments can take place.   In
Kenya, this mainly ineans finding the right rackage of incentives to induce
the privatie sector not only to develop rapidly but to develop in a manner
which will bring greater benefits to Kenya.
11.       A second problem Kenya faces is the capacity of the public- sector
to accelerate growth in the preferred sectors, particularly in agriculture
and small-scale business and to do a better job of screening new large scale
industries. Both the basic economic mission and the agricultural sector
survey mission last year have emphasized the problem of absorptive capacity
in agriculture. The problem is of course largely one of skilled manpower,
and it is clear that Kenya's development potential will continue to be cur-
tailed by the scarcity of skill for a long time.
12.       Since Independence, Kenya has shown a commendable flair for solving
her own problems in her own way and, as indicated earlier, has already taken
some important steps towards initiating the kind of economic reforms which
have been outlined; and it is expected that other reforms will be made. If
Kenya is to succeed in achieving rapid growth and increasing equity, it will
need continued external support, not only in an increasing flow of foreign
capital on concessionary terms, but also a more flexible approach to local cost
financing and project design.   It -ill also need a continued flow of techn5-'ncWl
assistance.
-1)       Since Independence at the end of 1963, Kenya's total external debt
increased from $258 million to $435 million at the end of 1971, of Wilich 5305
million had been disbursed. In addition to its own external public debt,
Kenya is also jointly responsible, together with the other two Partner States,
for the debts incurred by the East African Community and its inst--tutions,
which amounted to some $277 million in September 1972. About 28 per cent of
Kenya's external debt is held by the Bank Grouip, more or less equally divided
between Bank and IDA. By the end of the next five year plan period (1)78),
the proportion of debt held by the Bank Group could rise to about L0 per cent.
The Bank also holds about half of the Community's external debt.
14       Kenya is well able to accept an increased burden of external debt.
In 1971, Kenya's debt service ratio (including a nominal one-third share of
EAC debt service) was under 6 per cent.   Kenya's debt servYce burden is there-
fore still quite light. Recent projections undertaken by the basic economic
Mission suggest that the burden of debt could rise sharply (to possibly 16 p,r



-4 -
cent by the end of the 1970C) if the past structure of economic growth is
xaintained and if Kenya is forced to close her resource gap by increasing
resoance on conventional borrowing.  Thus, while Kenya remains creditworthy
for so-me add-i`onal borrowing on conventional terms, it is important that
capital inflows on concessionary terms be forthcoming if the burden of
extearnal debt is not to rise sharply.
PART TI - BANK GROUP LENDING TO KENYA
75.       Kenya has to date received seven Bank loans and thirteen IDA credits
amounting to $95.0 million and $88.7 million, respectively.  In addition, Kenya
has been one o;' the beneficiaries of nine loans totallhng $219.8 million which
have been extended for the development of common services (railways, ports,
telecommunications and finance for industry) operated regionally for the tihree
Partner States of the East African Community -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
Annex II contains summary statements of Bank loans and IDA credits to Kenya
and the East African Community organizations, a surmmary of LEC investments in
Kenya, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       Most of the Bank Group's direct lending to Kenya in the iast has
beenL for infrastructure, particularly transportation and power, although
other sectors such as agriculture and forestry, education and water- supply
have also received support. As stated above, we have felt for somie time
that the Baik should give greater emphas.s in its lending to Kenya to agri-
cultuire and other directly productive sectors, particularly for projects
which will extend more immediate benefits to large numbers of people and
wit., as much as possible, increase Kenya's foreign exchange earnings.
Wdith this objective in mind, the Bank agreed with the Government on a pro-
gram for expanding the Bank's technic.al assistance in agriculture. A rural
sector survey was mounted in Kenya towards the end of' 1972, 'We have offered
an expanded program of assistance in project identification through the
Permanent Mission in East Africa, and have pro-vided a senior agricultural
advisor to assist thle Government in charting a longer-term! strategy for the
agricuLtural sector.
17.       This exiDanded teclmical assistance is starting to show results.
A second agricultural credit project was approved by tne Executive Directors
in November 1972. A proposed LDA credit of $21.5 million and a complementary
financing package of further $14.2 million from various donors including
Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States for a second livestock pro-
ject, which covers a five-year beef development program calling for a total
.nvestment of $52 million has been negotiated and will be submitted for consi-
deration by the hxecutive Directors. A proposed loan of $15 million for a
thirdd tea development project covering the development of factories required
to process green leaf from existing plantings is expected to be negotiated
shortly  Preparatory work is under way for a diversified smallholder pro-
duction project for the dryer areas of eastern Kenya, an irrigation project
for the Lo-er Tana area, and for a proj4ect to resettle and rehabilitate the
currently underutilized large commercial farms in the high potential areas.



-hile these results of our joint efforts are encouraging, they are only a
beginning.  To support adequately the development of agriculture and the
rural areas of Kenya will require sustained effort. Once the Government
has had an opportunity to study bo'th the rural sector survey report and
the basic economic report we shall discuss further with them how best the
Bank Group can support accelerated agricultural development in Kerya during
the forthcoming 1974-78 Development Plan period.
18o       usJoncurrently with efforts to promote the development cf the rural
economy, substantial investment will continue to be required to maintailn
public services abreast of economic growth, and we expect to con in-ue fiin al-
cing key infrastructure projects.   The project now proposed for financin;
the construction of trunk, and other roads essentially serving the rural
areas and an upcoming loan for an industrial development finance institutli on
fall i,n this categor. A credit to be negotiated shortly will assist Kenya's
much needed. family planning program.
19.       The Bank is continuing its lending to the instit,,utions o  The r'lSt
African Community.  A loan of $32.5 million for the Third Telecomr,iatior,s
Project was approved by the &cecutive Directors on June 22, V?73.
200       IFC has investments in three enterprises in Kenya:   $13 million in
the PanafrIcan Paper Iills, Ltd.; $5.7 million in Kenya Hotel Prcperz-es, Ltd.
and $2.4 million in Tourism Promotion Services, Ltd. (Kenya).   A furthor
investment in Panafrican Paper l-ills, Ltd. is presently under negotiation.
IFC is also ccnsidering an investment in a Maize, Starch and Glucose Project.
PJLRT TII - THE TAiNSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
21.      'The Republic of Kenya covers an area of 583,000 k      Ilore th;n
half the country, in the north and east, is arid and sparsely populatedi with
few transport links.  The most attractive areas for settlement are along t'-e
coast and in the highlands in the sourthwest between Mount Keyva and Lake
Victoria, where over ha'f the total population of twel-ve rrilliori lives in
one-fifth of the country's total area.   This pattern of settlement is re-
flected in the transport network, with the main rail line and trunk road
system and a subsidiary system of branch lines and secondary and minor roads
serving these areas.  Kenya is highly dependent on foreign trade.    The major
port, lIombasa, is used for the export of primary products and for the import
of essential consumer goods, fuel, equipment and machinery. I1Eombasa a'lso
serves Uganda and iwanda, and some parts of northern Tanzania and eastern
Zaire.
22.       The transport sector (including Kenya's share of common services)
accounts for about 8.5 per cent of GDP and is expected to absorb about 20 per
cent of the projected investments under the current Development Plan (1970-7ij).



-6-
23.       Thle heaviest concentration of inland transport facilities and.
traffic . s on thAe 1000-km corridor from the port of Mombasa to Kenya's western
border with Uganda, passing through Nairobi and the populous southwestern area
of the country. The corridor is served by road, rail and air services.   For
4nports and exports through M.ombasa, and indeed for other long-distance bulk
nova:rients, tbe railway is the mlost important carrier, providLng the princilpal
outtlet to the sea for both Kenya and Uganida. The main railway line from Uganda
to Monlbasa, together with subsidiary lines feeding into it, accounts for some
1,600 kmr of the total 5 650 k1m sy1sterm of the East African dZailways Corporation
(1ARC) which is jointly owned by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Of the total
ann.ual traffic (of about 12 million tons) handled by the 29O, 60 per cent
cri,ginates or terminates in Kenya. The Bank nas made three loans for railway,
improvements in iast Africa.
24L.      Ken'ials road network is made up ot' approximately 23,000 km of trunit:
r-rnary, and secondary roads, 20,000 km of- minor roads and 3,000 Ion of special
purpose -roads such as those serving tcurist, tea Collection, and sugar areas.
This c,lassi-fication, in sone cases, reflects the projected econo,mic role of
roads rather than their present function, and many of the roads classified as
trunm or primar-% are low standard earth and gravel roads with small tra-.fc
volum-es, Althouggh the length of' paved roads has tripled in the last decade,
totallin: about 3,300 km in 1972, about 80 per cent of the neltwork consists
of earth roads or tracks, ancl many of the gravel and earth roads serving keyr
ag-r-cu1tural and tourist areas do not provide all-weather service,
2>. *     Kenya 's principal harbor is at MIombasa. It has 13 deep-water q,iuay,ro
plus lighterage faciLlities. A new -wharf which has recently been completed
and two now bertls, together with bulk handling facilities, are presen-tly beng
constructed by the i!ast Africta Harbours Corporation as part ofP a Bank-financed
Project (Loan No. 638-EA).   These additional facilities, as well as the program
of miodernization financed under the Third Harbors Project (Loan No. 866-E;A),
are expected to ease tlle congestion presently prevai'ling in tahe port.
Kenya is served by 22 major international airlines arnd the East
Afri c-anl Airwua-s Corporatlon (EAAC) which is owned equally by Keny,ra, Tainzania
and Uganda.  In addition to EAAC, a numb'er of smaller private carriers operate
chart-er services in Kenya, as elsewhere in East Africa.  The two principal
airports a.re tItbakasi at Nairobi and Port Reitz at Mombasa. The &nbakasi run-
way caun handle all aircraft in commercial use. Hrlowever, inadequate taLxiw-ay,
terminal and cargo-handling facilities are the cause of increasing congestion
and delays and a project to improve and partly reconstruct these facilities
nas been financed by the Bank (Loan Nio. 826-KE).
B. Higllways
Traffic Growth and Characteristics
27.      Gro-wth of road traffic averaged about 5 per cent annually throughout
the sixties, the heaviest increase being on trunk roads accounting for about
70 per cent of total vehicle kilometers but only 12 per cent o. road system
kilometers. Over the past decade, the vehicle fleet has grown at an average



-7-
annual rate of about 5 per cent.  In 1972, about 47 per cent of the vehicles
were estimated to be passenger cars and 33 per cent light trucks and buses.
The n.umber of heavy trucks accounts for about 12 per cent of the fleet and.
their average size has increased steadily with trucks of 5-ton capacity or
more accounting for about 50 per cent of the total fleet in 1972, compared
nith less than 33 per cent in 1y61.  Competitive road transport rates at-
tracted petroleum traffic away from the railway and truck operators, taking
advantage of lax enforcement of vehicle weight regulations, brought in
truicks with caDacities of over 30 tons and axle loads well over 8,000 kg.
The trunk roads, however, were not designed for carrying such heavy loads
and their condition iteriorated rapidly. Stricter enforcement of vehicle
wei&ht regulations by; highway patrols of the Kenya Police is now bringing
the situation under control. The Bank Group has assisted in thais effort
by providing automatic weigh bridges on the Nairobi-Mombasa road under the
Fourth Highway Project (Credit No. 276-KE). The Government has provided
assurances that vehicle weighti regulations will continue to be rigorously
enforced.
Ad.ministration
28.       The Ministry of Works (MOW) has responsibility for administration,
construction and maintenance of the highway system. It has several depart-
ments (Roads, Materials, Structures, Electrical, Mechanical, etc.) all report-
ing to the Lngineer-in-Chief, who is the senior teclhnical officer of the
Ministry.  Formerly there was some overlapping of executive functions which
militated against efficiency but under a recent reorganization, the Chief
Engineer. Roads.as head of the Roads Department, has been given executive
responsibility over all functions pertaining to highways, including the
maintenance and repair of equipment. Most senior and middle management
posts in the Roads Department are filled by Kenyan nationals.   Two advisors
and a number of middle management positions are filled by expatriates provided
under bilateral aid. According to current projections these positions will be
filled by Kernans within about five years. To supplement its permanent staff,
the Department employs consultants for development projects as required.
Maintenance
29.       In 1968, the road network was found to be deteriorating,
partly because of overloading butlargely because the organization for road
maintenance was no longer adequate. A study was undertaken as part of the Third
Highway Project (Loan No. 639-KE) which recommended reorganization of the MOW,
an extensive training program and provision of new maintenance equipment.   Under
the new organization which was adopted in January 1970, the MIOW has full respon-
sibility for all public highways with the exception of some minor local authority
roads.  It also maintains about 3,500 km of other   roads for special agencies.
The maintenance of roads in larger urban areas is delegated by the MOW to
local authorities who receive supporting grants-in-aid.
30.       In response to the findings of the maintenance study referred to above,
the Government is undertaking an extensive highway maintenance p-oject with the
financial assistance from the Bank Group (Credit No. 22L-KE). Under this project,
the staff of the Roads Department has been strengthened, maintenance equipmenL



and works'nops are being pro-ided, and supervisors, equipment operators and
mechanics are being trained0  As a rasult, road maintenance is improving
ranidly ana we are reasonably confident that the national road network will
continue to be adequately ma:intained.
PlanniLng and. F5Jinencing
31.       The M4inistry of Finance and Economic Planning, working closely with
tne MC)W, prepares broad investment plaris for the highway sector at the begin-
ning of each Five-Year Plan poeriod.  The MOW, through its Planning Unit.,
evaluates proposed Drojcts a-nd prepares de-tail'ed invest.rent programs0 hThe
Third Development Plan (1 919-78) is currently under preparation.
3:2.      Road construction under thae ong;oing Second Development Plan (1970-
'1974 is expected to account for nearly 30 per cent of total planne-d ,ublic
sector development expenditure during the period. As orJi-inally conceived,
the Plan allocated KSi 360 million for caoital investment in rcads, a size-
able increase over road development expenditures dluring the previous fi.ve
years (KSh 380 million).  Because of increasec, corst,ruction costs and the
need for hig.her construction standards, the revised Plan will involve much
h'sgher expenditures than were origina1ly pla'I edy
33.       A large proportion of the funds devoted to highways during the last
decade have been for the upgrading and maintenaace of trunk roads which, have
sustained the heavies; traffic growth. As the trunk road system is gradually
being brought up to a satisfactory standard, the major emphasis h-as shifted
to the improvement of roads serving rural areas. T''he work included in the
present project, as well ac the previous project (Fourth Hiighway Project -
Credit No. 276-KE), are indicative oz the increased emphasis being given bLy
the Government to agricultural developmentc and, accordingly-. to the improve-
raent of access to areas of high agricultural potential.
3!4.      External aid, nearly two-thirds from the Bank Group, wil account
for nearly half of total hdghway investment during the current Plan period.
Other sources, including Italy, Iederal Republic of Germany, S-witzerland,
United Kingdom-, anada, Sweden, Norway, United States alnr the African Devel-
opment Bank, have also provided or promised assistarces,
Road User Char- s
35.       Until 1270, revenues from road user charges exceeded highway con-
struction and m>._intenance expenditures and covered all highwav costs and
contributed  to the Governmentts general revenues,  With the recent high
rate of i4ncrease in highway expenditures, the situation has changed and in
7',27 highwa- e.x-zpenditures exceeded revenues by 30 per cent0  Over the next
few years, rejenues are expjected to remain slightly below expenditures.
However, the structllre of the current road user chargi.ng system appears to
reflect satisfactorily the relative costs imposed by vehicles on the highway
system.



-9-
Erngine erintl
36.       High-way design standards are sound and appropriate, allowing for
progressive stage construction as traffic develops. MOW4 policy is to use
its own staff wherever possible to design roads, and in the past, the
Ministry was able to carry out a substantial volume of work.  At present,
however, due to the shortage of sufficiently experienced engineering staff.
particularly in the middle grades, most of the work is carried out by con-
sultants; there are a number of international firms operating from Nai.robi.
The Government has formulated a long-term plan to produce more gradua+e
engineers, and, as they become available, in-house design work will be in-
creased to provide more prcfessional training opportunities to Kenyan staf:.
It is the current policy of the MOW to second pupil engineers to consultants
engaged in supervision of contracts to gain field experience in construction.
Construction
37.       Highway construction is carried out, for the most part, by cnritract.
The contracting industry in Kenya has grown considerably in recent years, and
major works have been awarded both to large local firms and to foreign firms
with branches in Kenya. Smaller works, notably isolated bridge constiuction
andi gravelling contracts, have generally been awarded to smaller local con-
tractors. Contract work is on a unit price basis, major contracts Deing
awarded after international competitive bidding, while small contracts are
awarded after local competitive bidding.
38.       For- non-contract work, the MOW utilizes its own construction uni.ts,
including labor from the National Youth Service (NYS) created to provide
training and employment for school leavers. Formerly these units lacked
realistic costing and produced poorer workmanship than normally required of
contractors.  They have improved with experience and their performance is
now satisfactory, They are currently engaged on the construction of the road
to Ethiopia north of Isiolo, and some settlement roads financed under the
Third and Fourth Highway Projects financed by the Bank Group (Loan No. 635-KE
and Credit No. 276-KE).
39,       The NYS is only one of several schemes introduced i n Kenya to alle-
viate unemployment through labor intensive road construction of certain
classes of roads. For example, the 14OW sometimes specifies a high labor com-
ponent in contracts for projects it feels can appropriately be carried out
utilizing hand labor. Poor performance and high financial costs in the past
have militated against large-scale labor intensive work on high standard
roads so that this method of execution is now confined by the MOW to gravel-
ling and minor improvements to low-standard rural roads. Within the Ministry
of Agriculture three Special Rural Development Areas have been established
on an experimental basis, and several schemes to rehabilitate rural. penetra-
tion roads on a labor intensive basis have been started. Wde intend to Lollow
the progress of these pilot schemes closely.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
h0.       Transport policy and coordination matters are ccmplicated by the
fact that railways, harbors and airways are administered by separate Community-



- 1'O -
cor-orations as common services for the three goverrments, while highways
and the regulation of road transport remain the responsibility of individual
gove.lnments. There is no institution at the Community -evel f or intermodal
coordi nati on a-rd planning.  Within Kenya, the Ministry of Power and Comau-
n icatilorS (   hiW0) has the task of coordinating the plans and activities of the
national arnd communlty transport entities, but effective coordination is
±act!zing. Though the MPC is entrusted with the task of formulating overall
transport policy, in practice it tends to confine its attention to 'comnmunityt
transport, leaving 'rational. transport, i.e., highways, to the MOW, which is
responsible for providing and maintaining the highway system but not for road
Trhe  rt  p Dolicy and regulation. Liaison between the two Mini.stries is poor.
The Government is strangthening both the MOW and the MPC, however, to correct
this0
41.       The Government also pro-poses to undertake a Road Transport Study
ea-r-y in the next planning period to be executed jo:intly bDy the Minristry
of Pinance and :Planning, the MOW and the MPC n  -t will provide data and
analysis for road transport policy within the broader context OI rational
economic planning, evaluate haighway investment projects and propose other
rmeasures for road transport efficiency.  The Government has confirmed its
intention to iJ,mplement this study and has agreed upon its scope end timring
with the BaxLnk-
42.       The difficulties of tranrsport coordinat,ion have been most evident
iin road-rail competition. The development of the econcomy has been heavily
dependent on the railway arnd from an early stage a policy was followed of
encouraging agricultural production for export b-y means of a differential
rail tarifL   The tariff was based on the value rather than. the transport
cost of shipments. extending low rat-es to agricultural produce ard charg-ing
cor-respondingly higher rates for higher value imported manufactures and
materials. To protect this tariff structure against the effects of road
com-petition, strict quantitative and operational restrictiors were imposed
on road transport. Nonetheless, improvements to the highway system, the
i;ncreasing efliciency of road transport an.u lax enforcement of the regula-
tions resulted in an increasing diversion of lhigh rated traffic from rail
to road, Given the rigid rail tariff structure, a pattern of distribution
consequently emeerged bearing little relationship to comparative transport
costs, There was a continuing decline in the railwacy's operating surplus
which focused the Community's attention on the problem,
43.       The terms of the Third East African Railways Loan (No. 67h-EA)
provide for the implementation by aA3C and the -Kenya Goverrinent of several
measures (identified under an earlier study) essential to efficient utiliz-
aticn and develorjment of East Africa's trarnsport resources. These are:
(a) revision of the existina rail tariff to relate it more closely to the
cost of transportation rather than the value of goods; (b) the elimination,
following the rail tariff revisions, of regulationE imposed on road compe-
tition; and (c) an assessment, of the economic feasibility of selected rail-
way lines and services.



)4L4.     The rail tariff has been reviewea and a proposal for revising a
numaber of individual rates has been submitted to the Community for approral;
fu-ther revisions are expected to follow. The capacity of the main Mombasa-
Nairobi railwav line is to be studied and consultants are examining uneconomic
lines.  The case for a pipeline to replace rail and road transport of refined
petroleum products over the same route has been examined by the Government and
the Bank and has in principle been accepted,
TD. The Banc Group Role in the Sector
45.       The proposed project will be the Bank Group's ninth for ro-ad devel-
opment in Kenya.  Past projects concerned wholly or in part with roads anrc
supported by $87.2 million of Bank Group financing have brought a wide arage
of benefits to agriculture, tourism and the general economy. Traffic zrowth
has generally exceeded forecasts, yielding benefits higher thanr those ori-
girnally expected.  The various projects included the upgrading of all classes
of roads through the country.  The agricultural sector has been a prime bene-
ficiary.  For example, Credit No. 77-KE for road improvement provideii thhe
infrastructure that not only facilitated the execution of the sna}lholuer
tea scheme financed under Credit iNo. 64-KE, but stimulated irtcreasod agra-
cultural production of a wide range of crops in areas that were pre-viously
mostlv forest.  Similarly, Credit No. 104-KE provided the road network needed
to move sugar cane to the factory and the refined product to market. in the
Fourth Highway Project financed by IDA (Credit No. 270-KE) and Swede., 75' per
cent of the expenditure was for roads serving agricultural areas.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
h6.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the  i-fth Highway Project - Kenya"
(No. 14la-KE, dated July25, 1973) is being circulated separately. A Loan and
Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
4.7.      The project was appraised in the field in September 1972 but ap-
praisal could not be completed until supplementary data was made available in
January 1973.  Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in
May 1973.  The Kenya Government was represented by:  Mr. P. Shiyukah, Permmanent
Secretary, Ministry of Works; Mr. S. Mbugua, Engineer-in-Chief, Xinistry ofc
'Works; Mr. N. P. Radier, Chief Engineer (Roads), Ministry of Works; Mr. G.
'WJabuke, Chief Development Engineer; Mr. A. L. arap Ngeny, Undersecretary,
Ministry of Finance & Planning; and Mr. B. Coukis, Adviser.
Project Description, Cost and Implementation
48.       The project comprises:  (a) improvement of the Nairobi-~fnternationsE
Airport road (14 km) to dual carriageway standard; (b) construction or imnpro-,ce-
ment of seven roads (totalling 315 km) servinrg rich agricultural areas; (c) con-
strulction or improvement of 388 km of roads of varying standards required for
the Mumias Sugar Development Scheme; and (d) technical assistance for trasrns-
port planning and coordination.



- 12 -
49.       The total cost of the project is estlmated at $hh.0 million equi-
valent.  The foreign exchange component is estimated at $29.0 million (66 per
cerit). The proposed loan of $29.0 million would cover the foreign exchange.
costs; the local currency costs amounting to $15.0 million would be financed
by thre Goverrnent.
5{.'.     As in past highway projects, the MOW would be responsible for the
execution of the proposed project. Although the Ministry's technical caua-
c-ty has increased (para. 28 above), it will continue to require assistance
from consultants for construction supervision and provision has been made
under the loan for their retention.
Project Benefits
51.      iWhile in future economic development Kenya will need to place
greater emphasis on directly productive sectors, such as agriculture, than
in the past, large investments in roads and other inf'rastructure will still
be requi.red particularly for supporting agriculture and, tourism. This pro-
ject, with its emphasis on the improvement of roads in areas of high agri-
cultural potential is consistent with this strategy.  It is also in con-
sonan-ce with the genera' theme of the Draft 10974-78 Development Plan which
will be inItiated during the project implemehtation period.
52.       The Nai-robi-International Airport road section, to be constructed
on a new alignment under the project, is not only the major access road to
&ast Af'rica's most important international airport, but is also the busiest
section of the Nairobi-Mombasa trunk route and of the international trunk
road to Tanzania. T'he design of the new road is also tied into the Nairobi
City Council's plan for the future growth of the City and it is expected
that the project road will form part of a future ring road around the City.
Traffic on this section is currently 10,000 vehicles per day and is con-
servatively estimated to double in about ten years. About 45 per cent of
this traffic is for the airport. The improvement of the road will benefit.
both through traffic and airport traffic with the realignment resulting in
a significart distance reduction for airport traffic.
53.       All other roads included in the project, accounting for about 35
per cent of the total project, will serve rich agricultural areas. A number
of them are either extensions of roads constructed under past projects -r a
further step in the program of stage construction.  These roads will link
agricultural areas with the turnk road network ensuring all-weather access
to factories and markets for smallholders.  At present, transport of agri-
cultural products is frequently frustrated by the poor condition of the
existing roads and difficult terrain, particularly during the rainy season.
whenl sections become impassable.  The upgrading and realignment of the roads
will yield savings in vehicle operating costs, reduce distances to markets
and stimulate agricultural output by providing more dependable access to
markets. In certain instances, improvements will augment the tourism poten-
tial of the areas,

54.       The main economic benefits of the project would take the form. of
lower vehicle operating cots, user time savings and the increased rate oj'
agriculture development induced by the improved infrastructure.  The est-i-
mated economic rate of return on the project as a whole is about 20 per cent.
Procurement and Di4sbursenent
55.       Contracts would be let after international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for carrying out of all the
construction work in the proposed project with the exception of about 32-j 1cn
of low grade access tracks and sugar collection road urgently required for
the ':umias Scheme (accounting for less than 1% of total project costs).
These tracks are being constructed under a negotiated contract by the managing
agents for the Sugar Scheme. The Government has adopted thnis procedure be-
cause of the urgent need to begin planting sugar for the 1O75 crushing season.
The managing agents, who are experienced in feeder road construc-tion as welL
as sugar planting, are carrying out construction of tracks with equlipment
provided by the Government, The small amount of equipmnent requirec (CcOS;_.o`
$"194,000 of which about 90- is foreign) has been procured locally in accord-
ance wTith normal Government procedures. In addition, since she equipment
needed to be procured and work commenced by January 1973, tne Governmient has
requested that expenditures up to $340,000 on these roads be financed retro-
actively from January 1, 1973. Provision for such retroactive financing has
been included in this loar.
50.       Disbursements would be made for the estimated foreign exchlange
component of the goods and services procured.  The loan is expected to be
disbursed over five years.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of Kenya.
the Report of' the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(ii   of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.  The draft
Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans for highway projects.
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the krticles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan,

C.  Projects in Execution-'
Credit 105 - Agricultural Credit; $3.6 million Credit of May 11,
i96'7; Closing Date: June 30, 1973.  Project implementation was initially
delayed because of problems in recruiting and retaining satisfactory manage-
ment and adequate staff. Recruitment and retention of suitable staff on a
long term basis continues to be a problem. This problem has in particular
led to accounting backlogs. Steady progress is however being made. Dis-
bursement was completed by Closing Date.
Credit 119 - Tea Development; $2.1 million Credit of June 17, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973. This project is a continuation of the pro-
ject financed under Credit No. 64-KE. KTDA has carried out its expansion sro-
gram under the project with minimal recourse to the funds provided under the
credit because its revenues were greater and its costs lower than anticipated0
Under this project 35,000 acres were to be planted over the period 1968-1973
but this program -as accelerated and planting has been completed. The bal-ance
is expected to be cancelled<,
Credit 129 - Livestock Development; $3.6 mi'llion Credit of September
26, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 197t*    A Swedish Credit of the same
amoun-t has aso been made for this project.  Initial implementation was slow
in part because of the project's pioneering nature, for which Kenya had little
prior experience. Progress on project execution has improved greatly during
the oast two years and all funds for ranch develo-pment have been committed.  It
is expected that the bulk of the credit will be disbursed by the present Closirng
Date, and disbursements completed by J-une 30, 1974.-
Loan 63S - Highways; $23.5 million Loan of October 10, 1969; Closing
Date:  December 31, 1973.  Constru Tc   is about 60 per cent completed and all
contracts are proceeding on schedule.
Loar. 641 - Forest Plantation; $2.6 million Loan of November 7, 1969;
Closing Date:  Decem er 31 197r5   Progress is generally satisfctory and at
the present rat     d sb-ursement, the loan will be fully drawn down well before
Closing Date.
Credit i85 - Education; $6.1 million Credit of May 20, 1970; Closing
Date:  December 31, 1975,  Construction work and procurement of furniture and
equipment is generally proceeding satisfactorily.  It is expected that all pro-
ject institutions except one will be completed prior to the December 1974 pro-
ject completion date; the remaining school for wnich the Government is proposing
modificatiions is expected to be completed about June 1975, six months prior to
the December 31, 1975 Clos-ing Date. Progress in Educational Planning has not
achieved the objectives as envisaged partly because the Planning Unit has only
recently been fully staffed.  As a remedy an Educational Sector Review mission
requested by the Government is being considered for later this year.
-'These notes are designed to inform the 3cecutive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are being
encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be read in
this sense, and with the umderstanding that they do not purport to present a
balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 714 - Water Supply; $8.3 mil-lion Loan of November 7, 1969;
Closing Date: March 31,1975. Most of the construc;ion contracts have been
awarded ald although there had been some delay in the supply of pipes and
accessories, this is not expected to delay project completion. The Water and
Sewerage Department is experiencing serious staffing shortages in its engineer-
ing and commercial sections due to inability to attract and retain staff. The
Government and City Council have agreed on urgent remedial action.
Credit 224 - Road Maintenance; $12.6 million Credit of December 28,
1970; Closing Date:  Jume 30, 1975.  Project is proceeding satisfactorily.  All
designated posts in the MOW have been filled. Most of the equipment has been
installed and the Highway Training Center is operational.
Loan 745 - KamDuru Hydroelectric; $23.0 million Loan of June 7, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The Project is proceeding satisfactorily and,
although there are some works on the critical path which are behdnd schedule,
the lost time can be made up and the Project should be commissioned by February
1974 as scheduled. Revised estimates show an apparent cost saving of US$1.4
million in the offshore cost of the Project, but this is likely to be absorbed
by additional works and claims and it is estimated that full disbursement of
the Loan will be made.  Loan disbursements are behind schedule (68% of appraisal
estimate by September 30, 1972) due to delay in declaring the loan effective andl
late placing of contracts.
Credit 276 - Highways; $22.0 million Credit of June 5, 1972; Closing
Date:  March 31, 1975.  This project is jointly financed by a Swedish Credit of
$6.0 million.  Contracts have been awarded and progress is satisfactor-y.
Loan 826 -. Nairobi Airport; $29 million Loan of June 2, 1972; Closing
Date:  December 31  1976.  The main contract has been awarded arid work has start- .
The Aerodromes Department has been created and most key posts filled.
Credit 344 - Agricultural Credit; $6.0 million Credit of November 29,
1972; Closing Date:  June 30, 1976. This Credit was declared effective March 2,
1973.
