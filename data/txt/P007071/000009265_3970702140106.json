"The Public Sector Management Project\n            will help improve Ecuador's public sector management to\n            make better use of scarce financial and human resources.\n            The project includes several main areas of assistance which\n            involve:  (i) introducing improvements in the national\n            planning and budgeting systems; and (ii) supporting general\n            management improvements where the state performs important\n            economic activities.  The first area will be achieved by:\n            (a) strengthening the macroeconomic framework for planning\n            and budgeting, including better management of external debt;\n            (b) improving preparation of the national budget; and (c)\n            putting in place a pilot financial information system and\n            training accounting professionals to use it.  It will\n            further involve; (d) strengthening public investment\n            monitoring; and (e) studying means for a phased reduction of\n            revenue earmarking.  Subactivities within the second area\n            will include:  (a) helping design a new system for\n            monitoring performance of public enterprises; (b) providing\n            direct assistance to key public enterprises (oil, power, and\n            telephone companies) as well as to mining development\n            initiatives; and (c) streamlining procurement and other\n            administrative practices."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
