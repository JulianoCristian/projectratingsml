project would consist of\n            components selected from the 1985-88 investment program of\n            the General Directorate of Highways (KGM).  The loan would\n            provide financing for:  (a) highway civil works; (b)\n            procurement of equipment for investment and maintenance\n            works; and (c) consultancy services and training.  The\n            project is designed to assist KGM in the following areas:\n            (i) project planning, preparation and implementation; (ii)\n            development of a modern and more balanced equipment fleet\n            for its investment and maintenance works; (iii) pavements\n            research and management; and (iv) staff training and highway\n            safety.  The project would lead to savings in transport and\n            highway maintenance costs and would promote highway safety.\n            Savings would accrue especially on quick benefit yielding\n            routes, which also generate foreign exchange earnings\n            because of transit and export traffic.  There are no unusual\n            technical risks."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
