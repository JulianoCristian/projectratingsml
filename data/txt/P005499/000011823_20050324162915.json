Lessons learned\n            indicate that there were shortcomings in project design; the\n            labeling of expenditures in the text of the SAR was\n            different from the ones used in the COSTAB, this made it\n            difficult to relate physical and financial performance\n            indicators; monitoring and evaluation component was\n            insufficiently developed in the SAR; in the area of soil and\n            plant analysis, agro-meteorology, and pest management,\n            achievements were fragile and there is a risk of backsliding\n            unless staff are continuously trained, farmer are associated\n            and adequate funding is provided; the qualitative and broad\n            nature of the IAASP's objectives made it impossible to\n            judge them in quantitative terms.
