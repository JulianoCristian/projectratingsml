                         The project generates and supplies electricity in the GBAO region under a 25-year concession awarded to a private concessionaire, PamirEnergy Company (PEC). Before the
                         project, daily power supply in GBAO was about 3 hours per day, especially in winter. Under the project, PEC has reported that is has been able to provide power supply of about

                         22-24 hours per day even in the winter period to the main grid area, which covers 80 percent of the electricity consumption in GBAO region. Annual supply of electricity has improved
                         from 135,000 MWh/year in 2002 without the project to 174,000 MWh/year in 2009. The implementation of EMP is considered to be satisfactory and is being monitored by the Bank.
