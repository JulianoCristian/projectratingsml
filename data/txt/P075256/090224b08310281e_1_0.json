The Pamir\n            Mountains, stretching through Tajikistan and Afghanistan,\n            are amongst the highest in the world and known since\n            Victorian times as the Roof of the World. The period\n            following independence, and the country's five year\n            civil war, people, economy and the environment suffered.\n            Schools, clinics and small businesses often closed in winter\n            because it was too cold to stay open. This inevitably\n            undermined economic development and affected wages, health\n            and education in the region. That changed when a\n            public-private partnership between the Government of\n            Tajikistan, and the World Bank Group put in place a new\n            Pamir Energy company that operates a renovated power plant\n            providing reliable electricity on a renovated grid. While\n            consumers and businesses in the Tajik Pamir have an almost\n            uninterrupted power supply, Pamir energy produces enough to\n            export its excess to northern Afghanistan. For the first\n            time, several Afghan villages in the Pamirs have\n            electricity, allowing schools to stay open and hospitals to\n            use technology. Pamir Energy company currently provides the\n            best and most reliable power supply services in Tajikistan,\n            with steady reduction of losses and increased collection of\n            electricity payments. Its consumers say access to reliable\n            electricity has revolutionized their lives. Residents say\n            the remote area is a beam of light on the Roof of the World,\n            thanks to a renovated electricity grid. The renovated grid\n            opens new opportunities for people and businesses to develop\n            further in Tajikistan's Pamir region as well as in\n            neighboring Afghan villages."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T07:35:04Z"}
