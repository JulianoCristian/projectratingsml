Some lessons learned\n            included: given the difficult environment in which the Pamir\n            Energy project placed, the goals set for the project, and\n            the limited resources available, high quality management was\n            always a pre-requisite for success. The initial plan\n            included the extensive use of consultants to initially\n            manage the project implementation and advise local\n            management going forward. The existing General Director was\n            seen as a key player in the future of the company, and the\n            sponsors planned on retaining him, while supporting him and\n            the senior management team with training and close board\n            supervision. The challenges the Pamir energy project faced\n            are hard in themselves to describe. To turn around a\n            historically loss making utility, operated and accepted as a\n            social good, in the poorest region of the poorest country of\n            the former Soviet Union, in an isolated region of an\n            isolated country, raising tariffs, increasing collections,\n            and implementing construction projects at extremely high\n            altitudes, while trying to maintain budgets, build human\n            resources and deliver financial results. More attention\n            should have been paid to the management of the company and\n            to supporting development of local staff. Change in human\n            resources has been, and continues to be, a top challenge of\n            the company."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
