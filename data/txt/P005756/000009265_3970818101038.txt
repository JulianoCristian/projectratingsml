PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC (YAR)-INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
(CREDIT 465-YAR)
PREFACE
This report covers the performance of the Industrial Estate Project
in YAR supported by Credit 465-YAR. The Credit of $2.3 million was approved
in January, 1974, declared effective in November, 1974,and closed on December
31, 1982, two years behind the original closing date. About $243,000 remained
undisbursed from the credit and were cancelled.
This Project Completion Report (PCR) has been prepared by the staff
of Industrial Development and Finance (IDF) Division of the EMENA regional
office.  It is prepared on the basis of the information gathered during
previous supervision missions. No special mission for the PCR was mounted but
the issues involved and recommendations were discussed with the YAR
authorities during the post appraisal mission for the Second Industrial
Development Project in May 1984. Comments from the borrower have been taken
into account in finalizing the report and are reproduced as Annexes-12 and 13.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department. As several industrial estates/export processing zones supported
by the Bank approach completion, OED plans to assess the Bank's experience
with such operations; this project will be included in the study.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC (YAR)-INDULSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
(CREDIT 465-YAR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       In early 1973, the Government of YAR established the Industrial
Estate Development Authority (IEDA) to plan, construct and operate industrial
estates nationwide. IEDA was a key element in the Government's strategy to
accelerate industrial development in the country. On the Government's
request, IDA approved a credit of $2.3 million in early 1974 for an Industrial
Estate Project. The project consisted of (i) the establishment of an
industrial estate near Sanaa to be implemented by IEDA, (ii) a line of credit
to be implemented by the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development (YBRD),
the largest commercial Bank, to finance enterprises on the estate, and (iii)
technical assistance (TA) to strengthen IEDA and YBRD. The credit was to
finance about 69X of the project cost.
2.       The principal objective of the project was to develop the
institutional capabilities of IEDA ard YBRD to assist small and medium
industry through provision of infrastructural support and technical and
financial assistance. The Sanaa estate, as a pilot operation, was to provide
a model for future industrial estates in the country. TA was to introduce
modern project analysis and managerial concepts and to help improve industrial
productivity (para 3.01).
3.       Project implementation suffered from four major problems:  (i) a cost
escalation of about 80% over the appraisal estimate as a result of which the
project scope had to be substantially reduced, (ii) delay of about 18 months
in civil works construction primarily due to the poor performance of the civil
works contractor, (iii) underutilization of the line of credit due to a
combination of factors including delayed recruitment of TA by YBRD,
availability of finance from other sources on more favorable terms and poor
performance of YBRD and (iv) failure of TA to make IEDA into a viable
organization (para 4.04-4.13).
4.       In physical terms, all of the land and buildings have been occupied
and 22 enterprises have settled on the estate. However, the main objectives
of the project, namely to dzmonstrate the replicability of industrial estates
as a means of accelerating industrial development in YAR and to develop IEDA's
institutional capability to undertake this task, were not achieved. IEDA is
financially unviable due to inadequate rents and high administrative costs.
The Sanaa estate also suffers from other problems. Several large enterprises
occupy the estate, which is contrary to the project objectives. About half of
the enterprises in the estate are in financial difficulty or closed,
reflecting poor project appraisal by IEDA. TA to improve productivity of
enterprises is practically non existent. The project had no impact on YBRD's
investment-decision-making process. Finally, IEDA has not acquired the
capability to promote and implement other industrial estates in YAR (para
5.01-5.11).



-iv-
5.       IEDA had the primary responsibility for the implementation of the
industrial estate and its management must bear responsibility for the
project's shortcomings, particularly as regards the choice of civil
contractor, construction delays, utilization of technical assistance, choice
of enterprises on the estate and excessive staff levels. Nonetheless, the
Government and IDA also share a considerable responsibility.  The Government
established IEDA with sound objectives but it lacked full commitment to
develop it to the expected level of efficiency and profitability and to set
clear guidelines for monitoring its performance. IDA itself did not have a
large experience in the design and financing of industrial estates and this
was further compounded by the lack of full appreciation of local politicial
and business conditions. In hindsight, IDA supervision was weak and it was
not able to take firm decisions regarding the future of this project, even
when it became clear that the project was in serious difficulties and that its
benefits would be considerably lower than expected (para 8.02).
6.       Experience with the project suggests four major lessons.  One, given
YAR's very recent access to industrialization in the early 70's, there was a
considerable need within the World Bank group to understand better the Yemeni
entrepreneur, his outlook towards industrial investment, his technical and
financial needs and disposition towards the Government support. Two, the pace
of industrialization in YAR did not support the use of complex project
vehicles like the one under review here, of which the Bank group had
insufficient experience. Three, in a case of this type, institutional
improvement should have been the prime focus of IDA's assistance. This
required long-term TA beyond the project needs. IDA should have assisted the
Government more actively in finding appropriate TA personnel and in monitoring
their performance. Also, because of the dependence of Yemeni institutions on
TA, recruitment actions should have been initiated early in the project
cycle. Finally, in the YAR context of the 70's, short of seconding a full
time IDA advisor to IEDA, more IDA staff resources should have been allocated
for supervision to assist IEDA and the Governnment in institution building
matters as well as in maintaining a close policy dialogue (para 8.04).
7.       In YAR's current stage of industrialization, industrial estates
appear to be justified.   To achieve maximum efficiency in the process, the
role of IEDA, which has the mandate to establish industrial estates in the
country, and its operational policies must be carefully defined and its
viability must be ensured (para 7.02).
8.       While the Government is not yet ready to plan further industrial
estates programs, the financial and operational issues from the past call for
a decision. In a recent discussion (May 1983), the Minister for Economy and
Industry indicated strong commitment to take appropriate measures to resolve
IEDA's problems. In particular, the Minister is considering turning IEDA into
a land development agency that could develop industrial plots for sale or
rent. The Government has recently appointed an Interministerial Committee to
examine these two options. The Ministry of Economy and Industry (MEI) is
preparing a position paper for the Comittee which will examine the legal,
administrative and financial implications of these options (para 7.03).



9.       Both options imply liquidation of a part or whole of the Sanaa
estate. Specifically, under the 'Sale' option, all of the land and buildings
in the estate would be sold. Under the 'rent' option, only the buildings
would be scld but IEDA would continue to own and rent the land and
infrastructure in the estate to maintain it. This report includes the
financial implications of the two options.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC (YAR)-INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PROJECT
(CREDIT 465-YAR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of YAR established the Industrial Estate Development
Authority (IEDA) in 1973 to plan, construct and operate industrial estates in
the country. IEDA was a key element in the Government's strategy to
strengthen the institutional support structure for industrial development in
YAR.
1.02     IDA has been associated with IEDA's establishment since 1971.
Initially, IDA had an advisory role along with the UNDP and UNIDO. In
September 1972, the Government requested IDA's assistance in financing an
industrial estate in the capital city of Sanaa to be implemented by IEDA. On
IDA's recommendation, the Government commissioned UNIDO to conduct a
feasibility study, which was completed in February, 1973.
1.03     IDA agreed with the concept of the project proposed in the
feasibility study but recommended a phased development of the estate. IDA
appraised an Industrial Estates Project, the subject of this review, in March,
1973. IDA approved a credit of $2.3 million (Cr. 465-YAR) in January 1974 to
finance about 69% of the project cost of about $3.35 million. The credit was
signed in March, 1974 and declared effective in November, 1974. The credit
closed on December 31, 1982, two years behind the appraisal schedule. No
follow up operation is planned for the time being. About $243,000 remained
undisbursed from the credit as of the closing date and were cancelled. Annex
1 compares the principal recommendations of the feasibility study and the
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). Annex 2 gives the schedule of disbursements
expected at appraisal and actually achieved.
II. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR: OBJECTIVES, DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
AND PERFORMANCE IN THE 1970s AND IN THE EARLY 1980s 1/
Industrial Sector in the early 1970s
2.01     YAR's industrial sector was embryonic in the early seventies.  The
country had only about 200 manufacturing enterprises with an average
employment of 12 persons, excluding a large textile factory. Many
entrepreneurs were traders who considered industry as a side activity for
quick profits. They had little experience to properly identify, prepare and
1/   A more detailed description can be found in the Staff Appraisal Report
(284-a YAR) of 1974, the Manufacturing Industry Report (3651 YAR) of 1982
and the Government's Second Five Years Plan document.



operate projects. The policy, legal and institutional framework to promote
industry was practically non-existent. In 1970, the Government passed a law
that provided protection to the local industry through quantitative import
restrictions and tax exemptions. However, recognizing their long-term
disadvantages, the Government kept such measures, particularly the import
restrictions, small and highly selective. Institutionally, the Ministry of
Economy (MEI) had the responsibility for development and regulation of the
sector. However, its administrative capacity to carry out these tasks was
very weak.  The Government had appointed a UNIDO team which was to provide a
broad ranging advice to MEI in these areas as well as to entrepreneurs on
project preparation and operation. Suppliers' credit provided much of the
term financing for industry. Some bilateral credits were channelled through
the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development (YBRD), which also provided
working capital funds. Much of YBRD's term lending portfolio (less than 10
projects) was transferred to it by the Government and YBRD itself had very
little experience to properly appraise and monitor industrial projects.
Development Strategy and Performance
2.02     The Government articulated its strategy for promoting industry in the
First Five Years Plan (1976-80) and continued it during the Second Plan
(1981-85).  The major elements of the strategy can be summarized as follows:
a. to focus mainly on import substitution projects; and
b. to develop institutional support structure which would assist the
development of small and medium size investments in the private
sector, particularly by tapping investible funds available with
merchants.
2.03     The performance of the manufacturing industry has been encouraging,
particularly in the second half of the 1970s. The sector output grew at an
annual rate of 11.7%, investment at 34% and employment at 10X. The growth
subsectors during this period were construction materials and food processing,
both reflecting increase in the living-standards. The growth of industry was
primarily fueled by worker remittances, which accounted for about 881 of the
fixed capital invested between 1975-80. Although the worker remittances have
been declining since the early 1980s, the investment in the sector is still
estimated to currently increase at 5X per annum.
2.04     Despite the quick growth, the sector suffered from several problems,
which are important to understand the context in which the Industrial Estate
Project was implemented. High inflation together with a fixed exchange rate
and liberal import policy made some industries uncompetitive with respect to
imports. Due to labor emigration to Gulf countries, labor costs increased by
40% per annum, reaching $5,300 per annum in 1981-82 for an unskilled worker.
The resulting shift towards capital intensive industries required skilled
manpower, which was even scarcer and had to be imported at a high cost. Water
and power shortages worsened and enterprises began to rely on their own, and
often high cost and uneconomic, facilities. The UNIDO team (para 2.01) could
not perform its tasks effectively due to several reasons including over
ambitious terms of reference, inadequate number and quality of the technical
assistance personnel, frequent changes in work priorities by MEI and poor
counterpart support. Under this situation and the absence of a well developed
financial intermediary, many projects were poorly prepared, implemented and
managed.



-3-
Bank Group's Involvement in the Manufacturing Sector
2.05     No project was financed by IDA between 1974 and 1980 in the
industrial sector in YAR. The Government gave priority to use IDA funds for
other sectors, particularly agriculture and transport, and bilateral and
commercial financing was readily available for industry. At the same time,
IEDA and YBRD, which were to administer the Industrial Estate Project, did not
develop institutionally as expected (paras 4.09 and 4.13). Discussions with
the Industrial Bank of Yemen (IBY), a term lending intermediary set up in
1976, began in 1978 but proceeded slowly because of lack of agreement on IBY's
interest rate policy. In 1980, IDA approved a credit line of SDRs 9.7 million
for IBY to finance snall and medium industry. The main objective of this
credit was to develop IBY's term lending capability and, for this purpose, IDA
seconded a staff member as the senior development banking advisor in IBY for
two years. The credit has been almost fully utilized and a follow up
operation is planned in FY85. Since the approval of the first IBY credit
line, IDA has also prepared a Manufacturing Industry Report in 1981, assisted
in the preparation of the Second Five Years Plan and, through the World
Bank-UNIDO cooperative program, prepared several feasibility studies to
exploit local raw materials. IFC has nade two investments in YAR, a dairy
project in 1978 ($2.4 million) and a dry cell battery project in 1983 ($4
million).
Ill. PROJECT OBJECTIVES,-DESCRIPTION AND APPRAISATL PROCESS
Project Objectives
3.01     The principal objective of the project was to develop the
institutional capabilities of IEDA and YBRD to assist industry through
provision of infrastructure and technical and financial assistance. This was
consistent with the Government's strategy described in para 2.02. A number of
other objectives were also quoted in IDA's Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). As a
pilot operation, the project was to provide a replicable model for future
industrial development in the country. The project was to create local
employment opportunities by creating 400-500 jobs in 22 small, labor intensive
enterprises located in the estate. The Sanaa estate was to promote import
substitution industries and thus help balance of payments. Technical
Assistance (TA) included in the project was to introduce modern project
analysis and management concepts and help improve productivity in enterprises
established in the state.
Project Description
3.02     The project, as defined in the SAR, coniprised three components:
i) Development of the first phase of an industrial estate near Sanaa
to be implemented by IEDA
ii) A line of credit to YBRD to finance enterprises established on the
industrial estate (estate enterprises) and
iii) TA to strengthen IEDA and YBRD.

Industrial Estate
3.03     The first phase of the industrial estate, to be implemented between
1974-79, consisted of the development of 32,500m2 of land, including roads
and utilities, construction of 8,400 ma of standard factory buildings (seven
buildings of 1,200 ma each) and of 400 m2 of an administrative center and
establishment of a maintenance workshop. The standard factory buildings were
to be constructed in three stages: initially only three buildings would be
constructed followed by two each in 1976 and 78 respectively. One of the
buildings would house a workshop to service IEDA and estate enterprises. The
project also included financing for consultants for engineering and
construction supervision of civil works.
Line of Credit
3.04     A line of credit of $1.2 million was to be established in YBRD to
finance estate enterprises. Of this, IDA provided $600,000 to finance
imported equipment and YBRD was to provide the remaining $600,000 equivalent
to finance local purchases.
Technical Assistance (TAI
3.05     The TA of 147 man-months (MM) comprised the following:  Management
Advisor to IEDA - 45 MM, Advisor to IEDA's industrial engineer - 60 MM, a
banking expert in YBRD - 24 MM and short term experts - 18 MM. The Management
Advisor was to advise IEDA on all aspects during construction of the estate
and its operations. The industrial engineering advisor was to strengthen
IEDA's ability to advise estate enterprises on construction and operational
matters. The banking expert was to strengthen YBRD's term lending
capability. Finally, IEDA was to recruit short term experts to advise on
specialized branches of industry. The cost of TA was estimated to be $490,000
to be financed by IDA and to be provided by the Government as grant to IEDA.
Appraisal Process
3.06     The appraisal mission had carefully estimated th2 demand for
developed land and buildings. As discussed in para 5.01, the demand was not a
problem under this project. However, three issues were raised within the Bank
during the subsequent processing of the project: (i) relending rate to IEDA,
(ii) relending ratt on the line of credit and (iii) appraisal of YBRD as a
financial intermediary.
3.07     Relending Rate to IEDA.  The appraisal mission had recommended an
onlending rate of 4X on IDA funds from the Government to IEDA. IDA considered
this rate too low because it would result in an unjustified subsidy to IEDA
and estate enterprises. Finally, the Government and IDA agreed that about
37.5Z of IDA funds would be passed on by the Government to IEDA as equity and
the remaining onlent at 92 per annum.
3.08     Relending Rate of the Line of Credit.  The mission had also
recommended an onle.ading rate of 42 per annum from the Government to YBRD and
82 per annum from YBRD to final borrowers. Finally, it was agreed that these
rates would not be less than 77 and 10  respectively.  The rovernment
subsequently reduced the interest rates structure in YAR, which made the
agreed minimum rates uncompetitive vis a vis the prevailing market rates.
Partly as a result, the line of credit remained underutilized (para 4.09).



3.09     Appraisal of YBRD.  The appraisal mission had paid little attention
to the suitability of YBRD as a financial intermediary. During the subsequent
missions, the appraisal team reviewed YBRD's term-lending capability and
included a full time banking expert under the project for YBRD.
3.10     The appraisal process suffered from two unforeseen problems:  First,
the UNIDO financed civil engineer, who was a member of the appraisal team,
could not perform his tasks, which included investigating the availability of
utilities, reviewing preliminary designs and preparing cost estimates. IDA
subsequently undertook these tasks. Second, UNDP which was to finance the TA,
declined to do so because of insufficient availability of funds in their
country program. IDA decided to finance all of the TA for the project.
3.11     Little analysis was made by the appraisal mission of the appropriate
design standards to be used for factory buildings and of the local contracting
industry. As discussed later, the project cost escalation and delays
encountered during implementation were at least in part due to inadequate
appraisal of local requirements and capabilities in these areas (paras 4.02,
4.06 and 4.08).
3.12     Agreement reached during negotiations are given in Annex 3.
IV.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Eig_neering and Construction Supervision
4.01     In accordance with IDA's procedures, IEDA selected Husband and Co., a
consulting engineer from U.K., to carry out the estate engineering and
construction supervision. The selection was made from a list of one local and
three foreign firms who had submitted proposals. Although the final
appointment was delayed by about five months behind the appraisal schedule of
June, 1974, the consulting engineers issued bidding documents in July, 1975
with only one month's delay.
4.02     The consulting engineer's performance was satisfactory.  However,
IEDA rightly felt, a posteriori, that they had overdesigned the factory
buildings for the type of industries currently located on the estate and for
the type of small enterprises envisaged at the time of appraisal.
Civil Works Construction Contract
4.03     IEDA selected M/S Amnan and Thabet, a local contractor, for the
construction of civil works. The selection was made according to IDA's ICB
procedures. Eleven contractors from five countries collected tender
documents. Four contractors, including one foreign, submitted bids. Three
contractors, all local, were qualified and Amnan Thabet was the lowest
evaluated bidder. As indicated in para 4.08, the contractor's performance was
disappointing.
Implementation Pro&ress
4.04     The project implementation suffered from four major prob.lems:  (i)
substantial escalation in the project costs, (ii) delays in construction,
(iii) under-utilization of the line of credit and (iv) failure of TA to build
IEDA into a technically, financially and managerially viable institution and
to develop YBRD into a sound financial intermediary.

4.05     Escalation in the Proiect Costs.  The following table compares the
project costs estimated at appraisal, actual costs after the project bad been
scaled down and costs if the project had been implemented as planned (para
4.07 and Annex 4).
Table: Comparison of Project Costs
(all figures in $1000)

Total        3,350          3,152                6,010
4.06     The major increase in the project costs occurred in the components
related to the civil works. The lowest evaluated bid for the civil works
(land development and building) was $2.71 million or about 138% higher than
the appraisal estimate of $1.14 million.  The dramatic increase in the civil
works costs can be partially explained by the unforeseen steep rise in the
labor costs by about 40% per annum in the mid-seventies. IDA also had very
little experience in the building and financing of industrial estates: the
price contingencies of 10% on local costs and 8% on foreign costs were
inadequate when compared with the actual inflation rates of 19% and 10%
respectively. Other cost increases were engineering fees (by 120%) because of
the longer period of construction supervision and land (by 200%).
4.07     Several options were considered after the opening of the civil works
bids, including to increase the Government's contribution to finance the cost
overrun, to cancel the project and to retender civil works. None of these
were acceptable to the Government and IDA.  Finally, given the active interest
of entrepreneurs in the estate, it was decided that the project should
proceed, but with a substantially reduced scope. The administrative center
and the workshop were deleted. Only three out of the planned seven standard
factory buildings were to be constructed. The infrastructure was to be
constructed as planned. With the above changes, the project cost was
estimated at $3.1 million and no additional financing from the Government or
IDA was necessary.
4.08     Construction Delays.  The redesigning of the project scope meant a
delay of about three months in the award of the civil contract from the SAR
schedule of October, 1975. Thereafter, the contractor's performance was also
disappointing, which led to a further delay of 15 months. Initially, the
works proceeded slowly because of the extreme shortage and high cost of
construction labor in YAR. The contractor also lacked engineering and
management expertise, which he subsequently corrected by appointing a partner
for steelworks erection and by recruiting experienced foreign staff on the
site. Finally, two out of the three standard factory buildings were ready in
June, 1977 but entrepreneurs could not move in because of the delay in the
construction of water wells. The contractor went bankrupt in late 1977.



-7-
Shortly thereafter, the Municipal water became available to the estate, thus
eliminating the need for construction of wells. The first enterprise moved
into the estate in December 1977, 15 months behind the appraisal schedule.
The physical construction was almost completed by the end of 1979, 18 months
behind the appraisal schedule.
4.09     Under-utilization of the Line of Credit.  The utilization of the line
of credit was delayed by about four years until December, 1979 and 732 of the
$600,000 orginally allocated to the line remained unused. Three factors were
responsible for this delay: (i) delay in the construction of the estate which
meant a corresponding delay in the implementation of estate projects, (ii)
entrepreneurs' preference to use alternative sources of financing because
local currency loans carried lower interest rates and, the local currency
being fully convertible, they carried no foreign exchange risk, and (iii)
almost no promotion of the line by YBRD which was inexperienced in term
lending, and a delay of about four years in the recruitment of the banking
expert.
4.10     The appraisal mission could not have anticipated all of these
difficulties. In retrospect, however, IDA could have cancelled the line of
credit without significant problems, when it appeared as it did in 1976 (para
4.13) that little could be achieved institutionally and, in 1978, when the
decision was made to provide a separate line of credit to IBY.
4.11     In September, 1978, the Government and IDA agreed to transfer the
line of credit from YBRD to IBY and at the same time to reduce the amount
allocated from $600,000 to $450.000 !". Its utilization was further delayed
until the end of 1979 because the Government and IDA could not agree on the
onlending rates. Finaily it was agreed that the Government would lend IDA
funds to IBY at 4X and to final borrowers at 72 per annum. IDA agreed to
these low rates because the amount involved was too small to have an impact on
the Government's interest rate policies. Also, a new credit to IBY was
planned, which would provide a more effective platform for interest rates
discussions.
4.12     Two subprojects with a total credit amount of $220,000 were financed
under the line of credit. The balance of $230,000 remained unused.
4.13     TA and Institution Buildin.  IEDA used almost all (120 out of 123
man months) of TA provided in the project. Yet, the TA did not succeed in
building IEDA into a technically, financially and managerially viable
institution. This has been the most important failure of the project. This
can be attributed to several reasons: (i) despite -easonably attractive
terms, IEDA could not attract nor retain good qualicy expatriate personnel
because of the poor working environment in IEDA, (ii) IEDA also required long
lead time for recruitment, which resulted in lack of continuity, and (iii)
IEDA could not recruit and retain Yemeni counterparts because of the extreme
shortage of qualified local personnel and better terms uf employment offered

works and engineering services.



-8-
by the private sector and other Government agencies. In addition, there was a
lack of firm commitment of the Government to build up IEDA to the expected
level of efficiency and profitability (paras 5.04 through 5.11). Finally,
lack of clear experience in the field of industrial estate development also
explains in part IDA's slow response in correcting TA deficiercies and, more
generally, IEDA's institutional problems.
V. PROJECT OPERATIONS
5.01     All of the developed land and buildings were leased about 15 months
before the completion of-the estate, which indicates the abundance of demand
for rented land and buildings. Some of the original leasees did not proceed
with their projects and were replaced by others. Nonetheless, the estate
operations suffered three major problems: (i) choice of the estate
enterprises, (ii) lack of TA from IEDA to these enterprises, and (iii) poor
financial situation of IEDA because of inadequate rents and very high
administrative costs, and consequent loss of IEDA's autonomy.
Choice of Estate Enterprises
5.02     IEDA made a poor selection of enterprises settling on the estate.
Several estate enterprises are large scale by Yemeni standards, which is
contrary to the project objectives. IEDA also does not appear to have
properly assessed the viability of estate enterprises. Out of the 22
enterprises that have settled on the estate 11, as of today, 11 are in
financial difficulty or closed for reasons ranging from poor product design to
insufficient product demand, poor management and weak financial discipline.
Five are operating at more than 50Z of their capacity, the remaining six are
under construction. IDA had recognized some of these problems but could do
little to influence the choice of enterprises before their final selection by
IEDA because of the weak review procedures built into the project. In
retrospect, the supervision missions also did not adequately focus on this
issue, partlv because they were preoccupied in getting the estate completed
and in resolving other important financial and institutional issues.
Technical Assistance to Enterprises
5.03     IEDA was to provide technical assistance to estate enterprises during
their operations. The project provided an industrial engineer advisor for
this purpose. For reasons discussed in para 4.13, such assistance has been
small and largely ineffective.
IEDA's Financial Situation and Implications for Its Autonomy
5.04     IEDA's financial situation is very poor because of high
administrative costs and low rents.
1/ in all three phases.



5.05     Administrative Costs:  The following table compares the
administrative costs estimated at appraisal and the actual results:

1/  Includes technical assistance cost, which was reimbursed by the Government.
2/ The very high figures in these years are probably due to refund as per the
Government's instructions of excess rents charged-
5.06     The high administrative costs are in turn due to *ie size of staff,
which is far in excess of IEDA's needs, and high salaries.  As regards the
staff, MDA employed 20 persons in 1982, including 12 professionals, as
against the appraisal estimate of 12, including I professional 1/. The bulk
of the increase in staff was due to IEDA's expectations that the Sanaa estate
would be expanded fo'llowing the completion of the project and that new estates
would be set up at Taez and Hodeida. IEDA also sought to play a more direct
role in the supervision of the implementation of these investments, which
would require additional manpewer.
5.07     The Government was at least partly responsible for building up IEDA's
expectations. It supported the expansion plans in principle but did not
provide adequate funds to implement them. Nonetheless, the main
responsibility for the overmanning problem lies with IEDA itself because it
recruited the additional staff without clear approval of its plans from the
Government or a firm indication on the availability of funds from external
agencies such as IDA.
5.08     Another problem underlying the high administrative costs, which could
not be anticipated at appraisal and over which IEDA has little control, is the
high cost of salaries. The average salary of an engineer in YAR today is
about $1,300 per month as against the appraisal forecast of $450 per month in
1983.
5.09     Inadequate Rents:  The SAR assumed initial annual rents of $1.5 and
$15.0 per mz for plots and buildings respectively, to be increased by 25%
every three years. IDA foresaw the need to increase IEDA's rents when the
civil works bids were found to be substantially higher than the appraisal
estimates and when it was decided that only three factory buildings would be
constructed. In 1976, IEDA, in agreement with IDA, decided to charge initial
rents of $2.2 and $26.6 per m2 for plots and buildings, an increase of 46%
and 77% respectively from the SAR levels. Also, these rents were to be
increased by 50% every three years. The initial rents were below the market
levels, but overall, the new rents would enable IEDA to obtain the minimum
return of 8% agreed in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA).
1/ During late 1983 and early 1984, many staff have left IEDA. The current
staffing is eight professionals.



- 10 -
5.10     In 1979-80, IEDA increased its rents by 50X as proposed in 1976.
However, following the strong lobbying by the tenants and the subsequent
Government intervention, the rents were reduced to their original levels and
IEDA had to refund the excess rents received. IDA repeatedly raised the issue
of rents with the Government but, given its political sensitivity and that the
credit for the estate had been almost fully disbursed, little was achieved.
In retrospect, in 1976, IDA could have anticipated the potential difficulties
in getting entrepreneurs to pay 502 higher rents every three years. It was
also known that without the 50% rent increase IEDA would not be financially
viable. Therefore, IDA should have insisted on more up front actions such as
higher initial rents and smaller increases every year. If the Government did
not wish to charge higher initial rents, IDA should have considered the
alte-itive of not proceeding further with the project.
5.11     The present situation (1984) is that IEDA's rents do not cover even
the administrative costs, let alone earn the minimum return of 8% agreed under
the DCA. The Government has been increasingly subsidizing IEDA's operations
and, in this process, IEDA has progressively lost its autonomy.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
IEDA's Financial Performance
6.01     IEDA's unsatisfactory financial performance is reflected in the
Income Statements and Balance Sheets given in Annex 6 and 7, respectively. By
the end of 1982, the cumulative deficits reached $581,000 and in 1982 alone,
they were $325,000 on a total revenue of $267,000. The Government has kept
IEDA solvent by subsidies amounting to $200,000 per year, and by equity
infusions amounting to $5.3 million by the end of 1982. Yet, the liquidity
situation has deteriorated. The current ratio declined from 0-.78 in 1980 to
0.13 in 1982. IEDA currently operates on cash balances sufficient to cover
only about 17 days of expenses. Up to 50% of the employees' salaries are
reported to have been held back. IEDA's debt-equity ratio increased from 0.51
in 1981 to 0.62 in 1982. Given the high level of deficits, IEDA cannot raise
further its borrowing levels. Rent arrears have also increased with the
breakdown of financial discipline in IEDA and the estates enterprises.
Although precise data is not available, this is ind:cated by the accounts
receivables (majority of which are accounted for by the rent arrears) which
have increased from 17% of the rent income in 1980 to 47% in 1982.
VII. PROSPECTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     IEDA is clearly not viable under the present rental policy and high
administrative costs and managerial and administrative set up.  The authority
is currently estimated to make cash losses of about $180,000. per annum. Even
if rents are increased to a level ensuring financial viability, IEDA cannot
continue to operate as it is. The Government, therefore, must urgently focus
on how IEDA should be organized in future, if its existence is to be
maintained.
7.02     In YAR's current stage of industrialization, industrial estates
appear to be justified. The relatively small industries need infrastructure
support to function properly. Industrial estates offer a possibility of



- 11 -
providing such support economically. Prceperly located, these estates would
allow planned growth of industries in urban areas. To achieve maximum
efficiency in the process, the role of IEDA which has the mandate to establish
industrial estates in the country, and its operational policies must be
carefully redefined and its viability must be ensured.
7.03     While the Government is not yet ready to plan further development oE
the industrial estate program, the financial and operational issues resulting
from the past call for a decision. In a recent discussion (May, 1984), the
Minister for MEI indicated a strong commitment to take appropriate measures to
resolve this problem. In particular, the Minister is considering turning IEDA
into a land development agency that could develop industrial plots for sale or
rent. The Government has recently appointed an Interministerial Committee to
examine these two options. The MEI is preparing a position paper for the
Committee which will examine the legal, administrative and financial
implications of these options.
7.04     The detailed operational policies and programs under both options,
i.e. developing plots for sale or rent, imply liquidation of a part or whole
of the Sanaa estate. Specifically, under the 'sale' option, all of the land,
infrastructure and buildings would be sold. Under the 'rent' option, IEDA
would sell all buildings but it would continue to own and rent the land and
infrastructure in the estate and maintain it.
7.0-     The financial implications from the 'sale' of the Sanaa estate are
anaiysed in Annex 8. IEDA, after the liquidation of the Sanaa estate's assets
iaz  liabilities, would be leEt with a net cash surplus of about $2.3 million
equivalent. The implications of the second option, i.e. if the buildings in
the estate are to be sold and only the land is to be rented, are analysed in
Annexes 9 through 12. In :his case, to earn a return of 8% on the existing
assets (without buildings), IEDA would need to increase the land rent by 100%
in 1984 from the current level of YR1 30 per mz per year, by 50% in 1985 and
to maintain it at that level in real terms thereafter.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS FOR IDA
8.01     This project was an ambitious experiment which was motivated by the
Government's desire to accelerate industrial development in the private sector
through development of institutional support structure. In physical terms, an
industrial estate was completed, although with a substantially reduced scope
and with a delay of about 1 1/2 years. Some 22 enterprises have settled on
the estate, of which five are operating satisfactorily. But the main
objectives of the project, namely to demonstrate the replicability of the
Sanaa industrial estate as a model for industrial development in YAR and to
develop IEDA's institutional capability to undertake this task, was not
achieved. Also, the project had no influence on YBRD's
investment-decision-making process.
8.02     IEDA had the primary responsibility for the implementation of the
industrial estate and its management must bear responsibility for the
project's shortcomings, particularly as regards the selection of contractors,



- 12 -
construction delays, utilization of technical assistance, choice of
enterprises and excessive staff levels. The Government and IDA also share a
considerable degree of responsibility. The Government established IEDA with
sound objectives but it lacked full commitment to develop it to the expected
level of efficiency and profitability and to set clear guidelines for
monitoring its performance. IDA itself did not have a large experience in the
design and financing of industrial estates, which was further compounded by
the lack of full appreciation of local conditions. A number of examples to
support this have been given in this report. However, in hindsight, IDA
supervision was weak and it was not able to take firm decisions regarding the
future of this project, even when it became clear that the project was in
serious difficulties and that the potential benefits would be considerably
less than expected.
8.03     In a larger sense, the difficulties encountered under this project
led to an awareness of the dimension of the investment problems and of the
need to accelerate the development of a specialized term-lending institution,
IBY. As a result, the Government initially transferred the credit line under
this project to IBY and, subsequently negotiated a separate IDA line of credit
for it. It is too early to assess the institutional impact of the separate
credit line on IBY and, more generally, on the industrial sector in YAR. But
preliminary indications are positive.
8.04     Experience with the project suggests four major lessons.  One, given
YAR's very recent access to industrialization in the early 70's, there was a
considerable need within the World Bank group to understand better the Yemeni
entrepreneur, his outlook towards industrial investment, his technical and
financial needs and disposition towards the Government support. Two, the pace
of industrialization in YAR did not support the use of complex project
vehicles like the one under review here, of which the Bank group had
insufficient experience. Three, in a case of this type, institutional
improvement should have been the prime focus of the Bank's assistance. This
required long-term TA beyond the project needs. IDA should have assisted the
Government more actively in finding appropriate TA personnel and in monitoring
their performance. Also, because of the dependence of Yemeni institutions on
TA, recruitment actions should have been initiated early in the project
cycle. Finally, in the YAR context of the 70's, short of seconding a full
time IDA advisor to IEDA, more IDA staff resources should have been allocated
for supervision to assist IEDA and the Government in institution building
matters as well as in maintaining a close policy dialogue.

Prospects for IEDA
Option 2:      Building in Sanaa estate to be sold, land to be rented.
Assumptions
a.    Buildings are sold during 1984, 85 and 86 at their book value
b.    IEDA will have a director general, one financial manager and
maintenance engineer each and 3 support staff beginning 1985.
c.    IEDA's investment in building         =  YR 7,155,000
d.    The Government would allow IEDA to set rents so as to earn at
least 8Z return on fixed assets
A. Calculation of the Book Value of Buildings
1. Assuming that the buildings were occupied in 1979 and depreciated
at 2Z per year on a straight line basis, the net value of building at
the end of 1982 = YR 6,440,000
2.  Value of buildings disposed off in 1984 = 1/3 x 6,440,000
=       72,150,000
3.  Value of buildings disposed off in 1985 =        2,102,000
4.  Value of buildings disposed off in 1986          2,060,000
B. Calculation of Administrative Expenses
i)  Administrative expenses for 1984 (assumed) = YR 1,980,000
ii) From 1985 onwards in 1985 prices.
Salary director general       YR 108,000
Engineer and finance Mgr.    YR 108,000
Three support staff           YR  83,000          300,000
Maintenance 5% of fixed investment
excluding land (5% of 4,769,000)                  240,000

1/  escalating at 10% per annum from 1985 onwards
in accordance with inflation.
2/  Land value is assumed to increase at 5% p.a.  On this basis, the residual
value of land would be about YRI 113 million in circa 2000.
Conclusion
1.     Land Rents will have to be increased by 100% in 1984 and 50% in 1985
over the prevailing 1983 levels to achieve the minimum rate of return of 8% on
investment.
2.     With the proposed increases, the land rent in 1985 will be about YR
33.37 per m2. Assuming the value of developed land to be about YR 500 per
m2, the rent will be about 6.6% of cost of developed land.

Comments to the Project Completion Report of The Regional -
Projects Department, IDF Division, Europe, Middle East and
North Africa Region regarding;
Yemen Arab Republic (YAR)
Industrial Estate Project
Credit 465- I&R
By letter dated 8.8.1984, the Industrial Estate Developpment -
Authority (IEnA) has been asked by The World Bank to comment
on Yemen Arab Republic : Industrial Estate Project ,
Credit 465 YAR, attached to this letter.
The principal objective of this project was to develop the
instituitional capabilities of IEDA and YBMD, to assist small
and medium industry through provision of infra-structural
support and technical and financial assistance.
The project implementation suffered from four major problems:
Discussed  - a cost escalation of about 80% over the appraisal estimate
in para -.
r 4.04-4.13  as a result of which the project scope had tob considerably
of the    reduced.
text.
- delay of about 18 month in civil work constructions primarily
due to the poor performance of the civil works contractor.
- underutilisation of the line of credit due to a combination
of factors including delayed recruitment of TA by the YBRD,
availability of finance from other sources on more
favourable terms and poor performance of YBRD.
- failure of TA to make IEDA into a viable organisation
The Project has during the whole period of implementation,
or operation, not matured to an extend to call it a success.

Although the different Temeni institutions involved in the
Noted in industrial promotion programme could not come up satisfactorily
paras. with their contribution, as mentioned in the report, the main
8f02the04 cause of failure of the project seems to us  the lack of detailed
text.   concept and an appropriate planning of its execution as well as
unsufficient consideration of the situation in YAR.
- The Government's committment towards the project was never
drawnup and confirmed.
- The co-ordination of the project between the authorities
involved never existed. (MII, IEDA & IBY)
This made it impossiblefor the World Bank from the start to
involve herself intensively in the project control by
convincing the Government of YAR every now and then, of the
importance of the project and by continuously, with all
consequences, insisting on the fulfillment of the obligations
and committments of the Government of YAR towards the project
as desired.
A more consequent interference from the World Bqnk's side
in the direct execution of the project with strict monitoring
and the consideration ofvthe recommendations of the  supervision
missions (15 within 8 years) and an intensive practical
assistance to the Government of YAR and the respective involved
institutions would defenitely have shown better results.
The involved institutions instead were left alone in their
struggle with their Government.

Instead of now pointing out individual failures and
scape-goating, it seems to us more relevant and important
to mention that , inspite of short-comings of the above
"Industrial Estate Project", promotion of small and medium
scale industries in YAR is still of highest importance
for the economy of the country and therefore still deserves
the serious condideration, attention and assistance by the
Government of YAR and any multilateral or bilateral
assistance engaged in this field.
