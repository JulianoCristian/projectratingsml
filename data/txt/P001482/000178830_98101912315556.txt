ANDEKALEKA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Local Energy Resources
1.01      The main known energy resources of Madagascar are hydroelectric
potential, coal, lignite, oil-ghale, all virtually untapped. The forests,
covering about 16% (100,000 km ) of the country, are on the other hand widely
exploited as a source of firewood. Geothermal energy may be available in
volcanic regions, but practically no prospecting has been carried out so far.
1.02      In 1970, Verbund Plan (Austrian Consultant), under UNDP auspices,
made an inventory of energy resources in Madagascar. Natural asphalt depo-
sits of more than a billion tons are believed to exist at Morafenobe (Majunga
province), and more than 500 million tons of coal of about 6,500 kcal/kg at
Betioky (Tulear province). It was estimated that deposits of about 26 million
tons of oil shale, with a calorific value of 2,500 kcal/kg, and 32 million
tons of lignite graded at up to 2,200 kcal/kg are located in the center of the
island, around Antanifotsy and Sambaina, 40 km north of Antsirabe. Smaller
reserves were found in Diego-Suarez province. However, evaluations so far
have concluded that their exploitation would be uneconomical.
1.03      Madagascar has substantial hydroelectric power potential, particu-
larly in its eastern region. Preliminary investigations have identified 75
possible schemes with a combined capacity of 3,500 MW. So far, the devel-
opment of only a few sites has been economically justified, but in view of
increased mineral fuel prices this resource is bound to be utilized increas-
ingly.
Imports and their Transformation
1.04      Madagascar's fuel imports are 90% crude petroleum; the balance
consists of by-products whose processing is not justified in situ because
of market limitations. The refinery, which was nationalized in July 1976,
can process 750,000 tons of crude oil yearly but is working at half capa-
city since it lost La Reunion market. As a result, fuel import volumes
have slowly decreased since the 1972 peak of 707,000 to 600,000 tons in
1975, and drastically, to 260,000 tons for the period July 1976 to June
1977. Consequently, the processing costs have increased and Government
decided to subsidize some processed products. Annual fuel imports now cost
FMG 12.7 billion (US$54 million) and account for about 10% in total imports
with no recovery through re-export at present.
Uses of Energy
1.05      Domestic usage accounts for about 80% of energy consumption as
industries are at an early development stage; the main source of energy
is firewood (about 85%). In the rural areas, where 85% of the population
of about 9 million lives, firewood is virtually the only energy source.



2-
Dried manure is also used, but other sources, even charcoal, are too expen-
sive. It is estimated that an average family of 5.5 persons consume 170 kg
of firewood per month.
1.06      Surveys 1/ and information collected by the appraisal mission indi-
cate that even where electricity and mineral fuels are available, about 40%
of the households use firewood only, in about the same quantities as rural
households; 28% of the families use charcoal only, about one and a half
bags per month (or 45 kg). About 5% use a combination of charcoal and kero-
sene, 3% use kerosene alone, and 16% use a combination of sources including
electricity. In addition, households without electricity or kerosene lamps
use about 15 candles per month.
1.07      Based on the above estimates, it appears that the rural house-
holds consume about 3 million tons of firewood, and the urban ones about 0.3
million tons directly or 0.6 million tons when including about 40,000 tons
of charcoal, 2/ that is, a total of 3.6 million tons of firewood per year. 3/
Also, about 5,000 tons of kerosene are consumed annually. Light and other
domestic electricity usage amounts to about 60 GWh per year, more than half
of it in the Antananarivo province alone where in 1976, about 58,300 house-
holds (about 23%) had a connection; on average each used about 610 kWh.
In the rest of the country, about 31,000 households (about 2%) had electric-
ity, with an average annual consumption of 650 kWh.
1.08      Industrial consumption accounts for about 112 GWh annually (or
about 75% of electricity use) in the Antananarivo province and 120 GWh (or 85%
of electricity use) in the rest of the country. The industrial and transporta-
tion sectors also consume about 85,000 tons of mineral fuel products each year
(excluding about 20,000 tons used for thermal electricity generation).
1/   Surveys have only been conducted at Antananarivo:  one in 1968 to de-
termine a basis for the consumer price index, and one in 1976, covering
10% of the population, to determine specifically the types of energy
consumed.
2/   One ton of firewood produces about 0.14 ton charcoal.
3/   Considering that the 3.6 million tons of firewood represent 5 million
m of wood, and that such volume is being consumed every year, the
natural forests are being depleted and erosion danger increased. This
is true especially in high density areas, mainly on the plateau. Re-
forestation and fire-fighting seem urgently needed, as the shift towards
other energy sources seems uneconomic and unlikely in the near future
for the majority of the population.



1.09      In summary, the total 1976 energy consumption has been as shown
below, electricity contributing less than 2% of the caloric equivalent:

Comparative Energy Pricing
1.10      After analyzing costs and prices, as explained below, it seems that
the price ranking reflects the economic cost ranking, and encourages a good
allocation of energy alternatives. The Price Commission of the Ministry of
Economy and Commerce regulates official prices for all essential commodities
including fuel and electricity. Prices vary geographically as they reflect
transport costs, and include some cross-subsidization from lesser essential to
more essential goods, e.g., gasoline is sold above cost while fuel and gas oil
(for industrial and heavy transport use) are priced below cost. Prices are
revised periodically, generally upon demand of producers, but in some cases no
increase is granted. The present price structure is a result of independent
historical decisions that aim at making the most essential items accessible to
the poor segments of the population.
1.11      As energy is mainly used by households, the mission analyzed related
consumptions: first for cooking and heating, then for lighting (Annex 1.1).
For cooking and heating: 3(i) firewood is definitely the  cheapest fuel,
priced at FMG 1.67 pe5 10 kcal, more than four times its economic cost of
about FMG 0.33 per 10 kcal 2/; (ii) although charcoal's economic cost per
kcal is about seven times that of firewood, the price is only about one third
higher; and (iii) other sources are considerably more expensive. As for light-
ing, (i) candles are the cheapest possibility, and more affordable considering
that they can be purchased daily while other means require an investment and
periodic payments. FIG 150 may be considered a minimum monthly expenditure per
family for candles, but some spend up to FIG 900; (ii) electricity compares
1/   75% from hydroelectric sources.
2/   Based on planting cost, interest on investment until wood utilization,
cutting and transport for about 50 km.



- 4 -
favorably, about FMG 400 per month, even more so considering the quality dif-
ferences with other sources of light, and that presently unit price decreases
with quantity consumed; and (iii) kerosene ranks third in price.
1.12      The population, at least those in the area affected by the project,
seem very aware of price differentials. Since 1970, despite some electricity
tariff increases in current values, electricity consumption has considerably
increased, as real cost decreased and substitutes became increasingly more
expensive in relative terms. It is also a "prestige" commodity. Based on
present tariff structure, it would seem justified to encourage use of elec-
tricity for lighting. 1/
1.13      As for industrial uses, technical considerations seem to be more
relevant for energy source choice as fuel or electricity costs are in general
a low percentage of production costs, and small price variations do not affect
consumption.
Sector Development Strategy
1.14      Various Government services deal with the sector.  Under the Ministry
of Economy and Commerce, the Energy Service assembles all information relevant
to the sector, handles related legislation proposals, and oversees the national
energy-related agencies such as JIRAMA and SOLIMA (the refinery); the Depart-
ment of Industry and Mines approves electric tariff and fuel price proposals
in coordination with the Price Commission. Despite the existence of these
various services, Madagascar lacks a comprehensive energy development plan;
such a plan will be started under the project, although it will focus essen-
tially on power development (para. 3.06). Further, in line with the decen-
tralization policy, smaller projects are planned at local levels.
1/   However, a tariff based on marginal pricing may disprove this, as
lighting demand occurs in the peak hours. The cost of supplying the
lighting load is the system's marginal cost.

II. THE POWER SECTOR
Institutional Background
2.01      Electric power was introduced in Madagascar at the beginning of the
century, by a private group. Thermal-based power generation facilities were
initially constructed to supply the Antananarivo area, and subsequently the
major centers were electrified.
2.02      Until 1973, institutional responsibility for the sector was divided
among:
(i) Electricite et Eaux de Madagascar (EEM), a privately owned
company, operating in the central area;
(ii) Societe d'Energie de Madagascar (SEM), which was operating
mainly in the vicinity of Antananarivo. In this company
the Government had a majority interest; and
(iii)  eleven small urban systems ("Regies") owned by local author-
ities and managed, under contract, by SEM.
2.03      Both EEM and SEM were also operating or managing water supplies in
their service areas and in a few urban centers. In order to rationalize the
development of the sector, the Government took over the foreign interests
in SEM and EEM 1/ in 1973 and, as a temporary measure, created the Societe
d'Interet National pour l'Eau et l'Electricite (SINEE); its duties were
essentially to manage the nationalized entities on Government's behalf.
In 1975, a unified autonomous entity, the Malagasy Electricity and Water
Corporation (JIRAMA), was set up to own and operate all electric and water
supplies in the country and to achieve the national objectives in the two
sectors (para. 2.04). On January 1, 1977, JIRAMA took over all the assets
and liabilities of the former entities, in addition to long-term debt to
the Government in respect of the compensation of related foreign interests.
JIRAMA is overseen by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce.
Legal Framework
2.04      The national objectives are spelled out in a Presidential Ordinance
issued in 1974, and are essentially:
(i) gradually to provide the whole country with electricity
and water supply facilities;
(ii) to provide these services at the lowest price;
1/   EEM's name then changed to SMEE, Societe Malgache de l'Eau et de
l'Electricite.



(iii)  to unify gradually the policies in the fields of produc-
tion, transmission and distribution of electricity and
water, as well as tariffs; and
(iv)  to maintain tariffs that would recover all costs as well
as generate a reasonable surplus to finance part of the
expansion costs.
2.05      Legislation was introduced in the 1960's regulating the safety of
production, transmission, distribution and maintenance of public and private
electric facilities. The legislation for the sector is satisfactory. JIRAMA's
legal framework is reviewed in Chapter V.
Existing Facilities
2.06      The electrical facilities of JIRAMA are characterized by an In-
terconnected System around Antananarivo, which accounts for one half of the
total installed capacity of about 100 MW, and 30 isolated systems located
in the major urban centers (Map IBRD 13138). Hydroelectric power presently
accounts for about 80% of the generation of the Interconnected System and
less than 20% in the isolated grids. Details appear at Annex 2.1. Trans-
mission facilities, at 63 kV, total about 400 km, while the distribution
system totals less than 2,300 km. Considering the size of the country (about
590,000 km ) and its population (about 9 million), it may be concluded that
the power sector is at an early stage of development; for instance, annual
per capita consumption of electricity at 33 kWh, compares with 72 kWh in
Kenya.
2.07      Independent electricity generating facilities, for self consumption,
account for a total installed capacity of about 58 MW, including 1.5 MW of
hydroelectric plant. Sugar estates which operate bagasse-fueled, steam power
plants, account for about 23.5 MW; these plants only operate during the crop
season. The balance is used only for standby purposes in the areas supplied
by JIRAMA, or by a number of small-scale and agro-industries (sisal, cinnamon,
cloves, meat canning, cement) often in poorly accessible and scarcely populated
areas, which are not presently supplied by JIRAMA.
Power Market
2.08      JIRAMA's energy sales have increased annually at about 6.5% average
since 1970, and totalled about 229 GWh in 1976. The Interconnected System
(Map IBRD 13139) presently accounts for 64% of the power market. The rest
of the country accounts for the remaining 36% or 81.5 GWh in 1976, after
experiencing an average increase of 9.7% p.a. since 1970. Electricity sales
and other characteristics of the power market appear at Annex 2.2.
2.09      The low-income groups have increased their electric consumption
considerably in the last few years, as Government favored subsidizing them
through selective tariff freezing. JIRAMA has embarked on rural electri-
fication programs for social reasons although their economic justification
is doubtful. As more of the low-income households have been connected,
consumption per connection has declined.

Past Demand in the Interconnected System
2.10      The proposed Andekaleka Hydroelectric Project will meet the antici-
pated demand growth in the Interconnected System. The annual growth rate
in demand has been steadily declining since 1968, and in 1975 sales actually
decreased. In 1976 sales at 146.5 GWh represented, on the other hand, a 5.0%
increase over 1975. Stagnation of energy sales in any particular year can be
attributed to special political events that affected the economy: in 1960,
when independence was declared, and in 1974-75, when Government was in a
restructuring process and expatriates departed massively. However, energy
sales growth resumed immediately thereafter.
2.11      In fact, energy sales increased even in 1972-73 when the GNP
declined. In real terms, the GNP increased about 1% p.a. in 1970-75 which
compares to energy sale increases of about 5.2% p.a. in the Interconnected
System.  This can be explained by a decrease in real tariffs, and by the
industrial expansion that has taken place. High voltage (60 and 22 kV)
demand has increased at 7% p.a. since 1970 while low voltage (400 V) at only
2.4%. The longer term 1957-76 trend shows an average total increase of 7.6%
p.a. in electricity consumption (Annex 2.3). On average, maximum demand (MD)
has grown slightly less than energy demand, at about 4.4% p.a. since 1970 and
reaching 32.5 MW in 1976 (Annex 2.3). The MD does not vary much seasonally.
In 1976, the maximum demand was 32.5 MW in September, while the minimum
MD was 28.4 MW in January, part of the variation being caused by growth
(Annex 2.4). Much more important are hourly variations, with an MD below
18 MW during 6 night hours and peaks from 6 pm to 10 pm, approximately
(Annex 2.5).
2.12      As mentioned above, high voltage sales have increased faster than
average and their share increased from 60% of sales in 1970 to 67%, or 99.4
GWh, in 1976. About 40% of this volume has been absorbed by large indus-
tries, expanded or installed since 1970, and whose average yearly requirement
increase was about 11%. One cotton fabric manufacturer accounts for almost
80% of this GWh increase, a brewery for 9% and a blanket factory for 8%.
Maximum demand increased by only about 3% p.a., as the industrial utilization
factor improved from about 44% to 70% in 1976 (Annex 2.6). Energy demand by
smaller industries increased by about 4.7% p.a. Total number of industrial
connections in the Interconnected System was 326 in 1976, about 75 more than
in 1970; average consumption per connection was 305 MWh in 1976 against 265
MWh in 1970.
2.13      The second main consumer group are households (some details were
given in para. 1.07), which absorbed almost 25% of 1976 sales, or 35.6
GWh; this category was the most affected by the departure of expatriates,
but its consumption is now above previous levels. Domestic connections have
increased by about 8% p.a. since 1970; presently more than 70% are for light-
ing purposes only. Still at least 40,000 households in the urban areas, and
more than a million persons in the rural areas surrounding the Interconnected
System, are without electricity. Should the connection charges be reduced
(at present, about FMG 8,000 to 35,000) no doubt an increase in demand would
result . JIRAMA will shortly undertake a market survey to assess means to



-9-
Lacilitate access to electricity by the urban poor, particularly to establish
to what extent the policy of full lump-sum payment for connection costs is a
deterrent to electrification. Should it prove to be a deterrent,
a new policy will be formulated, and its impact on JIRAMA's finances quanti-
fied.
Development Strategy
2.14      The Government attaches considerable importance to the development
of the power sector, in order to make energy available ta industries and to
both urban and rural populations. Existing systems will be expanded as and
where demand requires it, and JIRAMA has embarked on a rural electrification
program with the objective of constructing about 9 new systems per annum
(para. 2.04). This is a modest program if compared with needs, but reason-
able taking into account the high investment and recurrent costs of rural
electrification and the low income of the rural population.
2.15      Priority has been given wherever possible to hydroelectric projects.
hus, a 5-MW hydroelectric plant is now under construction at Namorona, with
Japanese assistance, to supply future demand in the Fianarantsoa area. W4hen
hydroelectric development is not possible, new diesel plants are installed
when required; for instance, a 7.5 MW diesel unit will be commissioned during
1979 at Majunga. The Andekaleka hydroelectric project will be the largest
plant in the country, practically doubling existing capacity in the Intercon-
nected System; the first stage is to be operating by 1982. Government is now
discussing with the USSR possible assistance to investigate other hydroelec-
tric sites for the Interconnected System. The preparation of a national,
long-term development plan for the power sector is now under consideration,
and will be prepared by JIRAMA, under Terms of Reference satisfactory to the
Association, with expatriate assistance provided under the proposed credit
(para. 3.06).

III. THE PROJECT
JIRAMA's Investment Program
3.01      Over the 1978-1982 period, JIRAMA's electricity construction pro-
gram will amount to FIG 45.7 billion (US$190.4 million), including FMG 27.9
billion (US$116.3 million) for the Andekaleka Hydroelectric Project. JIRAMA's
construction program is well balanced and also provides for major extensions
in two independent systems (Fianarantsoa and Majunga), new electrifications
of rural areas, and distribution facilities in the whole country.
Project Objectives and Description
3.02      The Andekaleka Hydroelectric Project will meet the growth of demand
in the Interconnected System beyond 1982, and will also permit substantial
fuel savings. The proposed credit also provides for the strengthening of
JIRAMA, particularly in the areas of planning and staff development. The
project comprises:
i. The Andekaleka Hydroelectric Complex situated on the
Vohitra river 115 km east of Antananarivo (Map IBRD
13139). It will include:
(a) a concrete diversion dam 10 m high and 125 m long
and an intake structure;
(b) a 5.2 m diameter tunnel, about 4 km long, leading
from the intake to an underground powerhouse; an under-
ground powerhouse with provision for four 28-14W units
and tailrace and access tunnels;
(c) two Francis turbines and two generators with a
nominal rating of 28 IMW each;
(d) associated auxiliary electrical and mechanical
equipment;
(e) a 138-kV, 150-km, transmission line to Antananarivo
with necessary switching and substations; and
(f) engineering services.
ii.  Preliminary investigation ant design for a storage reser-
voir of 400 to 500 million m capacity at Ankorahotra,
45 km upstream of Andekaleka.
iii.  Technical Assistance and Training
External assistance for the creation of a planning unit
and training of JIRAIA staff.



- 17 -
i. The Andekaleka Plant
3.03      The Andekaleka plant will utilize an extraordinary fall of 242 m
in the Vohitra river over a river distance of 10 km. The foundation rock for
the diversion dam and the intake is exposed in many places and appears to be
of good quality. The twenty borings that have been made along the proposed
route of the tunnel, and in the vicinity of the powerhouse, indicated that
good rock may be expected except for some faulted sections which will require
the tunnel to be lined with concrete; at the crossing of the Sahantsiva River,
a steel lining will be required where there is a lack of sufficient rock cover.
3.04      The diversion dam has been designed to bypass as much silt and sand
as possible; hydraulic model studies are now being conducted and some changes
in the desilting arrangements and the intake tower are presently under review.
The tunnel is designed for optimum use of three 28-MW units.  The fourth 28-MW
unit will be utilized as a standby and for peaking.
ii. The Ankorahotra Investigation
3.05      Subsequent steps after this project consist of:  (a) two additional
28-MW units which will be installed in space provided for them in the first
stage, and (b) the construction of the Ankorahotra storage dam, 45 km up-
stream of Andekaleka.  The fourth unit can only be justified if the storage
is available and therefore it was important to ensure, before the project is
started, that the construction of the storage dam was feasible, and if so, its
approximate cost. JIRAMA's consultant carried out site investigations during
October-December 1977, on the basis of terms of reference acceptable to the
Association. The study concluded that construction of a dam with adequate
storage at Ankorahotra was feasible, at a cost of approximately US$54 million.
An expenditure of this order would be economically justified. Retroactive
financing by the Association of about US$200,000 is recommended for the above
investigation.
iii. Training of JIRAMA Staff
3.06      The JIRAMA personnel department has submitted, for IDA financing,
a five-year training program to supplement the facilities and practices
already in use in order to serve all levels and categories of staff (including
water staff). The proposal is described at para. 5.10. It is also proposed
to strengthen the planning department of JIRAMA through the secondment of ex-
patriates knowledgeable in power planning who would train counterpart staff
(para. 2.15).
Cost Estimates
3.07      The detailed estimates, with base costs at January 1978 prices,
appear at Annex 3.1 and can be summarized as follows:

/3   The project is exempted from custom duties and taxes.  Any corporate
and personal income tax affecting contractors and suppliers would be
paid by JIRAMA. The amounts involved are expected to be small and
therefore would not materially affect project costs or JIRAMA's finances
(Chap. VI).
Basis for Cost Estimates
3.08      The estimate prepared by JIRAMA's consulting firm for engineering,
SNC (Canada) is similar to that used when a contractor prepares his bid i.e.,
a complete construction layout was planned and the costs of equipment, labor,
supplies, and overhead to implement this plan using the computed unit quanti-
ties were determined. The cost of equipment and supplies, besides purchase or
rental costs, includes insurance and transportation cost to the site; and the
cost of local and foreign labor includes, besides salaries, where applicable
transportation costs, living expenses, insurance, etc. This type of estimate
is satisfactory. The total cost of the project, as estimated by Cartier is
reasonably similar to that prepared by the previous consultant (para. 3.13).



- 19 -
3.09      The high percentage of foreign costs is due to the fact that the
local contribution would consist only of manual labor.  Cement and lumber
must be imported together with all other supplies and equipment. The project
is exempted from custom duties and taxes.
Financing Plan
3.10      The financing plan for the Andekaleka Hydroelectric Project is as
follows:
Proposed Financing Plan of the Project

The major part of the CIDA loan (US$12 million equivalent) is already effec-
tive, and the BADEA loan has been approved. The others are in various stages
of appraisal/negotiations. A condition of effectiveness for the IDA credit
would be that the conditions of effectiveness of the balance of external f unds
have been fulfilled (para. 7.02). The colenders are expected to cooperate
closely during project implementation, and a draft Memorandum of Understanding
to this effect has been agreed and will be signed once all the loans have been
approved.
Procurement
3.11      At the colenders meeting held in Paris in January 1978, agreement
was reached on allocation of the different bid packages among the cofinancing
agencies. The civil works are to be financed on a joint basis by the four
Arab funds and IDA.  Civil works contractors and equipment suppliers have
already been prequalified in accordance with IDA guidelines for international
bidding. IDA will also finance turbines, valves, transformers, gates and
linings, as well as technical assistance, drillings and pre-engineering. The
contracts to be financed by CIDA and Caisse Centrale will be awarded in com-
pliance with their procurement regulations. CIDA, which is already financing
JIRAMA's contract with Cartier, will also finance the transmission line. The
Caisse Centrale will finance electrical equipment, generators and substations.



- 20 -
Regarding the civil works contract, BADEA, Kuwait Fund and Saudi Fund have
agreed to the prequalification recommendations and have jointly agreed
with IDA on the general and special conditions applicable to the civil works
tender documents. Regarding the equipment items financed by IDA, tender
documents satisfactory to IDA will be issued shortly to the prequalified
firms.
Engineering and Construction
3.12      The Feasibility Study, preliminary design and pre-engineering of the
project were carried out by SNC Inc. of Canada (para. 3.18). The concept has
been carefully studied, and the various individual components of the project
have been located to provide for economic construction and ease of operation.
The design of the diversion dam and the intake are undergoing minor modifica-
tions following model studies and detailed layout. The size of the generating
units was determined following appropriate optimization studies.
3.13      In accordance with CIDA procedures, Canadian consulting firms,
including SNC, were subsequently invited to submit proposals for engineering
services for the preparation of tender documents and supervision of project
implementation.  JIRAMA awarded the contract to Cartier, a firm associated
with Montreal Engineering of Canada, on terms and conditions that were satis-
factory to the Association.  Cartier was asked, and has agreed, to take full
responsibility for the design prepared by SNC (para. 3.12). During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that JIRAMA will continue to employ engineer-
ing consultants, whose qualifications, terms, and conditions of employment are
satisfactory to the Association (para. 7.01). JIRAMA personnel will be used
on all supervising activities but their employment is considered to be in the
form of training by the consultant since there has been little construction of
this type of Madagascar.
3.14      The plant site does not have an adequate road connection with the
port of Tamatave through which practically all materials for the plant (ex-
cluding natural materials such as sand, gravel, and rock, but including
cement) will be imported.  However, there is a railroad extending from
Tamatave, through the site and to Antananarivo. The railroad is 50 years old,
but the quality of maintenance is good and the rolling stock has been inves-
tigated and found to be adequate. Investigations disclose no serious reason
why the railroad alone cannot serve project construction requirements. Fur-
ther, the railroad company has provided adequate assurances to JIRAMA that
it will cooperate fully to serve the proposed construction.
3.15      No major construction problems are foreseen, although work on the
diversion dam and intake in the riverbed will require proper timing to avoid
flooding of the works.  The tunnel can be constructed from four working faces
and there is ample space for the disposal of muck.
3.16      The number of workers is estimated at 800 and the total population
for the camps at about 2,000 persons. A site camp with all ancillary facili-
ties will be constructed by local contractors.



- 21 -
3.17      Completion of the Andekaleka plant with two units in commercial
operation is expected in mid-1982. A project implementation schedule appears
at Annex 3.2.
Disbursements
3.18      In July 1976, the Government of Madagascar made a request for an
advance under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to be applied to the
pre-engineering studies of the project. At that time, no external funds were
available, and without the advance, project preparation would have been
substantially delayed. As a result, in August 1976, an amount of US$400,000
was made available under the PPF to finance site investigations and engineer-
ing of the project and the funds were disbursed during 1977. In addition it
is proposed to finance retroactively the Ankorahotra investigations (para.
3.05). The balance of the IDA credit would be disbursed against 22% of total
expenditures 1/ for civil works 2/; 100% of total expenditures for turbines,
gates and transformers 2/; and 100% of foreign expenditures for technical
assistance and training. A disbursement schedule appears at Annex 3.3. The
closing date of the Credit is proposed to be December 31, 1983.
Ecology
3.19      The diversion dam is too low to have any important effect on the
upstream channel: (i) the area is not populated; (ii) the impoundment e
tends only 700 meters upstream with a storage capacity of only 150,000 m
which, with average flows, will have a narrow range of water level fluctua-
tions. With the first two units in operation the flow will be minimal or
nil for about 4 km downstream of the dam to the mouth of the tributary, the
Sahantsiva River, about 120 days per year. Little effect is expected from
this because the Tarariana rapids 25 m-high prevent migration of fish in this
reach in any event, and the pools formed by rapids are expected to support
the fish populations during the days of zero flow.  The change in water flows
will not affect the water supplies of any villages. The first stage of
construction requires no further ecological study. Such a study will be
required when the Ankorahotra storage dam (para. 3.05) is constructed, as
wildlife is present and the area is populated, although sparsely.
1/   It is proposed, for the disbursement of the civil works contract that,
upon review and approval of a withdrawal application, each colender
would disburse its funds without prior notification to the others. The
lending agencies will coordinate closely on the progress of disbursements.
2/   Civil works contractors and suppliers have been requested to submit
all bids excluding corporate or personal income tax as when due;
these would be paid by the employer, JIRAMA (para. 3.07).

IV. JUSTIFICATION
Background
4.01      SNC, Canadian consultant in charge of project preparation, made
a feasibility study in early 1976; earlier studies were based on different
demand forecasts and had identified various alternatives to meet the future
requirements of the Interconnected System. SNC's technical proposals were
retained by JIRAMA and their least-cost-solution analysis was updated by the
mission confirming that the adopted option (Grand Rogez) is the best.
Future Power Market
4.02      In recent years several power market surveys for the Interconnected
System have been conducted. These are described in Annexes 4.1 and 4.2. The
forecast adopted as the most probable is the one based on the long-term trend
method, which results in an annual growth rate of 7.6%. The "low" forecast
is based on a 2-year lag behind the "probable" forecast, and the "hîgh" one
on a 2-year advancement, deviating at most 15% at any point in time from the
historical trend. 1/ When considering the breakdown by classes of consump-
tion, domestic consumption is expected at least to follow the average trend
since 1968, of 2.9% p.a., and a higher growth rate is likely should incomes
improve significantly and/or connection charges be reduced (para. 2.13), in
real terms. On the other hand, industrial sales are not expected to increase
above the earlier trend. 2/
1/   Compared to the forecasts resulting from the trend method, SNC's esti-
mates fall within -15% by 1981, -12% and +9% by 1986, and +6% by 1991,
the main difference being SNC assumptions of a slower recovery from
the recent recession. Still, all SNC estimates fall within the adopted
+15%.
2/   A comparison of the main industrial developments, actual from 1970 to
1976, and planned from 1977 to 1984, has been attempted to estimate
whether the largest industries will continue to grow at the recent
trend. The Direction de l'Industrie et des Mines provided a list of
"large" industrial projects at various stages of preparation and their
expected demand until 1984:  30 GWh and 8 MW (excluding a fertilizer
and a pulp and paper plants that would be undertaken after 1984, and the
ferrochrome plant). However, these energy-capacity demand figures would
imply a low 42% utilization factor, and modern industries should more
probably be able to reach factors of 70% that prevail in existing indus-
tries. Therefore, a 5-MW demand increase is more realistic. Linking
these figures (30 GWh and 5 MW) with the corresponding ones until 1976
from Annex 2.6, results in expected energy and power demand increases
of 7.3% p.a. This rate is higher than the earlier growth rate of power
demand (3.0%) because of previously-existing unused capacity, but lower
than the earlier growth rate of energy consumption of large industries
(11%) from 1970 to 1976.



- 26 -
;03      In addition to the long-term trend estimate of energy demand, the
implications of constructing a ferrochrome plant near Moramanga have to be
considered. Many unknowns about the ferrochrome plant remain to date, such
as completion of detailed feasibility, technology to be adopted, timing of
construction and production volumes. By end-1978, specific details will be
known. In the interim, a ferrochrome plant proposal by the Japan Interna-
tional Cooperation Agency (1975) was retained as indicative for energy and
power demand: the plant would start to operate in 1982 with one furnace
requiring 16 MW and 125 GWh p.a., and its capacity would be doubled by 1986.
However, the expected demand of the ferrochrome plant is not required for the
justification of the Andekaleka project, although it would increase the return
on investment, and require an advancement of future stages.
4.04      A Verbund-Plan study in 1970 and an SNC study in 1977 both concluded
that construction of a transmission line from the Interconnected System to
Tamatave would be uneconomic and, further, the cyclones affecting the area
might require a specially-strengthened transmission line. For the present
analysis of the Andekaleka hydroelectric project, Tamatave's potential demand
is excluded.
4.05      As system losses are on average 10% this was reflected in the
energy demand forecasts to determine energy requirements. Forecast of energy
and maximum demand until 1997 are summarized in Annexes 2.3 and 4.3; monthly
variations are shown at Annex 2.4..
4.06      The Interconnected System, with 49 MW of firm capacity and 267 GWh
producible in an average year (or 210 GlWh with a 90% probability) requires
additional generating capacity by 1982 should the "probable" demand forecast
materialize whether or not the ferrochrome project is implemented. 1/  Should
the demand grow faster, the system might have to be operated at its limit and
additional thermal power put into operation before 1982. However, should
this happen, in order to avoid building up thermal capacity that would become
unnecessary as soon as the hydroelectric plant starts operating, JIRAMA could
temporarily utilize small, mobile units that could later be transferred else-
where; such units also require a minimum delivery time. On the other hand
should demand grow slower than under the "low" assumption, added capacity
requirements would be postponed. However, such hypothesis seems unlikely as
since 1970, even though real GNP increased at only 1% p.a., energy consumption
nevertheless grew at 5.2% p.a.
1/   The analysis is based on average year capacity and not dry year capacity,
as the cost of higher reserves to minimize risks of service cuts is not
justified in Madagascar, even more considering that domestic lighting
produces the load peak, and that industrial use would not be affected
if domestic supply is discontinued first in a shortage case. The average
dry year recurrence is one in ten, and the capacity decrease in those
years, about 20%. And in any event, even if the dry hydro year was
considered, thus advancing the need for capacity expansion, the proposed
plant could not be commissioned earlier than scheduled under the project,
thus making little difference for practical purposes.

Alternative Expansion Proposals
4.07      Different proposals regarding the development of the potential of
the Vohitra river at Andekaleka had already been formulated but found unsatis-
factory, when SNC started its study (Annex 4.1). SNC analyzed three hydro-
electric alternatives and a thermal alternative for reference, as follows:
(a)  Grand Rogez:  In a first stage, a power station would be
built for an ultimate capacity of four 28-MW units, but
only two would be installed initially. The second stage
would consist of the third unit, and the third stage, of
the fourth unit and the Ankorahotra regularization dam
(para. 3.05). The firm capacity at completion would be
85 MW.  (The first stage of this alternative is included
in the project).
(b)  Rogez I and II:  The same 242 m fall in the river in this
case would be utilized in two steps instead of one, there-
fore requiring two smaller power stations. The first step
(Rogez I) would utilize 148 m of the fall and consist of
a power station with an ultimate capacity of three 28-MW
units, although only two would be installed initially.
The second stage would consist of the installation of
the third unit; the third stage would consist of the
Ankorahotra dam. The fourth stage would comprise construc-
tion of the second power station (Rogez II) using the re-
maining fall in the river (76 m), and installation of two
17.5-MW units. The total firm capacity for this alterna-
tive would be 82 MW.
(c)  Rogez Il and I:  This alternative would also have two
power stations. The first step would consist in the
construction of Rogez II with two 19-MW units. The
second step would consist of construction of Rogez I
with three 27-MW units. The third stage would consist
of the Ankorahotra dam. Total firm capacity would be
85 MW.
(d)  Thermal alternative:  This would be achieved in two
stages and comprise four 27-MW gas turbine or steam
turbine driven units, so that it would have an ulti-
mate capacity similar to the hydroelectric proposals.
4.08      Annex 4.4 summarizes SNC's proposals, including implementation
schedules and cost estimates. Cost estimates based on detailed engineering
are available for Grand Rogez only, at July 1977 prices. For the other
alternatives, the SNC 1975 estimates derived from preliminary engineering
were updated according to increases observed for the Grand Rogez estimates in
the same period. Operating costs for the various alternatives are also shown.
To calculate economic costs, the shadow exchange rate of FMG 260 per US$ was
applied to local costs.



- 28 -
Least Cost Solution (l.c.s.)
4.09      Comparison of the net present economic cost of the various alter-
natives, at 8%, 10% and 12% discount rates 1/, indicates that the Grand
Rogez is the least cost solution in virtually all scenarios (Annex 4.5). The
first stage of Grand Rogez was, therefore, retained for the project. A first
phase, comprising three units instead of two, seems a slightly better economie
solution except in the lowest demand framework, as the incidence of the third
unit's cost some years earlier is more than offset by higher savings from
substituting more thermal generation. Economically, both options would be
indifferent in the "without ferrochrome" scenario, but 3 units are preferable
in the first phase in the "with ferrochrome" scenario, at the relevant dis-
count rate range from 8 to 12 percent. The next selection criteria should be
the avoidance of any over-investment risk. Therefore, the project has been
defined as comprising basically two units, the more so because a decision on
including a third can be delayed until end 1978, by which time more should be
known on the status of the ferrochrome plant proposals and on the evolution
of demand. The bidding documents will allow an option for a third unit to be
exercised by end 1978.
4.10      The existing hydroelectric capacity of the Interconnected System
is now fully utilized. Future demand increases will be satisfied by existing
thermal capacity, up to now held in reserve or utilized occasionally for peak-
ing periods. This existing thermal capacity could satisfy demand increases
until about 1982, at a fuel cost of US$3 to 5 million per year (at 1977
prices). After 1982 this fuel cost could be avoided with the commissioning
of a hydroelectrical plant, and such savings would more than offset the
higher investment cost of an hydro plant compared to a thermal one. The net
present cost of the thermal proposal is about 2.5 times the net present cost
of the hydro proposals in the "without ferrochrome" scenario (at 10% discount
rate), and would be even more unfavorable should the ferrochrome plant mate-
rialize. A new thermal installation is in no case a least cost solution for
the Interconnected System. 2/
4.11      The "Rogez II and V" proposal is inferior to the other two hydro
schemes. Its first stage would provide considerably lower capacity (38 MW
instead of 56 MW) enabling less savings from avoidable thermal generation.
The net present cost of the "Rogez I and IV" alternative is lower, and
marginally so (by less than 3%), than the n.p.c. of Grand Rogez only in the
without-ferrochrome scenarios at discount rates of 10% in the "low" demand"
case and 12% in the "probable demand" case, (but is higher at 8% discount
rate). Moreover, it is substantially higher at all discount rates in the
with-ferrochrome scenarios. Further, in the lowest demand scenario, the
1/   Opportunity cost of capital is estimated as 10% in real terms.
2/   In addition to SNC's thermal proposal, an alternative consisting of
a succession of smaller plants was analyzed. The advantage of more
gradual investments was outweighed by repeated mobilization costs and
lost economies of scale.



- 29 -
plants could be commlssioned later than in 1982 as assumed throughout the
analysis and, if postponed, the Grand Rogez appears again as l.c.s. The
various alternatives' n.p.c. are shown in Annex 4.5.
Return on Investment
4.12      The return on the project was taken to be the discount rate at
which the present worth of its associated economic net costs, including all
capital and operating costs but excluding taxes, is equal to the present
worth of the associated system revenues obtained over its lifetime based on
current tariffs.  This represents a minimum estimate of the economic rate
of return, as the full economic benefits of the project are not adequately
reflected by the electricity revenues alone.
4.13      The return on investment of the Grand Rogez proposal would be
approximately 11%, or 15% should the ferrochrome plant be commissioned in
1982 and be charged the present industrial tariff.  The lowest return ob-
tained in the sensitivity analysis is still a satisfactory 9.6%, assuming a
10% cost overrun and the lowest demand scenario. Details are at Annex 4.6.
Risks
4.14      The risks of this project are those normally associated with hydro-
electric plants namely (i) unforeseen bad underground conditions; (ii) over-
investment; and (iii) institutional/financial difficulties. In order to
reduce these risks: (i) geological investigations were carried out, which
concluded that the rock is generally good (para. 3.03) and a preliminary
feasibility study was undertaken at Ankorahotra, showing that the construction
of a dam in a future stage is technically possible and economically justified
(para. 3.05); (ii) although a first phase consisting of three units instead of
two appears slightly better in the case of the probable forecast (para. 4.09),
the decision of the third unit has been deferred until end-1978 in order to
reassess the demand forecast at that time; 1/ and (iii) JIRAMA has already
taken appropriate steps to strengthen its weaker areas (paras. 5.06 and 5.11).
4.15      The potential impact of the above risks has been minimized to the
extent feasible. The project is worthy of the Association's support, as a
new source of power will be needed by 1982 (para. 4.06) and Grand Rogez is
the least cost solution. It will permit substantial savings in fuel imports,
of up to US$4.7 million (at 1977 prices) p.a. for about 14 years. Assurances
were obtained that JIRAMA will provide regular progress reports during project
execution and a Completion Report upon project completion (para. 7.01).
Monitoring guidelines are at Annex 4.7.
1/   The financing plan covers two units only.

Andekaleka Hydroelectric Project
Background of Economic Analysis
A. Existing Power Market Forecasts
1.        Several studies on the development of the Vohitra hydroelectric
potential have been undertaken since 1970 (Annex 7.1) each including demand
forecasts for different time horizons for the Interconnected System. The
first analysis was included in a Madagascar Master Plan prepared by Verbund-
Plan G.m.b.H. in 1970, under UNDP auspices. This study utilized the trend
method to forecast a minimum and maximum demand level until 1983. In 1971
both SEM and EdF prepared forecasts: the first including the demand from a
silicochrome plant foreseen by 1980, and until the year 2000; the latter
projecting a minimum, and a maximum incorporating the demand expected by a
nickel and a ferrochrome plant, until 1990. The 1975 JICA study utilized
two methods whose results were similar: the macroeconomic method based on
elasticity functions, with respect to GNP, and the disaggregated method by
which each demand type is forecast separately. A probable and maximum time
series were drawn until 1995; the demand from a proposed ferrochrome plant
was considered separately, assuming that a first furnace producing 17,000
tons per year, would be commissioned by 1981 and a second furnace by 1986.
2.        In 1975 SNC undertook another study applying three methodologies
to determine energy demand in the Interconnected System. The resulting
forecasts were the bases for the selection of technical alternatives, and
were established as follows:
(a) Two projections were done with the trend method, based on
available electricity sales statistics which indicated a
9.1% (8.3%) 1/ annual growth from 1965 to 1974, or 10.9%
(10.0%) 1/ p.a. from 1965 to 1971 when excluding the
years 1972-74. The "low" forecast expected a 4.5% annual
growth from 1976 to 1980 while the "high" considered a
5.5% growth until 1980, when the historical trends would
resume.
(b) Four projections were done with the macroeconomic method,
utilizing available GNP statistics, and GNP projections
of a low of 3.5% annual growth from 1976 to 1984 and 4%
thereafter, and a high expecting 5% annual growth contin-
uously. Elasticity functions of electricity to GNP were
estimated applying regression coefficients for the two
periods also utilized for the trend estimates, as follows:
1/   Figures resulting from 1977 revised statistics.



- 31 -
ANNEX 4.1
Page 2 of 3
- for 1965-74:    y = -7.0 + 2.21 log GNP        R  = 0.84
2
- for 1965-71:    y = -4.6 + 1.74 log GNP        R  = 0.95
by applying the low and high growth coefficients to
projected low and high GNP growth estimates respectively,
two similar projections resulted, only 5% different for
the year 2000. Electricity demand should as a result
increase by about 6.5% annually until 1981, accelerating
gradually until about 9% p.a. 1/
(c) Two projections were done with the disaggregated method,
assuming again a low and a high hypotheses. In the "low"
scenario, annual growth rates of 5.6% for the industrial
sector and 4.0% for the tertiary sector were expected
until 1984, and 6.4% and 4.5% respectively thereafter.
In the "high" scenario, an 8% annual growth rate for
industries and a 6% annual growth rate for services were
considered throughout. For each selected category, the
range of yearly growth rates were as follows: number of
connections 4 to 7%; administration 4 to 6%; low tension
6 to 9%; public lighting 8%; Antsirabe 7 to 9.5%; indus-
trial 10 to 15%; and telecommunications 4 to 6%. When
these sectoral forecasts were added, the "low" total
resulted in an annual electricity demand increase of 4.7%
until 1981, 8.2% until 1986 and accelerating; the "high"
is 6.7% and 11.8% respectively.
3.        In addition, SNC considered the potential energy requirements of
the proposed ferrochrome project to start in 1982, the proposed fertilizer
and pulp and paper plants to start in 1984 and 1986 respectively, and of
the Tamatave Grid should it become interconnected.
4.        In 1977 JIRAMA has updated past statistics and forecast the energy
demand from the past trend rate at 7.6% per annum by means of a regression
analysis. Actual energy sales figures since 1957 fall within 15% of the
trend estimate for each year.
5.        All of the above forecasts are summarized at Annex 4.2.  As can
be seen, there are significant variations among them, except for the more
recent SNC and JIRAMA ones.
B. Technical Expansion Proposals Prior to SNC's
6.        The 1970 UNDP financed study (para. 1) found that the best hydro-
electrical project of the Interconnected System was a 35 MW plant at Rogez.
1/   Two other projections were done by combining elasticity  for 1965-71
with 1965-74 GNP growth, and elasticity for 1965-74 with 1965-71 GNP
growth, which resulted in a very high and a very low forecast, which
we disregarded.

With slightly lower returns ranked projects on the Fatita river of 30 MW and
20 MW, and at Rogez, with larger capacity. The Rogez alternative is better
located with respect to Antananarivo and has advantages regarding transmis-
sion. The Fatita site would be about 300 km from Antananarivo (140 km S-SE
from Antsirabe). The hydroelectrical development was expected to be justi-
fied by 1978-79.  The study recommended not to serve Tamatave from the Cen-
tral Plateau through a high voltage line. Instead, 4th and 5th generators
should be installed at the already then existing hydroelectric plant of
Volobe, in 1974-75 and 1979-81, depending on growth of demand.
7.        In 1974 JICA financed a feasibility study for hydroelectric devel-
opment for the area, including the demand from the proposed ferrochrome
plant. It recommended the development of the Rogez site and locating the
ferrochrome plant close to the transmission line to Antananarivo, 70 km from
the power station, which is also served by the railway. The study reviewed
previous reports and finally recommended a 3-stage implementation program to
utilize the 110 MW potential of the Vohitra river:
- Station 1, with 35 MW by 1981, and expanded as demand
would require with two more turbo-generators and a regu-
lating pond reaching a total output of 70.4 MW by about
1986.
-  Station 2, with 36 MW, probably by 1990.

3/  It should be noted that the project could satisfy demand longer if the ferrochrome project is n ot undertaken.
Investments required after GR is fully utilized have not been included in our calculation.  Therefore, ERR for
both scenarios should not be compared nor the conclusion derived that the ferrochrome plant increases the return
of the hydroelectric project.
Il convient de noter que le projet peut satisfaire la demande pour une période plus longue si le projet de
ferrochrome n'est pas réalisé. Les investissements requis suivant la pleine utilization de GR ne sont pas
inclus dans les calculs. Par conséquence, les taux de rentabilité des deux scénarios ne doivent pas être com-
parés, ni la conclusion tirée   que le projet ferrochrome augmente la rentabilité du projet hydroélectrique.

V. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Background
5.01      Following the nationalization of two foreign-owned companies,
Electricite et Eaux de Madagascar (EEM) and Societe d'Energie de Madagascar
(SEM) in 1973, and the transfer of their assets and liabilities to JIRAMA
in January 1977, JIRAMA is now in charge of all public electricity and urban
water supply in Madagascar (para. 2.03). In all, JIRAMA now operates 30
power systems (including the Interconnected System) and 44 water supplies.
The vast majority of these systems and supplies are small.
5.02      EEM and SEM operated independently of each other, and therefore
had different personnel policies, accounting systems and operating proce-
dures. As a result, JIRAMA has been faced from the outset with the problem
of merging the staffs of the two entities into one organizational framework,
as well as introducing common policies, for all its areas of operations. It
was wisely decided to call on the services of an outsider (P.A. Management
Service S.A. (Switzerland») to: (i) set up an organization chart; (ii) pre-
pare job descriptions at all levels; (iii) select department heads; (iv)
set up a unique salary scale; and (v) establish a common accounting system.
During 1976, the organizational framework was established and staff was
selected to fill all key posts, and during 1977 the consultant's assign-
ment concentrated on establishing job descriptions and salary scales at
the lower echelon, as well as preparing a uniform system of accounts. On
the whole, the merger was executed smoothly, and despite teething problems,
particularly on the accounting side, JIRAMA now functions as a single, well
integrated, entity.
The JIRAMA Act
5.03      The 1975 Act has been designed to enable execution of the national
objectives in the electricity and water supply sector (para. 2.04), through
an autonomous and financially viable institution. The Board enjoys the
powers provided under the Companies Act; 1/ its membership is made up of
four representatives of the State, two of the staff, and two outside mem-
bers, all appointed by the Cabinet. The Board has delegated to the General
Manager the powers needed to run the day-to-day operations, and has retained
the right to approve large investments, new borrowings and other major deci-
sions. A General Controller, appointed by the Prime Minister, has the duty
to ensure that the company operates within its terms of reference, and con-
forms to the general policy of the Government. He enjoys the powers to call
for a meeting of the Board, or to postpone implementation of Board decision
by referring to the Ministry of Economy and Commerce which oversees JIRAMA.
This is a normal feature of parastatal companies in Madagascar.

5.04      Consideration is now being given to the application of the "Charter
of Socialist Enterprises" to JIRAMA. Under this Charter, a policy making
Orientation council would be established and made up of representatives of
the State, the Management Committee, the staff and the National Assembly.
The Management Committee constituted by the General Manager, and represen-
tatives of the State and the staff, would be the executive arm of the Orien-
tation council. The General Manager would be accountable to the Management
Committee. Further the staff would elect a Workers Committee which would
look after its well-being and which would be consulted on all reforms affect-
ing the staff. Also, a commission could be set up to look after various
issues affecting personnel matters.
Organization
5.05      In accordance with PA's proposals (para. 5.02), JIRAMA is organized
in eight departments. The day-to-day management of the electricity and water
supply operation is the duty of two departments: (a) Interconnected Zone,
which covers the Antananarivo region and accounts for about two-thirds of
electricity and half of water sales; and (b) Outside Zones which deals with
the rest of the country. Five other departments support the first two in
accounting, management systems, personnel, purchasing and sales matters.
Planning and construction are the duty of the Development Department. The
combination of the electricity and water supply operations at the levels of
all departments does not seem to affect JIRAMA's performance adversely, as
it was the practice of the preceding companies as well. JIRAMA's organiza-
tion chart appears at Annex 5.1.
Management and Staffing
5.06      JIRAMA employs a total staff of about 3,900 of which about 2,600
can be reasonably assigned to its electricity operations; this seems to be
somewhat on the high side taking into account the scope of JIRAMA's elec-
tricity operation. The senior management of JIRAMA is well qualified and
competent; the General Manager, a civil engineer, has had an impressive
career in one of the nationalized entities, and has the background and ex-
perience required for his assignment. At the technical level, all senior
posts and, where required, the posts below are occupied by well-qualified
and experienced engineers. JIRAMA, like many companies in Madagascar, suffers
from a shortage of qualified accounting staff. The problem is dealt with
effectively, and a competent Administrative and Financial Manager was recently
appointed, and a qualified Accountant has been recruited to head the Budgeting
Group. Consideration is now being given to recruit an expatriate to head the
Internal Audit Section and, should the need raise, it is proposed to finance
his emoluments under the Credit, provided that he is suitable and his Terms
of Reference are satisfactory to the Association. During negotiations, assur-
ances were obtained that the Association and JIRAMA will exchange views prior
to new appointments to the posts of Interconnected Zone Manager, Development
Manager, and Administrative and Financial Manager, and that JIRMA will con-
tinue to conduct its operations under qualified and experienced management
and staff at all levels (para. 7.01).



- 43 -
5.07      Indications are that since its inception, JIRAMA's unskilled staff
has grown much faster than the scope of its operations would justify. This
was apparently due to loose policies when it began to operate; during nego-
tiations, the Association obtained assurances that the size of the permanent
unskilled staff will not be increased beyond the level required by its scope
of operations (para. 7.01).
Training
5.08      JIRAMA presently operates a training center in the Antananarivo
area. The school was initially set up with assistance from Electricite de
France (EdF) and is essentially designed to familiarize lower cadres and
new recruits in the technical and administrative aspects of district opera-
tions. The center has a capacity of 32 trainees. New centers are planned
for Majunga (diesel maintenance), Tulear (distribution), and Tamatave, to be
opened respectively in 1978, 1980 and 1983. The main constraint is the lack
of instructors. Against 16 now required, only 6 are available, and JIRAMA
intends to approach EdF for technical assistance.
5.09      Seminars are also given, and cater for a wide variety of needs,
ranging from literacy at the lowest echelons to highly specialized technical
subjects. At the upper echelons, JIRAMA has also been sending senior staff
for short seminars to Europe, particularly those organized by EdF. It also
sponsors full-time students in higher learning institutions abroad.
5.10      JIRAMA has recently submitted to the Association a five-year train-
ing proposal, involving all categories of staff, and both the electricity and
water supply operations. In view of the expanding needs, it is proposed to
include a training component in the credit. The Association is now reviewing
JIRAMA's proposal, and is presently seeking clarifications regarding the jus-
tification of certain items. Regarding the Andekaleka Hydroelectric station,
the engineering consultants were asked, and have agreed, to set up a specific
program for the training of the staff which will be in charge of its operation
and maintenance. Training of planners is also envisaged (para. 2.15).
Accounts and Audits
5.11      The biggest problems associated with the merger have perhaps been
the preparation of a uniform system of accounts, particularly since the
accounts of one entity had not been closed since 1972, and the senior, ex-
patriate personnel of the account sections of both companies had left the
country during 1972-1975. During the first half of 1977, JIRAMA, with the
help of the Management Consultants made a remarkable effort in: (i) bring-
ing all the accounts up to date; (ii) separating the electricity and water
accounts; and (iii) introducing gradually the accounting system of SMEE,
the larger of the merged firms, into all the operations of JIRAMA. Efforts
are now underway to introduce budgetary control systems together vith costing
systems. Together with the forthcoming recruitment action (para. 5.06), the
present situation can be considered satisfactory.



- 44 -
5.12      JIRAMA's accounts, like those of its predecessors, will be subject
to an independent audit by a qualified Auditor ("Commissaire aux Comptes").
The proposed Auditor has the experience and staff required to undertake a
proper audit and, during negotiations, assurances were obtained that JIRAMA's
accounts will continue to be audited annually by auditors satisfactory to the
Association, and the audit report will be submitted to the Association within
five months from the end of the reporting period (para. 7.01).

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Background
6.01      As explained in Chapter II, JIRAMA is the result of the recent
merger of SEM and SMEE, and of autonomous systems which were previously
run by SEM. Accounts until end-1976 have been separately audited for all
entities. In most cases the reports of the auditors have been unqualified.
6.02      Past-years accounts are not too helpful in analyzing JIRAMA's
present financial position and prospects, as the electricity and water
accounts were not clearly separated.  It was, therefore, decided to proceed
as follows:
(i)  an opening Balance Sheet was set up as of January 1,
1977 in which (a) all fixed assets were stated at
their replacement values; 1/ (b) current assets and
liabilities were actuals as of that date; (c) long-
term debt was stated at its outstanding value, to
which was added a new debt of FMG 2.0 billion 2/
(US$8.3 million), which JIRAMA owes to the Government
on account of the transfer of fixed assets 3/; (d) a
balancing value of the start-up capital was deduced.
(ii) formats for the presentation of the electricity and
water Income Statements were established to permit a
reasonable analysis of the main accounts and were
drawn backwards for the years 1974-76 as a basis for
the financial projections.
JIRAMA's opening Balance Sheet and pro forma Income Statements for 1974-76
appear at Annexes 6.1 and 6.2 respectively.
1/   The replacement value of assets previously owned by SMEE (which accounts
for about 57% of JIRAMA's total assets), was assessed by an independent
(Swiss) valuer as of December 31, 1973, and for subsequent years EdF
coefficients were applied (the Malagasy Franc is pegged to the French
Franc). For the balance of its assets, JIRAMA applied EdF's coefficients
to historical book values established following a physical inventory as
of December 31, 1971.
2/   Subsequently 70% of the amount was allocated to the electricity operation,
and the balance to the water operation.
3/   The assets were owned by the two nationalized entities.  Therefore, the
matter of compensation does not concern JIRAMA, and is being dealt with
directly by the Government.



- 47 -
Past Performance
6.03      Over the three years 1974 through 1976 (Annex 6.2) both the elec-
tricity and water operations ran profitably. The average operating ratio 1/
for the electricity operation was approximately 60%, but for the water opera-
tion, it was a high 82%. Net Income from the electricity operation repre-
sented on the average 39% of Gross Sales, against a corresponding figure
of 17% for the water operation. Surpluses from the electricity operation
were wholly used to finance construction expenditure for both sectors. 2/
6.04      JIRAMA's Balance Sheet indicates (Annex 6.1) a strong position,
with a current ratio of 3.0 and a debt equity ratio of 12:88. The low in-
debtedness is explained by the relatively low level of investments in recent
years. Accounts Receivable, at FMG 2.5 billion, represent approximately 5.5
months of annual sales and are unacceptably high. Much of the arrears in
Accounts Receivable (about FMG 1.1 million) are due by the Government and
the Administration (i.e. units of local government); since January 1978,
however, approximately half of Government outstanding indebtedness has been
repaid, and the balance will be repaid before year-end. Further, the Gov-
ernment will, before year-end, assume liability for the arrears of the Admin-
istration, which will be cleared against JIRAMA's long-term debt to the
Government (para. 6.02). This is considered satisfactory.
Present Tariffs
6.05      The electricity and water tariffs now in effect are largely the
result of historical circumstances, rather than a defined tariff policy. Both
tariffs are indexed to many cost indices through complex formulas; on the
whole, however, the tariffs have increased at a slower pace than the cost of
living.  Some tariffs, particularly for water, have been "frozen" since the
late sixties and early seventies in order to keep the services affordable
to the lower income groups. As a result, there is a multiplicity of tariffs,
often bearing little relationship to the cost of supply. 3/
6.06      The Government is very aware of the need to elaborate a national
tariff policy, and some attempts have already been made by JIRAMA in this
direction. It is now envisaged, as a first step, to set up electricity
tariffs based on long-term marginal costs, for the Interconnected System.
1/   Ratio of Operating Expenses including depreciation allowance to
Operating Income.
2/   Annual construction expenditures averaged FMG 1.1 billion (US$4.7
million) for the electricity operation and FMG 350 million (US$1.5
million) for the water operation.
3/   For instance, in the Interconnected System, former customers of SEM pay
much less than former customers of SMEE though the costs are the same.



- 48 -
JIRAMA is presently receiving external assistance for the elaboration of such
a tariff, which will be prepared on the basis of Terms of Reference satisfac-
tory to the Association. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
tariffs based on long-term marginal costs will be introduced by July 1, 1979
(para. 7.01).
Future Performance
6.07      Forecasts of Income Statements, Sources and Application of Funds
and Balance Sheets for the Electricity and Water Operations appear at Annexes
6.3 and 6.4 respectively; the consolidated statements are at Annex 6.5 and
the supporting assumptions at Annex 6.6.
6.08      JIRAMA is presently earning 8% on its net revalued electricity
assets. In order to maintain this rate of return, a 12% tariff increase is
required in 1980, with a further 8% increase in 1981, and a 30% increase in
1983. 1/ During negotiations, assurances were obtained that JIRAMA's elec-
tricity tariffs will be reviewed periodically, to enable it to earn at least
8% on its net revalued electricity assets; the method or revaluation was
discussed and is satisfactory to the Association (para. 7.01).
6.09      This rate of return will enable JIRAMA, during the 1978-82 period,
to finance out of internal cash generated in its electricity operations, about
30%, of the electricity construction program. This is considered satisfactory.
To enable JIRAMA to finance its share of the electricity construction program,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that: (i) from 1978 onwards
JIRAMA will maintain separate accounts for the two operations, electricity
and water supply; and (ii) during the construction period: (a) no funds will
be transferred from the electricity operation to the water operation; 2/ and
(b) no dividends on earning of the electricity operation will be paid out
(para. 7.01).
6.10      JIRAMA's financing plan for the 1978-82 period, for the electricity
operation can be abstracted from the Sources and Application of Funds State-
ment (Annex 6.3, page 2), and summarized as follows:
1/   The forecast indicates that a 4% tariff increase would be needed in 1979
to enable JIRAMA to earn 8% on its net revalued electricity assets; a 4%
tariff increase however is within the margin of error of the forecast.
2/   In 1977, it is estimated that approximately FMG 450 million (US$1.9 mil-
lion) were transferred from the electricity operation to the water
operation.

Under a subsidiary loan agreement, the proceeds of the IDA credit would be

grace period, during which interest would be capitalized and financed by the
Governnent.
6.11      As the projected Income Statements for the water operation indicate
(Annex 6.4), with the existing tariffs JIRAMA now earns 0% on its net oper-
ating water assets, and the return is expected to decline to -4% by 1982.
During the 1978-82 period, cash surpluses from the water operation are ex-
pected to contribute 11% of the financing requirements of the water con-
struction program, leaving a financing gap of about FMG 4.8 billion (US$20.2
million). The Government is well aware of the problem, and undertook during
negotiations to provide or secure funds to finance operating deficits and

construction requirements of the water operation (para. 7.01). The financing
plan for the 1978-82 period for the water operation can be abstracted from the

as follows:

External financing is now being sought for the Antananarivo Water Supply
Project, which will be implemented in stages.  It was assumed above that
financing, amounting to 70% of the cost of the project (excluding customs
duties and taxes) would be obtained.
6.12      As the Consolidated Balance Sheets indicate (Annex 6.5, page 3),
JIRAMA's debt/equity ratio will increase from 11:89 in 1977, to 39:61 in
1982, which is still satisfactory. In order to ensure that adequate debt
service coverage will be maintained, assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that JIRAMA will consult with the Association prior to incurring new
long-term debt, should internal cash generation be less than 1.5 times future
debt service, including proposed new borrowings (para. 7.01).

Assumptions underlying the Financial Projections
A.   Electricity
1.        Income Statements
Sales forecasts, in GWh, were prepared by JIRAMA separately for
the Interconnected System, the Large Systems 1/ and the Small Systems.
The low forecast was used for the Interconnected System; the details of
the forecast for the Large Systems appear on page 5.
Average Revenue per kWh sold is based on the tariffs now in effect.
The tariffs are indexed to a large .number of indices, and with an average
inflation rate of 8%, the domestic commercial and industrial tariffs would
increase by an average of 3.2%, 5.77% and 5.85% respectively.
Cost of Generation: the plant load forecasts for the Large Systems
and the Interconnected System appear on pages 5 and 6 respectively. The costs
of hydroelectric generation were assumed to increase by 10% annually; Ande-
kaleka was assumed to enter into commercial operations January 1, 1983, with
an operating cost of FMG 250 million in that year. For thermal generation
costs in the Interconnected System, the fixed costs were assessed at FMG 20.9
million in 1977 and increasing by 10% annually thereafter, while the variable
costs were assessed at FMG 10/kWh. In the case of the Large Systems, and the
Isolated Systems, the cost of thermal production was assessed at FMG 14/kWh,
and FMG 15/kWh.
Transmission and Distribution expenses were assumed to increase
10% annually, starting from FMG 4 kWh sold in 1977.
Depreciation expenses were calculated on the basis of the schedule
appearing on page 7. The following lives were assumed:
1/   The cities of Diego Suarez, Fianarantsoa, Fort-Dauphin, Majunga,
Morondava, Nossi Be, Tamatave and Tulear.

Transmission             .   20 years
Distribution             :   18 years
Other Assets                  14.4 years
Income Tax was calculated on the basis of the existing tax laws
which indicate that income tax is only due on Net Income, less provision
for renewals, less half of the assets coming into operation during the year.
It was found to be nil during all the years of the forecast.
Provision for renewals is, in accordance with the practice in
Madagascar, calculated as 4.5% of Net Operating Assets, less annual depre-
ciation, less half of the assets coming into operation during the year and
less accumulated provisions for renewals.
Interest payment schedule appears on page 8.
2.        Balance Sheets
The Construction Program of JIRAMA appears on page 9. New assets
were commissioned in accordance with the schedule on page 7. Assets were
revalued on the basis of replacement costs as of December 31, 1976 and further
revaluations were assumed, at an equivalent rate of 8%.
A subsidy of FMG 450 million from the electricity to the water
operations was assumed in 1977, and no further transfers were assumed.
Accounts Receivable were assumed to be equivalent to 4 months of
sales in 1977, and decreasing thereafter to 3 months in 1978 and 2 months
from 1979 onwards.
Stores were assumed to increase by 10% annually.
Debt was calculated on the basis of the schedule on page 8. Funds
from the IDA credit would be onlent to JIRAMA at the prevailing IBRD lending
rate, over 25 years, including a 5-year grace period, and interest during
construction would be financed by the Government. It was assumed in the
forecast that the interest rate would be 7.5%.
The terms of the different loans are as follows:

Accounts Payable were assumed to increase by 5% annually.
B.   Water
3.        Income Statements
Forecast of m  sales and revenues per m  sold were provided by
JIRAMA, separately for Antananarivo, and the other supplies. As in the case
of the electricity projections, tariffs are indexed, and average revenues per
m were expected to increase annually by 3.5%, assuming a 8% annual inflation
rate.
Production and Distribution costs were assumed to increase at the
same rate as water sales, plus a 10% inflation provision.
Depreciation expenses were calculated on the basis of the schedule
appearing on page 10. The following lives were assumed:
Production                 33 years
Distribution               22 years
Other                      20 years
Income Tax and Provision for Renewals were calculated on the same
basis as in the electricity projections. Income Tax was found to be nil
during the period of the forecast.
Interest payment schedule appears on page 11.
4.        Balance Sheets
The Water Construction Program appears on Page 12 and new assets
were commissioned in accordance with the schedule on page 10. Assets were
revalued on the basis of replacement costs as of December 31, 1976, and
further revaluations were assumed, at an equivalent rate of 8%.
A subsidy of FMG 450 millions from the electricity operations was
assumed in 1977 to meet construction expenditures, and no further transfers
were assumed.
Accounts Receivable, Stores and Accounts Payable: same as for the
electricity projections.

ANNEX 6.6
Page 4 of 12
Debt was calculated on the basis of the schedule on page 11. It
was assumed that JIRAMA would make two borrowings, in 1978 and 1980 to finance
the Antananarivo Water Project. The borrowings would cover 70% of the cost
of the project, plus interest during construction at 8%; two tranches were
assumed, the first one covering the period 1978-80, and the second the period
1980-89. The operating deficit, and remaining construction requirements, were
assumed to be met half by a Government subsidy and half by a Government loan
at an interest rate of 8%.
