SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The Ghana sugar industry was started under the First Republic; it
consists of two factories at Asutsuare and Komenda, which began operations
in 1967. The two factories have their own plantations and also buy cane from
farmers. Development of the plantations and of the factories - which were
supplied, erected and financed by Poland (Asutsuare) and Czechoslovakia
(Komenda) - was badly planned and executed and management to date has been
inadequate. However, agricultural conditions for cane growing are good at
Asutsuare and reasonable at Komenda, and the technical problems at the
factories can be rectified.
ii.       The project appraised in this report aims at establishing the
industry on a viable basis through expanding cane production to meet factory
capacities; rehabilitating field and factory machinery and equipment; provid-
ing efficient management together with training of Ghanaian personnel; es-
tablishing a sound organizational structure for the industry; and strengthen-
ing the operations of the Agricultural Development Bank generally, as well
as these involving sugar farmers in particular, through technical assistance.
The project also includes a feasibility study of future expansion. The pro-
ject would be carried out over six years, 1972/73 to 1977/78.
iii.      Project costs are estimated at US$24.8 M.  The foreign exchange
costs of US$16.1 M would be financed by an IDA credit of US$15.6 M and equity
contributions from HVA-Internationaal NV(HVA), the firm which would manage
the project, of US$0.5 M. Local currency costs would be financed by Govern-
ment loans, out of earnings of the Industry, and by farmers.
iv.       A new company, Ghana Sugar Estates Limited (GHASEL), has been foimed
to take over the present sugar undertakings which are run as divisions of
the Ghana Industrial Holdings Corporation (GIHOC). Funds on-lent to GHASEL
would be at 7.25% interest and be repaid over 20 years including a grace
period of six years. An agreement has been concluded between Government,
GIHOC, GHASEL and HVA providing for management of GHASEL by HVA for a mini-
mum of five years.
v.        The overall economic rate of return is estimated at about 20%, and
the financial rate of return to GHASEL at about 8%. The project would make
a significant contribution to the economy through net foreign exchange savings
of about US$5.2 M annually as from 1978/79. The project would also provide
or continue to provide employment for some 6,700 estate and farm workers and
transform a present cash drain on Government into a profitable industry.
vi.       The project would be suitable for an IDA Credit of US$15.6 M.






GHANA
SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Ghana Government has requested IDA assistance to help finance
rehabilitation of the Ghanaian sugar industry. The industry comprises two
sugar-producing units, one at Asutsuare and one at Komenda (see Map 1), each
with plantations and factories; Asutsuare produces refined sugar and Komenda
mill-white sugar. The Asutsuare factony was built by Cekop of Poland and
the Komenda factory by Techno-Export of Czechoslovakia.
1.02      The industry was badly pianned and executed and its management has
been inadequate. Its problems have been many, including inadequate cane sup-
plies, lack of irrigation, inefficient cane harvesting and transport, and
frequent factory breakdowns. As a result, factory efficiency has been very
low, production has fallen far short of capacity and financial losses nave
been great.
1.03      However, since agricultural conditions for sugar growing are
good at Asutsuare and acceptable at Komenda and since the cane supply and
factory problems can be rectified with strong management and funds, it
is possible to produce sugar at a reasonable cost, and create a viable in-
dustry. The proposed project would provide the necessary framework and
ingredients but at the same time it is essential that Government and the
labor unions are prepared to accept measures to relate wages to productivity.
1.04      This project was first appraised in April/May 1971 and negotiations
for a Bank Loan and an IDA Credit totalling US$15.6 M were concluded in
December 1971. Following the change of Government in January 1972, finaliza-
tion of the Agreements and Board presentation were postponed till tne new
Government had formulated economic and balance of payments policies to be
followed by Ghana. A reappraisal mission was sent to Ghana in July 1972
to update the original appraisal report and incorporate the various modifica-
tions resulting from time lapse and changes in project conditions.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of a Bank appraisal mission
in April/May 1971 consisting of Messrs. A.R. Whyte and P. Grosjean (Bank);
and R. Koolhaas, J. Stegers, C. Drayer, C. Willett, A. Arben, B. Campbell
and C. Campbell (Consultants), and of a reappraisal mission in July 1972
consisting of Messrs. P. Grosjean, S. Thillairajah (Bank) and H. Naber
(Consultant). Both missions took into account the findings of a number of
previous studies including "An Evaluation of the Sugar Industry of Ghana"
prepared by Hawaiian Agronomics, Inc., an "Evaluation Report of the State
Sugar Products Corporation" by the National Investment Bank, and "An Operational
Plan for the Rehabilitation of the Ghana Sugar Industry" prepared in June
1968 by Tate and Lyle Technical Services, Ltd. and Bookers Agricultural and
Technical Services, Ltd.
1.06      The proposed IDA Credit would be the third for agriculture in
Ghana; credits for the Fisheries Project (163-CH) and the Eastern Region



- 2 -
Cocoa Project (205-GH) were made in 1969 and 1970. The Fisheries Project, to
which IDA's contribution is US$1.3 M, provides credit to fishermen for con-
struction of medium-size purse seine fishing vessels.  For various reasons in-
cluding boat construction cost increases, and other circumstances affecting
the profitability of the boats, the project had to be recast. The Government
has suggested the allocation of about $420,000 remaining in the Credit Account
for use in deep sea fishing.  IDA is also  contributing US$8.5 million toward
the cost of replanting and rehabilitating 87,000 acres of cocoa farms. Progress
of the project which started in early 1971 is satisfactory although the rehabilita-
tion component of the project currently is not being carried out due to changes
in the policy concerning cocoa pest control made by the last Government. This
matter is under discussion with Government and it is hoped that it will be
resolved in the near future.
II.   COUNTRY BAuKGROUND
A.   General
2.01       Between 1960 and 1970, Ghana's population grew from 6.7 million to
8.6 million at an average annual rate of 2.4%. The annual rate of increase
for the next 10 years is projected at 2.7-3%. The average population density
is 93 inhabitants per sq mile, but two-thirds of the population live in the
souLthern rain forest and coastal areas, and of these 1.2 million in the main
cities of Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi, Takoradi and Tema. Total population in towns
of over 5,000 inhabitants was 2.5 million in 1970 or nearly 30% of total
population compared to 23% in 1960; this growth is mainly due to migration
frcm rural areas by young people seeking better prospects than the stagnating
agricultural sector can provide. It is estimated by Government that the pro-
portion of the labor force in agriculture has decreased by about 15%; this is
causing local labor shortages in the traditional agricultural sector where
wages are low and, since industrial development has been limited, serious urban
unemployment.
2.C2       In 1970, GNP at current market prices totalled US$2,h77 M equivalent,
and the average annual increase in real terms in the period 1960-70 was 2.6%.
With a population increase of 2.4 per year, GNP per capita in 1970 was about
US4i259, equivalent to US*139 at 1960 prices, and representing only about 99% of
the 1960 level. The economy is based on the production and export of a limited
number of agricultural and mineral commodities, mainly cocoa, aluminum, timber
and gold. Agriculture including forestry and fishing provides the living for about
60  of the population and contributes about 40% of GNP. The cocoa industry
accounted for about 63% of total exports in 1970, timber and aluminum 10% and
gold 7%.
2.03       Outside the agricultural sector, the development problems facing
Ghana include an unsatisfactory level of public investment, urban unemploy-
ment, a heavy reliance on erratic returns from cocoa exports, overdependence of
the industrial sector on imported goods, and low savings compared to private
and public consumption. Despite an impressive recovery since 1966,



Ghana's balance of payments position is still weak and is expected to remain
so for some time. Partly because of the heavy debt burden, the management
of its balance of payments without jeopardizing the long-term objectives of
economic development is the major problem facing Ghana. In the short run
the present Government faces very difficult budgetary and foreign exchange
situations, to cope with which the economy has been placed on an "economic
war-footing". Imports are being severely restricted to priority goods and
the overall level reduced by about one-third in value terms. Measures are
also being taken to limit the size of the budget deficit. The exchange
rate has been changed twice, in December 1971 and in February 1972, and the
current rate is C 1.28 to the dollar. However the effective devaluation
rate is t 1.35 to the dollar, taking into account the effects of the Smith-
sonian Agreement on the currencies of Ghana's main trading partners.
2.04      Performance of the agricultural sector since 1960 has not been
satisfactory. Heavy Government investment in large capital-intensive but
technically unsound and ill-managed State farms in the early sixties disrupted
the traditional system of food production, and while these enterprises have
since been largely abandoned, agricultural production has failed to keep pace
with the increase in food demand and Ghana is now importing basic foods and
other farm-originating commodities that could be produced locally. Diversify-
ing exports out of cocoa will be a slow process but the agricultural sector
could significantly contribute to improving Ghana's balance of payments by
producing efficiently a range of agricultural commodities presently imported
such as sugar, rice, maize, vegetable oils, cotton and livestock products.
The proposed project would contribute to this strategy by replacing a
significant part of sugar imports, and the Bank is assisting Ghana to prepare
projects for the increased domestic production of other commodities.
B. Sugar Consumption and Marketing
Consumption
2.05      Sugar consumption and marketing are discussed in Annex 1.  Annual
sugar consumption has increased steadily reaching 93,800 tons in 1970 equiva-
lent to an annual consumption per capita of about 10 kg. Since the two local
factories have contributed very little to total supply, imports of sugar arc
a significant burden on Ghana's balance of payments, costing about ¢ 7 M
annually from 1961 to 1969, 9 16 M in 1970 when import controls were removed
and imports jumped to 115,000 tons, and some 0 9.2 M in 1971 when controls
were reintroduced and imports amounted to 50,000 tons. Consumption is to
be restricted to the estimated essential level of 50,000 tons in 1972.
Present Marketing System
2.06      Since the Cedi devaluation in early 1972, the distribution of sugar
in Ghana hlas been the responsibility of the Essential Commodities Committee
(ECC), established under the Commissioner for Trade. The Ghana National Trading
Corporation (GNTC) acting as ECC's agents, buys all sugar produced by Asut-
suare and Komenda and also imports the supplement required to satisfy demand.



-4-
2.07      Government has agreed with GIHOC that the Asutsuare and Komenda
factories should receive a sugar price adequate to cover cost of production
aLnd also allow a reasonable profit margin. The prices so agreed for 1972
are 0 21.53/cwt for Asutsuare and V 13.63/cwt for Komenda. GNTC buys sugar
from Asutsuare and Komenda at the lower prices that prevailed before devalua-
tion, i.e. t 10.25/cwt (USe 7.1/lb) for Asutsuare refined sugar and f 9.75/cwt
(USi 6.7/lb) for Komenda mill-white sugar. The difference between the Govern-
ient and GNTC prices represents a subsidy which is paid by Government and
which will be discontinued when consumers adjust to post-devaluation condi-
tions.
Alcohol
2.08      Alcohol produced at the Asutsuare distillery has virtually replaced
imports of crude alcohol.  In 1969-1971, an annual average of about 200,000
gallons of 960 alcohol was produced and sold at 4 3.0 per gallon to the State
Distilleries Corporation.  In the past much sugar has been used for the pro-
duction of "akpeteshie", a local alcoholic drink, which is made mainly in
rural areas. Production of akpeteshie is legal but unregulated and official
statistics of akpeteshie production are not available. It was estimated,
hDwever, that in 1970 about 18,000 tons of granulated sugar were used for
this purpose. Molasses, a by-product of sugar production, can be used for
the production of akpeteshie and currently its use for this purpose is being
sponsored under the impetus of severely restricted sugar supplies.  Molasses
can be used also for the production of food yeast for human and animal con-
sumption; the production methods are well known but the economics of produc-
ing this high protein material in Ghana have yet to be evaluated.
C. Institutions
Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation (GIHOC)
2.09      GIHOC was established in 1968 to take over 19 state corporations
including the Sugar Corporation and is responsible for the two sugar units.
G:[IOC's constitution, objectives and operations are described in Annex 2.
Briefly, GIHOC has had to fulfill the role of a conglomerate with widely
d:isparate activities, many of which were badly conceived, and has had to do
so with meagre management, staff and financial resources. It is not surprising,
therefore, that its performance, at least as regards the Sugar Products
Division, has not been good and that it has been unable to exercise effective
management guidance and control.
2.10      Sugar Products Division.  The history of the Sugar Products Division
is also described in Annex 2. Construction of Asutsuare and Komenda factories
Wlas begun in 1963 and they were commissioned in 1967. The Polish and Czech
Governments have continued to provide some technical staff and there are now
three technicians left at Asutsuare and three at Komenda. In 1968 GIHOC
appointed Associated Consulting Engineers, Ltd. (ACE) of Pakistan to manage
Kc,menda and in 1969 they also took over management at Asutsuare. ACE,



- 5 -
faced with difficult problems and constrained by lack of finance, lack of
policy direction from GIHOC, and shortage of technical staff and labor, has
not performed well at Asutsuare. It has done better at Komenda but, there
too, the efficiency of operations is well below standard. Financial manage-
ment and accounting, which ACE was not required to provide, have been totally
inadequate at both locations. The ACE contract terminated on June 30, 1972 and
no attempt was made by GIIIOC to extend it; consequently ACE staff vacated
their posts in July 1972 after handing over to GIHOC management. GIHOC
hurriedly filled the ACE vacancies by promoting inexperienced people from the
lower ranks of the Sugar Division and other industries. Only two or perhaps
three of the recent appointees have the capacity to cope with their new
responsibilities, and without strong management the future of the industry
is very dubious.
2.11      Because of the lack of complete and up-to-date accounts, it is not
possible to determine the extent of the Sugar Division's losses but these
probably amounted to about 0 7 M by the end of 1971. It is also impossible
to estimate precisely the total investment in the factories but this is pro-
bably about 0 15 M. Production has been extremely low. Only 1,200 tons at
Asutsuare and 5,100 tons at Komenda was produced in 1970 and the increase of
production in 1971 to 8,200 tons and 10,500 tons respectively was mainly due
to refining of imported raw sugar. The cost of production has been very
high - about t 285/ton at Komenda and substantially higher at Asutsuare
where production up to 1970 was only 6% of available capacity.
2.12      Future Organization and Management.  The proposed future organization
and management of the industry is described in Chapter VI. In view of GIHOC's
limited management resources, the need for cohesive management of the two
estates, and the desirability of direct Government participation in the industry,
Government has formed a new company, Ghana Sugar Estates Limited (GHASEL);
QHASEL's shares would be held directly by Government with outside minority
participation. GHASEL will be managed for a minimun period of 5 years by
HVA Internationaal, N.V. (HVA), a Dutch company well experienced in the sugar
industry.
The Agricultural Development Bank (ADB)
2.13      The two factories receive cane supplies from their own estates and
from farmers growing cane under contract to the factory. Agricultural credit
to these farmers is provided by ADB which is the main source of agricultural
credit in Ghana; details of ADB are at Annex 3. Up to March 1972, ADB had
approved 239 loans to sugar cane growers representing a total amount of
t 3.29 M or 20% of ADB's total lending. ADB's financial situation and debt
recovery were recognized as being unsatisfactory when the Cocoa Project was
appraised and led to the special credit arrangements for the project described
in Annex 3. ADB's performance since then has not improved and at the end of
March 1972, loan principal reimbursed was only about 40% of the principal due.
Overdue loans include some loans which were granted by the Bank of Ghana for
political reasons and taken over by ADB when it was established. These loans
total about 0 555,000; 0 215,000 of this was written off in 1971 and authority
has been given to write off the balance of 0 340,000 in 1972.  Formal



-6-
confirmation of these arrangements by Government would be a condition of
effectiveness. Loan recovery could be improved through tighter appraisal
of applications and through mDre efficient control and follow-up of individu-
al loans. Technical assistance is recommended to introduce these improvements,
the cost of which is provided under the project and would be financed by the
proposed IDA Credit. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that two
credit specialists with terms of reference acceptable to IDA (see Annex 3
and its Appendix) would be appointed to assist ADB, in particular to ensure
that all future ADB credit programs are viable. Assurances were also obtained
that the specialists' recommendations would be implemented following ADB and
IDA approval.
Farmers' Associations
2.14      In Asutsuare, 29 cane grower cooperatives have been registered but
these so-called "societies" are more family groups than true cooperative
societies. In 1971 there were 106 cooperative societies registered in
Komenda. These cooperatives are grouped in the Pra River Cooperative Sugar
Cane Farmers Union whose main function is to represent its members' interest
in negotiations with the sugar factory. Though on a small scale, performance
of the Union and societies in Komenda has been quite satisfactory. In April
1971, the Ghana Sugar Cane Planters' Association was formed to represent all
cane farmers.
III. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. General
3.01      The project areas are shown in Map 1 and the layout of each estate
in Maps 2 and 3. Asutsuare is about 40 mi northeast of Accra on the Volta
River below Akosombo dam which was partly financed by the Bank in 1962
(loan 310-GH). Government acquired title to 18,730 acres under the State
Lands (Akuse-Asutsuare Sugar Project) Instrument 1969, and of this about
4,100 acres are now planted to cane. While there should be no difficulty
in transferring effective title to GHASEL, such transfer for at least fifty
years, unencumbered by any land claims, would be conditions of effectiveness
of the credit. Some 250 farmers grow cane for sale to the factory on
about 5,200 acres; of which about 1,350 acres are over 20 mi from the factory
and incur excessive transport costs. The topography of both estate and
farmers' land is suitable for cane, being level or gently undulating.
3.02      Komenda is about 120 mi west of Accra on the coast.  The estate
land consists of 5,705 acres; 3,250 acres are already planted to cane and
1,250 ha would be developed under the project. The land is rented from the
local chiefs but a notice is being prepared under the Land Administration
ActF 1962 making the area available to GRASEL for an indefinite period. The
issue of such notice in favor of GHASEL would be a condition of effectiveness
of the credit and assurances were obtained during negotiations that GHASEL



-7-
would enjoy full rights to the land for at least fifty years. Some 280
farmers cultivate about 3,500 acres, of which about 200 acres are over 20 mi
from the factory.
3.03      Individual farmers' cane acreages vary greatly from 2 to over 300
acres. Holdings are smaller at Komenda, where farms smaller than 25 acres,
account for 40% of total acreage, against 16% at Asutsuare. Most farmers
hold their land on the traditional usufruct system, paying rent of 4 1.00
to 4 2.00/acre to the local chief. This system has its shortcomings but
provides adequate security of tenure.
3.04      The Asutsuare area is sparsely populated with about 6,000 people.
Because of lack of housing in the area, both estate and farmers have had
difficulty in recruiting and retaining the unskilled labor required for
agricultural work. The provision of housing for estate workers under the
project should eliminate the estate's labor problems. The limitation of
credit to new farmers at a maximum of 25 acres proposed for the project
(para 6.16) should eventually reduce the need for non-family labor, as a
holding of 25 acres can be managed by a typical family of four adult equiva-
lents. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government would
assist CHASEL in recruiting labor from other parts of Ghana and, should the
need arise, from neighboring countries.
3.05      Komenda is a settled township of some 7,000 people and the total
population in the Cape Coast district is some 250,000; thus the labor supply
is better. -
B. Climate, Soils, Pests and Diseases
3.06      Climate.  Cane growth and sucrose content depend vitally on rain-
fall, sunshine and temperature.  Annex 5 details these requirements and the
conditions at Asutsuare and Komenda. Both places are generally suitable
for cane growing. At Asutsuare estate cane will be irrigated to improve
yields, safeguard against abnormally dry years, and provide flexibility in
the planting cycle. Paragraphs 3.09 and 3.10 describe the irrigation works
to be provided at Asutsuare and the problems of the Komenda irrigation
system. Most cane farms are in the 50"-60" rainbelt, but recently some
farms totalling about 1,500 acres have been established in more marginal
rainfall areas (40"-50") south of Asutsuare. Under the project, GIIASEL
management would be required to establish the viability of proposed new
cane farms (paras 6.16 and 6.17) as a condition of ADB loans.
3.07      Soils.  The tropical black earths and alluvial soils at Asutsuare
are well suited to cane growing but the former especially need careful
management to ensure adequate drainage. The Komenda soils are generally
less fertile than at Asutsuare but good crops have been grown there in the
past and should be better in future with more experienced management.
3.08      Pests and diseases do not present a serious problem at either
estate.  Stem borer and red rot have occurred at Asutsuare but these can



- 8 -
be controlled by sound management, principally by preventing over-ripening
cf cane. Previous studies have indicated a risk of nematode infestation
at Yomenda but at present there is no evidence to suggest that this is
-a serious concern.
C. Water Supply and Irrigation Facilities
3.09      The existing and proposed water supply and irrigation systems are
discussed in Annex 6. Asutsuare estate borders the Volta River so that there
are abundant water supplies. The irrigation system was designed by Sir
William Halcrow Partners about five years ago but because of continuous
problems and delayt in completing the pumping station, no significant quan-
tity of water has been delivered to the estate. Hitherto, the Ministry of
Agriculture has been responsible for the pumping station and main canal and
in June 1969 the Ministry placed orders for five 30-cusec pumps from Kirlos-
kar of India which were delivered in 1972. The design and capacity of the
punping station was reviewed by HVA, the company that will manage GHASEL,
and found satis factory after the Ministry of Agriculture incorporated in
its plans some modifications proposed by HVA experts. The pumping station
is expected to be operational in December 1972 and fully commissioned by
mLd-1973 after a six-month trial period, well in advance of CIASEL require-
,mnts for its own irrigation program. The pumping station is also to serve
tlhe UNDP/FAO Pilot Rice Irrigation scheme and the total capacity was designed
accordingly.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the pumping
station and main canal would be efficiently maintained so as to ensure the
timely delivery of water requirements and that if, in the opinion of IDA,
following an independent consultant's study, the Ministry of Agriculture fails
to do so, responsibility for operating the system would be transferred to
GIASEL.
3.10      Water for the factory and housing at Komenda is provided by a 24-mi
canal from the River Pra; the canal was intended also to provide estate
i7rrigation through a sprinkler system. The Ministry of Agriculture is
responsible for the main supply canal and the Ghana Water and Sewage
Corporation (GWSC) for the treatment plant. A contract was let in 1967 for
the high price of about US$3 M, for a complete sprinkler irrigation system
inicluding pumping stations, but the contractor went into liquidation and
the work was not completed. A contract was let in March 1970 to another
company to complete the installation. This has not been finished; partly
this is due to the uniavailability of spare parts, but there are serious
doubts about the quality of the work done so far.  In view of the foregoing
the extremely high cost of installing and maintaining an efficient sprinkler
system, and the lack of any data on the yields under irrigation at Komenda,
it: is proposed to include only a pilot irrigation scheme under the project.
Further irrigation work would not be undertaken until the system had been
thoroughly tested and the results measured.
3.11      Factory and domestic water supplies at Komenda have been unreliable,
and the CWSC pumping station and equipment are in urgent need of overhaul.
Assurances were obtained that Government would ensure that the water supply



-9-
system is put in sound working order and adequately maintained by the Ministry
of Agriculture and GWSC.
D. Infrastructure
3.12      General transportation services are good at Komenda but more
limited at Asutsuare. Both estates are well served by roads. Power at
Komenda is supplied from the national grid and Asutsuare will shortly be
connected to the main power supply from Akosombo. Telecommunications are
deficient at both estates and the project includes provision for radio
links. Health facilities for Komenda are reasonably good with clinics at
the factory and close by, and a 300-bed hospital at Cape Coast; Asutsuare
has access to a 40-bed hospital at Akuse six miles away, but serious cases
have to be sent to Akosombo, Tema or Accra; provision is made under the
project for improving and enlarging the factory clinic.
E.  Present Production
3.13      Present cane yields and production, factory efficiency and sugar
and by-products production are discussed in Annexes 4 and 6. Due to higher
proportions of ratoon 1/ cane and poor cultivation practices yields have
dropped from 25 tons/acre in 1966 to 10 tons/acre at Asutsuare and from 29
tons/acre to 19 tons/acre at Komenda. Under the project, average yields are
expected to increase to 31 tons/acre at Asutsuare because of irrigation, and
to increase slightly to 21 tons/acre in Komenda where irrigation would be
only on a pilot scale (see para 7.01).  The recovery of sugar from cane is
abysmally low at Asutsuare at less than 4% and is only about 6% at Komenda
compared to a norm elsewhere of 9-10%.  The low recovery is due to many
factors, mainly intermittent cane supply and factory inefficiency and should
improve to 9% under the Project (para 7.02).
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      Objectives.  The objectives of the project would be to increase
Ghana's sugar production and make the industry efficient and economic, thus
reducing imports and eliminating the present heavy losses sustained in
domestic production. The project also provides for a study to determine
the feasibility of further expansion, and technical assistance for strength-
ening ADB.
1/   The planting cycle lasts four years with three ratoon crops (regrowth
of stubble) following the plant cane crop.



- 10 -
4.02      Definition.  The project would be carried out from 1972/73 through
1977/78 and would comprise:
(a) Asutsuare
(i)   Expansion of estate cane acreage from about 4,100 to
about 6,400 and farmers' cane from about 5,200 to about
7,575 acres;
(ii)   Replanting of some 4,100 acres of estate cane and some
5,200 acres of farmers' cane;
(iii)   Irrigation works for all estate cane;
(iv)   Rehabilitation, modification and additions to cane
tra^sport and field equipment; cane yard; mill;
refinery; workshops and laboratory;
(v)   Completion of partly-built houses and provision of new
housing and training, health and social facilities for
management, staff and labor;
(vi)   Provision of vehicles for management and staff; and
(vii)   Provision of extension services by GHASEL and seasonal
and medium-term (four year) credit to farmers through
ADB.
(b) Komenda
(i)   Expansion of estate cane acreage from about 3,250 to
about 4,500 and farmers' cane from about 3,500 to
about 5,000 acres;
(ii)   Replanting of some 3,250 acres of estate cane and 3,500
acres of farmers' cane;
(iii)   Pilot scheme for irrigating some 600 acres of estate
cane;
(iv)   Rehabilitation, modification and additions to cane
transport and field equipment; cane yard; mill; work-
shops; and laboratory;
(v)   Completion of existing houses and provision of new
housing and training, health and social facilities for
management, staff and labor;
(vi)   Provision of vehicles for management and staff; and
(vii)   Provision of extension services by GHASEL and seasonal
and medium-term (four year) credit to farmers through
ADB.



- 11 -
(c)  Study to determine the feasibility of further expansion at
Asutsuare, Komenda, or elsewhere, taking into account future
consumption and quality requirements, and by-product utili-
zation.
(d)  Technical Assistance to ADB in implementing improved credit
accounting and control; reviewing its present financial
position; and advising on credit policies and procedures.
4.03      Ghana Sugar Estates Limited (GHASEL) was formed in November 1971
to take over the existing undertakings at Asutsuare and Komenda. HVA, a
Dutch management company, has been appointed to manage GHASEL for at least
five years, to train Ghanaian personnel on-the-job and overseas, and to
provide back-up services.
B. Detailed Features
4.04      Field Development Program.  The field development program is based
on achieving as rapidly as practical cane deliveries of 2,500 tons/ day at
Asutsuare and 1,000 tons/day at Komenda, these being the quantities required
to meet factory capacities (para 4.10). The development schedule, which is
detailed in Annex 4, assumes that farmers at Asutsuare would add progressively
1,000 acres in 1972/73, 1,000 acres in 1973/74, and 375 acres in 1975, bring-
ing their total to 7,575 acres; and that at Komenda they would add 1,500 acres
in the three years 1972/73 to 1974/75, bringing the total acreage of farmers'
cane to 5,000. The balance of the cane supplies would be met by increasing
the acreage of estate cane at Asutsuare by 2,300 acres and at Komenda by
1,250 acres over the years 1973/74 to 1976/77 and introducing irrigation.
The replanting program would be carried out over the years 1972/73 to 1977/78.
4.05      Hitherto farmer demand for more cane acreage has been strong and
applications have already been made for the assumed 1972/73 expansion. how-
ever, the demand probably is due partly to the excessively easy credit facilities
available up to now and, although some farmers are self-financed (16% at
Asutsuare and 32% at Komenda), the tighter credit facilities proposed for the
future may reduce farmer enthusiasm. Should this happen, the slack would be
taken up at Asutsuare by expanding estate acreage, and at Komenda through
acquisition of additional estate land. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that Government would cause to be made available sufficient
additional estate land suitable for cane growing if this were required
to meet factory capacities.
4.06      Cane Cultivation.  Field preparation, cane planting, and cultivation
at Asutsuare have been unsatisfactory both for estate and farmer cane. The
faults include inadequate tillage and drainage; poor germination; poor weed
control and haphazard fertilizer use. Annex 4 details the problems and sets
out the practices to be followed in future. Practices at Komenda are better
but weed control, drainage and fertilizer application need to be improved.
Varieties at Asutsuare and Komenda are satisfactory but only one main variety
is used at Komenda. Cane trials would be instituted at both estates to test
new imported varieties under local conditions.



- 12 -
4.07      Irrigation.  All estate cane at Asutsuare would be irrigated as
described in Annex 5, and provision is made in project costs for modifications
to the main pumping station, overhead irrigation equipment for Inspectorate 1
and for additional pumping equipment and works on Inspectorates 2 through 6
where mainly furrow irrigation would be used.  However, the actual irrigation
system and pumping equipment and specifications cannot be determined until
Eurther studies have been carried out by the new management.
4.08      In view of the serious doubts over the Komenda irrigation system
(para 3.10), only one pumping station would be operated initially on a trial
basis for irrigating about 600 acres. If this proves satisfactory and the
iincreased yields justify the capital and recurrent costs, and if additional
cane is required to supply the factory, irrigation would be extended.
4.09      Cane Handling and Transport.  Present cane cutting, loading and
transport methods are highly inefficient. Output per man is very low at less
t;han half a ton a day cut and loaded (2 - 3 tons elsewhere in the world), and
utilization of transport equipment is poor. Future methods are described in
Annex 5. Besides improvements in equipment and organization, two important
innovations would be made: mechanical loaders would be used, and payment to
cutters would be on a piece-work rather than the present daily basis. The
seven cane loaders - crawler tractors fitted with front end loaders - would
be used on the two estates and would relieve acute operational bottleneck
caused by stacking cane trailers by hand. In addition, the project provides
for two cane-receiving stations in farmer cane areas at Asutsuare. The roads
serving the project areas and the estates are good and the only additions
required are about 14 mi of minor roads at Asutsuare and 4 mi at Komenda.
Details are at Annex 5.
4.10      Factories.  The present processes, and the improvements, modifica-
tions and additions under the project to cane yards, mills and processing
plants, are detailed in Annex 6. They are designed for an annual output
of about 30,000 tons of refined sugar at Asutsuare, assuming a crushing
season of 130 working days, and of about 15,000 tons a year at Komenda of
mill white, assuming a crushing season of 163 working days.
4.11      Expenditure and production forecasts for Asutsuare are based on
the assumption that the new equipment would be installed in time for the
1973/74 crushing season.
4.12      Planned expenditure at Asutsuare is based on replacement of much
of the present milling and refining equipment which is unsatisfactory; the
distillery, which distills at present alcohol from Asutsuare and Komenda
molasses, needs little expenditure. Planned expenditure at Komenda has been
kept to a minimum as existing equipment is basically sound and it is assumed
that Government would release foreign exchange for spares from Czechoslovakia.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that foreign exchange would be
made available or other measures taken to allow import of spares promptly as
required. The alternative to continuing with the present equipment would be
to replace it with that from Western suppliers; this would be prohibitively
expensive.



- 13 -
4.13      Housing and Social Infrastructure.  There are 23 completed houses
at Asutsuare for management and staff together with a 48-room hostel. Due
to lack of funds, a further 30 units at Asutsuare and 26 houses at Komenda
have not been completed. For Asutsuare the project provides for completion
of 30 junior staff houses and a clinic; and construction of 11 new senior
staff and 64 new junior staff houses, a club, a training center, rest house,
and a hostel for apprentices. Junior staff houses will also be constructed
at Komenda and labor housing will be constructed at Asutsuare and Komenda.
Details are at Annex 7.
4.14      Studies.  By June 30, 1974, a study should be completed on the
feasibility of further expansion either at Asutsuare or Komenda, or possibly
establishing a new complex elsewhere. The study should include an assessment
of the domestic market requirements for sugar and by-products and recommenda-
tions for utilization of by-products. Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that Government would engage a firm acceptable to IDA on conditions
and with terms of reference acceptable to IDA to carry out such a study.
Draft terms of reference are at Annex 8.
4.15      Research.  Applied research is badly needed.  The Asutsuare agrono-
mist to be provided by the management firm would be responsible for programs
of varietal selection from clones imported from sugar cane breeding stations
in other countries, plant nutrition based on field trials and soil and foliar
analysis, and for determining the consumptive water requirements of cane at
Asutsuare and Komenda. He would also be required to screen herbicides and
insecticides for use on the plantation and initiate programs for their use
commercially. In specialized areas, such as entomology and plant pathology,
he would make use of the back-up services of the management firm or the
Ministry of Agriculture as the need arose.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS

5.02      Agricultural Development includes the costs of new and replanted
areas up to harvest; management includes full fees and expatriate staff
salaries for the six years of development at the end of which the Asutsuare
factory in addition to Komenda would be in full production; administration
comprises housing, vehicles, and office equipment. Price contingencies are
provided at 6% per annum (compounded) from 1973/74 through 1977/78. A flat
5% on all project costs has also been included as a physical contingency.
The total provision for contingencies amounts to 15% of project costs; this
is considered adequate in view of the fact that some 65% of expenditure would
be incurred in the first three years. Project costs exclude import duties
and surcharge on capital goods as assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the project would be exempt from such levies during the project period.
Project costs, however, include a provision of 0 1.4 M (US$1.1 M) for income
tax payable on expatriate management staff salaries, and during negotiations
assurances were obtained that if this is not sufficient, any additional
income tax liabilities would be transferred to GHASEL and paid as and when
GHASEL's financial position permits.
B. Proposed Financing

Farmers                                               0.226
Total                                     24.790
5.04      The foreign exchange costs of US$16.1 M would be financed by the
proposed IDA Credit of US$15.6 M and by cash equity contributions by HVA
totalling US$0.5 M. HVA's equity subscription would be contributed to GHASEL
over three years, in one installment of US$200,000 and two of US$150,000.
The IDA funds on-lent to GHASEL by Government and amounting to US$14.4 M
(O 18.5 M) would bear interest at 7.25% per annum and be for a term of 20
years including 6 years grace. IDA funds used to finance farmer credits
US$0.87 M (¢ 1.1 M) would be onlent by Government to ADB in installments at
an interest rate of 6-1/2% per annum and each installment would be repayable
over six years; onlending to farmers by ADB would be at a minimum of 9%
per annum (see para 6.16). A condition of effectiveness of the Credit would
be the conclusion of appropriate relending agreements between Govermnent,
GHASEL and ADB satisfactory to IDA.



- 16 -
5.05      GHASEL's local currency costs of C 10.7 M would be met by long-
term Government loans totalling C 8.2 M, which would be lent concurrently
with and on the same terms as the on-lent IDA funds, and in addition by
self-generated funds of C 2.5 M.  Short-term loans in a sum of t 3 M would
be required by GHASEL in the first two years to meet operating deficits
and this would be repaid together with interest at 7-1/4% per annum before
the end of the project disbursement period.  The remaining local currency
costs would be met by Government and farmers.
5.06      Thus total Government loans to GHASEL would amount to e 29.7 M
consisting of long-term loans amounting to C 8.2 M, short-term loans C 3 M,
and IDA funds onlent ¢ 18.5 M.
5.07      Existing assets at Asutsuare and Konenda to be valuecd before
June 30, 1973 would be transferred to GHASEL when the IDA Credit became
effective (Vesting Day) in exchange for equity shares up to a maximum of
C 9.5 M to be held by Government. Should the value of the net assets exceed
C 9.5 M, which seems unlikely, the excess would be satisfied by the issue of
deferred shares which would not have voting rights nor rank for dividends
unitil ordinary shares had been paid C 4/share in any financial year. Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations. Should, however, the
valuation fall short of t 9.5 M, Government would contribute cash for the
shortfall so as to maintain its equity participation at C 9.5 M. It would
be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit that existing assets at
Asutsuare and Komenda had been transferred to GLIASEL and that their valua-
tion, to be completed by June 30, 1973, would have started to be implemented.
5.08      It is proposed that IDA should finance retroactively project costs
incurred for QHASEL including HVA management costs and for ADB technical
assistance that would be incurred prior to signature of the IDA credit. It
is estimated that such retroactive financing would amount to US$300,000.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
5.09      Procurement of equipment and materials totalling about US$8.2 M
wcould be by international competitive bidding; these would comprise factory
eq[uipment US$3.5 M; field and administrative vehicles and equipment
US$3.7 M; and fertilizer US$1.0 M. Civil works procurement totalling
US$5.7 M, comprising irrigation US$0.8 M, factories US$1.4 M, and housing
US$3.5 M would be by international tender, but local firms, which include
subsidiaries of overseas companies, are expected to win most of the contracts.
Any items below US$5,000 would not be subject to tender. Management and
Technical Assistance costs would amount to US$7.6 M. The balance of US$3.3 M
represents planting and replanting and other local currency costs. Ghana
is not a party to any preferential tariff agreement.
5.10      Estimates of disbursements are at Annex 10.  The credit would be
disbursed against:



- 17 -
(a) cif costs of factory, field and administrative equipment,
fertilizer and vehicles - US$6.637 M. If items are procured
locally disbursements would be against 80% of the cost;
(b) 100% of management fees - US$1.68 M;
(c) 55% of expatriate salaries and expenses - US$2.565 M;
(d) 55% of civil works on factory, irrigation and housing -
US$2.211 M;
(e) 60% of ADB credit to farmers for new planting and replanting
excluding fertilizer covered under (a) above - US$0.596 M;
and
(f)  foreign exchange costs of the expansion study - US$0.045 M
and technical assistance to ADB - US$0.150 M.
An unallocated amount of US$1,716 M would meet contingencies on the above
items. Disbursement would be against import documentation or certificates
submitted by GHASEL Managing Director, ADB Managing Director, or the Ministry
of Industries (for the study) as appropriate. For disbursements made against
certified expenditures, documentation would not be submitted for review as
a matter of course but would be retained by the respective entities for
inspections by IDA supervision missions. Any undisbursed IDA funds due to
cost savings would be cancelled.
D. Accounts and Audits
5.11      Project staffing provides for adequate accounting staff for GHASEL
under an expatriate financial controller. Assurances were obtained that
GRASEL accounts would be audited by an independent firm of auditors accept-
able to IDA, and submitted to IDA no later than four months after the close
of GHASEL's financial year, which is assumed to run from October 1 to
September 30.
5.12      ADB's accounts are presently audited by Amorin, Agyeman, Ayew & Co.,
a firm of chartered accountants in Accra. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that ADB's accounts, audited by a firm satisfactory to IDA,
would be submitted to IDA within four months of the close of ADB's financial
year.

VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Industry Structure
6.01      GfASEL was formed on November 17, 1971 to take over the existing
sugar divisions of GIHOC and to manage the industry in future. A summary
of GHASEL's Regulations, which have been approved by IDA, are at Annex 11.
6.02      A Sugar Industry Committee would be established by Govermnent to
monitor the industry, and to advise Government among other issues on:
(a) the cane price paid to farmers and quality grading and
premium systems;
(b)  the price paid to CHASEL for sugar and premiums and
discounts for different qualities; and
(c) all matters affecting the sugar industry, including
duties on sugar and alcohol.
6.03      The Committee would consist of representatives from the Ministries
of Finance, Agriculture and Trade, and Industries, the Ghana Sugar Cane
P:Lanters' Association, GHASEL, ADB and two other members outside Government
nominated by the Minister responsible for Industries. The Committee would
have power to co-opt, but co-opted members would not vote. The Minister of
Industries would appoint a full time Secretary for the Committee. The
Clairman would be the Minister responsible for Industries or his representa-
t;ive. During negotiations assurances were obtained that such a Committee
would be established with membership and terms of reference satisfactory
to IDA. The establishment of the Committee would be a condition of
effectiveness.
B. Management, Staff and Labor
6.04      GHASEL's Board of Directors would consist of seven members (Annex
11). The Chairman is the Commissioner for Industries, and the Managing
D,irector will be nominated by HVA. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tiLons that, during the first 10 years of the project, appointments to the
post of Managing Director and Financial Controller, the latter is not on the
Board, would be subject to IDA approval.
6 05      Government, GIHOC, GHASEL and HVA have concluded a Management
and Subscription Agreement, approved by IDA which provides for management
of GaASEL by HVA for a period of five years, and subscription by HVA of
US$500,000 to GHASEL's share capital. Details of the agreement, including
the services, staff and facilities to be provided by HVA together with a
chart of the Industry organization, are at Annex 11. Information about HVA



- 19 -
and its experience in the sugar industry is given in Annex 11, Appendix 2.
Under the Agreement HVA will take over full management on the Effective
Date until when GIHOC will manage the two estates. Meanwhile, HVA will
proceed with design and ordering of equipment, and such matters as staff
recruitment and will advise GIHOC/GHASEL on estate operations generally. A
condition of credit effectiveness would be submission by GHASEL to IDA of
a Program of Work for the project development period; HVA have undertaken
to prepare such a program.
6.06      The large number of expatriates required to manage GHASEL - 28 at
Asutsuare and 12 at Komenda besides the Managing Director and Financial
Controller - is dictated by the high degree of managerial and technical
skills needed in a sugar industry. There are no Ghanaians with experience
of an efficient sugar industry and, due to the past poor management and
lack of training, those now employed are not qualified to fill more senior
posts. The cost of expatraite staff is very high but is essential if the
industry is to be made viable and Ghanaians trained to manage it.
6.07      HVA's managment fee has been fixed for a period of five years
after which the contract will be renegotiated. The fee will cover the cost
of HVA services including all charges on account of the Managing Director
and the cost other than expenses of visiting experts. The fee for the
period till July 1, 1973 will be on an agreed cost plus basis; thereafter,
the renumeration will comprise three elements: a fixed fee of US$200,000
in the first year reducing to US$100,000 in the fifth year, plus a percentage
of the value of sugar production and, from the third year, a percentage of
net profit. Total remuneration is estimated at about US$300,000 per year. In
addition, HVA will receive a fee of 4% of the value of specialized equipment
for which procurement is handled by the HVA head office - this is included
in project costs.
6.08      Training.  Training policies and procedures would follow HVA's
established methods, which have proved successful in Ethiopia and Tanzania.
They would be aimed at the replacement of expatriates by local staff, and
semi-annual reports on progress would be supplied to GHASEL's Board. A
Training Manager would be responsible for programs and would be assisted by
two Shop Floor Training Officers for factory and transport, and field engi-
neering.
6.09      Training would be distinguished between "staff" and "nonstaff".
Staff training would be implemented by on-job training of suitably qualified
personnel (B.Sc. or B.A. degree level) followed by study assignments
abroad, including periods of work in sugar industries elsewhere, for periods
of up to nine months. Nonstaff training would be conducted at a Training
Center and would include up-grading courses for artisans; practical
courses for school graduates; training courses to provide qualified foremen;
and advanced training courses for promotion to staff. Syllabi in use
elsewhere by IIVA would be made available to GHASEL.
6.10      Labor  The existing agreement (Annex 11) between GIHOC and its
labor is unsuitable for an agricultural industry and has contributed to low



- 20 -
productivity and management problems. The agreement would not be assumed
by CHASEL and QIASEL's management would have powers to negotiate a new
agreement.
C. Cane Farmers
6.11      Government has encouraged the development of cane farming, and
Glana's cane farmers play an important part in the industry, at present
providing over 50% of cane supplies. Credit has been readily available but
laxly administered, and cane prices have been reasonably remunerative, with
the factory providing free transport within a 20-mile radius. On the other
hand, extension services have been inadequate through lack of personnel
and vehicles, and farmers have received little technical assistance. As a
consequence cane farming has a far from adequate technical and financial
base and requires rationalization if it is not to collapse. Under the project
siteps to rationalize cane farming would be introduced.
6.12      Land Clearing and Preparation.  Hitherto farmers have obtained
michinery and tractor services from the Mechanization Division of the Minis-
try of Agriculture at subsidized rates and from private contractors whose
activities are growing. The Ministry plans to phase out the Mechanization
DLvision. To stabilize contractors' charges, which are now high, GHASEL
would provide a part of the land preparation services required. The project
includes two heavy tractors and implements for this purpose which would be
capable of preparing about 400 acres a year.
6.13      Cane Transport.  Management would introduce a scheme whereby
farmers within five miles of the factory or of a cane receiving station to be
established under the project would become responsible for delivering cane
themselves and would be compensated accordingly. These measures would reduce
the present high cost of cane transport to the factory.
6.,14     Cane Farmers' Payment.  At present GIHOC pays farmers a flat price
of ¢ 7.20 a ton less a transport charge of t 0.04/ton/mile, which probably
is well below cost, for distances over 20 miles. GIHOC contracts with
farmers to purchase their cane on a cutting and delivering schedule, determined
br the estate, and proceeds are paid to farmers, cooperatives or ADB as the
case may be when the farm acreage has been fully cut and delivered. Consider-
ation is being given to increasing the price to between t 8.00 and ¢ 10.00
and at the same time charging t 0.04/ton/mile for all transport whatever
the distance. Report calculations assume a net average price to the farmer
o,E t 8.50/ton, i.e., a gross price of t 9.00, less transport costs for 12.5
mLles haul to factory. As shown in Annex 12 this price ensures a reasonably
efficient farmer an adequate income, and it is not believed that a higher
price is presently justified. In future, cane and ex-factory prices will
be based on recommendations of the Sugar Committee (para 6.03). Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that IDA would be informed of any change
in cane producer prices.



- 21 -
6.15      Extension Services.  Extension services would continue to be
provided by the estates and would be improved under the project by the
addition of two senior officers to assist the Cane Farming Liaison Officer.
Extension agents would be provided with transport and would be responsible
for dissemination of technical information to farmers; ensuring that cane
cultivation standards are maintained and improved, that only authorized
varieties are planted; and organizing, with the assistance of the Plantation
Agronomist, field trips to the plantation where fertilizer use, weed control,
etc. would be demonstrated. The Plantation Agronomist would visit and advise
any farmers with technical problems. Both the estates and cane farmers
have had difficulties in obtaining fertilizers. Up to the present time the
only fertilizer available has been that supplied by the Ministry of Agricul-
ture under its fertilizer subsidy scheme. Most of these fertilizers have
been supplied under bilateral aid and supplies had been restricted. During
negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that GMASEL would be
responsible for importing its own and canefarmers' fertilizer requirements.
Credit
6.16      The present position on credits to sugar farmers is highly unsatis-
factory.  The poor debt recovery (55% of principal due actually reimbursed)
is due to the inefficiency of the industry, to ADB's lax lending procedures
and to ADB's lack of effective control. In order to ensure that credit is
made available only to viable farmers and that it is properly disbursed and
administered, ADB would finance the establishment of 25 acres of cane or less
only and 20% annual increases up to a maximum of 20 acres in any one year
thereafter. The loan would bear interest of at least 9% per annum with
reimbursement over 4 years and would cover the cost of 80% of land clearing,
seedlings, fertilizers and 80% of the manpower required for harvesting.
Maintenance operations to be carried out by the farm family would not be
financed by the loan but during the first year of development the farmers
would be entitled to an allowance of up to 0 12.00/acre to be disbursed in
two equal installments, the first after land clearance and the second after
completion of weeding. Agreement on interest rate was reached during nego-
tiations, and at the same time assurances were obtained that, except as IDA
shall otherwise agree, those procedures, as detailed in Annex 3, paragraph
25, would apply to all future sugar credits according to individual loan
agreements with farmers, the form of which would be approved by IDA. As-
surances were also obtained that ADB would keep records satisfactory to IDA
of sugar credits, separating those made before from those made after signa-
ture of the credit. It would be a condition of effectiveness that ADB and
GRASEL had entered into an agreement satisfactory to IDA, guaranteeing the
purchase of sugar cane from ADB's borrowers, specifying the technical
assistance and services to be provided by GHASEL to ADB's borrowers, and
organizing the loan recovery administration.
6.17      With the above arrangements, together with payments for cane being
made to ADB rather than to farmers, the improved factory efficiency under
the project, and improvement in ADB's administration (see para 2.13),
it is expected that administration and repayment of sugar credits would be



- 22 -
satisfactory. To ensure that the cane farming sector is properly supported,
however, assurances were obtained during negotiations that by i'ovember 1,
1973, CHASEL and ADB would have made a full study of the sector and prepared
detailed proposals for the support and future development of the sector,
and that these proposals, if acceptable to IDA, would be implemented. If
all the farmers taking part in the planned outgrowers' acreage expansion
were to borrow from ADB, ADB development loans to farmers would amount to
C1.8 M over the period 1972/73 - 1977/78. This amount would represent 86%
of the total cost to the farmers and IDA would finance 70% or C 1.28 M of
these ADB loans.
VII. PRODUCrION, PRICES, GSC FINANCIAL RESULTS,
FARM INCOME AND GOVERNMENT REVENUES
A. Production
7.01      For report calculations it is estimated that average annual cane
yields per acre at Asutsuare will increase from the 1971/72 levels of 10 tons
and 15 tons for estate and farmers respectively to 31 tons and 20 tons by
1978/79. At Komenda in the same period, only a small increase in estate
yields is forecast, from 19 to 21 tons, and farmers yields are expected to
fall from 21 tons at present to 17 tons reflecting the decrease which will
occur in the proportion of plant cane. These yield estimates are conservative
and should be exceeded as higher yielding varieties are introduced as a
result of the cane trials to be conducted under the project. By 1978/79, the
Ghana industry's average annual yield for estates and outgrowers should be
21.1 tons cane/acre comparing with average yields in 1968/69 for Africa -
25.3 tons, Latin America 19.9 tons, Far East 18.8 tons, Australia 32.3 tons,
and the Philippines 19.9 tons 1/.
7.02      Total cane supplies are estimated to increase from 178,500 tons in
1971/72 to 486,000 tons in 1978/79; sugar production from 10,800 tons to
43,700 tons as a result of an improvement in sugar recovery to 9%; and alcohol
production from 250,000 gallons to 676,000 gallons. The sugar recovery rate
is conservative and compares with 10-11% achieved by other producers.
7.03      Estimated total domestic sugar production in 1977/78 of 43,700 tons
compares with demand estimates for 1978 of 145,000 tons of which
87,000 tons would be in the form of granulated sugar which the two estates
produce (Annex 1).

B. Market and Prices
World Market
7.04      As outlined by the Bank Economics Department (see EC/0/72-104 of
August 31, 1972) the conditions of the international sugar market have
significantly changed in the early 1970's as compared to the situation which
prevailed in the 1960's. Most of the fifties and sixties were characterized
by an excess of production over consumption, sugar surpluses, and low prices
resulting in low returns on 4nvestment. Consequently existing investments
were neglected and no significant new investments made. As a result, it
is believed now that production will lag behind consunption over the next
decade and that in order to meet annual consumption requirements estimated
at 101 million tons in 1981-83, the world sugar industry needs to expand
its capacity by some 30 million tons. As a result of declining world sugar
surpluses annual average prices on the free world market have already
increased from US43.2/lb in 1969 to USg4.5 in 1971 and the price in the
first half of 1972 averaged US47.7/lb. The Bank's Economics Department
forecasts that in 1981/83 a price range of USJ6.0 to 7.5/lb of raw sugar
fob Carribean is likely to materialize.  More details on the world market
for sugar are given in Annex 1. The International Sugar Organization has
been informed of the project and has commented that it expects world
consumption in 1975 to be some 5.5%, and world production some 3.3%
higher than the Bank Economics Department estimates.
7.05      For the economic analysis of the project, it is assumed that over
the project life the Ghana import price for sugar would be equivalent to
USg6.0/lb (US$132/ton) of raw sugar fob Carribean ports in terms of
constant 1972 dollars corresponding to a Ghana import price of USg8.3/lb
(US$183/ton) of refined white sugar.
Domestic Prices
7.06      GHASEL should be able to operate profitably at an average ex-factory
price of 0 250/ton which would be equivalent to an Accra warehouse cost of
0 260/ton. During the early years of the project at least a price advantage
of about 2.5% for local over imported sugar probably would be needed to
induce Ghanaian traders to buy local rather than imported sugar if present
sugar import restrictions are lifted. At a projected world price of
USU6.00/lb (See Annex 1, Table 1) the warehouse cost of imported sugar
would be ¢ 242/ton without the present import duty of 0 44.80/ton, or
0 286.80 with duty. Consequently, the present import duty which is low
compared with several other African countries would be more than adequate
to protect the local industry.
7.07      The present duty of 0 44.80 per ton is equivalent to 20% of se
forecast cost of imported sugar. It would appear that the duty cou.L> 'oe
reduced to 12% and still be adequate to protect the industry. An import
duty at the latter level is not considered excessive in view of Governmenc's
legitimate development aspirations and even more important in the light of



- 24 -
the Government's policy of effecting a reduction in the import level through
a system of import licenses. As described in para 8.01, in view of the
imblance between domestic and international costs and prices, the economic
cost of imported sugar is possibly 30% higher than its local cash cost; this
is more than the minimum level of protection needed by the industry. Govern-
ment does not intend to change the present duty structure, but has stated
that should it not operate satisfactorily it would take alternative measures
including either import licensing on a temporary basis or establishing a
Government monopoly of sugar through a Sugar Board following an arrangement
similar to the present Essential Connmodities Comnmittee. Assurances were
obtained that Government would consult with IDA before adopting such measures.
7.08      GIHOC now sells its 960 alcohol at 03.00 per gallon to the State Dis-
tilleries Corporation. It has been assumed that the increased production
resulting from the project would be absorbed by the local market at a lower
price of ¢2.00/gallon which is used in the financial analysis. For the
economic analysis, it is assumed that total project production growing at
some 10% per annum over the next 10 years up to 673,000 gallons in 1981/82
-will be absorbed by the State Distilleries Corporation and the expanding
local chemical industry. Therefore in project economic analysis an import
substitution price of US$1.40/gallon has been used, equivalent to the current
international price of alcohol.
C. GHASEI Financial Results
7.09      Statements of GHASEL's projected income and expenditures, balance
sheets, sources and application of funds, together with calculation of
:financial rates of return for GHASEL are given in Annex 13. The statements
are based on the assumptions given in the appendix to Table 3.
7.10      Income and Expenditure.  The Asutsuare Statement shows a loss
(before interest) in 1972/73 of 41.78 M changing to a profit of about t1 M
:Ln 1975/76 and increasing to $2.14 X by 1977/78. The Komenda Statement
shows a loss in 1972/73 of O306,000 changing into a profit of ¢368,000
:Ln 1974./75 and increasing to over p600,000 in 1978/79. Management salaries,
together with relevant income tax (see para 5.02) and oncost have been
apportioned between capital and revenue in the proportion which annual
production bears to full production capacity of the factories. The amount
So capitalized has been amortized at 5% per annum. It is assumed that
GHASEL would be exempt from duty an fuel oil and assurances to this effect
were obtained during negotiations.  GHASEL also could be exempt from income
tax on profits for a maximum period of 8 years but no liabilities would
accrue during the first 15 years or so because of accumulated tax losses
that would be available. The Consolidated Income Statement shows a small
ret surplus after interest for the first time in 1976/77 and this surplus
reaches the )2 M mark in 1981/82.  The return on capital employed before
interest is estimated to be about 6% in 1975/76, steadily rising to over 10%



- 25 -
in 1978/79.  The internal financial rate of return, assuming V 9.5 M to be
the estimated value of existing assets to be vested in GRASEL (see para 5.07),
would be 4.3%. Both Asutsuare and Komenda estates have been incurring con-
tinuous losses and except for the proposed investments would continue to
make substantial financial losses in future. It is practical therefore to
consider the existing assets to be vested in GRASEL as sunk costs in which
case the internal financial rate of return would be about 8%.
7.11      Sources and Application of Funds.  GRASEL would be obliged to
resort to short-term borrowings from Government in order to meet cash
deficits resulting from the heavy losses anticipated in 1972/73 and 1973/74.
These short-term borrowings estimated to total 0 3 M could be repaid in full
from funds generated during 1975/76 and 1976/77. The long-term loan of
4 8.2 M from Government would be required in addition to 0 18.5 onlent from
the IDA Credit proceeds (see para 5.06).  Some 0 1.7 M out of the 4 8.2 M
could be repaid to Government in 1977/78. Thereafter GHASEL would be in a
position to meet an annual debt service commitment of ¢ 3.4 M towards debt
service until 1987/88 when the annual payments would be reduced to 0 1.7 M.
By 1991/92 GHASEL would have liquidated all its indebtedness to Government
in addition to accumulating a revenue surplus of about 0 4 M.  The annual
cash surplus from 1991/92 could be in the range of 4 1.75 M.
7.12      The projected balance sheets have been prepared on the assumption
that the existing assets of Asutsuare and Komenda would be vested in GHASEL
in exchange for equity at a value of ¢ 9.5 M (see para 5.07). The debt/equity
ratio during the first ten years would be considered high by commercial
standards. However, the high proportion of debts is justifiable in view of
the fact that the Government loans are to be liquidated in annual installmen.s,
and the debt service coverage of 1.5 to 2.0 times (see Annex 13, Table 4)
after the project disbursement period is adequate. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that GHASEL without prior approval of IDA would neither
incur debts during the project period in excess of the long-term and short-
term loans totalling 0 29.7 M (US$23.2 1O (see para 5.06) estimated to be
required to finance the project nor thereafter unless debt service chargL.
on long-term debts, including those now proposed, would be covered at least
1.5 times by net cash earnings, and on short-term debts would not exceed
20% of gross profits.
7.13      GHASEL's financial position would be affected by two main factol-i:
the ex-factory price for sugar, which would depend largely on the efficiency
of its operations, and the prices paid to farmers for cane which to some
extent are beyond GHASEL's control. In order to ensure that GHASEL would be
able to maintain a sound financial position and meet debt service charges,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government and GHASEL would
seek to maintain an annual return on capital employed (including valuation
of existing assets) of not less than 8% after 1977/78 and, without limiting
the technical and financial efficiency obligations of GHASEL, the prices
for GHASEL's products would be adjusted to achieve such return. The return
would be derived by relating net income after depreciation and taxes on
profits (if any), but before interest, to the value of net fixed assets in
operation plus net current assets (excluding cash) at the beginning of the
year.



- 26 -
D. Farmer Income
7.14      Under the project farmers growing 25 acres of sugar with ADB
assistance would be required to contribute about 4 360 or 14% to development
costs in the first year and over the next four years would average a net
income after debt service of about t 1,850 (Annex 12, Table 2). Debt
service would be adequately covered by gross income twice. Assuming that
Che farm family consists of six persons, annual income per capita would
be about 0 310 (US$242) which compares with an average income in the rural
sector of about 0 190 in 1970 (US$148).
E. Government Revenues
7.15      It is difficult to assess the impact of the project on Government
finances as the levels of import duties with and without the project cannot
be forecast. However, it is assumed that as a consequence of the project
Covernment would lose the import duties and charges on 36,700 tons of sugar
annually amounting to 0 1.6 million. On the other hand, the current loss of
about 0 2 M annually incurred in maintaining the industry would be replaced by
CHASEL surpluses of 4 2.0 M (after interest) which together with additional
income taxes on salaries, wages and local excise duties on sugar and alcohol
of some 0 1.0 million would result in a net gain to Government of about 0 3.4 M
a year (excluding interest receipts). If it is assumed that Government were
to shut down Asutsuare as an alternative to its rehabilitation, the net gain
would be reduced to about 0 1.7 million.
VIII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
8.01      The major benefit of the project would be the expansion of sugar
production in Ghana, at an economic cost, with resulting substantial net
foreign exchange savings on sugar imports estimated at some US$5.2 M annually
as from 1978/79. The economic rate of return on the project as a whole is
estimated at about 20%; for Asutsuare it would be 17% and for Komenda 31%
(for details see Annex 14). The calculation for Asutsuare assumes that past
investment is a sunk cost and has no market value, that without the project,
production would cease and takes into account all future costs and benefits
of project production; the calculation for Komenda is based on comparing the
costs of rehabilitation with the incremental benefits generated by such
rehabilitation. Other important assumptions are:
(a)  an import price of refined sugar of USJ8.3/lb over the
project life (para 7.05);
(b) an opportunity cost of labor of 0 0.75 per man-day against
an official minimum wage cost of 0 1.00 (Annex 14, para 6);
(c)  an import substitution price for alcohol equivalent to
US$1.40 per gallon (see para 7.08); and



- 27 -
(d) a shadow rate for foreign exchange of 0 1.70 per US$
compared to the official rate of 4 1.28 (Annex 14,
para 7).
The sensitivity analysis of the rate of return related to cost increases
and price variations given at Annex 14 shows that even if costs were to
increase by 10% and 20% over the project life, the rate of return for
Asutsuare would still be 14% and 11% and that for Komenda 27% and 23%.
These are satisfactory returns, particularly if account is taken of the
conservative yield and sugar recovery assumptions.
8.02      The project would ensure the employment of about 5,000 workers
now engaged in the industry of whom the 3,000 now working in Asutsuare
would lose their job were not the project carried out, and permit the
employment of an additional 1,700 workers. The cost of providing the new
job opportunities and of protecting present jobs would be about US$2,400
per capita. Other benefits would be the strengthening and expansion of ADB
and the conversion of the sugar industry with its present cash deficit into a
profit earning industry. The project would also set a pattern for irrigation
projects in Ghana and provide a basis for future expansion of the sugar
industry.
IX.  AGREEMENTS REACIED AND RECOM1ENDATIONS
9.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) credit specialists with terms of reference acceptable to
IDA would be appointed to ADB and their recommendations
enforced (para 2.13);
(b) GHASEL would enjoy full rights to Asutsuare and Komenda
Estates during the period of the credit (paras 3.01 and
3.02);

- 28 -
(f) additional estate land would be made available if
required at Asutsuare and Komenda (para 4.05);
(g) foreign exchange would be made available for procurement

acceptable to IDA and submitted to IDA not later than four
months after thlose of GiASEL's financial year (para 5.11);

would be submitted to IDA within four months of the close of
its financial year (para 5.12);
(n)  appointments to the posts of M4anaging Director and Financial

(n) IDA would be informed of any change in farmers' cane prices
(para 6.14);
(o) GRASEL would be responsible for importing its own and cane
farmers' fertilizer requirements (para 6.15);
(p) ADB's credit procedures for sugar farmers would be as described
in para 6.16 and Annex 3, para 25;
(q) GHASEL and ADB would make a full study of the cane farming
sector by November, 1973, and prepare detailed proposals for
the support and further development of the sector and these
proposals, if acceptable to IDA, would be implemented (para 6.17);
(r) a Sugar Industry Committee would be formed with membership and
terms of reference satisfactory to IDA (para 6.03);
(s) GIIASEL would be exempted from duties on fuel oil (para 7.12),
Government and GHASEL would seek to maintain an annual rate of
return on capital employed of not less than 8% (para 7.13); and



- 29 -
(t) GHASEL will not incur debt during the project period without
IDA approval and thereafter unless debt service coverage is
1.5 times (para 7.12).
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness would be:
(a) ADB's unrecoverable debts have been written off (para 2.13);
(b) transfer to GHASEL of effective title to Asutsuare, issue of
a Notice issued designating the Komenda estate area in favor
of GHASEL and settlement of compensation at Asutsuare
(paras 3.01 and 3.02);
(c) conclusion of relending agreements between Government and ADB
and Government and GHASEL satisfactory to IDA (paras 5.02
and 5.04);
(d) transfer to GRASEL of existing assets in Asutsuare and Komenda
and steps taken for their valuation (para 5.07);
(e) submission of a Program of Work by GHASEL (para 6.05);
(f) conclusion of an agreement satisfactory to IDA between ADB
and GHASEL for purchase of farmers' cane (para 6.16); and
(g) establishment of the Sugar Industry Committee (para 6.03).
9.03      With these assurances, the project would be suitable for an
IDA Credit of US$15.6 M on standard terms.

SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
SUGAR MARKET AND MARKETING
A. Sugar World Market Outlook
1.        The Bank Economics Department forecasts that from 1971/73 to
1981/83 world sugar consumption will increase from about 75.0 to about
100 million tons. To meet the greater demand, production capacity will
need to be increased by 30 million tons over the same period at an estimated
cost of about US$4 billion.
2.        Out of a total international trade of about 19.2 million tons in
1975 about 65% will probably move under special arrangements involving the
United States, United Kingdom, Caribbean, and centrally planned countries.
The remaining trade will be under the so-called "free world market". During
the 1960's prices on the special markets were much higher than "free world
market" prices, but during the 1970's this margin decreased as a consequence
of price increases on the "free world market". This market is organized
by the 1968 International Sugar Agreement, which is due for renewal in 1973,
It is probable that the new agreement would provide for higher sugar prices
than those of the current agreement, which aims to keep prices in the range
of US03.25 to 5.25/lb for raw sugar (fob Caribbean ports). Average prices
increased from USJ3.1/lb in 1969 to US47.7/lb by the first half of 1972
as a result of a decline in world sugar surpluses. In late 1971 the
International Sugar Organization lifted export restrictions when world
market prices exceeded the US45.25/lb ceiling under the agreement. But,
early in 1972 quotations for raw sugar were over US48/lb and exporters
were therefore asked to offer all stocks held under special reserve arrange--
ments for prompt delivery. Working stocks, estimated normally at 25% of
annual consumption, were reduced to some 19% by the end of August 1972.
3.        Since sugar production will lag behind demand over the next decade,
it is expected that prices on the free market will be significantly higher
over the next 10 years than the prices that prevailed in the later 1960's.
In April 1972 the Bank Economics Department forecasted a 1975 price of
US45.5/lb for raw sugar (fob Caribbean ports), and a 1980 price of US45.8/lb.
These forecasts are now considered low and a price in 1980 of US46 to
USO7.5/lb is considered more likely. A price cif Ghana of USU8.3/lb for
refined sugar, equivalent to a fob Caribbean port price of USJ6/lb in real
term is therefore used in the project's economic analysis (see Table 1).

Consumption
4.        Total demand for sugar in Ghana is made up by the retail trade,
Dmnufacturers, and distillers, for which consumption in 1970 is summarized
below: 1/

94.8                 100
5.        Consumption increased from about 33,000 tons in 1963 to about
95,000 tons in 1970. Annual per capita consumption increased during the
same period from 9.9 lb to 23.3 lb in 1970. This increase was achieved
despite the rising trend in price since 1967, and per capita consumption
is now at about the average level for Africa (23.6 lb in 1970). It is
still however some 17.6 lb below world per capita consumption estimated at
40.6 lb.

ANNEX 1
Page 3
Consumption estimates for the retail trade are based on an annual population
growth rate of between 2.5% and 3%, a GDP growth rate varying between 3% and
6% for different regions of Ghana, and an income elasticity of demand for
sugar of between 0.65 and 2.0. Manufacturers' demand is expected to increase
at 7 to 8% per annum, and the demand from distillers at 2 to 3% per annum.
7.        The project under consideration in this report would bring GHASEL's
capacity to some 45,000 tons per annum in 1978, i.e. less than one-third of
total country requirements. Thus GHASEL's production will have to be
supplemented either by imports or by further local production, possibly of
lower grade sugar for uses that do not require white sugar.
Imports
8.        Most of Ghana's sugar requirements are met by imports; the average
annual production during 1966-71 from the two local sugar factories was only
4,000 tons. Imports increased steadily from 1963 to 1970 and were 115,000
tons in 1970 (Table 2), representing NJ 16 million in foreign exchange
expenditure in that year. In 1971, imports fell to some 50,000 tons valued
at about 0 9.2 million. Although annual sugar imports normally fluctuate,
1970 imports were unusually large. They were nearly twice those of 1969
and 1971 and probably resulted from the removal of all sugar import licensing
in March 1970. Total usage of these exceptionally large imports has not been
completely determined. Part was traded normally but importers also built up
stocks.
9.        Imports were on "restricted license" until January 1, 1969 and
from then until March 1970 on "open general license" subject to "commitment
forms" an arrangement similar to restricted license in its practical effect.
Since March 1970 sugar has been imported freely subject only to an import
duty and levy. In February 1971, imports of sugar were again restricted
and became the sole responsibility of the Essential Commodities Committee
(ECC) (para 13).
10.       Most imports in recent years have been from the USSR, Eastern
European countries, France, and Britain. Although in 1971 there were no
formal restrictions on obtaining foreign exchange for sugar imports, delays
in converting local currency into foreign currency through the banking
system were a constraint on importing. These difficulties were less for
sugar from Eastern Europena countries and the USSR, with which there were
government-to-government exchange clearing arrangements.
11.       Government charges an import tax on all sugar of 0 0.01/lb and,
since August 1970, an additional 0 0.01/lb has been levied to finance local
sugar industry development. Only part of this levy has been made available
to the industry so far. These two charges combined are well below import
duties charged by other African sugar producing countries as indicated
below:

Kenya                          2.8
Uganda                         3.2
Tanzania                       2.9
The Essential Commodity Committee (ECC)
12.       After the 1972 devaluation, Government launched a consumer subsi-
dization scheme to avoid abrupt price increases on eleven imported basic
commodities including sugar. ECC was established under the Commissioner
for Trade with a monopoly for trading in these eleven commodities. The
Ghana Trade Corporation (GNTC) is ECC's agent.  It orders and delivers the
goods to trade and retail houses.
13.       ECC was allocated C 17 million (about US$13 million) in foreign
exchange to purchase up to 32,000 tons of sugar in 1972. From January to
June GNTC placed four orders for 18,625 tons of refined sugar for an average
price of $320/ton or US414.3/lb.  This sugar is sold at a wholesale price
of C 11.46/cwt or US47.98/lb. After including GNTC operating costs of about
C 5.50/ton - this price represents a subsidy of about 50% of the cost of
imported sugar.
14.       Locally produced sugar is bought from GIHOC at pre-devaluation
price levels (¢ 10.25/cwt at Asutsuare and C 9.75/cwt at Komenda) and
delivered to GNTC. Government undertake to pay GIHOC the difference between
the above selling price and mutually agreed production costs, including a
5% profit margin, of ¢ 20.51/cwt (US414.2/lb) at Asutsuare and C 13.63/cwt
(USd9.4/lb) at Komenda. From January to June 1972 the Asutsuare and Komenda
estates each produced and sold about 7,000 tons of sugar, requiring on
average a 55% subsidy worth about C 7.5/cwt.
15.       It is estimated therefore, that for the first half of 1972,
Government paid or will have to pay about C 5 million on sugar subsidies
of which about C 3 million (US$2.34 million) was foreign exchange. If
maintained at this level, subsidies would represent a significant strain
on Government resources. Government officials believe, however, that ECC
will gradually hand over the trade of essential commodities to established
marketing channels and prices will be allowed to adjust to free market
conditions.
Pricing Policy
16.       Government controls the maximum price at which sugar and other
basic foodstuffs may be sold. Apart from these price regulations, the
local trade in sugar is carried out freely by a number of competing
concerns.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
17.       The maximum controlled wholesale price of sugar was reduced by
33% in October 1967 and then increased by 23% in November 1969. The lower
price contributed to the increased consumption in 1968 and 1969 compared
with earlier years. The freeing of import controls may have contributed
to a further increase in consumption in 1970.
18.       The Price Control Orders specify retail and wholesale prices.
Most granulated sugar leaves regular commercial channels in wholesale
quantities, and when it is not used for manufacturing purposes (including
distilling), it is sold by small traders in hand-packaged quantities to
the final retailer. Prices supplied by the Central Bureau of Statistics
for the cost of living index indicate that the retail price control on
sugar is ineffective.
C. GHASEL Marketing Policy
19.       GHASEL would manufacture white sugar of a quality adequate for
general manufacturing purposes. HVA would advise the GEASEL Board and,
through it, Government if it considers that any manufacturer is seeking
to impose unreasonable quality requirements for locally produced sugar.
20.       Asutsuare would make a high quality refined sugar while Komenda
would continue to make a mill white sugar, although of a higher quality
than at present. No final decision would be taken on the pricing formula
for mill white and refined sugar in Ghana until rehabilitation of both
factories is complete and experience has been obtained of the market
demand for each type. Calculations in this report assume ex-factory
prices at Asutsuare of C 256 per ton for refined sugar and at Komenda's
of C 243 per ton for white sugar. This represents a discount of 5% for
Komenda sugar and an average ex-factory price of C 250 per ton for both
factories.
21.       To establish and maintain a sound marketing policy, GHASEL would:
(a) appoint a competent Ghanaian executive with commercial experience
to be responsible for its sugar sales policy; and
(b) negotiate block contracts with the large sugar merchants for a
substantial proportion of total production. These merchants
would be entitled to a discount in return for accepting sugar
during the crop season, thus reducing factory stocks.
22.       A justification for some form of local industry protection is
given in para 7.07 of the report. After considering various ways of pro-
tecting the local industry, it appears that a fixed duty system would be
satisfactory, provided that Government:



ANNEX 1
Page 6
(a) undertakes to adjust this duty as necessary to provide adequate
protection to the local sugar industry; and
(b) establishes as soon as possible a Sugar Industry Committee
as a channel for consultation between GHASEL, the Government,
and other organizations interested in the sugar industry.

GHANA INDUSTRIAL HOLDING CORPORATION (GIHOC)
A. The Corporation
Constitution and Objects
1.        GIHOC was established on July 1, 1968 under NLC Decree 207, later
amended by Act of Parliament dated January 15, 1971. Its objects are the
establishment and operation of profitable manufacturing and commercial
enterprises, and it can be nominated by Government to hold shares or other
interests of Government. GIHOC is required to conduct its affairs on
sound commercial lines to ensure that its revenues are sufficient to
produce a reasonable return o the fair value of its total assets plus
working capital: a reasonable return is defined as including sufficient
net operating income to meet interest payments and loan repayments to the
extent they exceed depreciation; to finance a reasonable proportion of
expansion; to provide reserves; and to make reasonable payments to the
Consolidated Fund.
Management and Organization
2.        GIHOC's governing body is a Board consisting of a Chairman, not
less than three nor more than seven Directors, and a Managing Director, all
of whom before the January 1972 coup were appointed for renewable terms of
three years by the President on advice of the Prime Minister and have since
been appointed by the NRC. Board members are required to be qualified or
experienced in industry, trade, finance, science or administration, and
must include experts in business administration, commerce, and engineering
or law. All members of the present Board are Ghanaian.
3.        GIHOC's organization consists of headquarters management and
staff in Accra and 17 operating divisions listed in Table I. GIHOC has
a subsidiary advertising company and a 40% interest in a textile company.
GIHOC employs about 9,500 people. The Sugar Division accounts for approxi-
mately one third of employees.
Operations
4.        Initially GIHOC took over 19 state corporations.  The State Cocoa
Products Corporation was subsequently handed over to the Cocoa Marketing
Board; the Sheet Metal Works Corporation sold; and the Textile Manufacturing
Corporation floated off as a limited liability company with GIHOC holding



ANNEX 2
Page 2
40% of the shares. A new division (Pharmaceuticals) was added later. GIROC's
policy is to float other divisions off into companies when appropriate, and
it plans to do so with the Distilleries Division.
5.        GIHOC is a conglomerate with more than the usual problems facing
that type of enterprise. Its activities did not grow naturally but were
thruist on it; they are widely disparate; management skill are in short
sup-ply particularly in planning, marketing and finance; and its overall
obj,ectives are ill-defined. It has been severely criticized in Ghana and
by outside observers, and while it has admittedly faced a difficult task,
its performance has not been good.
B. The Sugar Products Division
6.        When GIHOC was formed it took over the State Sugar Corporation
consisting of the two estates at Asutsuare and Komenda. The Asutsuare
facitory was erected under a contract with Cepok of Poland and commissioned
in 1967. Management was first supplied by Techno-Export of Czechoslovakia.
When the Czech General Manager left in 1967 a Pakistan firm, Associated
Consulting Engineers (ACE), were asked to take over management and in 1968
a contract was signed with ACE to continue management for three crop seasons,
i.e,, until mid-1971. The ACE contract was renewed for a further year till
mid--1972. Meanwhile, some Czech technical personnel remained and three are
now employed directly by GIHOC under an arrangement with the Czech Government.
In 1969, ACE were asked to take over Asutsuare also for a period of three years.
7.        The agreements with ACE required ACE to provide a General Manager,
a Sugar Technologist and an Agronomist at each factory, plus a visiting
distilleries expert for four months at Asutsuare and a liaison officer.
ACE were also required to provide overall guidance from their head office,
establish a training program, and submit reports. The fee, which covered
the ACE staff salaries, was 0 18,500 per month (o 9,500 for Asutsuare and
0 9,000 for Komenda) and ACE staff were also provided with housing and
trarLsport.
8.        The many problems that the sugar industry has faced are dealt
with in the technical annexes. They include low cane supplies, poor cane
quality, inefficient cane transport and handling, inappropriate and out-
of-date mill design and equipment, labor shortages and troubles at Asutsuare,
inadequate housing and facilities at Asutsuare, and difficulties with farmers.
Many of these problems proved to be beyond ACE's powers and GIHOC has been
unable to help. However, while the position at Asutsuare has remained bad,
production and efficiency at Komenda have improved.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
9.        ACE were not required to provide financial services and GITIOC did
not institute any form of cost accounting. The financial accounts of the
Sugar Division are long overdue and the auditors have had to prepare the
final statements. Audited accounts for 1969 were not completed until HIay
1971 and the audit of 1970 accounts was not completed by July 1972. The
audited profit and loss account for 1969 and the provisional account for
1970 and 1971 are at Table 2 but they exclude depreciation on the Asutsuare
factory, the value of which has not been determined; but which is probably
of the order of No 0.5 million, thus increasing the Asutsuare losses by
this amount. The balance sheets for the two estates for 1969, 1970 and 1971
are at Table 3.
10.       Due to lack of cost accounts, it is not possible to determine
accurately the unit costs of production, but in 1970 and 1971 it was about
0 285/ton at Komenda and substantially higher at Asutsuare. The excessive
production cost at Asutsuare was due primarily to the very low production,
only about 6% of capacity.

GHANA
SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK
Introduction
1.        In April 1964, the Bank of Ghana established a Rural Credit De-
partment to study the problems of agricultural credit and to prepare
legislation, plans and procedures for the establishment of an agricultural
credit bank. In April 1965, Parliament passed an Act (Act 286) to incorporate
the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Bank. The new bank started its
operations in August 1965, taking over the assets and liabilities of the
Rural Credit Department of the Bank of Ghana. In April 1967, the initial
Act was amended by a Decree of the National Liberation Council (Decree 182),
and the bank's name changed to the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB).
Functions and Objectives
2.        ADB w-as established to provide credit facilities for development
and modernization of agriculture and allied industries. To achieve this
purpose, ADB may either enter into loan agreements with individuals, coop-
eratives and companies, or subscribe a part of the share capital of new
ventures. The bank is also empowered to initiate or participate in training
and research facilities aimed at promoting agricultural development.
3.        The bank may mobilize funds by accepting deposits on saving ac-
counts and transact business normally confined to commercial banks. With
Government approval and guarantee, the bank may also raise loans from inter-
national financial organizations or foreign financial institutions.
Organization, Capital and Management
4.        ADB's authorized share capital is 0 30 M and the paid-up capital
at December 31, 1971 was 0 13.25 M. Although it is open to public subscription
Government and the Bank of Ghana are the only shareholders. The Bank of
Ghana's contribution amounting to 0 3.5 M was made available in cash
while Government provided 0 3.78 M in 3% savings bonds and 0 5.97 M in
cash. There is no fixed schedule for the paying-in capital and the two
shareholders agree each year with ADB the amount to be paid in during the
following financial year.
5.        The bank's operations are controlled by a Board of seven Directors
representing the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture, the Bank of Ghana,
and the Department of Cooperatives. The Chairman of the Board is also the
full-time managing Director of the bank; he is assisted by an Executive



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Director who is also a member of the Board. Under an agreement between the
Government and USAID, terminated in September 1970, ADB was advised by an
American expert in agricultural credit.
6.        The day-to-day activities of the bank are under the control of the
Managing Director, who is appointed by Gover nent for a five-year period.
The bank retains the services of independent auditors: Amorin, Agyeman,
Ayew and Co., chartered accountants with an office in Accra.
7.        There are 3 main departments in the bank-the Loans Department, the
Finance Department and the Administrative Department, which in turn are split
into various divisions. Each department is under a Director responsible to
the Managing Director.
8.        Besides its headquarters in Accra, ADB has opened four branches in
Kumasi, Koforidua, Tamale and Hohoe, and ten Farm Credit Service Offices to
supervise projects financed by ADB.
9.        The staff of ADB totals about 200 of whom about 60 are qualified
professionals with university or post-secondary school diplomas, some with
degrees degrees either in Great Britain, USSR, USA or Germany. Although
many of the professionals have graduated in agriculture, only a few have
adequate practical experience, and consequently the technical appraisal
of agricultural projects is weak. Under the sponsorship of USAID three
staff members were sent to the United States for further training.
Activities and Performance
10.       ADB has more than tripled its total lending since September 1969.
The total number of 351 approved loans at that time amounting to ¢ 4.7 M
has increased to 1,551 loans in March 1972 representing an approved total
of 0 17 M out of which ¢ 13 M was actually disbursed. The breakdown of the
loans among different types of operations is summarized below and detailed
in Table 3.

ANNEX 3
Page 3
Terms and conditions of the loans are based on the type of activity and vary
between 6 months for food crops to 7 years for cattle and 10 years for oil
palm. Interest rates up to February 1972 varieh between 7% and 9% per annum.
The rate depended not only on the type of operation, but also on borrowers'
security. For sugar cane farms, loans are made for four years and the
interest charged was 9% per annum. The new Government has decreed that all
ADB loans for agriculture, effective February 5, 1972, should be charged
interest at a concession rate of 6%0 per annum. This decree could cause
problems for ADB as it is obliged to pay 7-1/2% per annum on saving deposits,
and the Bank of Ghana Discount Rate is 8%. All agricultural loans granted
after February 5, 1972 were met out of Bank of Ghana loans made available
from a special fund for which ADB is charged an interest rate of 3% per
annum. During 1972 no loans were granted to sugar cane farmers. The
Government is considering the exclusion of the sugar industry from this
concessionary interest rate of 6%.
11.       ADB's loan administration and debt recovery record is not as
impressive as its recent expansion. As of March 31, 1972, the total amount
of principal actually recovered represented only 40% of the principal due
at the same time (see Table 3). For some loans, debt service does not even
cover the interest charge and the balance now due exceeds the original loan.
In 1970, only 68% of interest due on all loans was actually collected; but
in 1971, the interest recovery rate improved to 81%. Some of the reasons
for the poor debt collection record are beyond ADB's control and stem from
the social and legal structure of Ghanaian society. They include the absence
of formal land ownership and the consequent impossibility of securing loans
with land titles. Legislation on debt default is complicated and difficult
to enforce even with court decisions favorable to lenders. But the main
reason for poor debt recovery is the lack of a proper loan recording system
inside ADB, including establishment of a reimbursement schedule for each
loan, separate recording of principal and interest repayments, and con-
tinuous up-dating of individual loan positions. These shortcomings were
discussed during the appraisal in 1969 of the Eastern Region Cocoa Project
(see Report PA-43a, Annex 6) and were to be put in effect by a USAID expert
who assisted ADB at that time, but who unfortunately resigned prematurely.
12.       The 40% figure quoted above as representing the level of ADB's
debt recovery is also due to the time of the year at which it was established,
i.e. end of March. Many annuities on ADB's loans are paid in block at the
end of the cropping season and it is possible that a debt recovery percentage
calculated at the end of September would be higher. Part of ADB's poor debt
recovery is also due to loans estimated at about 0 550,000 granted by the
Bank of Ghana under the First Republic, and taken over by ADB when it was
established in 1965 (see para 1). Such loans, mainly for fisheries, were
politically oriented and are being written off.
13.       In order to strengthen its credit management generally and
especially its accounting system, ADB has entered into an agreement with
Berenschot Bosboom, who are experienced credit management reorganization
consultants. These will provide 2 of their experts to ADB. A specialist
in loan accounting procedures will first establish and then run for about



ANNEX 3
Page 4
nine months a proper system of loan accounting and reporting. The other
expert will review credit policies and procedures. Both experts will assist
ADB to establish financing plan to either reschedule or write off its
overdue loans. Terms of reference for these experts are at Appendix 1.
'14.      In early 1968, ADB began accepting funds on current and deposit
accounts and that activity has been increasing steadily as slhown in the
J'ollowing table:

Interest of 3-1/2% per annum was paid on savings deposits until August 1971
whereafter the rate was increased to 7-1/2% per annum. Most of the savings
deposits monies were used to purchase Government bonds.
15.       ADB provides credit for the Fisheries Project (163-GII) and the
Eastern Region Cocoa Project (205-Gil). The Fisheries Project, costing
US$2.3 M, provides credit to fishermen for construction of 40 medium-size
seine fishing vessels. Because of changed circumstances affecting the cost
and design of boats and tlheir profitability, the number to be constructed
hias been reduced to 10. IDA's contribution of US$1.3 M covers the foreign
exchange component of vessel construction and a fishing port feasibility
study, and is being made available, together with Government's contribution,
tc eligible borrowers through ADB.  Discussions are in progress as to the
possible uses to which the amount of the Credit freed by the reduction in
the number of boats might be put; this would involve amending the Credit.
16.       After approving the creditworthiness of an applicant, ADB receives
from the borrower a down payment of e 5,000 1/ representing some 10% 1/ of
the total cost of a vessel. ADB then credits the borrower's account with
another 0 44,000 1/ and the Boatyard Division of GIHOC draws from this account
the expenses it incurs in the construction of the borrower's vessel.  The
Boatyard Division will later collect debts on ADB's behalf through the medium
of a hire-purchase type arrangement.
17,       Government on-lends IDA funds and its own contribution to ADB at
6-1/2%. ADB charges the borrower 9%, pays 1-1/2% to the Boat yard Division
for its services, and bears the credit risk from the remaining 1%. Loans
will be repaid in six years with a one-year period of grace; this is well
within the expected vessel life of 10 to 12 years.
1/   These amounts differ from those stated in the appraisal report (see
para 18) and have been agreed upon by IDA.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
18.       Progress on the Fisheries Project was held up initially because of
disagreement between GIHOC and potential buyers on the design and cost of
boats, which led eventually to the decision to build only 10 boats with some-
what different equipment originally envisaged. The first five boats have
now been completed and disbursement is being requested. In view of the slow
start on the project, the Closing Date will have to be extended by a year to
December 31, 1973. Further details on the fisheries projects are given in
IBRD-IDA Report PA-7a of September 8, 1969, "Fisheries Project -- Ghana" and
the President's Memorandum on the Sugar Rehabilitation Project (to be issued).
19.       In the Eastern Region Cocoa Project (205-GH), ADB has seconded
loan officers to the Project Unit established within the Ministry of Agri-
culture to appraise the creditworthiness of cooperative members whose farms
are to be rehabilitated or replanted under the Project. After approval
of borrowers by ADB's Board, farm inputs are provided by the Project Unit
and financed by a loan from ADB. Cooperatives deduct reimbursements from
cocoa sale proceeds. The Ghana Cooperative Marketing Association, the apex
organization of the cocoa marketing cooperatives, guarantees individual
loan reimbursement.
20.       Credit 205-GH was signed in June 1970 and became effective on
March 12, 1971. Project organization started in November 1970 and consisted
mainly in establishing the Project Unit and organizing farmers in new
cooperatives where required. Granting of loans commenced with the first
rehabilitation campaign in mid-1971. Details of the Eastern Region Cocoa
Project are given in Appraisal Report PA-43a, dated June 3, 1970.
Sugar Credits
21.       With a total of 239 approved loans amounting to ¢ 3.29 M ADB has
20% of its loan portfolio in the sugar cane business (see Table 3). Average
size of the loans is about ¢ 13,200 but varies significantly between Komenda
(O 7,500) and Asutsuare (¢ 16,500) where sugar cane farms financed by ADB
are larger than in the Komenda area. The size of loans varies between
¢ 2,000 for small private farmers and more than ¢ 80,000 for small-size
companies planting 400 to 500 acres.
22.       Under the present arrangements, applications for loans are
addressed to ADB, which obtains from GIHOC Sugar Division a guarantee that
the cane harvested by the applicant would be purchased by the factories at
a fixed price (O 6.50/ton of cane in 1970/71 and 4 7.20 in 1971/72). ADB
relies mainly on GIHOC's extension officer to ensure that field location,
quality of land and applicant's technical capacity are satisfactory. ADB
undertakes to finance 80% of the first year costs including land preparation
and first year seasonal inputs. Practically, however, ADB has been opening
a credit line to its borrower and disbursing against 100% of the first year
cost, including daily payment for the farmer's own work. At harvest time,
GIHOC takes delivery of cane and after completion of cutting pays en bloc
the cane proceeds into the farmer's account with ADB. ADB deducts the
annuity due and allows the farmer to withdraw from his account the balance
of the sale proceeds.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
23,       Despite the theoretically tight reimbursement system, ADB
performance on sugar loans is no better than on some of its other operations.
On March 31, 1972, only 55% of the principal due had actually been paid.
Two considerations, however, should be kept in mind when looking at ADB's
results on its sugar operations. First, because of the poor state of the
industry the two factories have not been able to buy on time all the
quantities they undertook to purchase and many farmers have been left with
cane in the field. Second, due partly to shortage of funds, GIHOC credits
farmers' accounts with ADB only once a year when cutting is completed.
Therefore, the rate of reimbursement by the end of the harvesting season
should show a significantly improved position.
24.       The present system, however, is not satisfactory in many ways.
First, there is no limiton the total acreage ADB finances for each individual
farmer and this has led to mismanagement of labor, consequent loe4es and
higher risks for ADB. Second, some farmers have been allowed to expand their
initial holdings before they have proven their capacity to manage their
original holdings in a way that enables them to repay their original loan.
Third, since ADB has been financing up to 100% of total costs, many absentee
landlords have no stake in their farms and do not have enough incentive to
get the best results. Fourth, ADB policy has led to disregarding the needs
of small farmers by lending available funds to already wealthy people on
advantageous terms. If seriously interested in sugar cane farming, these
people could find the required funds from their own sources or other financing
institutions.
ADB's Role in the Sugar Rehabilitation Project
25.       To remedy the present situation, ADB would apply the following
rules when financing sugar cane farms under the project:
(a) New farmers
(i) Total acreage for new sugar cane farmers would be
limited to 25 acres.
(ii) During the first year of development APB would finance
the clearing of 20 acres (i.e., 80% of acreage), the
total cost of planting material, and a living allowance
amounting to a maximum of 0 300 to be paid in two equal
installments, the first after land clearance and the
second after completion of the weeding.
(iii) During the following years, ADB would finance the
total cost of fertilizers and 80% of the manpower
required for harvesting assuming a productivity of
0.5 ton of cane cut and loaded per man-day.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
(b) Existing Farmers
Loans to existing farmers would finance the same costs,
though land clearing may not be required, and the same
terms would apply, subject to the following limitations:
(i)  Loans would be subject to satisfactory technical per-
formance and repayment record, and would be restricted
to an annual increase of 20% of a farmer's area under
cane, with a maximum for any farmer of 20 acres in any
one year.  ADB would not finance increases above these
limits, since larger farmers could either reinvest
their own earnings or obtain loans from other financial
institutions.
(ii)  Loans for replanting would be available up to a maximum
of 100 acres, provided farmers have performed satis-
factorily and repaid previous loans in full.
26.       ADB would keep separate accounts for existing loans and those
opened in future. One loan and one current account would be opened for each
of its sugar cane farmers; the loan account would show the amount approved,
and be debited with loan disbursement for approved expenses and credited
monthly with cane sales proceeds. The balance of sales proceeds, after
deduction of debt service due, would be transferred to the borrower's current
account.
27.       ADB would obtain guarantees from GHASEL ensuring that:
(a) applicants for ADB loans have use of land conveniently
located and suitable for sugar cane growing;
(b)  GHASEL would provide seed cane and extension services.
and
(c) GHASEL would buy the sugar cane produced by ADB's borrower
and pay the proceeds monthly into the borrower's loan account
with ADB.
28.       Under the proposed scheme, a farmer cultivating 25 acres would
receive ¢ 3,715 as development loan in the first year and about 0 4,035
as seasonal loan in four annual installments of 0 1,275, 0 1,120, 4 1,000
and 4 640 each. Both loans would bear interest of 9% per annum. Seasonal
loans would be reimbursed in less than one year while the development loans
would be repaid over four years. An estimated cash flow for a 25-acre farm
is shown in Annex 12. 4 1.8 M required by ADB to finance loans to sugar
cane farmers would be on-lent by Government at an interest rate of 6-1/2%
per annum and would include ¢ 1.28 M financed by IDA. Such on-lending, would
be by annual tranche, the amount of which would be related to the annual
farmers' expansion program, and each tranche would be on-lent for six years.

Conclusions
29.       ADB's present position is precarious and may become critical.
Ihe true position is obscured by thie new capital, which Government pays
in every year and which allows rapid expansion of loans; if such payments
were to stop and ADB were forced to live on its own resources, new lending
would be curtailed. This should be prevented for several reasons. First,
ADB is still relatively small with some 1,500 borrowers and it should not
be difficult to rectify the present situation; the proposed technical
assistance should be able to do so within a year. Second, ADB is a young
institution and many of its problems arise from the shift from expansion
based on fresh capital to reliance on its own resources. Third, failure
by ADB to carry out its intended function would have consequences reaching
far beyond the financial losses it would involve: it would shake the
confidence of farmers who are placing increasing trust in this new institution
after the many unfortunate experiences they went through under the First
Republic Government. Finally, ADB was soundly established to fulfill an
important role in Ghana's agricultural development and has acquired valuable
experience which should not be lost.
30.       It is therefore recommended that ADB, properly reinforced by the
proposed technical assistance, should be the channel for on-lending
to sugar cane farmers provided it enforces the lending regulations set out
in paragraph 25.

1.        Introduction.  This annex summarizes the findings and recommenda-
tions of the appraisal mission's agricultural consultants. The consultants'
full report is available.
A. General Description of Cane Production
2.        Climatic Conditions.  Sugar cane grows best between 770 and 82°F;
higher daytime temperatures can be tolerated while temperatures below 650
retard growth but increase the sucrose content in cane. The water require-
ment of cane, which varies with the crop month, is determined by many
factors such as evaporation and sunshine. The latter has a favorable effect
on sucrose content. For example, the maximum requirement in a month at
Asutsuare is estimated at 7 inches while at Komenda it is 6 inches due to
lower evaporation. A distinct dry season is required for harvesting.
3.        Soils and Land Preparation.  Cane thrives on a wide variety of
soils, and depth and soil structure are more important than fertility, which
can be corrected. Thus, good land preparation is essential. A pH of 7 is
optimal. Topography is important and steep slopes must be avoided because
of harvesting problems.
4.        Planting.  Planting is carried out simply by placing the setts
either in the furrows or, in wet areas, in small furrows on top of the
ridges. Setts are usually planted butt to butt but they may be overlapped
if germination is poor. Supplying of gaps is essential. The planting
material is either stalks of 8 to 10 months plant cane (seed cane) or tops
of mature cane. Seed cane is preferable.
5.        Cultivation.  At two to three months, cane is earthed up to
facilitate drainage, discing, weeding and harvesting. For ratoons, ridges
and furrows are reshaped. Fertilizer requirements vary and have to be
established by trials; foliar analysis may be used to test nutrient require-
ments.
6.        Varieties.  Varieties should be chosen according to their yield,
pest and disease resistance, number of ratoons, period of optimum maturity,
etc. It is important to test a number of different varieties as local
conditions differ greatly.

7.        Weeds, Pests and Diseases.  Weed control is essential and is
usually a combination of hand and chemical weeding. Cane diseases and
pests are numerous and since specific control is expensive, introduction of
resistant varieties is the best solution.
8.        Harvesting.  Harvesting methods vary from completely manual
operations to mechanized cutting and loading. Mechanized cutting, however,
requires careful field layout, preferably flat fields, and erect cane; it
can also result in delivery of excessive extraneous matter and consequent
reduction in factory efficiency.
B. Asutsuare
9.        Climate.  Four seasons can be identified:
April/July:          Summer rainy season; about 8 in/month;
temperatures 86° to 70°F; relative humidity
60% to 70%; sunshine hours 7 (April) to 5 (June);
pan evaporation 7 in (April) to 4.5 in (June).
July/August/
part September       Drier season; unpredictable rainfall; tempera-
tures 85' to 70'F; humidity 65% to 68%; sunshine
4.5 hours; pan evaporation 4.5-5.0 in.
September/mid-
November             Rainy season but less than in April/July;
temperatures 900 to 70°F; humidity lower;
sunshine 8 hours/day in November; pan evapora-
tion 5.7 in.
Mid-November/April  Dry season; less than 4 in/month; temperatures
950 to 74°F; low humidity (50%-60%); 7 hours
sunshine; pan evaporation 7.8 in.
10.       Harvesting has to be carried out in the dry season, November/April,
and planting 11 months beforehand. While new plants must have adequate
water, the planting season, without irrigation, is limited by the very heavy
rains and an important benefit of irrigation will be to enable planting in
December/April.
11.       The irrigation requirements have been calculated with reference to
rainfall and evaporation. The annual deficit is estimated at 19 in and
irrigation should increase yields from 22/23 up to 35 and possibly 40 tons
cane/acre. In addition, irrigation will safeguard against abnormally dry
years.
12.       Soils and Land Preparation.  Soils are of two main groups - tropical
black earths and alluvial soils of the Volta Flood Plain. Characteristics
of t;he tropical black earths are extensive cracking when dry; low water



ANNEX 4
Page 3
intake; compact subsoils; susceptibility to water logging; moderate organic
content; liability to compaction; lack of potassium; and response to
nitrogen. The soils need careful management but can give very good yields.
13.       The alluvial soils are irregularly distributed; show low permeability
in some types; poor internal drainage; poor nutrient status, and distinct
acid reaction. The soils are generally suitable but high yields are not
expected and the first extensions will be made south of Inspectorate IV, where
black earths predominate.
14.       Heavy equipment will be provided for land clearing and the following
sequence of operations is envisaged:
(a) New land - clearing.
Replanting - stubble ploughing with crawler tractor and
disc harrow;
(b) Subsoil up to 20-24 in;
(c) Heavy disc ploughing to at least 15 in;
(d) Harrowing;
(e) Landplaning;
(f) Furrowing (with depth control attachments); and
(g) Ditching.
A row space of 5 ft is recommended.
15.       Planting and Planting Material.  Present shortcomings in planting
methods have resulted in large numbers of gaps and are a major cause of the
low yields. Germination will be improved by better land preparation, more
attention to quality and conditions of seedeane, and better control. Setts
will be overlapped in early years.
16.       Cultivation.  Earthing-up and ridge and furrow shaping will be
essential. The operation will be carried out about 2-1/2 months after
planting with a second cultivation a month or so later. Cane will be
burnt before harvest.
17.       Fertilizing.  Present applications are not based on experiments,
and trials need to be carried out immediately. It is assumed that present
rates will be continued for plant cane (1 cwt ammonia, 1 cwt sulphate of
potassium and 1 cwt triple superphosphate at planting with 2 cwt ammonia
before earthing-up) but increased for ratoons to 4-1/2 cwt sulphate of
ammonia, 1 cwt potash and 1 cwt superphosphate.
18.       Varieties.  Although the main varieties used, PR 980 and B 41.227,
are expected to show good yields with irrigation, they have not been ade-
quately evaluated and new varieties should be imported and tested on the



ANNEX 4
Page 4
estate. As there is no quarantine station, varieties should be imported
through the quarantine station of the East African Agriculture and Forestry
Organization in Kenya or another internationally accepted station.
19.       Weeds, Pests and Diseases.  Due partly to labor problems, weed con-
trol has been poor.  A combination of chemical and manual weeding will be in-
trcduced; chemicals used will be 2.4 D-amine with TCA or equivalent. Pest and
diseases do not seem to have been a problem hitherto, although a number have
been recorded; effective management together with proper selection of vari-
eties should prevent losses in future.
20.       Cane Yield and Quality.  The following table shows production data
to date:
Tons Sugar/
-------Tons Cane per Acre-------    Tons Cane
Estate      Farmers       Average         %
1966              27.4        23            25           2.7
1967              14          27            21           3.6
1968/69           17          22            19           0.6
1969/70           12           15            14          3.3
1970/71            9.9         14            13          4.1
These very low yields and recovery are due to a variety of reasons:
-    only a part of the average available was harvested;
-    old cane had to be harvested, particularly in the
2nd and 3rd season;
-    increasing proportion of ratoon cane; and
-    poor planting, cultivation, and harvesting methods.
21.       With the improved management and input under the project, yields
are expected to improve to an average of 31 tons/acre and TS/TC% to 9%.
The following table shows the estimated future yields of estate cane:
Tons Cane/acre
plant                 38
1st ratoon            33
2nd ratoon            28
3rd ratoon            25
Average          31
These yields are comparable with other estates with similar conditions (e.g.,
Kilonibero in Tanzania) and may well be exceeded when high-yielding varieties
become available.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
22.       Farmers' cane yields are expected to improve from 14/15 TCA at pres-
ent to 20 TCA with improved standards, the use of heavy equipment for land
clearing, an effective extension service, and maintenance of a proper replant-
ing cycle.
23.       Total yield from estate and farmers' cane from 1972/73 to 1978/79
is summarized in Table 1.
24.       Development Program.  The present estate acreage under cane is
estimated at 4,000 acres.   The farmers' cane acreage is estimated at 5,200
acres of which it is assumed 85% (4,420 acres) is annually available for
harvesting.
25.       Based on eventual full irrigation of estate cane and the assumption
that farmers will plant about 50% of the total cane area, the estate planting
program is planned as follows:
Year                  Estate                    Outgrowers                Grand

As from 1977/78, about one quarter of the estate and outgrower acreage would
be replanted annually to replace cane arriving at the end of their cycle.
The above planting program represents the acreage included in project costs.
26.       Nurseries.  Nursery requirements have been allowed for in the
expected estate tonnages. Seedcane for 1972/73 will be available from
existing fields; nursery acreage would expand progressively to 200 acres and
this would meet estate and outgrower requirements.
27.       Irrigation.  The irrigation system is planned as follows:
1973/74   Rehabilitation irrigation system in Inspectorates II and
III. Preparatory work on irrigation-drainage system in
Inspectorate I.
1974/75   Irrigation in replanted fields in Inspectorates II and III
(1,250 acres). Layout irrigation-drainage system in
Inspectorate I. Preparations for irrigation-drainage system
in Inspectorates IV, V and VI.

C. Komenda
28.       As at Asutsuare there are four seasons:
Mid-April - Mid-July      Rainy season with average about 25 in;
temperatures 82°-72°F; relative humidity
rising from 75% to 82%; sunshine dropping
from 6.8 hours to 4.1 hours; pan evaporation
6.5 in in April to 4.4 in in July.
Mid-July - Mid-October   Drier with highly variable rainfall; tempera-
tures 810 to 71°F; relative humidity high
(85%) due to low sunshine (3-1/2 to 4 hours);
pan evaporation low (4-4-1/2 in).
October                   Short rainy season, usually less than 4 in.
Pan evaporation rising to 5-1/2 in/month with
higher temperatures and more sunshine.
November - Mid-April      Dry season with temperatures 88° - 72°F,
humidity 75%, 7-1/2 hours sunshine and 5 in
to 7 in pan evaporation.
Maximum temperatures are lower than at Asutsuare, humidity is higher and pan
evaporation slightly lower.
29.       Harvesting is carried out over the six months October-April and
planting in March-April resulting in 11-12-month-old cane.
30.       Water requirements for plantcane and ratoons are the same as for
Asutsuare because of lower maximum pan evaporation.
31.       The annual water deficit is 20 inches, about the same as at Asutsuare.
The expected yields at Komenda are lower at 21 tons/acre average and they
could be improved considerably with supplemental irrigation to 55 tons/acre
or more. However, because of serious doubts over the efficiency of the
irrigation system installed and the high costs of maintaining it, only a pilot
scheme of 600 acres with one pump unit of the planned overhead system will
be carried out initially.



ANNEX 4

32.       Soils and Land Preparation.  Most of the soils are lowland and
upland soils. The latter are ferralitic, have good drainage and are moder-
ately fertile. Their yield potential is good. The lowland soils are subject
to hardpan and have to be carefully prepared and managed to allow root growth
and prevent waterlogging. Reasonable yields are obtainable from them.
33.       Land preparation will be similar to Asutsuare (para 14).
34.       Planting and Planting Material.  Germination has been better than
at Asutsuare due to more open soil structure and better management; overlapping
setts should be planted.
35.       Cultivation.  Cultivation will be generally the same as at
Asutsuare and, as there, cane will be burnt before harvest.
36.       Fertilizing.  Present applications are excessive and the 3 cwt
sulphate of ammonia applied at planting should be reduced to 1 cwt with
1 cwt triple superphosphate and 1 cwt sulphate of potassium. A further
2 cwt sulphate 4 ammonia should be applied before earthing-up. Ratoon fer-
tilizer will be as for Asutsuare (para 17).
37.       Varieties.  The predominant variety is B 41.227 occupying 83% of
estate cane. It gives satisfactory yields but trials should be carried out
to reduce the risks of using virtually only one variety.
38.       Weeds, Pests and Diseases.  The situation and remedies are the same
as for Asutsuare. The soil conditions are favorable to nematodes but symptoms
of infestation are not apparent at present.
39.       Cane Yields and Quality.  The following table shows production
data to date:
Tons Sugar/
Season     Estate      Farmers      Total   Tons Cane
--------------TCA------------         %
1967       29          27           29       5.77
1968/69       30          29           30       5.81
1969/70       19          21           20       6.3
1971/72       19          15           16       5.6
The yields, though better than at Asutsuare, were still low in 1971/72 due
mainly to high proportions of old cane and ratoon crops.
40.       It is estimated that with improved drainage, better weed control,
deep subsoiling, improved planting and optimum fertilizing, estate yields will
improve to an average of 21 TCA, and the TS/TC% to 9%. The following table
shows the estimated future yields on estate cane:

3rd ratoon              16
Average            21
41.       Due to the increased proportion of ratoons, it is estimated that
the acreage yield on farmers cane will drop to 17 tons/acre.
42.       The total yield from estate and farmers' cane is shown 0i Table 1.
43.       Development Program.  The present estate acreage under cane is
estimated to be 3,250 acres. The area to be developed is 1,250 acres
resulting in a total of about 4,500 acres. The farmers' cane is estimated at
3,435 acres of which 85Z is harvested.
44.       The planting program for estate cane is as follows:
Year               Estate                      Outgrowers              Grand

and 200 acres from 1972/73 onwards.  Cane planted in the preceding year will
be used.

SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
Field Engineering, Irrigation and Roads
Introduction
1.        This report summarizes the findings and recommendations of the
appraisal mission's technical consultants. The consultants' report, which
contains full technical data and information, is available.

Field Engineering
2.        Land Preparation.  Present land preparation, using 65 hp tractors
with three-point hitch disc ploughs which make two cross ploughings and har-
row passages with furrowing, is inadequate as it cultivates to only 8-10 in
and leaves a hard pan. The following procedure would be used in future:
(a) Land clearing or ratoon stubble breaking. Most of the area
is free from heavy growth and the operation would be carried
out by a bulldozer with plough for ratoon stubble.
(b) Sub-soiling or ripping. Tractors equipped with three wing-
type ripper points would make one cross pass.
(c) Heavy disc ploughing. Tractors would make one pass ploughing
to at least 24 in.
(d)  Disc harrowing.  Tractors would make two cross passes.
(e) Land levelling. Most of the area in cane has been levelled
and new areas appear not to need much levelling. Some field
engineering would be needed and tractors would be used.
(f) Furrowing. This would be done by tractors equipped with
three furrow ploughs.
(g) Infield canals. Irrigation and drainage canals would be
made by tractors or road graders for the larger canals and
ditches.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
3.        Existing equipment would be rehabilitated and additional units
purchased.
4.        Cultivation.  Existing wheel tractors, which include 78 new Massey-
Fergusons, 99 Ursus (Polish) and 130 Fordson Majors in running order, are
sufficient for mechanical cultivation operations and no expenditure is pro-
posed. The following procedures would be used:
(a) Plant canes
(i)  Seed covering by discs;
(ii)  Pre-emergence weed treatment with one line per swath;
(iii)  Cultivation at six to eight weeks after (ii) with fer-
tilizer application; and
(iv)  Second cultivation.
(b) Ratoon cane
(i)  Disc cultivation for line repair and ridging;
(ii)  Pre-emergence weed control;
(iii)  Cultivation at four to six weeks after (ii) with fer-
tilizing; and
(iv)  Inter-row spraying one to two weeks after (iii).
5.        Harvesting and Haulage.  Present harvesting and haulage are most
inefficient. Haulage of farmers' cane is carried out by the estate using
tractor-trailer units and trucks (for over 15 miles). Losses in wagon and
truck time are very high and the cost per ton is probably around N4 2.40.
Estate cane is cut and loaded by hand at an average rate of 0.3 tons per man-
day. Cane and sugar losses are great due to high cutting and cane left under
trash. Loading is time-consuming -- the stalks are bundled and tied before
being head-carried to the wagon. The trailers, which are Polish, are of poor
design and weak.
6.        The following system would be operated in future:
Farmers' Cane. Farmers' cane transport should be taken over
eventually by farmers themselves but until this happens the
estate would control operations more strictly by:
(a) Preparing harvesting schedules and making daily tonnage
allotments;
(b) Daily visits to farmers harvesting cane;



ANNEX 5
Page 3
(c) Closer supervision of cane transport personnel; and
(d) Limiting loading times.
Estate Cane
(a) Cutting
(i) Cane would be burnt before harvesting;
(ii) Only one field would be harvested at a time until daily
tonnage requirements dictate two fields; and
(iii) Cutting would be on an incentive basis and performance
standards would be set.
It is estimated that cutting performance should reach 2 to 2.5 tons
per man-day within two to three years. The existing Massey Ferguson
cutting machines would continue to be used on suitable areas.
(b) Loading. Machine loading would be introduced. The machines
should be of simple construction with reverse drive; low
compaction wide track; hydraulic crab, boom and piler; and
grab height of 13 feet. Estimated performance is 20 tons/hour.
(c)  Hauling.  Uauling would be by four-wheel-drive 80-100 HP
tractors with two 6-8 ton trailers.
7.        Mill Yard Cane Handling.  Cane would be unloaded by two side-unload
electric hoists (rather than by tipping as at present) and discharged either
straight onto the main carrier feed table or into the storage area. Stored
cane would be carried to the feed tables by loaders fitted with cane fork
grabs; at present, cane is lifted by crawler cranes whose efficiency and
reliability are very low.
8.        Mechanized Equipment Repair and Maintenance.  Maintenance of
equipment has been poor. The project provides for new field repair and
maintenance equipment and changes in the layout of the machine shop areas.
Irrigation
9.        Present Position.  The existing irrigation system follows the Sir
William Halcrowe Partners design but despite a substantial investment, vir-
tually no cane has been irrigated since 1966. The system consists of tem-
porary pumping and water distribution facilities providing 35 cusecs; an 8
acre feet water storage reservoir (the main canals were originally designed



ANNEX 5
Page 4
for partial water storage but are of doubtful capacity due to faulty con-
struction and have not been used); and main distribution canals consisting
cf a main canal of 50 cusecs, a northern low level canal of 50 cusecs serving
Inspectorate III, a southern low level canal of 70 cusecs to Inspectorate III
and a western supply system of 50 cusecs to Inspectorate II.
10.       The status of the Inspectorates is as follows:
Inspectorate I.      Although water is available nearby, the area
has not been laid out for irrigation.
Inspectorate II.    Laid out for 220 acres of surface and 630 acres
of overhead irrigation. The surface system has
not been used since 1966 and considerable repair
and reconstruction are needed. The overhead
system was partially installed but abandoned; 90%
of the equipment is in the field or in store but
has to be inventoried.
Inspectorate III.   Laid out for surface irrigation but the distri-
bution system needs rehabilitation.
Inspectorate IV.    No irrigation system.
11.       Irrigation Plan.  All the estate would be put under overhead or
surface irrigation by 1977. Water requirement is predicated on a net of 6
acre inches per month; water duty at 81 acres per cusec on a 20-hour day for
overhead, and 80 acres per cusec on a 24-hour day for furrow. The existing
system would be rehabilitated and a new pumping station would be required to
serve the sugar and rice growing areas.
(a) Pumping Station. A new pumping station with five 30-cusec
pumps has been ordered to replace the existing temporary
station and would be commissioned in early 1973. HVA experts
were given an opportunity to review the pumping station
design and suggested modifications which were taken into
account by the Irrigation Division of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
(b) Development Program
(i) Inspectorate I - 1,200 acres. To be all under overhead
irrigation. It is envisioned that this inspectorate
would be irrigated by a semi-portable overhead irrigation
system. An inventory of the existing pumps, piping and
sprinklers is required before a firm recommendation can
be made. It is proposed that this irrigation system be
operational at the beginning of 1974/75 crop year;



ANNEX 5
Page 5
(ii) Inspectorates II and III - 2,100 acres. The existing
overhead irrigation system Inspectorate II is to be
rehabilitated on 650 acres that are at a higher level
than the western canal serving that area. Equipment is
located in the area and part of the system has been
installed. More equipment earmarked for this area is in
storage at the main warehouse. Existing furrow irrigation
system on 1,450 acres of Inspectorates II and III is to
be repaired and put in working order. Proposed to be
operational during the 1974/75 crop year;
(iii) Inspectorate IV - 700 acres. All furrow irrigation is
planned for this area. Additional pumping stations and
canals will be required to deliver water to the area in
sufficient quantities. Proposed to be operational for
the 1975/76 crop year;
(iv) Inspectorate V - 1,200 acres. All of this area is pro-
posed to be furrow-irrigated using an extension of the
Inspectorate IV main canal. Planned for 1976/77 crop
year; and
(v) Inspectorate VI - 1,200 acres. All area to be furrow-
irrigated from the main canal from Inspectorate V. Planned
for the 1976/77 crop year.
12.       Costs.  The estimated capital and operating costs are at Table 1.
Roads
13.       The new roads to be built are as follows:
Factory - Inspectorate I. 8 miles 40 ft wide with 1.25
ft hard gravel surface. Total cost including culverts
estimated at C 30,000.
Inspectorate II. 1.2 miles 30 ft. wide. Total cost
including culverts estimated at 0 4,800.
Inspctorate IV. 0.75 miles 30 ft. wide. Total cost
estimated at C 2,000.
Inspectorate V. 4 miles 30 ft wide. Total cost including
culverts estimated at C 10,000. All roads are scheduled
for construction in 1973/74.

Field Engineering
14.       Land preparation and cultivation procedures would be similar to
those at Asutsuare though costs would differ due to the different terrain
and soil conditions. Cutting and loading operations would also be similar.
Hauling would be based on continued use of existing equipment and there
would be no change in the mill yard.
15.       Mechanical Equipment Repair and Maintenance.  The equipment has
been much better maintained than at Asutsuare. However, the project provides
for some additional maintenance equipment, and the factory shop would in
future be used also for field equipment.
Irrigation
16.       Present Position.  Water for the irrigation, drinking and factory
water systems is supplied by a pumping station on the Pra River. A supply
canal about 21 miles long connects the pump station with the main irrigation
canal, about 2 miles long, which runs through the estate. Six pumping sta-
itions on the estate pump water from the main canal into the distribution net-
work. A separate pumping station of the Ghana Water and Sewage Corporation
cGWSC) draws water from the canal to supply their purification plant.
17.       The present water supply system is in very bad condition.  The Pra
RLiver pumping station has only one out of five pumps working; the main
canal requires cleaning; the irrigation system which has been partially
installed at very high cost is over-sophisticated and costly to maintain;
zand there are indications that the piping will not withstand the pressures.
In addition, both pumps in the GWSC pumping station are out of order.
18.       Because of the serious doubts over the reliability of the
p,resent system and its high cost, coupled with the fact that because of the
wore friable soil, irrigation is not as necessary as at Asutsuare, the
ntission proposes that only a pilot irrigation project should be undertaken.
About 600 acres would be selected in an area where the system is in reasonably
good order and the results of the scheme would be evaluated before proceeding
with any further irrigation development.
19.       In the meantime all work on the irrigation system would cease.
However, in order to ensure a reliable supply of water to the factory and
housing as well as to surrounding villages, assurances would be obtained that
Government would take all steps necessary to ensure that GWSC and the Ministry
of Agriculture put the pumping stations and canals in sound working order and
maintain them efficiently.
Roads
20.       Four miles of new 30-ft wide roads are proposed of which the total
cost including culverts is estimated at 0 12,000.

SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
FACTORY DETAILS
Introduction
1.        This annex summarizes the findings and recommendations of the
appraisal mission's technical consultants. The consultants' reports,
which contain full technical data and calculations, are available.
A. Asutsuare
Summary
2.        The factory was originally designed for a capacity of 2,000 tons
cane/day but the project provides for expansion to 2,500 tons to enable more
economic production at about 30,000 tons refined sugar/year. On the whole
the factory design is adequate and the machinery of good quality but overall
recovery is now only about 4%, whereas it should reach about 9%. The main
faults are:
(a) low cane input leading to high out-of-cane downtime;
(b) stale cane due to intermittent grinding;
(c) some existing equipment, particularly the centrifuge,
is of poor design and spares cannot be obtained;
(d) inefficient layout of auxiliary buildings; and
(e) inadequate training and personnel management.
3.        The present refining process shown in Chart A is designed to
produce a high quality raw sugar by double sulphitation, followed by
refining with activated carbon and filter. Under the project, it is proposed
to introduce the simpler and cheaper normal raw sugar process followed by
melt sulphitation. However, costs have been based on the continued use
of carbon.
4.        The proposed improvements should lead to an efficient factory
comparable with those elsewhere. The present and estimated future
recoveries are shown in the following table, and overall estimates and
production data are in Table 1.

StmLargy
6.        The factory was designed for a capacity of 1,000 tons of cane per
day and the project is designed to increase efficiency at this capacity, as
increased capacity would require not only larger cane acreages than may be
available but major capital investments in the factory. Generally the present
factory design is adequate and the machinery of good quality though of old-
fashioned design and layout. However, the factory is badly ventilated and
lit and the auxiliary buildings are inefficiently arranged.
7.        The present refining process, using the double sulphitation system
(Chart C), would be basically unchanged but temperatures and pH values
would be altered as shown in Chart D. The final product will continue to
be "mill-white" sugar.



ANNEX 6
Page 5
8.        Present supplies of factory and drinking water from the Water
and Sewage Corporation are unreliable through the bad condition of the
Corporation's pumping station, and the canal and pumping station from the
Pra River (see Annex 6).
9.        The proposed improvements should lead to reasonably efficient
production allowing for the small scale of the operation. Present (1970/71)
and estimated future recoveries are shown in the following table, and
overall estimates and production data are in Table 4.

HOUSING
A. Asutsuare
General
1.        The main estate buildings, including the factory, are located
about one mile from the village of Asutsuare and some five miles from the
town of Akuse, formerly a small river port, with a postal agency, school,
bank services and small hospital. Those staff who are at present not
housed mostly travel from fairly distant towns by GIHOC buses.
Present Housing
2.        The senior staff housing consists of 23 houses which are of a
reasonable standard. A junior staff hostel with a capacity of 48 rooms
has been built and 30 junior staff houses are partially erected. No labor
housing is in existence.
Additional Staff Houses Required
3.        It is proposed that all senior staff be housed on the estate.
The alternative would be to rent houses at Tema or Akosombo. This would
be undesirable as it would lead to a breakup of the community as well
as require excessive travel time. Provision has been made for the
completion of 30 houses and the erection of 75 new houses, a rest house
and a club. A clinic is partially complete which, on completion, will
provide very adequate facilities for staff and labor.
Additional Labor Houses Required
4.        It is proposed to erect 911 labor housing units in the factory
area and the cane plantation. This provision will enable approximately
50% of the labor requirement to be housed.
5.        A housing schedule is at Table 1.
B. Komenda
6.        Most of the present dwellings occupied by the senior staff at
Komenda are unsuitable for this category. This had been realized as long
ago as 1966 when the first of 26 new housing units was started. After long



ANNEX 7
Page 2
delays the program was nearly completed in 1972, and the 26 houses should be
completed by the end of 1979. Finance is provided in the project costs for
provision of furniture and services to the housing areas. With the completion
of these units, the senior and junior staff housing situation will be reason-
ably satisfactory.
7.        There is no labor housing at present at Komenda.  Although labor is
easier than at Asutsuare, periods of shortage have occurred and it is deemed
necessary to erect about 1,000 housing units for both seasonal and permanent
workers.

SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
FEASIBILITY STUDY OF FURTHER EXPANSION
Draft Terms of Reference
1.        The Government of Ghana wishes to engage Consultants to carry
out a study of the feasibility of expanding sugar production in Ghana
within the limits of domestic consumption. The study should assess the
merits of the following four alternative courses, which may not be
mutually exclusive:
(a) Expansion of Asutsuare estate and factory from the
capacity of 30,000 tons sugar/year designed to be
achieved under the existing program;
(b) Expansion of Komenda estate and factory from the
capacity of 15,000 tons sugar/year also designed
to be achieved under the existing program;
(c) Establishment of a new estate and factory complex
elsewhere in Ghana; and
(d) promotion of medium and small scale technology in both
farming and processing practices to produce sugar of a
lower quality than mill-white, still satisfactory for
many uses.
2.        In carrying out the study, the Consultants should examine the
market prospects for domestic sugar, the types and quality required, and
the methods of production and marketing. They should make recommendations
in particular on the balance between estate and outgrowers cane acreage and
on the viability of installing a cubing plant and/or of small packet
sugars.
3.        The Consultants should also examine and make recommendations
on the production and marketing either on the domestic market or for
export of alcohol and molasses byproducts. They should make recommendations
as to disposal, taking into account environmental considerations, of
unmarketable byproducts.
4.        In the event that the Consultants recommend expansion of Asutsuare
or Komenda or both, they should prepare a project for such expansion
suitable for financing by an international lending agency. Preparation
should include:



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(a) Details of physical execution of the project including
capital and recurrent costs with phasing and foreign
and local cost components;
(b) Estimates of additional management and staff required
for project implementation and operation;
(c) Assessment of the internal rate of return to the economy
from the additional investment assuming an appropriate
value for alternative imported sugar; and
(d) Assessment of the financial rate of return to the sugar
company from its additional investment.
5.        In the event that the Consultants conclude that there would be
a case for establishing a new sugar industry complex elsewhere in Ghana,
they should:
(a) Identify the area and indicate the cane acreage, factory
capacity and sugar output required for economic production;
(b) Give a broad estimate of the capital costs and indicate
the likely internal rate of return to the economy on the
investment; and
(c) Set out the further steps required to prepare the project
in a form suitable for financing by an international agency.
6.        In the event that the Consultants recommend the expansion of small
scale farming and processing practices, they should:
(a) identify the area or areas of expansion, indicate the
type and size of farms to be established, and analyse
their financial and economic viability;
(b) analyse the type of technology to be used for processing
and propose related farmers organizations;
(c) indicate the type of government extension services,
credit facilities and marketing arrangements that would
be required; and
(d) give a broad estimate of capital and recurrent costs and
the likely internal rate of return to the economy.
7.        It is expected that the assignment will last two months and will
require a total of 9 man-months, as follows:

SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
Sugar Industry Organization and Management
A. Ghana Sugar Estates Limited (GHASEL)
Constitution
1.        GHASEL was formed in November 1971, under the Companies Code,
1963 (Act 179). Regulations provide, inter alia:
-    For GRASEL to take over GIHOC assets and liabilities
related to its sugar and alcohol activities at Asutsuare
Komenda, to expand these activities, and to cooperate
with other cane producers;
-    that GRASEL is a private company;
-    that no dividends will be paid unless:
(a)  the Company will, after such payment, be able to
pay its debts as they fall due;
(b)  the amount does not exceed the Company's income
surplus; and
-    Directors will number seven appointed by the Government;
the representative of HVA in Ghana will be one of the
Directors and will be appointed as the sole Managing
Director of GHASEL.
Capital
2.        GRASEL's registered capital is 200,000 ordinary shares of no par
value. Government will subscribe for 190,000 shares at 0 50 per share and
the shares would be paid for by the transfer from GIHOC to GHASEL of the
assets and liabilities referred under para 1 above. Should the valuation of
these assets fall short of t 9.5 M, Government would pay cash to GRASEL
covering such shortfall. Should, on the other hand, the valuation exceed
0 9.5 M the excess would be settled by the issue of new deferred shares
in GHASEL. Such deferred shares would have no voting rights and would
receive dividends only after the ordinary shares have been paid in any year
a dividend of 0 4 per share. HVA would be issued one share for each US$50
paid in accordance with the Management and Subscription Agreement.

C. Staff Establishment
15.       The Managing Director will be based in Accra with a small staff.
The Asutsuare proposed staff will total some 28 and the Komenda some 12 ex-
patriates. The attached Organization Chart shows the distribution of the
staff, and details of the positions are at Appendix 2. A summary of the
total staff and labor employed in the Industry, excluding contractors, is
at Table 1.
D. Labor
1i5.      The four main instruments of labor legislation are the Labor
Decree, 1967; the Industrial Relations Act, 1965; the Workman's Compensation
Act, 1963; and the Social Security Act, 1965.
17.       GIHOC recently negotiated a Labor/Employer Agreement, effective
from July 1971 for a period of two years, with the Industrial and Commercial
Workers' Traders' and Woodworkers' Union of the Traders' Union Congress. The
Agreement, obviously oriented towards an industrial operation, is not suited
tc, agriculture and is one of the reasons for low productivity and management
difficulties. However, it will not necessarily be assumed by GHASEL, and the
new management will review it and, if necessary, negotiate a new labor agree-
ment prior to assumption of full responsibility.

1.        HVA-Internationaal NV (HVA) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verenigde
HVA-Maatschappijen NV, a public Dutch Company which was founded in 1879
and which first engaged in commodity trading, especially in Indonesia
where it later acquired substantial interests in production of sugar, coffee,
tea, rubber, palm oil and other commodIties. These interests were national-
ized in 1957. Other companies in the Group include:

2.        The Group has had long experience in the sugar industry, starting
in Indonesia. Since the mid-1950's it has pioneered the sugar industry in
Ethiopia which is now carried on at three estates totalling some 25,000 acres
with an annual production of about 130,000 tons of sugar. HVA also manages
the Kilombero estate in Tanzania which has an area of some 7,000 acres and
an annual production of 36,000 tons. HVA has managed these projects suc-
cessfully and also provided sound training of local staff with the result
that expatriates are being replaced steadily by nationals.

3.        In addition to its management experience, HVA has conducted
feasibility studies for rehabilitation of sugar estates in Indonesia, a
sugar project in the Yemen Arab Republic, and extension of the Kilombero
sugar factory. Its activities in tropical agriculture other than sugar
include development and management of an oil palm estate in Surinam, and
feasibility studies on tea estates, oil palm estates, citrus plantations,
and edible oil marketing.

ANNEX 14

GHANA
SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return Calculation
1.        Tables 1 and 2 show the calculation of the economic rate of return
on the investment in Asutsuare and Komenda and the estimated foreign exchange
benefits from the project. The sensitivity of the Rate of Return to changes
in costs and prices is given in Table 3.
2.        Project Life.  The life of investment in Asutsuare and Komenda
has been estimated at 30 years and no residual value has been attributed
after that period. It has also been assumed that farmers would replant
their holdings every five years over the same period.
3.        Existing Assets.  Asutsuare is at present producing about 3,000
tons of sugar per year and, without new investment, it would soon cease all
production. The existing investment has therefore been treated as a sunk
cost and all future production is assumed to result from the project. In
Komenda, on the other hand, the factory could keep producing at the present
level with regular replacement of existing equipment. The project would
increase the production and efficiency and therefore the economic analysis
is based on incremental production and incremental investment and recurrent
costs.
4.        Cost of M4aterial, Equipment and Staff.  Capital costs given in
Tables 1 and 2 are adjusted from project costs (Annex 9, Tables 1 and 2)
by deducting price contingencies (see para 8 below) and adding the incre-
mental working capital required (Annex 13, Table 4). Annual replacement
after the development period is assumed to average 8% of total investment
in Asutsuare, and 10% in Komenda from year 7 through 30.
5.        Recurrent costs are based on cost figures in Annex 13, Tables 1
and 2. Farmers' profit on cane supplied to factories is excluded.
6.        Labor Costs.  Tables 1 and 2 show separately estate and on-farm
unskilled labor costs valued at the official rate of ¢ 1.00 per man-day and
include all family labor employed by farmers (see Annex 12, Table 1 for
on-farm man-day requirements per acre and Annex 10 for estate labor).
Present conditions of employment in Ghana, however, justify the use of a
shadow wage rate for unskilled labor in agriculture. It has been estimated
in the course of a 1970 survey by B. E. Rourke 1/ that in the rural sector
1/   "Wages and Income of Agricultural Workers in Ghana", University of
Ghana, Legon, August 1970.



ANNEX 14
Page 2
the average total annual wage in cash and in kind, plus the worker's con-
tribution to his own subsistence amounted to about 0 150 a year which gave
an average of $ 0.50 a day over 300 workable days. Since that survey,
however, rural employment increased after the 1972 devaluation. Higher
prices of imported food induced an expansion of local food production with
a consequent increase of rural employment. The shadow wage rate is now
estimated at 0 0.75 per man day in rural areas.
7.        Shadow Rate of Exchange.  Preliminary information given by the
Bank Western Africa Department indicated that the Cedi, officially rated at
US$0.78 (US$1 = ¢ 1.28), is overvalued by some 30% and represents only about
US$0.59 (US$1 = ¢ 1.70). In the economic rate of return analysis this rate
has been applied to the foreign exchange component of costs and to the im-
port substitution value of sugar and alcohol (para 9). An analysis recently
finalized by the Western Africa Department showed that the shadow exchange
rate would be more correctly estimated at US$1 = ¢ 1.65, i.e. a 3% increase
in value. The use of the latter exchange rate reduces the various rates of
return by less than half a percent point.
8.        Contingencies.  The price contit7gencies included in project costs
(Annex 9) have been deducted from the capital cost used in the economic rate
of return calculation, as benefits are calculated with forecast prices for
sugar and alcohol given in real terms.
9.        Benefits.  An import substitution price of US48.3/lb for refined
sugar has been used over the project life. These prices are based on esti-
