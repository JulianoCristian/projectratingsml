PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GABON
SECOND EDUCATION 1ROJECT
(LOAN 1084-GA)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Second Education
Project in Gabon, for which Loan i084-GA, approved on February 7, 1975,
provided US$5 million equivalent to assist with a project that was estimated
to cost US$8.1 million equivalent.  TI  June 1979, US$2.1 million of the loan
amount was cancelled. The loan account was closed on June 30, 1983, and an
undisbursed balance of US$43,565 remaining in the account was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by a Unesco project completion mission under
the auspices of the World Bank-Unesco Cooperative Program.   The mission
visited Gabon in March/April 1985.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
auditing, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies in July 1986 for
comment but none have been received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1084-GA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project was prepared and appraised by a World 3ank mission
which visited Gabon in October/November 1973.  After a series of four post-
appraisal missions a loan of US$5 million (total estimated project cost being
US$8.1 mi'llion) was approved by the Board in December 1974. Loan effective-
ness followed on November 10, 1975.   After two extensions of the Closing
Date, the loan was closed with a delay of three years on June 30, 1983, and
an undisbursed balance of US$43,565 cancelied (following a cancellation of
US$2.1 million in June 1979.)
Objectives and Project Content
The aim of the project was to expand and improve technical educa-
tion at secondary and post-secondary levels.   It comprised the following
components:
(a) civil works, furniture and equipment for one upper and one
lower secondary technical school;
(b) extension of classrooms and/or boarding facilities at the
National Schools of Forestry and of Commerce, respectively;
(c)  facilities   for  the  establishment   of   "Introduction   to
Technology" courses in one upper and one lower secondary
general school;
(d) creation of an educational materials production unit; and
(e) related expert services and staff training (para. 1.03).
Implementation Experience
Project implementation moved slowly, due largely to the exclusively
part-time assignment of Government staff to the Project Unit and to their
lack of relevant experience (paras. 2.1 and 2.5).  Added to these difficul-
ties were disagreements on tendering procedures for the construction of two
project institutions which resulted in the cancellation of the corresponding
loan amount (US$2.1 million) in June 1979 (para. 2.3). In addition, in 1978,
the Government had decided to stop construction of the lower secondary school
to compensate for the effects of inflation (para. 3.5 (a)).  Nevertheless,
civil works and equipment were provided as foreseen for five of the six
schools, through an increase in Government financing.

Results
While the physical elements of this project have fared better than
the software aspects, there are nevertheless a number of shortcomings:  most
of the facilities provided suffer from architectural design flaws (peras.
3.6-3.9), some of the furniture has turned out not to be very durable (p&ra.
3.16) and, because of changes in education program content and duration, some
of the equipment purchased was not any longer needed and sold off to other
schools, the proceeds being used for the initial financing of operating costs
of the technology .ntroduction courses (para. 3.20).
It is in the areas of staff training and institution building,
however, where the more serious problems occur. The part-time nature of the
PIU which prevented the accumulation of institutional know-how, has already
been noted.   Similarly, the essential work of the three specialists in the
areas of educational reform, curriculum development and primary teacher
training could not be followed up on because most of the national staff they
trained during their tenure has moved on to other assignments (para. 3.26).
However, the work of the project architect appears to have a more lasting
impact:   although he was recruited too late to participate in the design
phase of the project institutions, he concentrated, in accordance with his
modified TOR, on the standardization and environmental adaptation of Gabonese
school designs. His development work was applied in the construction of more
than 500 primary classrooms and eleven secondary schools.   The national
counterpart he trained is now head of the school construction department in
the Ministry of Education (paras. 2.2, 3.27-3.28).
Finally, the fellowship program, already reduced to one quarter of
its original size (36 instead of 144 months), did not come to fruition
because one of the beneficiaries died after only a short time in his post and
the other three were unable to find employment in the Ministry in the areas%
they were trained in (paras. 3.33-3.34 and 6.8).
Sustainability
In this project three dimensions of sustainability merit attention:
first, the financial side.   Here the situation is generally satisfactory,
although in one school a serious maintenance problem had surfaced due to lack
of funds (para. 3.7).
Second, the demand aspects:   demand shortfalls exist particularly
for boarding facilities, resulting in use factors of only 19% at the Port
Gentil Technical Lyce4e and of about 40% at the National Forestry School
(para. 5.1).  In the case of the former school, extension of the enrollment
coverage to enroll grades 7 and 8 has also resulted in a shortage of general
classroom space and an excess workshop capacity (para. 5.5). For the latter
school, the establishment of similar institutions in neighboring countries
has deprived it largely of its foreign enrollment which had been taken into
account when determining the size of the institution (paras. 5.21-5.22).



- vii -
Third, the staffing and institutional dimension:  this is the area
which causes most concern. The absence of an institutional learning process
during project implementation and the ultimate failure of the fellowship pro-
gram have already been noted. More important the majority of teachers in the
project schools are still foreigners which introduces an element of imperma-
nence into the school system.  This shortfall is due largely to a lack of
qualified teachers which in turn derives from the poor status of the teaching
profession in the country (para. 6.13).  In the National School of Forestry
the Government has tried to fill the gap opened by the departure of expatri-
ate teachers through part-time recruitment of national staff; a reasonable
decision in view of the above-mentioned uncertainties about future enroll-
ments.   However, the pay does not appear to be competitive, resulting in
insufficient motivation as evidenced by a high rate of absenteeism (para.
5.28).
Findings and Lessons
The experience of this project shows the crucial importance of a
fulltime PIU. Whereever feasible, the unit should not be an ad hoc creation
existing only during project implementation, but be part of the regular
administrative structure of the implementing Government agency and be vested
with an appropriate hierarchical status.  In the specific Gabonese context,
continued training of national teachers and education administrators would
appear to be the foremost priority.

steam IiNEAIcE PROJCT (Lo           )
CHAPTER I
PROJECT  M     G    IAND CWMNT
A.     PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.1    The components of the Second Education Project were identified during
a joint mission by UNESCO and the World Bank in January/February 1973.
Another joint mission appraised this new Project in October/November 1973.
Four post-appraisal missions finalized the preparation in Gabon, in 1974.
The Project was approved in December 1974 and the Loan Agreement, which
was signed in February 1975, became effective in November of the same year,
six months late.  The total estimted cost was US $8.07 millon excluding
taxes (US $9 million including taxes), of which US $5 million was to be
funded by the World Bank.
B.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.2    The Project objectives were to provide support for the Government's
long-range reform efforts, and to assist in implementing interim measures
in the following areas:
(a) reform of technical education in collaboration with prospective
employers;
(i) by supporting the development of new pedagogical methods
and curricula at a lower level (grades 7-10);
(ii) by expanding, diversifying and increasing the number
of specializations at intermediary level (grades 9-12);
(b) improvement in the efficiency of certain institutions through
better use of teachers and facilities which would necessarily
involve bringing student enrolments up to levels justified
by the country's requirements in skilled labour;
(c)  development  and  testing  of  courses  in  "Initiation  I La
technologie"  for  the  lower  secondary  school  students  in
Libreville, with a view to extending these courses, in
appropriate form, to other areas of the country;
(d) reform of curricula and production of suitable teaching
mterials;
(e) provision of technical assistance for the Project, with viev
to reforming the educational and training system.
C.     PROJECT COMPONENTS
1.3   In March 1973, the  Identified Project covered all professional,
technical and agricultural education. During the preparation stage, the
agricultural component (lower secondary school of Oyem) was cancelled;
at a later stage, this component was entirely financed by the Government
and implemented with technical assistance from UNESCO. Finally, the approved
Project included:



-2-
(a) the construction, furnishing and equipping of:
(i)    a new upper secondary technical school in Port Gentil
(LTPG);
(ii)   a new  lower  secondary technical school in Libreville
(CEFT);
(iii) additional boarding places for the National School of
Commerce in Port Gentil (ENC);
(iv)   additional boarding places and classrooms for the National
Forestry School in Cap Esterias (INEF);
(v)    a publication unit in Libreville (CPME);
(vi)   facilities for the "Initiation & la technologie" courses
at the Leon M'Ba Upper Secondary School and at the Ak6b6
Lower Secondary School (CMA), both in Libreville.
(b) the technical assistance required for:
(i)    the efficient operation of the CPM;
(ii)   the Educational Reform Project;
(iii) the National Institute of Management (ENSG);
(iv)   the Project Implementation Unit.
(c)  fellowships for training the staff of:
(i)    the CPME;
(ii)   the planning division of the MOE;
(iii) the ENSG.

CHAPTER II
PROJECT AILNSTRATION
2.1    The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was set up in the Ministry
of Education (MOE) by an ordinance of the 11 July 1975, after approval
of its composition by the World Bank. Its staff officially included between
eight ane. ten members drawn from various departments of the Ministries
of Educazion,  Public Works and Planning.   In  fact,  none of them were
nominated to the PIU on a full-time basis and, being absorbed by their
Ministries' own tasks, they were not able to spend enough time on the Project
itself.
2.2    The educational facilities architect, who was also to act as the
PIU's deputy director, was recruited at too late a stage (September 1978)
for him to effectively participate in the construction design and bid
analysis.   Hls  contribution  was  therefore  limited  to  the  designing of
workshops for the "Initiation a la technologie", and to the supervision
of construction sites which were already underway upon his arrival in Gabon.
His mission, however, was extended to include all Gabonese school
construction and furniture to which he dedicated most of his time.
2.3 - Invitations to tender for civil wcrks were sent out by the Ministry
of Public Works and the PIU, after a pre-selection of fourteen contractors.
As a result of heavy overrun costs, the LTPG and ENC offers were reassessed
after the opening of bids, and contracts were awarded to contractors vho
had not made the lowest tenders.  After receiving a complaint from one
of the tenderers, the World Bank considered that awarding procedures were
not in accordance with those specified in the Loan Agreement. Therefore,
after one and a half years of correspondance and warnings to the Government,
the World Bank cancelled the loan financing for the LTPG and ENC construction
in June 1979.
2.4    The  implementatior  of  the  educational  aspects  for  each  Project
component was entrusted to the MOE departments concerned:
(a)  Technical and Professional Education Division:
(i)    Upper secondary technical school in Port Gentil;
(ii)   Lower secondary technical school in Libreville;
(iii)  National School of Commerce;
(iv)   National Forestry School.
(b)  Lower Secondary General Education Division:
- "Initiation a la technologie";
(c)  Educational Planning and Reform Division:
- Educational Reform Project



- 4 -
(d) National Pedagogical Institute (IPN):
- Educational Material Production Centre.
2.5    Although  there  was  relative  stability  concerning PIU  personnel,
the Project implementation suffered from the lack of availability of this
personnel, from a lack of experience concerning the World Bank's procedures
and from a lack of coordination and communication between the numerous
authorities  involved.  This resulted  in considerable delays, especially
during the preparation of equipment lists and their approval, as well as
in the awarding and implementation of civil works (see Annex 2).

CHAPTER III
PROJECT IMPJ4EENTATION
A.     DURATION OF THE PROJECT
3.1    Once approved, the Project was implemented over a period of eight
years instead of the five and a half foreseen (see Annex 2).  In order
to enable completion of the Project, the closing date, which was originally
set for the 30 June 1980, was postponed twice, first tc 30 June 1982 and
then to 30 June 1983, and the last loan disbursement was finally made in
September 1983.
B.     IMPLEMENTATION OF PHYSICAL FACILITIES
1. Sites
3.2    rhe sites were selected before the design stage and purchased without
any major problems. Only the location for the new buildings in the Lyc6e
Leon M'Ba compound remained undecided until 1977.
3.3    The selected sites in Port Gentil met with the technical problems
common to this area:   the sandy soil necessitates reinforcement of the
foundattons, and the high water table requires the elevation of the
buildings.   The  sloping  site chosen  for the CEFT  would ceftainly have
involved costly excavation work, had the construction gone ahead.
2. Professional Services
3.4    Except for the LNLM extension (initially entrusted to the Ministry
of Public Works), all architectural and technical studies, as well as site
supervision, were entrusted to a private consultant selected from a short
list in 1974.  Preliminary studies were started before the contract had
been signed, but changes in the architect's brief during the design stage
delayed the final drawings for 21 months.
3.5    The initial construction programme underwent the following changes
(Annex 15):
(a) the construction of the CEFT was cancelled in 1978, because
of the overrun costs of the other Project components;
(b) the 50 additional boarding places planned for the ENC in Port
Geritil were increased to 120;
(c)  the extension of boarding facilities for the INEF was increased
from 32 to 60 places.  The upgrading of the library, kitchen
and dining-room was carried out and entirely financed by the
Government, independantly of the Project.
(d) the conversion of existing buildings at the Ak6b6 Lower Secondary
School was cancelled and replaced by the construction of new
buildings in the Lycee L6on M'Ba.



- 6 -
Although these changes increased the surface area of the institutions
built, the total surface area built with Protect funds decreased by 24%,
owing to the cancellation of the CEFT component (see paragraph 3.10 and
Annex 5).
3. Architectural Design
3.6    LTPG:   The  premises  are divided  into nineteen buildings,  one or
two storeys high, linked together by covered galleries.  The construction
design is both functional and traditional and yet, the choice of heavy
concrete structures to support a light roofing seems an expensive solution,
especially in large span workshops. Other design errors should also be
noted:   the  window  dimensions  chosen  for  the  workshops  do  not  allow
sufficient natural ventilation and light; the school's main entrance is
too narrow for the number of students intended; the dining-room and kitchen
designs do not facilitate a real self-service system and the cross
ventilation of the boarding premises is insufficient. Other mistakes should
be noted concerning the design of details: the sanitary and electrical
equipment is too fragile and difficult to maintain, the glass slats of
the windows are too long and easily breakable, and noreover their use for
window openings in doors is dangerous.
3.7    ENC:  The same design was used for the LTPG and ENC dormitories;
here the problems are further accentuated by a more intensive use of the
premises and by a lack oi building and furniture maintenance; the lavatories
and showers are out of order, and some of the electrical fittings and window
glass slats have either disappeared or been broken.
3.8    INEF:  As with the ENC and LTPG, the dormitory design, with bedrooms
opening onto a central corridor, do not allow for sufficient cross
ventilation.   Classroom and  laboratory design is simple and  functional,
and in harmony with the external aspect of neighbouring buildings, while
making use of different construction materials.
3.9    LNLM:  The premises of the "Initiation a la technologie" courses
are divided into four one-storey buildings, linked together by covered
galleries. The layout of workshops, side by side in pairs, (chosen against
World Bank recommendations) allows neither for proper natural ventilatioi
nor for good acoustic insulation; window openings were set in the partitions
between the two workshops in order to provide a better cross ventilation,
but this creates acoustic problems when practical work and courses are
given  simultaneously  in  adjoining  workshops.   Protection  against  theft
was insufficient and the school has had to reinforce the doors and windows
of workshops and store rooms using its own budget.
4. Construction
3.10   After  an  international  pre-selection  of  contractors,  invitations
to bid were sent out in July 1977 and contracts were awarded in 1978, (two
and a half years behind schedule).
3.11   The construction of the LTPG, ENC, INEF and CEFT started in 1978,
and was completed between 1979 and 1981, except for the CEFT (because of
the general overrun costs of the Project, the Government was obliged to
halt the construction of the CEFT foundation level in order to transfer
funds to the construction of other institutions). The disagreement between
the Bank and the Government concerning tendering procedures (paragraph
2.3) considerably delayed completion of the LTPG and ENC (Annex 2).



- 7 -
3.12   The Lycee Leon M'Ba extensions were built  in 1981/,2.  six years
behind schedule, for the following reasons:
(a) the late appointment of the new consultant;
(b) the disagreement between the Ministry of Public Works and the
consultant regarding the contract;
(c) the delays in payment of consultant fees;
(d) the change of site in 1978, leading to a transfer of the
construction of the Akebe Lower Secondary Scnool;
(e)  the   budget   delays  affecting  the  Government's   share  of
contributions.
5. Furniture
3.13   The Project furniture was acquired through international and local
tendering, between 1978 and 1981, and the contracts were awarded the same
year.   However, the furniture could not be delivered before the offers'
expiry date because of construction delays and disagreement between the
Bank and the Government concerning the procedures followed.
3.14   A new invitation to tender was thus sent out for the LTPG furniture,
but the ENC furniture was purchased locally on the basis of the discount
prices of the previous award. The delivery of the LNLM furniture was delayed
because of a disagreement between MOE departments concerning the proposed
lists.
3.15   In spite of these difficulties, the furniture was delivered to all
the institutions in 1981 and 1982, four years later than foreseen at
appraisal, and yet the quantities were reduced in order to compensate for
the higher costs due to inflation.
3.16   The furniture is generally well-suited to use, in spite of a lack
of shelving and side tables in the LTPG and LNLM workshops, (these were
later purchased with Government funds). The furniture of the ENC boarding
facilities, however, is too fragile and as a result, after three years
use, some of the cupboards and beds are already in a state of disrepair.
6.  Equipment
3.17   The  lists,  specifications  and  quantities  were  prepared  by  the
departments concerned (paragraph 2.4) under the PIU's supervision and in
consultation with future users.
3.18   Equipment  was  purchased through  international  competitive bidding
between 1978 and 1983 except for the "Initiation a la technologie" equipment
which was procured by local tendering with the World Bank's approval. As
with the furniture, construction delays and shortcomings in the tendering
procedures, considerably delayed the equipment delivery. The cost increases,
due to monetary inflation, were partly compensated for by the cancellation
of the CEFT construction and a greater financial contribution from the
Government.



- 8 -
3.19   The delivered equipment is generally of good quality and corresponds
to higher standards than those usually authorized for technical secondary
education.  However, the LTPG equipment is, at present, under-used because
part of the teaching is given to 7th to 10th grade students for which this
equipment  was not  intended  (paragraph  5.3).   Furthermore, the  language
laboratory installed three years ago, is not yet in use as there is no
*ualified teacher, and installation deficiencies have not yet been rectified.
3.20   Two workshops in the Lyc6e Leon M'Ba are used by teachers for course
preparation whereas they were designed for 9th and 10th grade students
who so far have not yet begun the EMT courses.  As part of the heavy
equipment in the workshops remained unused, it was sold off to the Libreville
Upper Secondary Technical School and the corresponding budget was used
to run the "Initiation a la technologie" workshop.
3.21   The CPME printing equipment was delivered in January 1981, as soon
as the premises in the MOE's basement had been upgraded.  The personnel
was recruited two years later and once the equipment was in working order,
printing started in March 1983.  The Government foresees the purchase of
additional photo composition and offset equipment so that two work teams
may operate on a basis of seven hours each.
C.     TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (Annex 5)
1. Expert services
3.22   At appraisal, the technical assistance allocated under the Project,
included 15 man/months of expert services for the CPME, 66 man/months for
educational reform, 12 man/months for the ENSG and 36 man/months for the
PIU, that is to say a total of 129 man/months.
3.23   This programme was modified in 1975 with World Bank approval, in
order to adapt it tc the real needs of the country and to see throughi the
assistance allocated under the UNDP Project; the four expert posts concerning
educational reform (examinations, sciences, social sciences and mathematics)
were transformed into two expert posts dealing with curriculum development
and environment study.  The ENSG expert post was replaced by a post for
a teacher training specialist in the field of educational reform and the
architect's post was reduced from 36 man/months to 24 man/months.
3.24   This assistance programme was entirely entrusted to UNESCO in April
1976. After lengthy negociations concerning the programme and its cost,
three educational reform experts were recruited between July and December
1977, one year later than anticipated.
3.25   The PIU's arehitect was only recruited in September 1978, whereas
the Project preparation stage had already been completed and construction
was already underway. This post was later financed under the UNDP Project,
from 1980 to 1985.
3.26   The three experts for educational reform carried out important and
useful work concerning the definition of objectives and methods, training
for primary teachers and a reworking of curricula (Annex 6). The training
of counterparts was carried out throughout the whole period of the experts'
mission, but few of them remained in their initial posts once the experts
had left.



- 9 -
3.27   The  mission  of the architect,  an  expert  in school construction,
was to have a double objective:
(a) the coordination of implementation and Project administration,
as the PIU's Deputy Director;
(b) the standardization of school facilities, adapting them to
the Gabonese environment.
3.28   His job description was prepared in February 1977, but it was already
out of date when he was recruited in September 1978 (paragraph 2.2): the
Project designs had been completed, bids had been opened, contracts had
been awarded and part of the construction was already underway. Furthermore,
the lack of Government support and the non-availability of other PIU members,
meant that the expert spent most of his time on the second part of his
mission, which was extended until 1985, and financed under UNDP Project
funds at the Government's request. Standard designs developed during his
mission were used for the construction of 532 classrooms and 11 secondary
institutions. Moreover, his trained counterpart is now head of the school
construction department.
3.29   The work carried out by the experts led the Gabonese authorities
to become aware of the weaknesses concerning the qualitative efficiency
of the educational system, as well as its inadequacy for the country's
social,  economic  and  cultural  environment.   Their  work  made  a  large
contribution to the reorganization and improvement of the educational system.
They also irstituted priority innovations for physical facilities (school
construction and equipment) and for pedagogical programmes (teacher training,
adaptation of education to local environments and development objectives).
3.30   Finally, the work done for the team of experts was certainly one
of the main factors leading to the general meeting on education and training
(Decemt)er 1983).  Recommendations proposed by participants at the meeting
were subsequently    presented to a special Council of Ministers  (March
1985) in order to define priorities in the reform of the educational system.
3.31   121  man/months  of  technical  assistance  were  financed  by  Project
funds instead of the 129 man/months initially anticipated (Annex 5).
2. Fellowships
3.32   The fellowships allocated under the Project included 144 man/months
(51 man/months for the CPME, 45 man/months 'or the Education reform and
48 man/months for the ENSG).
3.33   This  programme  was  modified  and  reduced  at  Government  request
(Annex 5):
(a) a fellowship holder (in offset printing) returned to the CPME
in March 1980, but printing operations actually started in
March 1983 and his work was only effective until his decease
in December 1984.
(b)  a single fellowship was given to the Educational Reform, but
its holder did not nave sufficient initial training and it
was impossible to employ him in the department for which he
had been trained.
(c)  two  fellowhips  were  provided  for  administrative  management
and both holders obtained a doctorate in their speciality hut
on their return, the MOE was unable to employ them.



- 10 -
3.34   The whole programme concerning training fellowships, besides
having been reduced from 144 to 36 months, has not produced the anticipated
results.
D.     COMPLIANCE WITH LOAN COVENANTS
3.35   The compliance with loan covenants  is analyzed in Annex 3.  The
results are irregular and certain conditions were not met or else only
partially met, particularly regarding the contract awarding procedures
(2.03), the Pruject implementation (3.01), the hiring of contractors
acceptable to the Bank (3.03), the forwarding to the Bank of reports,
documents and data (3.05) and the maintenance of buildings, furniture and
equipment in Project institutions (4.05).
E.     WORLD BANK FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS
3.36   17 Supervision Missions took place between January 1975 and June
1983, i.e., on average one every six months, (see Table, page (iii)). Their
average duration was about one week and an architect was included in all
cases,  except six.  The presence of technical educators in the mission,
however, was far from sufficient (4 times out of 17 missions), considering
the number of technical and professional education components in the Project.
3.37   During   these   missions,   major   problems   were   identified  and
recommendations were made and transmitted to the Government.
3.38   The   Bank   might   have   contributed  towards   improving  Project
implementation, had it insisted more strongly on real Government supervision
(quarterly reports, time schedules, accounting procedures, etc.) and a
more permanent staff in the PIU.
3.39   It might also have lowered the overrun costs of construction had
there been better checking of the proposed technical design (paragraph
3.6)
3.40   Furthermore,  when  the  tendering  problems  were  raised,  a  new
supervision mission including a legal advisor might have shortened the
18 month delay which intervened between the Government's awarding of
contracts and the Bank's cancellation of a certain part of the Loan
(paragraph 2.3).

1/  The CEFT was abandoned at foundation level
C.     ASSESSMENT OF COST VARIATIONS
4.04   The heavy  cost  increases  both in CFA francs and US dollars were
mainly due to monetary inflation during the three and a half years of delays
in implementation.   The disbursement  schedule  (Annexes  10 and 11)  shows
a six year delay in the Loan disbursements, with more than half the expenses
incurred in 1983, four years after the initial cloRhg date.
The increase of cost by component in the ENC (+275%), the INEF (+303%)
and the "Initiation A la technologie" (+202%) were also caused by significant
increases in the surface areas built (Annex 4) and consequently in the
amount of furniture and equipment purchased.
The increase in consultant's fees (+201%) was due to the extension
of the scope of his mission (topography, soil test and furniture design)
and to the increase in building costs.
The cancellation of the construction of the CEFT only in fact allowed
a part of the overrun costs to be financed.
D.     SOURCE OF FINANCING (Annexes 8, 9 and 14)
4.05   Following  the  cancellation  of  42%  of  the  Loan,  the  financing
distribution was considerably modified; the Government contribution was
increased by 193% (in US $) in order to compensate for the cancellation
of US $2.1 million and to cover the overrun costs.

4.06   The remaining amount of US $ 43,565, which could not be disbursed
on the Loan before 31 December 1983, was added to the US $2.1 million already
cancelled in June 1979.
E.     UNIT COSTS (Annex 12)
4.07   In general, all unit costs increased because of the above-mentioned
reasons  (paragraph  4.04).   The  unit  costs  of  the  "Ir.itiation  a  la
technologie"   increased  more  than  the  others  because  of  the  late
implementation of its facilities (Annex 2).  The considerable discrepancies
between the increases in FCFA and in US $ regarding furniture and equipment
are due to the increase in the dollar exchange rate at the time of purchase.
F.     PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT SCHEDULE
4.0-  The  comparative  table  of  schedules  (Annex  2)  shows  considerable
delays in all categories, especially for the technology workshop (6 years)
and furniture and equipment delivery (4 to 6 years).  These delays affected
the disbursenLent schedule which saw a very slow start during the first
six years of the Project implementation, followed by a sharp acceleration
in the last year (Annexes 10 and ll).
G.     OPERATICNAL COSTS (Annex 13)
4.09   The 1984/85  operating budgets are very unequal;  the INEF budget
is relatively high whereas the ENC budget is highly insufficient, which
partly accounts  for the bad state of the premises and  furniture.   The
operating budget for the "Initiation a la technologie" was, from the
outstart, entirely financed by selling off unused and inappropriate heavy
equipment.



- 14 -
4.10   All these budgets should normlly be increased over the next few
years for various reasons; because they are, at present, insufficient (ENC,
LNIM) or the number of students will be increased (LTPG, INEF) or because
the MOE will increase the school textbook production (CPME).

CHAPTER V
PROJECT RULTSB
A.     OVERVIEW
5.1    The table (Annex 15) comparing the number of enrolments in 1984/85
in the four educational and boarding components (LTPG, ENC, INEF and LNIM)
with each institution's total capacity, shows that the premises provided
by the Project are under-occupied, especially in the LTPG and INEF boarding
facilities where occupancy rates are respectively 19% and 41%.
B.     UPPER SECONDARY TECHNICAL SCHOOL OF PORT GENTIL
5.2    The school was created to provide qualified technicians for Gabonese
industry in the following fields: (i) machinery maintenance and repair;
(ii) industrial refrigeration; (iii) electronics; (iv) naval mechanics.
It was for these four streams that the students were to be recruited
at the end of the 8th grade and they could pass an industrial certificate
(BEI) on completion of a four year course.
5.3    At present, three out of these four specialized subjects are actually
being taught, but the recruitment and graduation levels have been modified;
the courses are provided during both secondary cycles (from 7th to 13th
grade) and are normally completed at the 13th grade with a technical
certificate  (BET)  for  maintenance  and  repair,  naval  mechanics  and
refrigeration. The students of the electronics stream can pass the technical
Baccalaureate (F2) at the end of the 13th grade (Annexes 17, 18 and 19).
5.4    Theoretically  the  school's  capacity  is  480  students as  foreseen
in the Loan Agreement. The grouping of students into the four year courses
should have resulted in the graduation of one hundred students each year
(25 for each stream).
5.5    In 1985, student enrolment totals 441, and they are grouped into
seven year courses as follows:

- i6 -
Enrolment is hi&ier in the lower secondary cycle while the upper
secondary has only 111 students.   As a result,  there is a shortage of
classroom space for general courses, whilst the workshops are under-utilized.
The first generation of students will not graduate in Eleetronics before
1985 and the other streams not before 1986.
5.6    A new Mechanics and Maintenance stream will be opened for the 1985/86
school year, starting from the 12th grade, which will produce its first
graduate students in 1987.
Student Recruitment
5.7    The recruitment is carried out by means of an entrance examination
at 7th or 10th grade level.  The Examination subjects are chosen by the
examination department (DETP), the IPN, one member from higher education,
and another member from each industrial sector concerned.   The Examining
Board consists of a president and members, half of whom are from the MOE
and the other half chosen from the professions concerned.
5.8    Recruitment for the lower secondary cycle should be reduced gradually
during the implementation of the educational reform and come to a final
halt in a few years time.
5.9    Recruitment  for the Lycee covers the entire country,  but 75% of
the students are from Port Gentil which is a much higher proportion than
foreseen  at  appraisal  (50%).   This  percentage  should normally decrease
with the gradual reduction of the lower cycle enrolment.  It should also
allow a better use of the boarding facilities which are now occupied by
only 45 students, though the total capacity is 240 boarders.
Curricula
5.10   The IPN, in collaboration with the school teachers and in accordance
with recommendations made during the first meeting with the public and
private industrial authorities concerned (3 June 1983), prepared the
curricula for Naval Mechanics, Industrial Refrigeration and Mechanics
Maintenance courses.   The first curricula were sent out for comment from
public and private sector representatives.
5.11   The Electronics course (F2)  follows the French curriculum and the
Mechanics Maintenance curriculum is under preparation at the IPN.
5.12   Two six week training periods in factories for school students were
proposed at appraisal.   The organizing of such courses presents certain
problems in the Gabonese context.   However,  4 to 5 day visits to public
and private industrial sectors are regularly undertaken. Moreover, students
can visit all firms in Port Gentil and there are sIans to start certain
industrial work within the Lycee itself.
Teaching Staff
5.13   The appraisal report foresaw a school staff of 35 teachers to be
trained by the ENSET.
5.14   At present, the school staff includes 32 teachers (9 Gabonese) but
only 4 of them graduated from the ENSET.  18 teachers deal with general,
scientific or physical education and 11 others are technical and vocational
educators.



- 17 -
5.15   The present pupil:teacher ration (ca. 14) corresponds to appraisal
objectives (Annex 16).
C.     NATIONAL SCHOOL OF COMNERCE
5.16   The  appraisal  report  provided  for  50  additional boarding places
in order to increase the existing capacity from 24 to 74 places.  This
extension was intended to allow recruitment at a national level and an
increase of student capacity from 70 to 120.
5.17   At  the  request  of  the  Government,  the  Project  financed  the
construction of 120 boarding places, to accommodate the actual increase
in school enrolment (there are 220 students for 1985). The two buildings
are presently occupied by 94 boarders (31 girls and 63 boys) recruited
from all the Gabonese provinces.
D.     NATIONAL FORESTRY INSTITUTE
5.18   The Project  objective was to  extend the boarding facilities and
the classrooms so as to optimise its staff resources by increasing the
number of students.
5.19   The Project financed the construction of a new 24 bedroom dormitory,
the conversion of two classrooms into boarding facilities (12 places) and
the construction of a new building to house four classrooms and two
laboratories.   Moreover,  the  Gabonese  Government  itself  financed  the
upgrading of a dining room, a kitchen, a students' room, as well as all
the necessary equipment.
5.20   The INEF capacity has been increased from 68 boarders in 1973 to
128 at the present time.
Student Capacity
5.21   The INEF was originally intended as a regional centre, recruiting
foreigners with fellowships from their Government or from international
organizations.  At first, the projected total enrolment was 106 students,
divided into two levels:
- Engineers: 10 Gabonese, 15 foreigners;
- Technicians: 50 Gabonese, 31 foreigners.
In 1980, an extension was planned raising the total capacity to
150 students, in order to meet demand and employment opportunities.
5.22   At present, the recruitment of foreigners has decreased since most
neighbouring countries now have their own Forestry school. Furthermore,
the recruitment of Gabonese students is Much lower than forecast. In 1984/85,
INEF enrolment totalled 53 students, including 3 probationers (Annex 15),
divided up as follows:
- Engineers: 7 Gabonese, 21 foreigners;
- Technicians: 22 students all Gabonese.

The occupancy rate of the premises is, at present, 41%.
Courses and Recruitment
5.23   At Engineer level, entrance is based on proposals from the Fellowship
Commission to students who passed their C and D baccalaureates. The students
graduate after a three year course, with an Engineer's Diploma.
5.24   At Technician level, there is an entrance examination open to students
who have completed the 10th grade. After a three year course, the students
receive their Technician's Certificate and the best among them are eligible
for the Engineer level if they pass a special entrance examination, after
two years experience in the field.
The main drawback to the increase in recruitment is, at present,
the lack of Gabonese and foreign fellowships.
5.25   Most of the INEF graduates are employed in public administration,
but some of them find jobs in private firms in the forestry sector.
5.26   The INEF teaching was  inltially orientated towards the economics
of forestry.  Nowadays, however, other subjects are beginning to appear,
such as Pisciculture, but these new courses lack adequate equipment.
Moreover, the existing laboratory equipment and educational materials are
out-of-date and insufficient.
Teaching Staff
5.27   In 1973, INEF teaching staff included a Director, six teachers and
two assistants.  With the exception of the two Gabonese assistants, all
the teachers were supplied by FAO, as well as by France and Germany.
Moreover, the Institute employed seven part-time teachers.
5.28   At present,  the teaching staff includes three permanent Gabonese
teachers, six French VSN and 21 part-time teachers who are insufficiently
paid, and therefore not highly motivated.  Furthermore, there is a high
rate of absenteeism (Annex 16).



- 19 -
E.     "INITIATION A LA TECHNOLOGIE"
5.29   Within  the  general  framework  of  educational  reform,  the Project
was intended to help the setting up of n.ew courses to introduce 700 lower
secondary students from the Lycee Leon M'Ba and Akebe College, to new
technical fields. Although the Appraisal Report mentions courses for 700
students, the real ca&acity of the premises was for 1350 students, who
would follow four hours of courses per week.  At Government request, the
facilities planned in the Akebe College were grouped together in the Lyc6e
Leon M'Ba.
Student Capacity
5.30   In 1984/85, 1058 students  (13 7th grade classes and 10 8th grade
classes) attend the manual and technical education courses (EMT) in premises
financed by the Project.  In each course, the students are divided into
two groups of 23 each for practical work. The 9th and 10th grade students
are not, at the present time, attending the EMT courses.
Curricula (Annex 18)
5.31   Curricula  were  prepared  by  LNLM  teachers  and  IPN  staff.   The
evaluations and annual results of these new pilot courses have been carried
out with the help of the environment survey expert.
5.32   The current 7th and 8th grade curricula are somewhat limited, though
they seem to constitute a satisfactory complement to the theoretical science
and  mathematics  courses.   The  9th  and  l0th  grade  curricula  have  been
prepared, but so far have not been taught, due to a lack of qualified
teachers; two workshops (wood and metalwork) have been equipped for this
level, but they are, as yet, inoperative.
Teaching Staff
5.33   At present, the teaching staff includes 12 teachers, 3 full-time,
9 part-time, 10 on the basis of bilateral cooperation and the remaining
2 with local contracts.   Only one teacher is specialized in EMT teaching
at lower secondary level and all the others are trained in mathematics,
and natural and physical  sciences.   The teachers'  professional training
is supplemented by a one week training course during the December vacation
and by monthly coordination meetings.   Teachings aids are also prepared
by the IPN to help them in their work.
5.34   The imrortance of "Initiation A la technologie"  courses  seems to
have developed, as the Government decided to extend this experiment to
four other high schools (Lycees of Estuaire, Franceville, Oyem and Port
Gentil).  About 1700 students of the 7th and 8th grade are now attending
the new courses in these four schools.
F.     LOWER TECHNICAL SCHOOL IN LIBREVILLE
5.35   A stated objective of the Appraisal Report was the creation of a
technical education and training centre (CEFT), with amenities for 600
students, in order to train skilled workers and lower level technicians.
Furthermore, this Centre would have been used for the teacher training
of students from the ENSET.
Since this component was cancelled, the ENSET now has to send its
students to six different technical institutions for training periods.



- 20 -
G.     PUBLISHING UNIT FOR EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS
5.36   The Project objective was to finance equipment, technical assistance
and training, necessary to the creation of a printing shop producing the
school books and educational materials for the reform of the educational
system.
5.37   The equipment was delivered in January 1981, but the printing did
not start before 1983, when the pedagogical staff of the IPN had completed
the preparation of the first educational materials.
Staff
5.38   At appraisal, the estimated required staff was 32;  the personnel
includes, at present, 9 technicians, 6 of whom are Gabonese. The Project
financed only one fellowship in offset printing and its holder was employed
in the printing shop for four years only.
Output
5.39   So far the book printing has been limited to the production of four
booklets for primary school teachers and another one for civil instruction
courses at secondary level.
5.40   Nevertheless, there is a Large and diversified production of documents
for the MOE including administrative documents, official instructions and
programmes, news bulletins, meeting and seminar reports and feasibility
studies.
5.41   At the present time, the print-runs vary between 400 and 7000, but
in future, school books will only be printed as experimental sets and the
final copies will be printed by a part state-owned firm.
5.42   As  soon  as  the  preparation  of  educational  materials  has  been
completed, the MOE will recruit additional staff in order to increase
production.

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSIONS ADD RECOMMENDATIONS
A.     CONCLUSTONS
6.1    The World Bank's Loan closed on 30 June 1983, three years behind
schedule.   Although the disbursements were far below initial estimates,
the total Project cost went beyond the estimated amount, both in dollars
and in CFA francs.
6.2    Among the seven Project components intended to reinforce and adapt
education to the needs of the country, three met their objectives (ENC,
CPME and Education Reform support), three met them partially (LTPG, INEF
and LNLM) and one failed to meet them at all (CEFT).
Upper Secondary Technical School of Port Gentil
6.3    The buildings and the equipment provided by the Project met the
requirements for the training of upper secondary students; at present,
three-quarters  of  the  students  attend  lower  secondary  level  and  the
facilities are not adapted to their needs. Furthermore, in 1985, the number
of upper level students being trained was 111, which represents only 13%
of the initial objective and had led to the under-utilization of workshops
and boarding facilities.
National School of Commerce
6.4    The construction and equipping of the ENC's new boarding facilities
are wceU cver the appraisal capacity objectives, and have resulted in an
increase in student numbers as well as in an extension of the catchment
area for recruitment.
National Forestry Institution
6.5    The  increase  in  boarding  capacity  and  the  construction  of  new
classroom,; and laboratories gives the Institute a higher total capacity,
but for the moment, the number of enrolments has not grown. These new
classrooms are now occupied by groups of 4 to 11 students, which has not
favoured an optimisation of staff resources. In fact, the number of permanent
teachers decreased with the departure of the technical assistants, and
the present low student:teacher ratio does not encourage the Ministry of
Water and Forests to replace part-time teachers with permanent ones.
"Initiation a la technologie"
6.6    The building and equipping of the planned. facilities were six years
late. The edugational objectives of this component have only been partially
met; the courses taught only involve the 7th and 8th grades whereas the
equipment was chosen for all lower level grades (7th to 10th grade);
consequently, part of the workshops and equipment is still unused.

Public%Ltion Unit for Educational Materials
6.7   The creation of this unit under Project funds, has enabled the MOE
to print its own documents. The printing actually started six years late,
because equipment delivery and staff recruitment were delayed. Moreover,
the printing of educational materials will start properly only when the
IPN has completed its preparation work and when additional staff have been
recruited.
Support for the Reform of Education
6.8   The technical assistance for this component was increased and its
programme was entirely changed during Project implementation. The three
experts contributed a great deal to the implementation of the educational
reform, especially regarding the definition of objectives and methods,
teacher training, the renewal of teaching programmes and training of Gabonese
counterparts.
On the other hand, the three fellowship holders in educational
planning and management were unable to find employment in the educational
reform area.
ProJect Implementation Unit
6.9   The PIU's efficiency was hampered by the lack of concrete support
from the authorities; many officials were appointed, but none of them were
posted to the PIU on a permanent basis,
This lack of permanent staff resulted in Project delays and lack
of coordination.   The PIU's technical assistance was recruited too late
to have any significant effect on the progress of the Project.
B.     RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT
Construction, equipment and furniture
6.10 It would be advisable to set up an efficient maintenance and repair
service in each institution with a sufficient annual working budget. Several
urgent measures need to be taken:
- the upgrading of buildings, plumbing and the furniture of the
ENC boa-ding facilities;
- putting the LTPG language laboratory into working order;
- repair of the old INEF buildings, kitchen equipment and deep
freeze store rooms.
Course Development
6.11   The enrolment level in the LTPG and LNIM should be brought back
into line with the initial objectives:
- the LTPG lower secondary students should be progressively replaced
by upper secondary students;
- the EMT teaching in the LNIM should be extended to the 9th and
10th grade;
- the INEF recruitment for the technician level should be increased
to meet with the country's needs and to make full use of the
facilities.



- 23 -
6.12      The LTPG and INEF graduates should be followed up and their job
opportunities should be evaluated in order to continuously adjust
recruitment, curricula, courses and examinations to real needs.
Teaching Staff
6.13      The progressive Gabonization of teaching staff remains one of the
Government's objectives.   This could only be achieved by improving the
image of the teaching profession.  In the LTPG, LNLM and ENC, Gabonese
teachers are in a minority, and in the INEF, expatriate teachers were
replaced by part-time teachers, most of whom are foreigners.  This is
partly due to the poor image of the teaching profession, and also to the
lack of teachers trained in the corresponding subjects.  This gap exists
throughout   the  whole  Gabonese  educational  system,  and  a  global
strengthening  of  teacher  training  is  needed.   For  example,  in  the
"Initiation a la technologie", at the LNIM, one teacher only (an
expatriate) is actually qualified in EMT and it would seen advisable for
the other teachers to receive further training in this field.
Operating Budgets
6.14      All  Project  institutions  should have  a  sufficient  operating
budget to allow a normal maintenance of buildings, equipment and furniture,
as well as recruitment of qualified part-time teachers when permanent
teachers are not available.
Government Commitment
6.15      The project may have suffered in that the Government may not have
identified itself fully with the objectives, scope and composition of the
project. In hindsight, the drawn-out appraisal process may have been an
indication of lack of Government commitment to the project. The Government
should not embark on a project unless that project is integral to its
development program.  Once embarked upon a project, the Government must
provide it with its full support.
C.   RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE WORLD BANK
Project Preparation
6.16      When a4project component has a regional orientation, the World
Bank should, at the identification stage, take into account similar
projects (identified and/or prepared) in neighboring countries, in order
to avoid duplication of efforts and financing. This was not done for the
INEF extension which was followed by the creation of similar institutes in
the Congo and Cameroon.
Project Implementation Unit
6.17      The  experience  of  this  Second  Education  Project  should  be
considered when preparing future projects elsewhere, especially as far as
the PIU's staffing, organization, project accounting, the coordination of
education  aspects  and  tendering  procedures,  are  concerned.   The PIU,
because of its ad-hoc character (no permau*ent staffing), was in a weak
position vis-a-vis established line departments. This made implementation
difficult.



- 24 -
Procedures
6.18      Before starting a new project, the Bank should assess tendering
procedures in order to bring to light any points which are unacceptable to
the Bank, and to propose any necessary adjustments.
Construction and Equipment
6.19      The Bank should make a more thorough examination of technical
drawings for construction and equipment lists, to avoid expensive and
useless choices such as those approved for the LTPG building structure and
for the purchase of some of its equipment.
Project Design
6.20      The Bank should discipline itself in future projects to focus
project  components  within  a  coherent  design.   In  this  project,  the
complexity and plethora of components militated against effective, timely
and coordinated implementation.  The excessive number of objectives and
project components was part of the cause of the delays encountered and the
subsequent disappointing impact of the project.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EVALUATION
(EDUCATION REFORM)
A.        The teacher training expert assisted the reform in the initial
and in-service training of primary school teachers, pedagogical advisors
and  education  inspectors.   For the pedagogical research,  related to the
initial training of teachers, he assisted in the defining of objectives,
curricula, methods, and training techniques for inspectors, primary level
pedagogical advisors in the Teacher Training Insititute o" Libreville, as
well as for primary school teachers (teachers and assistart teachers).  He
also contributed to the evaluation of the curriculum, to its progressive
adaptation and to the improvement of the pedagogical organization of teacher
training institutions and their annexes.   Furthermore, he renewed the in-
service training in pedagogical centres, with training periods, prepared
by himself and his counterpart, for inspectors, teachers of teacher training
and pedagogical advisors.
B.        The curriculum development  expert worked  in close collaboration
with his colleagues in the defining of objectives, curricula, methods and
teacher  training  techniques  in  teacher  training  institutions.   He  also
demonstrated the putting into practice of these new methods, and the training
of Gabonese staff in the field. He took an active part in meetings to sort
out possible solutions to the most urgent of educational problems, especially
those concerning General Education and Student Guidance. The expert prepared
the proposals *oncerning objectives for teacher training, for those who
were taking part  in teaching by objectives.   He carried out a diagnosis
of the educational system and concentrated on the drawing up of a possible
future curriculum to be undertaken in 1978/79 by the Directorate of Research
and Pedagogy.   Within the framework of the "General Education" committee,
the expert presented a model defining teaching objectives, and their means
in terms of methods and curricula. This work has, at present, been resumed
and completed within the framework of the National Pedagogical Institute.
C.        The  environmental  study  expert  contributed  to  the  elaboration
of curricu.la as well as to their use in Teacher Training Colleges, in National
Educational Centres, in Primary Teacher Training Colleges, and in Vocational
Training Centres. This team work with the experts and main technical advisor,
attained its objective, that is the renovation of the curricula and methods
of teacher training.  The "Environmental Study" group outlined objectives
for a renewal of science education in primary schools, and over a period
of 2 school years, it organized educational information days on up and coming
subjects, predominantly scientific, and every month, by rotation, gathered
together  the  500  primary  school  teachers  from  Libreville.   Other  such
informatioral sessions provided the opportunity for demonstrations to teachers
from anr>.l:i schools and to trainee teachers from the National Education
Centre a' Iibreville.  Finally, the expert, of his own accord, brought up
to date, the texts, defining primary school curricula, and distributed 3,000
copies o. ti.em.  In the context of lower secondary General Education, he
worked out E teaching programme for biology, according to the techniques
of teach-lbg by objectives, and this programme served as a model for the
work of all the sub-committees in the other disciplines. At present, all
the work  -s being prepared to be resumed and completed.   Moreover,  the
programme -utlines for the teaching of applied sciences during the 4 years
of lower secondary General Education, are being completed with proposals
for a system of continual assessment. Finally, the expert launched an enquiry
to evaluate the degree of interest that the Gabonese pupils in the 9th grade,
had in Geology, as well as their level of comprehension and grasp of the
principal concepts.
