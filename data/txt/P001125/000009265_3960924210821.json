The project failed to achieve its objectives,\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            unlikely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, a more in-depth evaluation of the SME I\n            project should have been carried out by the Bank to better\n            assess the merits of a second line of credit. Second, the\n            project should have been supported with additional SME\n            sector work, not only to identify the inadequacies in the\n            policy environment which contributed to the failure of the\n            first SME loan but also the means to improve the\n            effectiveness of institutions set-up to help SMEs. Third,\n            successful implementation of any SME project requires an\n            integrated package of financing and technical assistance to\n            enterprises before and after they are launched. Fourth, a\n            weak and poorly managed intermediary, such as CCI, required\n            more intensive supervision. Also, more emphasis should have\n            been placed on resource mobilization. Finally, the\n            Government should have been quicker to act upon\n            recommendations made by supervision missions."}, "docdt": "1991-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
