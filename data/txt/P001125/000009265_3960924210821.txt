PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COTE D'IVOIRE: ARTISANAL, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SCALE
ENTERPRISES PROJECT
LOAN 1663-IVC
PREFACE
This is the second project completion report (PCR) on the Credit
de la Cote d'Ivoire (CCI) for a loan of US $12.6 million for on-lending to
artisanal and to small and medium-scale enterprises.  The loan also
included Technical Assistance to CCI to strengthen its capabilities in
appraising investment proposals. The loan was approved on March 6, 1979,
approximately three years before the first loan to CCI (1162-IVC) was
disbursed, and was fully disbursed by March 31, 1987. A PCR on the first
loan to CCI was prepared on May 31, 1983.
The amount originally approved was US$12.6 million. However,
during project implementation US$4.4 ,nillion was cancelled for reasons
which are described in greater detail in the main report.
The PCR was prepared by the Occidental and Central Africa
Department, based on data received from CCI, discussions with CCI
officials, Staff Apppraisal Report No. 2223b-IVC, supervision reports,
loan documents and relevant correspondence on the project. A mission
visited Cote d'Ivoire in July 1988. Comments received from the Government
of Cote d'Ivoire have been incorporated in the PCR and are attached as
Annex C.

COTE D'IVOIRE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ARTISANAL, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SCALE ENTERPRISES PROJECT
Loan 1663-IVC
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.        The main objectives of the second SME loan were to improve the
institutional setting catering to the needs of SMEs in C6te d'Ivoire by
strengthening Credit de la Cote dllvoire (CCI), the local bank specialized
in lending to SMEs.
2.       The project'e achievements fell far short of expectations.
Devising and organizing a financial and technical assistance program to
cater to the needs of SMEs is inherently complex and difficult. CCI's
financial difficulties during project implementation were, in many ways,
typical to those faced by most Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) in
West Africa. CCI was facing increesing costs of borrowed funds, serious
collection problems, stringent BCEAO credit policies, and had to operate in
an environment which was experiencing a downturn in industrial investment
activity and in which investment promotion/technical assistance
institutions such as OPEI and other instruments, such as the Guarantee
Fund, were not effective. Furthermore, because of its extensive reliance
on deposits from State institutions, like the Caisse de Stabilisation and
the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements, to finance its lending operations,
CCI was confronted with serious resource constraints when these deposits
became less readily available during the subsequent economic recession in
COte d'Ivoire. With mounting operational expenses, inadequate provisions
for bad debts and inadequate follow up of its projects, CCI could not have
fulfilled the task designated to it by the SHE II Project. In fact, these
characteristics are not very different from the reasons highlighted in the
PCR for the SME I Project for which the objectives of that project were
also not achieved.
3.        The main lessons learned from this operation ares
(a)  A more in-depth evaluation of the SME I project should have been
carried out by the Bank to better assess the merits of a second
Line of Credit. Furthermore, the technical assistance component
should have focussed more on improving CCI's financial
management and resource mobilization and not solely on its
pzoject evaluation capabilities.
(b)  This project should have been supported with additional SME
sector work, not only to identify the inadequa:ies in the policy
environment which contributed to the failure {i the first SHE
Loan but also to identify means to improve th effectiveness of

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COTE D'IVOIRE: ARTISANAL, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SCALE
ENTERPRISES PROJECT
LOAN 1663-IVC
Background
1.        This Project Completion Report (PCR) covers the second Bank loan
to assist Cote d'Ivoire's small and medium scale enterprises (SME), using
Credit de la Cote d'Ivoire (CCI) as the intermediary. The US $12.6 million
loan was approved on March 6, 1979, about three years before the first SME
Loan (1162-IVC) was closed. 1/ The project was fully disbursed by March 31,
1987, after a cancellation of US$4.4 million. This POR was prepared by the
Occidental and Central Africa Department.
Project Objectives
2.        Similar to the objectives of the first SME project, the second
loan aimed at strengthening local industrial and financial intermediaries,
integrating financial and non-financial assistance to Ivorian enterprises
and creating employment at a cost per job considerably below the existing
average for the industrial sector. The second SME project included
financing for artisans and small and medium-scale entrepreneurs.
3.        To achieve these objectives the project included the following
components:
(a) Small-Scale Enterprise Component. This component ($6.0 million)
was to provide medium and long-term financing for fixed investment and
permanent working capital to modern sector small-scale enterprises. For
purposes of the project, small-scale enterprises were defined as Ivorian-
owned, with total investments of CFAF 75.0 million ($247,000) or less, at a
cost per job no higher than the average of the SME I project, which was
$9,391. As in the first line of credit, project promotion and follow-up
was to be provided by the Office National de Promotion de l'Entreprise
(OPEI). 2/ This component was directed to all sectors, including civil
works, transport and wood processing. At appraisal, it was estimated that
37 such enterprises would be financed.
(b)  Medium-Scale Component. A second component ($5.0 million) was
provided to finance economically sound medium-scale industrial projects. A
preliminary pipeline reviewed during appraisal included ten such
1/ A PCR on the first SME Loan (1162-IVC) was prepared in May 1983.
2/ OPEI and BDI (Bureau de Developpement Industriel) were merged in 1982 to
form CAPEN (Centre d'Assistance et de Promotion de l'Entreprise Nationale).

enterprises, These projects .aould average a total investment cost of CFAF
220 million ($724,000) and would be mainly oriented toward tY3
transformation of local resources. No cost per job threshold was
established for the medium-scale component. In order to avoid undue
competition with the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement Industriel (BIDI),
which at the time also had an IBRD Line of Credit, proceeds of this
component were to be used only for firms with total investment under
CFAF 300 million.
(c) Artisans Component. A third component consisting of a $1 millior
special fund was to be established in CCI to finance the investment and
working capital of projects generated by four artisan cooperatives. These
subprojects were to be prepared by the Ministry of Tourism in cooperation
with CCI and were expected to create employment in smaller towns, at an
investment cost per job of about $2,500.
(d) Technical Assistance to CCI. The loan included US$ 600,000 to
finance the foreign exchange cost of technical assistance to strengthen
CCI's development operation. This component consisted of (i) $300,000 for
advanced and specialized financial training of CCI staff and (2) US$
300,000 to finance an expatriate advisor to help supervise the
implementation of projects.
Project Implementation
4.        The utilization of the Line of Credit started well. This was
partly due to the fact that the second Line of Credit to CCI was cheaper
than the one provided under the SME I project and was, therefore, more
attractive. However, CCI had shown liquidity and profitability problems
even before this project was signed. By 1985, because of high portfolio
arrears, the institution became severely inso.vent. (Financial data on CCI
during project implementation is providad in Annex B.) To deal with this
crisis, a number of safeguard measures were introduced in mid-1985,
including freezing all new lending activities by CCI as well as
intensifying loan collection. Finally, in July 1986, CCI's mana6ment and
board were suspended and the institution placed, along with BIDI, under the
management of an "Administrateur Provisoire" whose mandate was to: (a) stop
all lending activities of both institutions; (b) clean up their accounts;
(c) collect outstanding loans; (d) reduce staff; and (e) formulate a
comprehensive rehabilitation plan for each bank. On the basis of the
recommendations of the Administrateur Provisoire, CCI and BIDI were merged.
This new bank was to (a) focus over the next few years on recovery of non-
performing portfolio taken over from the old structures; (b) develop an
efficient management information system; and (c) become a private bank,
with significant equity participation by Ivorian nationals and possibly by
a foreign bank which could provide the necessary technical support. SME
lending would only be resumed after completion of the rehabilitation
program. However, the merger of CCI and BIDI was not long lasting. All
efforts to identify a private sector partner failed and CCI's and BIDI's
assets were finally liquidated.

Project Results
5.        The project's achievements fell far short of expectations.
Devising and organizing a financial and technical assistance program to
cater to the needs of SMEs is inherently complex and difficult. CCI's
difficulties at the time were, in many ways, typical to those faced by most
Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) in West Africa. CCI was facing
increasing costs of borrowed funds, serious collection problems, stringent
BCEAO credit policies, and had to operate in an environment which was
experiencing a downturn in industrial investment activity and in which
investment promotion/technical assistance institutions such as OPEI and
other instruments, such as the Guarantee Fund, were not effective.
Furthermore, because of its extensive reliance on deposits from State
institutiono, like the Caisse de Stabilisation and the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissements, to finance its lending operations, CCI was confronted
with serious resource constraints when these deposits became less readily
available during the sebsequent economic recession in C6te d'Ivoire. With
mounting operational expenses, inadequate provisions for bad debts and
inadequate follow up of its projects, CCI could not have fulfilled the task
designated to it by the SME II Project. In fact these characteristics are
not very different from the reasons highlighted in the PCR for the SME I
Project for which the objectives of that project were not achieved, namely,
(a) difficulties created by BCEAO interest rate policy for SMEs; (b)
ineffectiveness of Government instruments such as the Fonds de Garantie the
SONAFI Fonds de Participation, the lack of effective technical assistance
by OPEI and a lack of genuine commitment by Government to make these
instruments work; and (c) the lack of close supervision of subprojects by
CCI and its failure to establish a Supervision Section, despite continuous
requests by the Bank to do so. The experience gained through the Bank
SME I Loan should have discouraged going ahead with a second SME project.
6.        The Line of Credit financed a total of 86 subprojects, of which
68 were SSEs and 18 MSEs. A substantial number of the enterprises financed
are either already out of business or in the process of being liquidated.
Of the 86 enterprises financed, information on actual performance was
available for only 27 enterprises. Out of these 27, about 60Z have failed
to realize the volume of sales estimated at time of appraisal; four
operated at significant losses, and actual net profit for the remaining 23
represented less thani 50Z of the levels initially projected. 60Z of the
enterprises responding to the survey, operate below their estimated
capacity utilization and of the 43 enterprises which provided information
on actual employment created, 36 (84Z) created less than the number of jobs
estimated. While these 43 enterprises were expected to create 875 jobs, in
fact they created only 494. (Details on enterprise performance are given in
Annex C.) CCI is currently, with UNDP assi- qnce, reviewing projects in
its portfolio to identify those which are potentially viable.
7.        The objective of the artisan component was also not achieved.
The CCI/Ministry of Tourism collaboration on cooperatives never
materialized and the special fund established under this component was
never utilized.



8.        The tcchnical assistance component for CCI was to (a) upgrade
CCI's financial management and firancial analysis capability and (b) help
CCI become more active in the industrial sector and in supervising more
closely physical implementation of projects in its portfolio. These
objectives were not achieved. Efforts to improve the selection ox
enterprises also failed, although causes of failure in many cases did not
directly result from inadequate appraisal, but also from the general
slowdown in the Ivorian economy.
9.        The following are some lessons that can be drawn from our
experience with this project:
(a) Although a PCR on the first SME Project was not prepared before
the SME II Project was approved, Bank supervision reports
indicated, even before loan signing, that CCI was facing
liquidity problems and that its operating income could not cover
its expenses. It is possible that CCI's financial difficulties
did not appear severe enough at the time of appraisal and that
CCI management's awareness of these problems and the steps it
was taking to improve the situation, were perceived as
surmountable with some technical assistance. Nevertheless, the
Bank should have carried out a more in-depth evaluation of the
SME I project to better assess the merits of a second Line of
Credit. Furthermore, the technical assistance component should
have focussed more on improving CCI's financial management and
resource mobilization and not solely on its project evaluation
capabilities.
(b) This project should have been supported with additional SME
sector work, not only to identify the inadequacies in the policy
environment which contributed to the failure of the first SME
Loan but also to identify means to improve the effectiveness of
institutions set-up to help SMEs, such as OPEI.
(c) The poor performance of small and medium scale enterprises was
partly due to the lack of an effective system of technical
assistance/extension services. Successful implementation of any
SME project requires an integrated package of financing and
technical assistance to enterprises before and after they are
launched;
(d) During the seven-year project period, from Board approval to
closing date, there were a total of five supervision missions
which took place at an average interval of over 13 months. While
this effort may appear adequate, a weak and poorly managed
intermediary, such as CCI, required more intensive supervision.
Supervision missions also seemed to focus on the lending aspects
of the project and did not give equal emphasis on resource
mobilization.
(e) As the CCI majority shareholder (82Z), the Government should
have been quicker to act upon recommendations made by

supervisions missions. Considerable delays in acting
upon these recommendations, particularly with regard
to CCI's serious problems such as high arrears,
insolvency and operational deficiencies, resulted in
further aggravating CCI's financial position.

BANQUE CENTRALE DES ETATS DE L'AFRIQUE DE L'OUEST

Re:         Your letter dated June 9, 1990
Dear Sir,
Following the above-referenced letter, please find below our
comments on the document referred to above.
As a whole, the PCR Cr. i663-IVC does not call for any major
comments. However, it would be useful to update the document and
specify that the "Office de Promotion de 1'Entreprise Ivoirienne* (OPEI)
and the 'Bureau de Developpement Industriel" (BDI) merged in 1982 to
form the "Centre d'Assistance et de Promotion de l'Entreprise Nationale"
(CAPEN).
As far as CCI and BIDI are concerned, it must be noted that
the prospect of a merger between these two banks could not be carried
out. CCI's and BIDI's assets were liquidated and the merger approval
withdrawn.
In terms of lessons to be drawn from project implementation,
we share the responsibility for the lack of success of the project:
-     sections a), b) and c) show the inadequacy of the precautionary
measures.
sections c) and e) point out the responsibility of the Ivorian
Government.
Sincerely,
Charles KONAN BANNY
National Director
