of\n            two parts. Part A would set up a new interagency information\n            and education program for the promotion of the small family\n            norm. Part B would strengthen rural health and family\n            planning services. The objectives of the project are: to\n            continue the efforts begun under the first IDA-financed\n            project to reduce fertility; and (b) to improve the\n            accessibility and quality of rural health services to reduce\n            mortality and morbidity in rural areas. The project would\n            have a duration of three years and constitutes the first\n            phase of a six-year program."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
