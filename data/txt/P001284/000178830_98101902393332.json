Part B would strengthen rural health and family\n            planning services. The objectives of the project are: to\n            continue the efforts begun under the first IDA-financed\n            project to reduce fertility; and (b) to improve the\n            accessibility and quality of rural health services to reduce\n            mortality and morbidity in rural areas.
