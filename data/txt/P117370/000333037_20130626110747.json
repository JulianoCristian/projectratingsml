"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the First, Second, and Third\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits Project (PRSC) for Zambia\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: success was more noticeable in areas which\n            coincided with Government's own priorities and where\n            Bank had other instruments to engage outside the Poverty\n            Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) framework. This is quite\n            evident in the declining overall performance of the\n            Government on Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)\n            indicators in the past few years. There are several reasons\n            behind this conclusion. One, the PAF document itself is the\n            outcome of protracted negotiations and compromises between\n            different groups of donors and the Government. As such it\n            reflects the minimum common denominator as to what can be\n            achieved and is unlikely to be a true reflection of\n            Government's most strongly held priorities. Two, the\n            context of budget support in Zambia has changed; ODA has\n            declined dramatically as a share of Government's\n            resources and unless the PAF mimics Government's\n            strongly held priorities, it will have limited impact. The\n            Bank should manage transitions within the Bank team more\n            systematically. This is indeed a very general point but in\n            this particular case it became very important. The\n            Bank's absence from key PAF revision discussions due to\n            staff transition had significant implications for the PRSC.\n            It led to a misalignment between PAF and PRSC and strained\n            relations between the Bank, donors and government."}, "docdt": "2013-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
