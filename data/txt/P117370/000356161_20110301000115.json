Support\n            Credit (PRSC) operation supports two objectives: a) preserve\n            macroeconomic stability and to improve public sector\n            performance, and b) support broad-based growth by improving\n            the efficiency in the energy sector and reducing the cost of\n            doing business. The PRSC is aligned with the Bank's\n            Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Zambia for the period\n            2008-2011. The CAS identifies direct budget support as the\n            primary instrument to assist Zambia in achieving its reform\n            program and maximizing the impact of its poverty reduction\n            strategy. The PRSC process also provides a forum for ongoing\n            policy dialogue with the government and other major\n            stakeholders; it promotes coordination between the\n            government and the donor community and complements the\n            continuing efforts of other cooperating partners. As a\n            result, economic growth has not generated the expanded\n            employment opportunities and increased income necessary for\n            further poverty reduction. Zambia must successfully\n            diversify growth across labor-intensive, pro-poor sectors if\n            the country is to make significant progress in achieving its\n            poverty reduction goals."}, "docdt": "2011-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
