                       · GRZ establishes a baseline for the number of licenses to be
                           eliminated or streamlined.
Program Development    The program is aligned with the CAS FY 2008-2011, which
Objective(s) and       identifies PRSCs as the primary vehicle to support the Bank's
Contribution to CAS    macroeconomic and public expenditure management program.
                       The CAS provides a resource envelope of 15-20 percent of the
                       IDA country allocation for budget support. The objectives of the
                       PRSCs will contribute to:
                       · Preserving macroeconomic stability and improving public
                           sector performance; and
                       · Supporting broad-based growth by improving efficiency in
                           the energy sector and reducing the cost of doing business.
                       In pursuit of these objectives the program supports the
                       achievement of a number of outcome indicators in
                       macroeconomic management, public sector reform, public
                                    viii
                 finance management, energy policy, and private sector
                 development.
Risks and Risk   Political Risks. Political pressures in the run-up to elections in
Mitigation       mid-2011 could derail some reforms and weaken the country's
                 fiscal stance. To mitigate these challenges IDA, working in
                 close collaboration with GRZ and other cooperating partners,
                 including the IMF under the ECF arrangement, is striving both at
                 the national and sector level in favor of continuing the reform
                 program. A frank and open dialogue is being pursued with the
                 political leadership at the highest levels, including Members of
                 Parliament, aimed at highlighting the importance of continued
                 reform momentum.
                 Lower-Than-Expected Growth.            The Zambian economy's
                 reliance on a single commodity export could expose it to severe
                 external shocks if copper prices fall. The Bank and other donors
                 are helping the government to promote economic diversification
                 through program support and policy dialogue on structural
                 economic reforms. These efforts appear to have been successful,
                 and Zambian exports of non-mineral products rose from
                 US$700 million in 2007 to about US$1 billion in 2009.
                 Governance Issues. Concerns have been raised regarding
                 governance issues involving the Ministry of Health, the roads-
                 sector agencies, and the government's overall commitment to
                 anticorruption efforts. The risk is that improvements in some
                 sectors could be offset by continuing problems in other sectors.
                 In order to mitigate this risk the Bank, together with GRZ and
                 other cooperating partners, has been actively following the
                 activities of the Office of Auditor General and supporting efforts
                 to adopt new corrective measures, including strengthening the
                 authority of the Parliamentary Accounts Committee, which plays
                 an important oversight role both with regard to specialized audits
                 and to the audits of the annual financial reports.
                 Implementation Capacity. Although the overall program of
                 reforms is encouraging, there are challenges in policy
                 implementation, specifically in terms of policies linked to public
                 sector reform, the civil service compensation structure, and
                 budget execution in public finance management that could derail
                 the reform efforts encompassed under the PRSC-2. To mitigate
                 these risks the Bank and other donors are supporting capacity
                 building efforts initiated as part of the public sector
                 management, public expenditure management and financial
                 accountability reform programs. A number of cooperating
                 partners are also implementing complementary reforms
                 involving oversight institutions, including the Office of the
                 Auditor General and the Parliament.

1.      The following is the Pr ogr am Document for a pr oposed Second Pover ty
Reduction Support Cr edit (PRSC-2) to the Republic of Zambia in the amount of
SDR 19.3 million (US$30 million equivalent). The proposed PRSC-2 is the second in a
programmatic series of three annual poverty reduction support credits to the country as it
implements a program of reforms designed to foster broad-based economic growth.
These reforms are articulated in the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, the
Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) covering the period from 2006-2010 and its
successor, the Sixth National Development Plan for 2011-2015. Of the variety of
reforms and policy objectives set forth in the FNDP and SNDP the PRSC series is
structured to support the government's strategy in three key areas: (i) maintaining
macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening public sector performance; and (iii)
promoting broad-based growth through improving the efficiency of the energy sector and
reducing the cost of doing business.

2.     The PRSC is aligned with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Zambia for the period 2008-2011. The CAS identifies direct budget support as the
primary instrument to assist Zambia in achieving its reform program and maximizing the
impact of its poverty reduction strategy. The PRSC process also provides a forum for
ongoing policy dialogue with the government and other major stakeholders; it promotes
coordination between the government and the donor community and complements the
continuing efforts of other cooperating partners.

3.     The proposed PRSC-2 is the product of a broadly collaborative process and
will be implemented in conjunction with other cooperating partners. The PRSC
program is part of a harmonized approach to providing budget support in line with the
2005 Paris Declaration. Zambia's cooperating partners have formed the Poverty
Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) group 1, which is led by the government and dedicated
to improving the quality and effectiveness of direct budget support. The PRBS has
agreed on a common review process, the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF),
which is a multi-year matrix of policy reforms supported by the PRBS group. The
PRSC2 triggers are drawn from the PAF for the period 2009-2011.

                         II.        COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                    A.      COUNTRY OVERVIEW

4.      Following a long period of low growth and declining per capita income
Zambia has enjoyed a decade of rapid economic expansion, but serious challenges
remain. Moderate growth rates observed between 1964 and 1972 were largely fueled by
rising copper prices rather than broad-based gains in productivity, and the economy
stagnated in the 1980s and 1990s due to a highly inefficient degree of state control over

the economy in general and the mining sector in particular. After 1996 the economy
began to grow again, albeit slowly, as a result of a relatively stable external environment
and improved macroeconomic policies. 2 Economic growth accelerated in the 2000s
following the privatization of the mining industry and a return to fiscal discipline and low
inflation. However, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in 2009 was still
equivalent to just 64 percent of GDP per capita in 1965. Narrowly focused and limited
growth has translated into falling living standards, and Zambia's rank in the UN Human
Development Index for 2010 is 150 out of 169 countries.

5.      The recent return to high growth rates and policymakers' demonstrated
commitment to reform have enabled the Zambian government to increase the fiscal
space for investment in infrastructure and the social sectors. In 2005 and 2006 a
major debt reduction effort undertaken as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country
(HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and amounting to approximately
US$6 billion, has afforded the country much-needed latitude to increase spending on
priority development objectives. This has been complemented by a combination of
prudent macroeconomic management, market liberalization and privatization efforts, and
investments in the copper industry and related infrastructure, which have helped to spur
economic growth to about six percent per year since 2000.

6.      Zambia continues to boast rich endowments of natural resources both within
and beyond the mining sector. Zambia has large mineral and agricultural resources, but
copper mining and processing remains the mainstay of the economy and the primary
source of national income and foreign exchange earnings. The mining sector leads GDP
growth and mineral products (especially copper and cobalt) are the country's main export
(at close to 80 percent, combined). However, the mining industry is concentrated in the
cities of the populous but relatively isolated Copperbelt region. Agriculture, by contrast,
is the major economic activity of the Zambian people and the agricultural sector remains
largely underdeveloped, despite its potential to reach much broader segments of the
population, and in particular the rural poor.

7.       Zambia has maintained peace and political stability since independence in
1964, despite changing political regimes. Zambia was a multi-party democracy for the
first eight years of independence, but became a one-party state in 1973. The one-party
government followed socialist principles of economic management, and many private
firms were nationalized during its rule. In 1991, multi-party democratic governance was
restored following the victory of reinstated opposition parties in the general elections.
Since then, the country has conducted five additionally elections, all of which were
peaceful.

8.      Despite its continuing political stability and accelerating growth rates, the
livelihoods of the Zambian people have only modestly improved in the past two
decades. According to the 2006 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey, the national
poverty rate is now 59 percent, down from 68 percent in 1996. And poverty levels

                                               2
remain substantially higher than average in rural areas. With a majority of the population
dependent on subsistence agriculture, rural poverty remains at 77 percent (though down
from 84 percent in 1996). In the same period, urban areas have benefited from the high
rate of economic growth, and as a result urban poverty fell to 27 percent in 2006 (from
41 percent in 1996).

9.      The recent period of sustained economic growth has had a limited impact on
poverty reduction. The sources and benefits of economic growth have been narrowly
focused on capital-intensive industrial (mining and construction) and services sectors.
The labor-intensive rural economy, conversely, has only experienced substantial growth
in the last two years, thanks to good weather conditions rather than any structural
increase in agricultural productivity. As a result, economic growth has not generated the
expanded employment opportunities and increased income necessary for further poverty
reduction. Zambia must successfully diversify growth across labor-intensive, pro-poor
sectors if the country is to make significant progress in achieving its poverty reduction
goals.

                Box 1: National Accounting and "GDP-growth Complacency"
    The traditional measures for accounting national wealth and economic productivity (GDP in particular)
    may be misleading in a resource-rich country like Zambia. Typical methods for calculating national
    wealth do not consider the depletion of natural resources by extractive industry, and GDP excludes the
    remitting of profits to foreign companies; as a result, these measures may overestimate both national
    savings and income. Sustainable long-term development requires increasing the national wealth for
    future generations. Wealth must be conceived broadly to include not only the traditional measures of
    capital, such as produced and human capital, but also natural capital. Natural capital comprises assets
    such as land, forests, and subsoil resources. All three types of capital--produced, human, and
    natural--are key inputs for sustained economic growth.
    For countries with significant exhaustible natural resources and important foreign-investor presence, a
    measure such as the adjusted net national income and adjusted net savings can provide an important
    complement to GDP for assessing economic progress. According to these measures, which
    incorporate the costs to all forms of national capital, most resources-rich countries in Sub-Saharan
    Africa--including Zambia--present low or even negative rates of adjusted net savings despite the
    recent commodity boom. Recent analyses suggest that Zambia's gross savings rate is sufficient to
    exceed either the depreciation of physical (produced) capital by the mining sector, or the depletion of
    its natural capital through resource extraction, but not both. As a result Zambia's adjusted net savings
    rate is negative, slightly less so than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa, but still well below the
    average for low-income countries.
    While mining taxes account for 1 to 2 percent of GDP, dividend outflows have reached 10 to
    12 percent of GDP in recent years. Sustainable and more inclusive growth in Zambia will depend on
    the government's ability to capture a fair share of the economic rents from the mining sector. In order
    to ensure that the national wealth increases over time, the depletion of exhaustible resources must be
    counterbalanced by an enhancement in the country's productive capacity (i.e., in its physical and
    human capital); fiscal policy must play a central role in achieving this goal. 34

10.     The concentration of growth and relative enrichment of the urban
population has accentuated the income divide between the urban and rural
economies. The urban-rural income divide is large and growing, and the Gini coefficient
rose to 52.6 in 2006, from 47.4 a decade earlier. The high poverty levels and low living
conditions of much of the population, despite recent high growth rates, are a reflection of
the high concentration of growth in the urban and mining sectors coupled with persistent
low productivity in the mostly subsistence-based agricultural sector.

11.     Along with the moderate reduction in overall poverty, social indicators have
improved in the last decade, but at an uneven pace. There have been continued
advancements in education indicators, including rising enrollment rates at the primary
and secondary levels, with more marginal improvement in the youth literacy rate (see
Table 1), but challenges remain, including overcrowded classrooms and limited access to
education in rural areas. There have also been some improvements in health outcomes,
including a reduction of the under-5 mortality rate and a decline in maternal mortality
rates, but Zambia is still not likely to meet the 2015 Millennium Development Goals for
the health sector. The prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/ Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has remained at about 15 percent for the 15-
49 year-old cohort.

12.     Concerns regarding corruption in the public health and road transportation
sectors over the past two years have had a great impact on the policy dialogue
between the government and its cooperating partners. The government's Office of
the Auditor General has played a major role in investigating these sectors. As a result of
these investigations and the ensuing request from Parliament (through the Parliamentary
Action Committee) that the executive branch take action to address the misuse of public
funds, key institutional changes have been made both at the Ministry of Health and the
road-sector agencies (Road Development Agency and Ministry of Works and Supply).
Ongoing dialogue between government officials and other stakeholders in the road sector
has resulted in newly reformed institutions evidencing a greater degree of transparency.

13.     Following the completion of the HIPC and MDRI debt relief initiatives the
role of the donor community in the public accounts has gradually declined and is
now not as prominent as in many other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Over the
past 2 years (2008 and 2009) budget support, including project grants, amounted to about
17 percent of total government spending, compared to 22 percent in 2004 and to a peak
of 27 percent in 2002. This is well below the 33 percent for Mozambique, 32 percent for
Malawi, and 21 percent for Tanzania observed during the same period.

                         B.      RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

14.     Zambia's economy is continuing its strong growth performance. The
economy weathered the effects of the global economic downturn in 2009 following the
financial crisis in 2008; recent growth was boosted by investments in the mining sector
that came online in early 2009. The economy is estimated to have grown by 7.3 percent
in 2010, up from 6.4 percent in 2009, and 5.7 percent in 2010. Growth has been led by
increased mining output, an expansion in construction activities, the robust recovery of
tourism and a spike in agricultural production, including two successive bumper harvests
for the staple foodstuff, corn (maize), which more than doubled its output from two years
ago.

15.     Inflation has fallen to single digits thanks to declining food prices. After
peaking at over 16 percent in late 2008, spurred by rising food and fuel prices, year-on-
year consumer price inflation fell to single digits (9.9 percent) in December 2009 and
7.2 percent in 2010. The downward trend in inflation is almost entirely the result of a
rapid decrease in prices for most food items due to the bumper harvests (in 2009 and
2010) mentioned above. Food price-inflation dropped to just 4.4 percent in, from
8 percent in 2009 and just above 20 percent in 2008.

16.      The flexible exchange rate regime has allowed the economy to adjust to
external shocks, and Zambia's external position has improved. The flexible
exchange rate has allowed currency values to mitigate sharp changes in copper prices,
while enabling interventions in the domestic foreign-exchange market to address excess
volatility. Estimates of Zambia's balance of payments show that the current account
deficit (including grants) narrowed to 2 percent in 2010, down from 3.2 percent in 2009
and 7 percent in 2008. This drop in the current-account deficit has been driven by strong
copper exports (in terms of both export volume and global market prices), which has kept
the trade balance in surplus for the last 18 months. Imports are expected to growth a bit
faster in the coming years due to the recent strengthening of the domestic currency.

17.     The international reserve position has similarly strengthened. Thanks in part
to the special allocation of SDRs and augmentation of access under the Extended Credit
Facility (EFC), the Bank of Zambia accrued US$714 million during 2008-2009;
international reserves are now close to US$2 billion, sufficient to finance more than four
months of potential imports. This contrasts with just over US$500 million of
international reserves held during 2005-06. The strong international reserve position has
provided the authorities the necessary monetary space to reduce exchange-rate volatility.



                                            5
This was evident when the Bank of Zambia used its strong reserve position to reduce
exchange-rate effects stemming from the current Euro Zone sovereign crisis.

18.     Public sector external debt remains low following extensive debt relief in
2005-06. Zambia's successful completion of the HIPC and MDRI programs substantially
reduced its stock of public external debt, which dropped from about 86 percent of GDP
(US$7.2 billion) in 2005 to around 9 percent in 2006 (US$0.5 billion). Since then, the
authorities have adopted a conservative debt policy, borrowing mostly on concessional
terms. This has produced a modest rise in the stock of public external debt to an
estimated 10.2 percent of GDP in 2010. Much of this increase reflects the use of the IMF
credit and concessional borrowing from other multilateral agencies, including the Bank.
Non-concessional external debt has also begun to grow, albeit slowly, on account of
rising infrastructure investment requirements and to meet spending targets agreed upon
with the IMF.

19.     Financial sector conditions have improved in 2010 as credit to the private
sector has recovered from the effects of the global financial crisis. In the wake of the
global recession in early 2009 Zambia's financial sector faced a sudden spike in non-
performing loans (NPLs), especially in the agricultural sector and by private households.
The banking system responded by reducing lending to the private sector and redirected
funds to relatively low-risk investment in government securities. After a period of
sustained increases in private-sector credit before the global financial crisis, credit to the
private sector contracted by 6 percent in 2009, but has recovered in 2010 at an estimated
one-year increase of 12 percent. By November 2010, NPLs were still high at about
15 percent of total credit (compared to a pre-crisis level of about 10 percent) mostly
explained by the deterioration of the largest fourth Bank that was finally intervened by
the Bank of Zambia in mid-December 2010.

20.     Fiscal revenues strengthened in 2010 following a brief drop in 2009. Total
fiscal revenues (excluding grants) reached an estimated 17.9 percent of GDP in 2010, up
from16 percent a year earlier. Relative to GDP, collections of income and value added
taxes are estimated to have risen in 2010 compared to the two previous years, while
excise taxes and custom duties have remained basically constant. Mining taxes also rose
sharply in 2010, reaching about 2.3 percent of GDP compared to just 1 percent a year
earlier, largely due to the belated collection of tax arrears and an increase in tax
collections from the mining sector.

21.    Following years of structural deficits, the Zambia electricity utility ZESCO
Ltd., has recently initiated a plan to increase tariffs to cost-reflective levels to allow
private sector participation in the energy market. ZESCO current revenue reached in
2010 a level to cover its operating costs, and the transition to cost-reflective tariffs will
enable both the state utility and private investors to turn a profit in new investments.
ZESCO's positive contribution to the fiscal accounts is a major policy achievement and
substantially reduces the potential financial and programmatic risks posed by the
accumulation of contingent liabilities in public enterprises.




                                              6
22.     The relatively high and increasing wage bill--which is rising both in absolute
terms and as a proportion of domestic revenues--remains a concern over the
medium term. Wages and salaries are equal to slightly more than 50 percent of
domestic revenues, substantially offsetting the increased fiscal space generated by the
HIPC and MDRI debt reduction programs. On average nominal wages for public
employees have been increasing at a faster rate than inflation. The need to expand
service delivery in education and healthcare through new hiring has also contributed to
increase the wage bill, but rising real wages and the increasing share of special
allowances have played a major role. 5 This trend must be contained over the medium
term to allow for much-needed infrastructure investment and the operation of a stronger
countercyclical fiscal policy. The government has undertaken a review of its
compensation structure, and a new wage and salary policy is expected to be implemented
following the general elections in mid-2011.

23.    The public sector pension fund could experience a solvency crisis in the long
term, as it faces an actuarial deficit, if no reforms are implemented. The government
program is addressing this issue, over the short term, by eliminating arrears to the Public
Sector Pension Fund (PSPF), and over the long-term by implementing measures that will
guarantee its solvency.

24.     The authorities are nevertheless taking measures to bolster fiscal revenues.
With the support of the IMF the government has committed to undertake a
comprehensive review and reform of the tax system by reviewing tax exemptions and
strengthening tax administration. Discussions are underway to reach a new contractual
agreement with a number of mining firms, which should substantially boost mining tax
revenues.

25.     Following higher-than-expected fuel subsidies in 2009, the government
committed to implementing a cost-reflective pricing system for petroleum products
in 2010. Following the jump in international oil prices in mid-2008, the government cut
excise duties on petrol and diesel from 60 and 30 percent to 36 and 7 percent,
respectively. In addition, pump prices for petrol and diesel were kept constant for over a
year. Prices rose in January and August 2010, following an increase in excise taxes, but
also moved closer to the cost of importation and processing. The government has
formally agreed with the IMF to maintain cost-reflective pricing for petroleum products
in 2011. 6

  According to recent research by the World Bank (World Bank. Zambia Public Expenditure Review.
Background paper: "Analysis of the Fuels Industry in Zambia" May, 2010), the cost of Zambian fuel
products was the second highest in the world in 2008. Fuel subsidies, and lower taxes, contributed to
reducing in 2009 and 2010, but Zambian fuel prices are still substantially higher than in most countries in
the region. At US$1.40/litre the price of diesel in Zambia was the fourth most expensive in Africa.

                   Box 2: Government Intervention in Agricultural Markets
    The costs of the government's interventions in the agricultural sector have taken an increasing toll on
    the fiscal accounts in recent years. The two largest ongoing policy interventions in the agricultural
    sector are the Farmer Input Support Program (FISP, previously known as the Fertilizer Support
    Program, (FSP)--which subsidizes fertilizer, seeds, and other agricultural inputs--and the operation of
    the Food Reserve Agency (FRA)--which intervenes in the market for maize (the most widely
    cultivated crop in Zambia as well as the primary staple food). These two programs account for more
    than 70 percent of government spending on agriculture.
    The cost of the FISP represents about one half of the budget allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture, or
    about 3.7 percent of domestic revenues (0.7 percent of GDP). Despite its extraordinarily high cost, the
    FISP has a very limited reach in terms of beneficiaries and little impact on agricultural production.
    The FISP is not effectively targeted: poor farmers are frequently unable to access the subsidy regime,
    and a large proportion of the subsidy is devoted to areas where there is already an adequate private-
    sector supply of agricultural inputs; more remote, less populous areas--where farmers have fewer
    private sector alternatives--are typically excluded. 7 For 2007-2008 the World Bank estimated that the
    FISP wasted an amount equal to roughly 20 percent of its total inputs. Audits of the program
    performed by the Ministry of Agriculture are expected to result in improved targeting and the
    implementation of a voucher scheme to reduce leakages in the execution of the subsidy.
    The Zambian FRA, in addition to operating other discretionary interventionist trade policies, plays a
    major role in domestic maize-pricing mechanisms, which have imposed an increasing fiscal cost in
    recent years. FRA is directly involved in crop purchasing, sale and the overall management of the
    national maize stock. In addition, the government uses export bans, import tariffs rates and
    government import programs with the stated objective of stabilizing prices and ensuring "food
    security". In 2010, maize production reached a record high of 2.8 million metric tons, mostly due to
    good weather conditions. 8 As the FRA guarantees a minimum floor price, the government decided to
    buy 800,000 metric tons of maize at a cost of ZMK1.3 trillion, or about US$280 million. Because the
    floor price is now about twice the current market price, the implicit subsidy will likely reach
    ZMK650 billion (US$140 million), about 4.8 percent of domestic revenues or 0.9 percent of GDP.
    The government has delayed approval of the proposed Agricultural Marketing Act which will allow
    the market to play a major role in maize pricing, minimize fiscal costs and provide for more effective
    market interventions.
    The government is well aware of the fiscal impact of financing the maize surplus and has agreed with
    the IMF to revise the current maize marketing and pricing mechanisms. This revision will establish a
    pricing system more reflective of market conditions and will act as an incentive to farmers in both
    deficit and surplus years.

26.     The macroeconomic framework remains adequate to sustain implementation
of PRSC-2. The authorities' adherence to implementing sound macroeconomic policies
has delivered a stable macroeconomic environment. This enduring stability has produced
an economy that is continuing to grow at a robust pace, a marked turnaround from only a
decade ago. Inflation is low, and has remained in single digits for nine months now.
Zambia's external position is much improved, the current-account deficit has narrowed,
international reserves are at a record high, and both the total public debt and the risk of

debt distress are low. The flexible exchange-rate policy has allowed the government to
respond to externally generated shocks through exchange rate adjustments, reducing
volatility. While Zambia's fiscal performance declined in 2009, its fiscal policy stance is
nevertheless prudent, as it remains focused on keeping the fiscal deficit sustainable. The
IMF's Executive Board is expected to consider the completion of Zambia's 5th Review
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in mid-December 2010.

                     C. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK

27.     Zambia's medium-term macroeconomic outlook is encouraging. The
government is maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework under an IMF-supported
economic program. The country has had an IMF-supported program in place for several
years. The IMF Executive Board approved the latest operation of the three-year
programmatic series, the ECF, formerly the Poverty Reduction Support Credit), in June
2008. The ECF supports the country's maintenance of macroeconomic stability and debt
sustainability, while increasing fiscal space for investments in infrastructure, energy, and
human resources. It also supports the country's efforts at diversifying its economy away
from its current dependence on the mining sector by improving the conditions for private
sector-led growth. At its fourth review of the ECF in June 2010, the IMF concluded that
the program was broadly on track.

28.    The economy is expected to continue to grow at a robust pace, and inflation
is expected to remain low in the near term. The government projects that real GDP
growth will reach 6.6 percent in 2010, and rise to an average of about 7 percent from
2011-2013. This forecast is based on the expectation of continued growth in the mining,
construction, and tourism sectors, as well as renewed expansion in the manufacturing,
transportation, and communications industries. Inflation is anticipated to remain


                                                 10
moderately low, at about 7 percent in the medium term, which will be sustained by
prudence in monetary policy.

29.     These projections however face downside risks. Zambia's high dependence on
the copper sector means that an unexpectedly large drop in copper prices could weaken
the country's prospects for growth and external sustainability. In addition, the tourism
sector is especially susceptible to adverse changes in the external environment as it
largely depends on external demand.

30.     The government's fiscal stance is oriented towards creating fiscal space for
increased spending on infrastructure and the social sectors, while keeping the fiscal
position sustainable. The focus of this strategy is on increasing domestic revenue
mobilization and reprioritizing expenditures. Collections of domestic revenues are
expected to recover substantially over the medium term, rising from 15.9 percent of GDP
during 2009-2010 to above 18 percent in 2011-2013; this is based on projected tax
administration gains (increased collection efficiency) and the introduction of specific tax-
policy reforms. Expenditures are expected to rise marginally, from about 23 percent of
GDP in 2009-10 to 24 percent over the medium term. However, the composition of
expenditures will shift towards capital investment and social-sector spending, with half of
all budgeted resources committed to these two priority areas. The fiscal deficit, including
grants, is projected to rise slightly in the medium term to 4 percent of GDP, in part
because of an expected decline in donor inflows.

                                D. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

31.     External debt alleviation through the Enhanced HIPC program and the
MDRI have reduced Zambia's debt burden significantly. Since 2003 a drastic
reduction of Zambia's external obligations has diminished its overall debt burden. At
implementation in 2003 the HIPC initiative (the Decision Point for which Zambia had
reached in 2000) reduced the present value of its external debt. In 2005, when Zambia
reached the Completion Point of the HIPC program, its total debt was reduced by about
55 percent. In December of the same year, under the MDRI, Zambia received
100 percent relief of all debt incurred to the IMF before 2005. These debt-relief
measures were accompanied by the cancellation of debts with several bilateral creditors.
In addition to providing much-needed fiscal space, the reduction in debt service
obligations has provided Zambia with the opportunity to increase its foreign-exchange
reserves, which has greatly strengthened the country's ability to manage its exchange rate
and bolstered the financial system. Zambia's foreign-exchange regime is a flexible float,
so the central bank (the Bank of Zambia) does not need to maintain reserves of any
specific currency, but the increase in available reserves has substantially enhanced the
Bank of Zambia's ability to manage external shocks.

32.    The Bank and the IMF completed the Low Income Countries Debt
Sustainability Analysis (LIC-DSA) for Zambia in November 2010. The analysis
concluded that Zambia faces a low risk of debt distress. The country has seen a
substantial decline in its stock of external debt due to its successful completion of the
HIPC and MDRI programs; its external debt-to-GDP ratio fell from about 86 percent in


                                            11
2005 to around 9 percent in 2006. Since then, the country has adopted a conservative
debt policy, borrowing mostly on concessional terms. An increase in commercial
borrowing was assumed in the LIC-DSA, yet the results still show a low risk of debt
distress. The debt ratio increased marginally to 10.2 percent of GDP in 2010, and most
of this increase was in public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt. Zambia's external
debt ratios are projected to remain well below the risk threshold for the period covered by
the LIC-DSA (2010-30). The share of total public-sector debt (including domestically
issued debt) is also projected to remain manageable. The total public debt, which was
equal to 24.6 percent of GDP in 2010, is expected to reach a peak of 28.7 percent of GDP
in 2013, under the baseline scenario, and to decrease to about 20 percent by 2020.

33.     While the 2010 LIC-DSA indicated that external debt burden indicators are
expected to rise in the medium term, they are also expected to remain well below the
indicative policy thresholds over the projection period. The stock of external debt is
expected to remain at around 12-17 percent of GDP through 2016 and to decline
thereafter. The present value (PV) of PPG debt to GDP is projected to be in the 8-15
percent range through 2017, well below the 40 percent moderate-risk threshold, and to
decline thereafter. In the analysis, the PV of debt to exports increases from 21 percent in
2010 to 46 percent by 2015, well below the 150 percent threshold, and declines
thereafter. The PV of PPG debt to revenue increases from 42 percent in 2010 to around
75 percent during in 2013-14, after which it declines. This is far below the threshold of
250 percent. Debt service as a percentage of exports increases from 1.1 in 2010 to 2.5 by
2019, again very far below the 20 percent threshold.

              III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

34.     The government's long-term development objectives are articulated in the
National Vision 2030 (NV 2030). This vision document envisions Zambia attaining
prosperous middle-income country status by the year 2030 through the development of
infrastructure and human resources to stimulate the creation of wealth and jobs. The
specific policy agenda for actions for attaining the goals of NV 2030 has been laid out in
a series of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs).

   a) The first PRSP, covering the period 2002-2005, was rolled out in May 2002.
      It focused on promoting the growth of specific sectors that would create
      employment and income opportunities of the poor. The strategy emphasized
      diversifying both output and exports, improving economic and political
      governance, bolstering macroeconomic stability, enhancing social services
      delivery, and strengthening private investment.

   b) The authorities then launched the FNDP for the period 2006-2010 in
      December 2006 as the country's second PRSP. The FNDP built on the first
      PRSP by prioritizing broad-based growth in labor-intensive sectors while
      recognizing technological advancement as a central element in long-term poverty
      alleviation. It emphasized the importance of macroeconomic stability, public
      sector accountability, improved social services to the poor, and investments in


                                            12
       infrastructure and the social sectors in fostering economic growth and private
       sector development. The FNDP was prepared through a highly participatory
       process, and discussions with local leaders were held in all of Zambia's 72
       districts. Sector Advisory Groups (SAGs) chaired by government officials with
       stakeholder representation were then tasked with drafting the comprehensive
       document. Stakeholders reviewed the completed document in December 2006.

   c) The FNDP ended in December 2010, and in February 4, 2011 the government
      launched its successor, the Sixth National Development Plan for the period
      2011-2015 (SNDP). The SNDP is designed to build upon the gains made under
      the FNDP by utilizing policies, strategies, and programs focused on supporting
      broad-based pro-poor growth, employment creation, and human development. To
      achieve these goals the SNDP prioritizes infrastructure and human capital
      development.

35.    The PRSP/NDP process is complemented by a number of multi-year,
medium-term programs. These include the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF), the PAF, the Public Sector Management Program, and the Private Sector
Development Program (PSDP). These medium-term programs are operationalized in the
annual budgets, where they are updated annually.

36.     The 2009 and 2010 MTEFs in particular make improving competitiveness
and diversification central to sustaining economic growth and, ultimately, reducing
poverty. To further these efforts the government's structural reform agenda is seeking to
improve competitiveness by strengthening energy, transportation, and communications
infrastructure. In the energy sector the government is re-adjusting electricity tariffs to
cost-recovery levels in order to attract much-needed private investment in the sector. It
has also taken steps to address the operational performance of ZESCO, seeking to
improve its efficiency, governance, and the quality of service it provides. In
transportation, the government's main goal is to improve existing road infrastructure to
reduce transport costs. In communications, the goal is to liberalize markets to allow
greater international investment and promote private-sector competition. The recent
privatization of the government's controlling majority of ZAMTEL, is a positive step in
this direction.

37.   Within the framework of reforms laid out in the PRSPs and medium-term
programs, the Bank's intervention is in two areas. One is the Public Sector Reform
Program (PSRP). The other is the Private Sector Development Program (PSDP).

The Public Sector Reform Program

38.    The PSRP targets making public service delivery more efficient and effective,
through strengthening institutional and human capacity in the public service. It has
anchored on three priority areas: (i) Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability (PEMFA), (ii) Public Service Management; and (iii) Decentralization.
The interventions proposed in the strategy seek to provide the impetus for the
government's political, economic and social reforms in general. The specific goals are to


                                           13
improve public-expenditure management, the quality of service delivery and democratic
governance. They are also to address the specific challenges identified under each of the
three priority areas of reform. Among the major challenges are weaknesses in public-
expenditure management and financial control systems, a bloated and unsustainably
expensive public service, and an inefficiently high degree of centralization of government
functions and processes.

39.    (i) The Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
(PEMFA) reform program aimed at strengthening financial management systems so
as to address the critical weakness identified in public policy management,
expenditure management, budget preparation and execution, and service delivery in
line with the objectives of the PRSP. Key activities under the program included an
overhaul of the legal and regulatory framework, the implementation of the new
accounting system, the Integrated Financial System and Information System (IFMIS), a
substantial reform of the public procurement system, and several reforms to the overall
budgeting and oversight processes in Zambia. The PEMFA program was completed in
December 2010, but its successor program (which is yet to be named), will concentrate
on IFMIS, procurement, audits and tax administration issues.

40.    The PEMFA reform program has been central to meeting Zambia's
development aspirations. Over the last 10 years Zambia has undertaken a number of
fiscal reforms aimed at improving public expenditure management and financial
accountability with the support of its cooperating partners. However, despite substantial
progress, significant weaknesses persisted in the areas of budget planning and execution,
procurement, financial reporting, and auditing. With World Bank-led donor support, this
led the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) to undertake a comprehensive
analysis of the status of its public expenditure management and financial accountability
in November 2003. The analysis relied on three diagnostic tools; (i) the Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR); (ii) Country
Financial Accountability Assessment; and (iii) Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR).

The PEMFAR diagnostic analysis indentified six key priority actions:
   1. Revise the legal framework for public financial management
   2. Strengthen Parliament's oversight of the budget
   3. Improve the presentation of the budget
   4. Strictly limit the use of supplemental appropriations
   5. Establish quarterly expenditure ceilings for line ministries, back ceilings with
      actual cash releases, and sanction officers who exceed their allotted budgets
   6. Ensure the independence of the Office of the Auditor General by creating an
      oversight body that reports to Parliament
41.    The GRZ has drawn on PEMFAR in implementing a comprehensive and
integrated public service reform program. The comprehensiveness of PEMFAR is
what distinguishes it from previous efforts, which were less inclusive. While this


                                           14
comprehensive approach was risky (as the capacity of government to address many
reform areas at the same time was limited), it is well integrated in its approach, which has
provided an opportunity for achieving the significant improvements in the quality of
public expenditure management that have eluded many of the previous reform efforts.

42.    The government has made some strides in addressing the problems identified
above, but significant challenges remain.

   a) With regard to macroeconomic management, the government has instilled fiscal
      discipline in expenditure management, initiated an MTEF that enables forward-
      looking and policy-based planning of the budget, improved parliamentary
      oversight through the establishment of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC),
      and effected improvements in the macroeconomic environment.

   b) The government has also been tackling issues in the financial sector and the
      private sector through the Financial Sector Development Programs I and II
      (FSDP-I and FNSDP-II) and the Private Sector Development Program (PSDP).
      These aim to improve access to finance, financial information, and business
      licensing in the context of a more hospitable investment climate bolstered by a
      sound trade policy and a commitment to institutional development.

   c) The reforms in public finance and public service management were supported
      under the PEMFA project, which received funding from a large group of CPs
      including IDA. A successor to the PEMFA program, currently being discussed,
      will strengthen additional areas of public sector management.

   d) Related PFM reforms are being addressed under the PAF 2009-2011 in areas in
      which donors, including IDA under the PRSC series, are offering budget support
      to GRZ. There is no duplication of policy reforms under PEMFA and PAF.
      These complementary efforts are crucial to ensure the sustainability of the
      macroeconomic framework as well as to strengthen the government's ability to
      direct resources to expenditure programs that are high priorities in the PRSP, and
      to improve the credibility and accountability of the government with the private
      sector and with civil society. One of the main conclusions of the Poverty and
      Vulnerability Analysis (PVA) was that the impact of growth on the poor can be
      enhanced by ensuring that rural citizens are able to more fully participate in the
      economic process. This finding is reflected in the FNDP in its focus on
      agriculture and physical infrastructure, especially rural roads.

43.     Government efforts at tackling some of the problems identified, mainly via
the PEMFA project and dialogue around the PAF, have begun to produce positive
results. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA)
evaluation (2008) shows improvements in several PFM indicators, notably the credibility
of the budget, as well as its comprehensiveness and transparency (in terms of the
information provided in budgetary and fiscal reports), and with regard to internal auditing
and accounting and legislative scrutiny of the annual budget. The Doing Business report
(2011) shows significant improvement in several business-climate indicators. However,


                                            15
weaknesses still exist in budget execution: variances across individual budget heads
continue to be significant (averaging 15 percent); the accessibility of budget information
to the wider public remains limited; internal payroll controls need to be strengthened; and
delays in updating personnel records and in implementing recommendations by the
Auditor-General and PAC persist. Full implementation of IFMIS remains critical in
order to process and produce timely financial information. PEMFA and PAF both
include policies that would address these weaknesses.

(ii) Public Service Management

44.      The Public Service Management program focuses on (i) enhancing the
management of, and incentive systems faced by, civil servants in order to improve
their performance, and (ii) strengthening the administrative structures of
government ministries. This is a prerequisite for effectively implementing the other two
components of the PSRP. The overarching policy goals are to improve service delivery
to citizens and to create an institutional environment appropriate to reducing poverty
effectively. The program includes four sub-components: (i) rightsizing, (ii) pay reform,
(iii) performance management, and (iv) payroll management and establishment control.
The goals of each sub-component are elaborated below:

   a) Rightsizing. All government ministries and institutions have staff complements
      which are appropriate to their agreed mandates and are affordable in relation to
      their respective budget ceilings.

   b) Pay reform. Employee remuneration is related to job type and performance; the
      public service is able to attract and retain essential technical, professional and
      managerial staff; pay arrangements support and reinforce improved service
      delivery; and increases in pay levels are consistent with the resource envelope.

   c) Performance Management. All government ministries and institutions are
      managing performance effectively within an agreed framework of planned
      objectives and standards, and are taking action to improve their capacity to deliver
      better services.


                                             16
       d) Payroll management and Establishment Control. Personnel emoluments and
          establishments 9 for the public service are effectively managed and maintained at
          agreed-upon levels.

(iii) Decentralization

45.     The focus of the decentralization component is on devolving selected
functions, authorities and expenditure controls from the central government to
democratically-elected local councils. The objective of this process is to make the local
government system more efficient and responsive to local demands. During the 1990s,
the government undertook various measures to address the shortcomings of the local
government system. These included the formal reorganization of the country's
governance structure, the inclusion of decentralization objectives in the PSRP/NDP
strategies as well as various amendments to the Local Government Act and related
legislation to strengthen the capacities and administrative standing of the councils.
Towards the end of the 1990s however, the government recognized that in spite of these
measures little positive change was being registered, particularly with respect to
improvements in service provision, while the PDCCs and DDCCs had generally
remained ineffective. It is in this context that the government adopted its Decentralization
Policy on the 18th of November 2002. The Policy was subsequently launched by the
President on the 20th of August 2004. While this policy action is important on its own, it
also represented the culmination of a series of other initiatives that preceded it and which
were also aimed at addressing the shortcomings of the public service, particularly at the
local level.

The Private Sector Development Reform Program

46.     The Private Sector Development Reform Program (PSDRP) is aimed at
stimulating the growth of the private sector. Its goal is to facilitate the development of
a competitive business environment in order to foster more rapid job growth and wealth
creation. This requires adopting policies and reforms that reduce the cost of doing
business and increase the competitiveness of the Zambian economy. The PSDRP focuses
on improving access to financial services, building and rehabilitating infrastructure,
opening up both regional and international markets, establishing transparent regulatory
frameworks, bolstering the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs),
and expanding the availability of skills training and business development services.

47.   Through regular meetings with the Sector Advisory Group on Private Sector
Development, the government and the private sector have jointly agreed on a set of
reforms to be undertaken as part of the PSDRP. These are:

       a) Business licensing and regulatory reform. The costly and cumbersome
          business licensing regime in Zambia is a major constraint to private sector
          development.     Business licensing processes and procedures often lack
          transparency, are needlessly time-consuming, and in many cases serve no

9
    Establishments are the positions set up at government institutions.


                                                       17
   reasonable purpose. Very few MSMEs are formally registered due in part to the
   overly costly and time-consuming registration process. Many current laws and
   regulations are obsolete, and licensing practices have largely failed to keep pace
   with modern technologies. The government has successfully identified the
   majority of the licensing requirements that will be eliminated, consolidated, or
   otherwise streamlined as part of the PSDRP. With the assistance from the World
   Bank Group, the government has been implementing regulatory activities that
   includes the following: (i) reforms in the areas measured by Doing Business, (ii)
   reduction in the number and cost of business licenses, (iii) the establishment of a
   Business Regulatory Unit, and the planned introduction of an online business
   registry (e-Registry) and one-stop shop by 2011.

b) MSME Development. MSMEs dominate the Zambian private sector, and the
   growth of the MSMEs could have a significant impact on poverty reduction.
   However, MSMEs face numerous constraints that adversely affect their
   development. These include lack of access to finance and markets, high costs of
   borrowing, shortages and high costs of inputs (working capital traps), poor
   infrastructure, a lack of skilled labor, limited utility services, and a harsh overall
   business environment. To deal with these problems the government is working
   on the design of an official MSME policy, along with a credit guarantee scheme
   for MSMEs, an MSME incubator program, and a training program for achieving
   access to finance and markets designed specifically for MSMEs.

c) Labor Law Reform and Labor Productivity Development. Labor legislation
   has been identified as posing a significant impediment to the growth of the private
   sector. The high cost of severance packages as well as the overall rigidities in the
   labor market introduced by labor regulations act as deterrents to private sector
   growth. In addition there is a significant gap between the practical vocational
   skills demanded by the private sector and those produced by the educational
   system. The government plans to reform business related labor laws, including
   issues of retirement and severance packages, and to develop a system for
   measuring and improving labor productivity.

d) Public Private Partnership (PPP) Development. The government has identified
   PPPs as a viable model for infrastructure development and service provision
   capable of augmenting the government's limited financial and managerial
   capacity. The government has finalized the PPP legislation and policies in 2009,
   creating a dedicated PPP unit, and training private firms and public agencies in
   how to properly form PPP arrangements.

e) Trade Expansion. The government is working to develop more coherence in the
   policy, regulatory and legal framework for international trade. It is improving
   border infrastructure, streamlining customs procedures, and assuring the
   legitimacy of its professional accreditation standards, product quality controls,
   and national metrology system, along with other related initiatives.




                                         18
48.     Zambia has made significant improvements in its business climate according
to the 2011 Doing Business Report (DBR), but challenges remain. Zambia is listed
among the 10 top reformers of 2010, and is now 76th in the overall rankings. These
achievements reflect substantial progress in three areas: (i) starting a business, with the
elimination of the minimum capital requirement; (ii) trading across borders, with the
introduction of a one-stop border post with Zimbabwe, and (iii) enforcing contracts, with
the introduction of an electronic case management system in the courts. Substantial
reforms for improved private sector development, however, remain a challenge in the
labor market, in infrastructure and in access to finance.

49.      Limited investment in energy infrastructure has been a significant obstacle to
growth and the development of a more dynamic and diversified export sector. The
energy sector, especially the electric power supply, presents a major challenge to
Zambian development. The rapid expansion of mining and other energy-intensive
activities in recent years, as well as the need to run generators below capacity to allow for
long-overdue maintenance, have virtually exhausted the surplus of electric power that
characterized Zambia's energy sector in the 1960s and '70s. Over the medium-term, a
potential power shortage threatens to become a major obstacle to the continued growth of
the Zambian economy. The further expansion of mining, agriculture, and manufacturing
will require increased access to electricity. With the whole of southern Africa
experiencing a power deficit, any additional power would need to come largely from new
power generation within the country. While there is an abundance of hydroelectric
potential to be harnessed in Zambia, bringing new capacity on line will require
considerable investment and in many instances long lead times. The poor financial
condition and weak operational performance of ZESCO, the state-owned power
company, has been an obstacle to undertake the new investment needed to build power-
generating capacity. Recent changes in the operational efficiency of ZESCO supported
by the PRSC, including increasing the number of clients and reducing unmetered
costumers, have also resulted in two large increases in electricity tariffs that have result in
a tariff now very close to the cost of production (compared to less than 50 percent two
years ago). A recent agreement with a Chinese operator to establish a PPP in order to
finance the construction of the Lowe Kafue Gorge Hydroelectric Plant is expected to
increase available electricity output by about 650 megawatts.

50.    The government has developed an electricity strategy to shore-up supply,
increase investment, and improve the operational and financial performance of
ZESCO. The electricity strategy specifies the medium- and long-term investment
programs required to build new power stations and enhance the operational and financial
performance of ZESCO. To improve the efficiency of ZESCO, a set of Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) were agreed upon between the Energy Regulation Board (ERB) and
ZESCO. The KPIs fall under five main categories: (i) customer metering, (ii) cash
management, (iii) staff productivity, (iv) quality of service, and (v) system losses.

51.    These programs and priorities are reflected in the government's PAF. In
addition to the NDP and MTEF the government, in collaboration with national
stakeholders and international donors, has drawn up a PAF which further articulates
policy actions that the government intends to undertake on a subset of core FNDP areas


                                              19
on a three-year rolling basis. The PAF provides a framework for more regular monitoring
of progress made in undertaking a subset of reforms that are considered key to the
achievement of the FNDP goals. The PAF 2009-2011 articulates policy actions that the
government will undertake in three main clusters, namely Reform Process and Financial
Management (covering Decentralization, Public Sector Reform, Public Finance
Management and Macroeconomic Management), Wealth Creation (covering
Infrastructure-Roads, Energy, Water, Agriculture and Private Sector Development), and
Social Equity (focusing on Health and Education), as well as cross-cutting areas such as
HIV/AIDS and Environmental Policy. The implementation of reforms in these areas will
lead to enhanced macroeconomic stability, a more efficient public sector, improved
public finance management, improved rural economic connectivity, greater efficiency of
the energy sector, and enhanced agricultural productivity, improved access to and quality
of social services, and a reduction in the cost of doing business. Positive outcomes in
these crucial areas will substantially contribute towards the attainment of the FNDP
goals.

       IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S
                     PROGRAM

                  A. LINKS TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

52.     The PRSC series is a key component of the Country Assistance Strategy,
which the Board discussed in May 2008. The CAS FY08-11 seeks impact through
greater selectivity in support of the government reforms. To that end, it supports two key
areas: improved public expenditure management, and investment in infrastructure to
increase economic opportunities and competitiveness. Within the two broad themes, it
proposes selective interactions in four priority areas of the national development plans:
(i) macroeconomic management, (ii) infrastructure development, (iii) institutional
capacity enhancement, and (iv) social sector development.

53.    The CAS identifies the reform areas that the annual program of PRSCs will
support. The PRSCs will support the core objective of the Bank's macroeconomic
program to help Zambia better manage its financial resources so that fiscal policy can be
used to foster more inclusive growth. The focus areas are the reform of the energy sector,
the improvement of the business climate, and capacity enhancement in public service.

54.      The World Bank works in close collaboration with IFC, through the joint
Investment Climate Advisory Services, on the implementation of Doing Business
and business license reforms. The first Investment Climate Program started in 2009 and
ended in December 2010. A successor Program is being prepared, which is likely to
include the following components: (i) reforms in the areas measured by Doing Business;
(ii) support to business license reforms, with a focus on implementation and compliance;
(iii) introduction of e-Government practices with support to the e-Registry and one-stop
shop; (iv) access to finance, in collaboration with IFC's African MSME Program; and (v)
assessment of specific business environment constraints in the three priority sectors



                                           20
identified by the World Bank's Job and Competitiveness Report [see Paragraph 67]:
livestock, tourism and copper. The successor Program will be implemented in early 2011.

                             B. COORDINATION WITH THE IMF

55.      The IMF leads the dialogue on and review of the country's macroeconomic
performance. This assessment is an underlying principle in the provision of budget
support to the government, as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for
the PRBS. The IMF agreed with the GRZ on a new three-year Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) program in June 2008, later caller the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF). The fourth review under the ECF was successfully completed in June 2010, and
the fifth review is expected to be approved by the board in mid-December. The ECF has
structural policy benchmarks in a number of areas including: the adoption of the Treasury
Single Account so as to cover 60 percent of budgetary expenditures, submit to cabinet a
review of maize pricing policy, and prepare a review of tax administration and policy.
These were developed in close consultation with IDA. The Bank and the IMF are also
collaborating closely on financial sector reform, debt-sustainability analyses, and trade
policy formulation.

                         C. COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DONORS

56.    The Bank has agreed with other cooperating partners (CPs) and the GRZ on
a MoU that guides the process for the PRBS. The CPs and the GRZ signed the first
MoU in mid-2005. This was then revised in June 2008 to include new CPs. Together
with IDA, eight other CPs have been providing budget support to Zambia, namely: the
European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden (which
withdrew in December 2010), Finland, Germany and the African Development Bank.

57.     The MoU identifies two categories of performance that are important for
disbursement. First, performance is measured against underlying principles. These
comprise: (i) GRZ's commitment to fight poverty, which includes maintaining a pattern
of public expenditure consistent with poverty reduction priorities as identified in
Zambia's National Development Plan; (ii) GRZ's commitment to peace, democratic
principles, the rule of law, good governance, and integrity in public life, including the
fight against corruption; (iii) GRZ's commitment to public financial management reforms
as demonstrated by satisfactory progress with the PEMFA program; (iv) GRZ's
commitment to pursuing sound macroeconomic policies, as is shown by a positive IMF
assessment of its overall macroeconomic performance. Second, performance is measured
against specific process and outcome indicators specified in the PAF. The PAF itself does
not include indicators related to the underlying principles. 10

58.   The MoU allows each donor to decide how much it will disburse against the
underlying principles and/or against all or a subset of indicators spelled out in the
PAF. At present there are 38 indicators and milestones included in the PAF. For each

10
  The PAF does include indicators that measure macroeconomic performance and public expenditure
management, but the underlying principles include a wider set of indicators and actions on which the
donors evaluate the performance of the government.


                                                21
indicators and milestones, 2008 figures are the baseline. These are then mapped to
targets outcomes for the years 2009, 2010, and 2011. The targets for the two later years
are subject to revision based upon performance in 2009.

59.     The preparation of the PAF for 2009-11 was jointly undertaken with the
GRZ and the PRBS group. Extensive consultations took place with the line Ministries
and the Sector Advisory Groups (SAGs), which consist of government officials,
representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), civil society groups,
business organizations, and donors. The SAGs are also the main forum used by GRZ to
discuss the PRSP/FNDP and review progress in their implementation. (See Box 3: Good
Practice Principles on Conditionality).

60.     The World Bank, together with the GRZ and other CPs, has been working
on strengthening the policy content of the PAF. As a result of ongoing policy debate
among the other cooperating partners and the Bank, there is now an agreement among
CPs to strengthen the policy content of the PAF, reducing the number of indicators, and
improving the focus on development priorities. Also, it has been agreed that the PAF
should not be a sectoral progress monitoring instrument. Only those indicators which
measure progress beyond the sector level should be incorporated. Next to the indicators,
the PAF should also contain policy measures and/or actions aimed at achieving the
targets related to those indicatorsand.

61.     The changes incorporated suggest setting the priorities in three stages. First,
the sectors should be invited to list the three most important indicators for progress in the
sector, accompanied by the actions/policy measures identified to trigger the achievement
of the indicator targets. Second, GRZ and the PRBS donors should in separate parallel
processes each select their main priority indicators (with their actions / policy measures).
Finally, a joint analysis would have to yield a common limited set of priority indicators
for the PAF, which would then also imply the priority actions and policy measures.

62.     Indicators must be measurable, must have a baseline, must be policy
sensitive, and should be monitored on annual basis. It was agreed that the PAF should
be flexible, i.e. able to accommodate changes in circumstances (some indicators may be
met at a certain point and can thus be removed; others may become irrelevant over time).
Changes should, however, in principle only be made between years and not in-year.

63.     The government and the PRBS donors meet twice a year to review
performance in relation to the agreed PAF for the previous year, and to agree on the
contents of the PAF for the following year. The joint review meetings take place each
year in June and October. The time of the meetings is being updated to coincide with the
new budget cycle process.

   a) The June review meetings are meant for the PRBS donors and government to
      jointly agree on PAF's performance, which serves as the basis for commitments
      for the next budget year. The review draws on various sources, including the
      government's annual review of the National Development Plan, annual progress




                                             22
   reports on the PEMFA, Quarterly Budget Execution Reports, the national audits,
   plus other information deemed relevant.

b) The October review meeting is focused on forward planning and budgeting and
   reaching an agreement on the PAF for the next budget year. This dialogue is
   based on the annual Financial Reports of the previous budget year, the Annual
   PEMFA Evaluation, and the ceilings in the annual budget for the next budget year
   as specified in Zambia's MTEF Green Paper. During this review meeting each
   member of the PRBS Group confirms the volume of its commitment, the
   government and the PRBS donors agree on the PAF for the next budget year, and
   any PRBS donor (i.e. IDA) intending to provide a floating element confirms
   against the new PAF the specific milestones, indicators and/or targets that will
   trigger an immediate disbursement at the relevant review meeting in the following
   year.

                     Box 3: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
· The proposed operation draws directly from the PAF 2009-2011, which was jointly prepared by
    representatives of the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) and PRBS donors. The
    PAF itself is linked to priorities and actions spelled out in Zambia's new Poverty Reduction Strategy
    Paper (PRSP)/ FNDP, which covers 2006-10. As with the PRSP/NDP all indicators selected for the
    PAF were discussed in the relevant Sector Advisory Groups (SAGs), which consist of government
    officials, representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), civil society groups, business
    organizations, and donors. The SAGs are also the main forum used by GRZ to discuss the PRSP/FNDP
    and review progress in its implementation.

Principle 2: Harmonize donor support
· The PRSP/FNDP, the PAF, and other ongoing reform efforts--particularly in the area of public sector
    management--have benefited extensively from IDA and other joint analytical work. For example, the
    Country Economic Memorandum , the Poverty and Vulnerability Analysis (PVA), and the PEMFAR
    have all influenced the supported reforms, including the PAF and ongoing Technical Assistance (TA)
    projects.

·   IDA's support is summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix and draws all its proposed measures
    from the PAF used by all PRBS donors providing budget support. Note that the PAF is for three years
    and as such provides an accountability framework for the years 2009-11 and will be of a rolling nature.
    In addition, the cooperating partners that are part of the Wider Harmonization in Practice (WHiP)
    group, which includes IDA, prepared a Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia in April 2007 as a
    response to the new PRSP/FNDP in order to further increase aid coordination and reduce transaction
    costs to GRZ.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
· Building on what has been articulated under principles one and two IDA's budget support operation is
    part of the total support provided by all PRBS donors. As such, the biannual reviews agreed upon by
    GRZ and the PRBS donors are used to set the content of the forward-looking PAF, the performance
    standards under the PAF, and the aid modalities that GRZ can expect for its upcoming fiscal year. The
    first two issues mentioned are part of the discussions that take place in June of each year, while the
    announcement of the expected aid modalities in the form of budget support are communicated during
    the October review.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
· All proposed IDA prior actions are chosen from the PAF. There are 38 total indicators monitored
    through the PAF, of which eight are proposed to guide IDA's disbursement under this operation. The
    milestones chosen are those that overlap with the objectives of the CAS and the PRSP/FNDP and are
    thus critical to support the results agenda under the CAS.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
· Building on what is stated under Principle 3, IDA announces in conjunction with all other PRBS
    donors its expected amount of budget support for GRZ's next fiscal year at the October PRBS review
    meeting. These dates are chosen to allow GRZ to prepare its budget knowing the amount it can expect
    in budget support.

·   The PAF is a mix of process and outcome indicators (see Annex 2) with process indicators mostly
    identified for the first year, i.e. 2009, so as to pave the way to achieving the results, which are
    identified in accompanying outcome indicators for later years.




                                                   24
                       D. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER IDA OPERATIONS

64.     The PRSC program complements several operations and ongoing
knowledge-based activities identified in the CAS FY 2008-11. In the area of Public
Sector Reform, IDA has in place a Technical Assistance (TA) operation, the Public
Service Management Program 11. This is assisting GRZ in two areas: (i) the area of civil
service and pay reform, and (ii) reforms in public expenditure management and financial
accountability, including the installation of an IFMIS. IDA has also undertaken a Public
Expenditure Review (PER) working with government and with the support of other
cooperating partners. This has looked into the efficiency and equity of public resource
allocation across sectors. The flagship of wealth creation is being supported through TA
and investing lending towards reform in the electricity sector and improving the business
climate. The Bank's aim in the electricity sector is to assist the government in improving
ZESCO's efficiency and quality of services it provides. In support of the government's
private sector reform agenda, the Bank is working on a Jobs and Competitiveness
Economic and Social Work focusing on the areas of private sector development in
tourism, beef and dairy production, and value addition in the copper sector. In the area of
social equity IDA has prepared PER for the education and health sectors.

     E. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATIONS (DPO)

65.     The PRSC-2 program draws on the lessons learnt from the past DPOs,
Economic Management and Growth Credit (EMGC) I & II and the PRSC-1.
EMGC I & II were two DPOs identified in the previous CAS FY 2004-07 to assist GRZ
in policy and institutional reforms. EMGC I was approved in December 2004 and closed
in December 2005, EMGC II was approved in May 2008 and closed in December 2008,
and the PRSC-1 was approved in March 2009.

66.     The major lessons to draw from EMGC I and II for the PRSC program are
based on the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluation of the operations. 12
The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) for EMGC I was finalized in
March 2007 and for EMGC II was finalized in June 2009. One of the key lessons from
IEG's evaluation of EMGC I ICR is the need to recognize that institutional reforms
require a longer time horizon than can be achieved through a one-year disbursing credit.
A second (and related) lesson is that the conditions of the credit were not adequate to
meet the objectives of the program. Taking these lessons into account, the CAS identified
a series of three annual credits, PRSCs, as the method by which policy reform will be
supported. This provides a longer time horizon in which to undertake the reforms
described in the program. Finally, recognizing the importance of the reform areas to
which the previous credits were directed, the program will continue to support most of
these reforms.


11
   The PSM project in the amount of US$30 million was approved by the board on January 5, 2006 and was
declared effective on May 10, 2006. The operation contributes to a pooled-funding arrangement and is in
part a follow-up on the Public Sector Capacity Building project, which closed in 2005.
12
   See ICR of the EMGC operation, report No. 36495 ZA and IEG's evaluation dated March 26, 2007 and
report No. ICR00001107 for the EMGC II dated June 25, 2009.


                                                  25
                              F. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

67.    The proposed PRSC operation draws on a variety of economic and sector
work. This includes the PEMFAR 2004, the Jobs and Competitiveness Report (2010),
the PER, 2010, the PVA (2007, and the diagnostic work on "constraints to inclusive
growth" 13 undertaken as an input into the current CAS (2008-2011). The PRCS also
draws on reports and evaluations carried out by GRZ, such as "Zambia: Public Financial
Management Performance Report and Performance Indicators", a Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA, 2005 and 2008). In the energy sector, the
PRSC is informed by ongoing technical assistance to the "Electricity Sector Performance
Review" currently underway.

68.     The PER covers issues regarding the efficiency of fiscal spending, with an
emphasis on the infrastructure and agriculture sectors, as well as cross-cutting
issues. This PER reviews the major structural challenges that the government must meet
in order to improve efficiency and equity in public spending. Following a review of the
major achievements in terms of macroeconomic stabilization, the PER suggests measures
to improve the budget and planning processes, as well as to account properly for the
economic effects of an exhaustible resource such as copper, and the need to improve
project-specific investment management. The PER provides a detailed analysis of the
major infrastructure sub-sectors, such as roads and water, as well as agriculture.

69.     The Job and Competitiveness Report analyses several cross-cutting issues
that affect the productivity of three major industries in Zambia. The Report
highlights the major issues that negatively affect the growth of the livestock, tourism and
copper processing sectors, and offers several options to increase the productivity of these
industries. The Report analyses and offers solutions to the following questions: Why are
these industries not generating more jobs and income? What can be done differently by
the government, businesses, civil society and the donor community to make these
industries more competitive? Can innovative approaches such as crowd-sourcing and the
promotion of competition, often adopted by the private sector, play a role in facilitating
implementation, advocacy and accountability in the public sector and civil society?

70.     The PEMFAR reviewed the country's public financial management systems.
The report identified several shortcomings in the relevant legislative framework and in
public finance information management, both of which hinder enforcement and
accountability, as well as weaknesses in the budget process in terms of the
comprehensiveness, classification and presentation of the budget, in the budget execution
and procurement processes, and in expenditure tracking.             These were further
compounded by a poorly-motivated and largely unskilled public service staff. The
PEMFAR recommended a revision of the legal framework for financial management,
stronger parliamentary oversight over the budget, improvements in the budget processes
with regard to preparation and execution, improvements in the institutional mechanisms
for accountability, and public service reform measures.

71.     However, a number of binding constraints still exist with respect to economic
growth and poverty reduction. An analysis of constraints to growth in Zambia
published by the Bank in 2008 examined the potential for enhancing pro-poor growth in
Zambia. 14 It indentified the main challenge to improving the functioning of the
agricultural sector, enhancing access to markets through a better road network, and
broadening the availability of (micro) finance in rural areas. The analysis also revealed
several market coordination failures that undermine the country's competiveness, limit
job creation and hinder inclusive growth. These include limited access to markets, inputs
and information, and high indirect costs related to services (i.e. energy, transport and
telecommunications). The study further points to ineffective governance and regulatory
mismanagement as major factors behind these market failures. This is reflected in a
number of distortive policy interventions, especially in the agriculture sector.

72.     The PVA (2007) found that despite recent gains, poverty levels are
unacceptably high in Zambia, especially among the rural poor. The assessment
identified four fundamental challenges faced by the country in its efforts to reduce
poverty and promote economic equity. These are: (i) the need for policies designed to
expand economic opportunities for the poor, (ii) the recognition that the poverty-
reduction impacts of reforms are contingent on the poor having the necessary tools to
participate in growth, (iii) the need to recognize and account for the risk-averse nature of
the poor, and (iv), the need to develop a well-functioning and responsive public
administration to improve governance.

                  V.       THE PROPOSED PRSC PROGRAM

                                     A. OVERALL DESCRIPTION

73.      The proposed second poverty reduction support reduction credit (PRSC-2) is
the second in a series of three one-year programmatic PRSC operations to Zambia.
It is a continuation of support to ongoing implementation of a program of developmental
reforms in the country.

74.     The overarching goal of the PRSC program is to support Zambia in its
efforts at implementing a developmental strategy that is directed at generating
faster inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. It is designed to contribute
to this goal through supporting two pillars of the government's policy and institutional
reform agenda. One is preserving macroeconomic stability and improving public sector
performance. The other is supporting broad-based economic growth by improving
efficiency in the energy sector and reducing the costs of doing business.

75.     The operation is providing support towards these pillars in the context of a
PAF that outlines a rolling multi-year program of the government's developmental
reforms. Therefore, for the two pillars that are the focus of PRSC, the operation has
selected as prior actions and triggers policy actions outlined in the PAF for 2009-2011.

                                                   27
These are summarized in table 4 and in the policy matrix shown at annex 3, and cover the
entire life span of the PRSC series. Selection of each prior action and trigger is based on
its importance in (i) advancing the reform agenda, and (ii) ensuring its continuity.

                                   B. POLICY AREAS

76.   The PRSC program is supporting two policy areas of the government's
agenda of policy reforms, as already stated:

   a) Preserving macroeconomic stability and improving public sector performance;
      and

   b) Supporting broad-based economic growth by improving efficiency in the energy
      sector and reducing the cost of doing business.

                AREA 1: P RESERVING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND
                      IMPROVING PUBLIC SECTOR PERFORMANCE

77.     The aim of reforms in the macroeconomic stability and public sector
performance area is to strengthen the authorities' ability in achieving and
sustaining fiscal sustainability. This is necessary for continuity of the sound
macroeconomic policies that, now, are credited for the positive performance seen in
recent years. The government has recognized the negative impact of accumulated arrears
and is taking remedial to reduce them in the short and in the long run, and the need to
improve financial management and overall improvement in public sector delivery.

78.     The two areas of reform include macroeconomic management and public
service reform. The macroeconomic management reform agenda is addressing the
problem of reducing the arrears owed to the public sector pension system and to domestic
suppliers. Public service reforms, on the other hand, have been directed at strengthening
public resource control management, so as to improve service delivery.

Macroeconomic Management

79.     The Public Service Pension Fund. The PSPF is an occupational pension scheme
which faces an actuarial (but not a current) deficit, and had in the past relatively large
arrears generated by some government agencies not making full payment of contributions
owed. The government program has concentrated first in reducing the arrears to a
minimum and second in facing the actuarial deficit by changing some of the current
parameters and financial limitations of the PSPF as recommended by a business plan
currently being discussed.

80.    The most important short term measure has been the implementation of a
program to reduce arrears. Over the past five years, the government has made steady
progress in reducing the arrears owed to the PSPF. During the PRSC-1 implementation
period, the stock of contribution arrears was reduced to ZMK93 billion (compared to
ZMK305 billion at end-2007, and ZMK464 billion at end-2005). Under PRSC-2, the
government has committed to reduce the arrears to ZMK67 billion at end-2009, but has


                                            28
actually been reduced to ZMK48 billion. This represents a considerable improvement on
the situation and the arrears have now being reduced to a level that is sustainable to
manage.

81.     For long term sustainability of the PSPF, the government has developed a
business plan for the Fund, to reduce administrative costs and strengthen its
operational efficiency. In line with PRSC-1, the PSPF prepared a business plan in 2008
that provides options for sustaining its solvency. The Board of the PSPF approved the
plan during 2009. The business plan has now been publicly discussed as indicated in the
government reform program and the government is currently finalizing a draft on the new
pension rights for new entrants to the PSPF.

PRSC-2 Prior Action: Arrears owed by the GRZ to the PSPF are reduced to no more
than ZMK67 billion at end-2009.

Public Service Reform

82.     The area of public service reform supports the continuity of government's
efforts at strengthening control and management of public resources for improving
service delivery. Government is improving the delivery of public services through
strengthening public service management and public financial management. PRSC's
support under public service management has focused on supporting the institutionalizing
of Service Delivery Charters (SDCs) and development of a Public Service Pay Policy as
the tools to benchmarking commitment to and timely delivery of public services. In
public financial management, the efforts being supported are the strengthening of budget
execution, so as to improve the availability and predictability of budgetary resources

Strengthening Public Service Management

83.     Service Delivery Charters. The government began establishing Service
Delivery Charters (SDCs) for public administrative agencies in 2008, as a means to
ensure that all ministries and institutions benchmark performance and service delivery to
fixed standards. The SDCs outline the level of service delivery clients can expect from
government agencies. While the content of each SDC is specific to its agency (see
Box 4 below), all share a common set of objectives. The stated purpose of an SDC is to
(i) enhance clients' awareness of the type of service the agency provides, (ii) inform
clients of the standard of service they may expect to receive, (iii) outline clients' rights
and responsibilities in relation to the agency, (iv) define the agencies' rights and
responsibilities as service provider, and (v) detail the ways in which clients may provide
feedback to the agency and seek redress for complaints. Each SDC goes on to provide
specific standards of service quality to which the agency and its employees are expected
to adhere and which clients may expect to receive. The SDC serves as an important
touchstone for both the agency staff, by laying out a set of clear and consistent guidelines
for professional performance, and for clients, by apprising them of the standards to which
the agency may be held.




                                            29
                          Box 4. SDCs Currently Being Implemented
  Along with the Ministry of Lands and the Department of Immigration, the Ministry of Mines and
  Mineral Development was among the first executive agencies to fully implement a Service Delivery
  Charter; its SDC was completed in February 2009 and promulgated in early 2010. It begins with an
  introduction from the Minister and a statement outlining its mission and purpose. It goes on to
  enumerate a set of core principles of Ministry staff: integrity, honesty, objectivity, impartiality, respect,
  accountability, excellence, confidentiality, selflessness, and concern for environmental protection. The
  SDC then provides a statement of what clients may expect from the Ministry stressing the importance
  of timeliness, efficiency, accuracy and transparency in the execution of official duties.
  The SDC offers a concise yet detailed description of Ministry procedures, broken down by service type.
  This serves as a common point of reference for staff and clients regarding specific requirements for
  various procedures and the standard processing time for each. For example, the process for acquiring a
  large-scale mining license includes nine required documents, three at application and six upon issuance
  of the Office Letter, and should be expected to take twenty days. As such, it is both an important
  informational resource--allowing clients to be sure they have the proper materials in order--and a
  safeguard on transparency, since all process requirements are published and available to clients as well
  as agency staff. This is reinforced by a subsequent description of the client's rights, what they may
  expect from interactions with agency staff, and how to register a complaint or otherwise provide
  feedback to agency managers. The SDC concludes with a restatement of the commitment of the
  Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development to the highest standards of transparency and
  accountability, and to the timely publication of both general Ministry information and specific reports
  regarding its performance on the SDC and actions taken to redress complaints and improve its
  operations.




84.     The government is continuing to make progress in this policy area. Under the
PRSC-1 SDCs were adopted and institutionalized in two government agencies, the
Ministry of Lands and the Department of Immigration. In the Department of
Immigration, the time to process a passport has been reduced to 5-7 days on payment of
appropriate fee. This contrasts with the recent past where one could wait for a passport
for as long three months after applying for it. At the Ministry of Lands, an information
centre has been established, at which the public easily accesses information on land title
registered, although there are still difficulties with registering land title.

85.      At end-2009, SDCs have been prepared for four additional government agencies,
namely; the Public Sector Management Division (PSMD), the Department of National
Registration, the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources (MTENR),
and the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development (MMMD). Beyond this, the
government has initiated a Service Delivery Survey that should ascertain whether the two
original ministries (the Ministry of Lands and Department of Immigration) have
implemented their SDCs satisfactorily. Public debate on this matter is now underway and
the government expects to launch the survey in 2011.




                                                      30
PRSC-2 Prior Action: Service Delivery Charters are adopted in the Public Sector
Management Division, the Department of National Registration, the Ministry of
Tourism and Natural Resources, and the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development;
and the Service Delivery Chapter in the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development is
institutionalized.

86.    Public Sector Pay Policy.         The government's efforts at developing a
comprehensive pay policy for the public service are directed at having an incentive
system that should attract and retain qualified personnel, and motivate staff to improve
performance. Recognizing the need for a more systematic and comprehensive approach
to addressing the pay and incentive problems, the government is developing a
comprehensive pay policy reform for the public sector.

87.     The new pay policy is focused on aligning remuneration incentives with
quality performance and addressing a number of longstanding problems in the civil
service payroll. Previously, they payroll system was adjusted on an unsystematic, ad
hoc basis. Real wages were allowed to erode for long periods at a time and inflation
adjustments were unpredictable. Public sector wages periodically became uncompetitive,
giving more qualified staff members a strong incentive to leave their agencies and pursue
employment in the private sector. To combat this tendency, agency managers began
dispensing unearned promotions, moving staff they wished to retain up the pay scale in
order to combat the inflationary decline in their real wages. The use of in-kind
remuneration and other non-salary benefits also became common. As a result, the pay
system became increasingly distorted, unreflective of performance and expensive, as
cost-of-living wage increases were ultimately added to existing informal incentives.

88.     In order to address these challenges the PRSC-1 supported the preparation
of a draft pay policy and its pilot implementation in the 2010 budget. The new pay
policy establishes clear guidelines for the organization of the career and pay scales and
provides for timely inflation adjustments, creates an explicit link between pay raises and
staff performance, and discourages the use of non-salary compensation or unwarranted
promotion as means to retain qualified staff. The Cabinet has since reviewed and
ultimately approved a final version of a new pay policy. As a complement government
has launched a thorough exercise to reassess competencies, qualifications, and job
description in the public sector (the job evaluation exercise).

PRSC-2 Prior Action: Draft pay policy is submitted to Cabinet.

Improving Public Financial Management

89.    The PRSC is supporting reforms targeted at efforts to strengthen treasury
management, the public procurement process, and budget execution. The
overarching goal is to improve the availability and predictability of budgetary resources.
Government is thus expected to implement the budget with greater precision that allows
reducing the variance between the budget and actual spending and, through procurement
reforms, achieve better value for money.



                                           31
90.     Budget execution. The PRSC supports the government's efforts in releasing
resources in a timely manner and to enable rapid implementation of identified priority
programs. Specific actions involve the development and implementation of a cash
management plan and improved budget preparation at each ministry (head) for every
quarter. The plan includes all spending and spending commitments for the period as set
out in the budget. The MoFNP is in turn responsible for releasing these funds in a timely
manner. Future budget preparations at ministry level should be aligned with this policy
and be realistic as to avoid large variances. These actions will ensure that actual
expenditures at each budget head are within a +/-5 percent variance, substantially
improving the credibility of the budget.

91.     Recent progress. The budget execution target is to achieve a percent of
calculated expenditure at each budget head 15 of between 95 percent and 105 percent of
total funding. In 2008, 84 percent of budget heads (41 out of 49) had their calculated
expenditures that fell within this range (above the targeted 82 percent). In 2009 this
increased to 90 percent (44 out of 49 budget heads); again, well above the target of
85 percent.

 PRSC-2 Prior Action: 85 percent of budget heads have calculated expenditures of
 between 95 percent and 105 percent of the total funding for the fiscal year 2009.

92.      Procurement reforms. Weaknesses in current procurement systems have
contributed to poor budget execution and poor value for money. Cognizant of the
important of this issue, government has embarked on a comprehensive program of
reforms with a view to increase transparency; enhance competition and efficiency, and
developing a regulatory framework for the country including an arbitration system. A
critical milestone was the passage of the Public Procurement Act No. 12 of 2008. Follow
up actions are now centered on developing the specific guidelines and regulations for
implementation as well as training civil servants. The PRSC supports the preparation of
draft procurement guidelines (the subsidiary legislation) to be issued. The government
finalized the preparation of the draft procurement guidelines in November 2009 and
submitted them to Ministry of Justice for finalization and preparation of the statutory
instrument to be issued by the Minister of Finance. The government has indicated that it
expects the legal review process and issuance of the regulations to be completed during
the first half of 2011.

 PRSC-2 Prior Action: Procurement guidelines are drafted and submitted by the
 Zambia Public Procurement Authority to the Ministry of Justice at end-2009.

 AREA 2: SUPPORTING BROAD-BASED ECONOMIC GROWTH BY IMPROVING EFFICIENCY
           IN THE ENERGY SECTOR AND REDUCING THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS

93.   The PRSC program is supporting broad regulatory reforms designed to
enable private sector-driven, pro-poor, and broad-based economic growth. The

15
 Heads are the different units in which the public sector is organized from a budget perspective, including
ministries and government agencies.


                                                    32
credit is supporting reforms in (i) business licensing, which are needed to improve the
business climate by reducing transaction costs and promoting business formalization, and
(ii) the energy sector, which focus on increasing the utility's efficiency and expanding
access to electricity. The government expects that improved efficiency and cost-recovery
in the energy sector will attract the much-required private investment in the sector that
Zambia needs if the country is to succeed in its quest to achieve economic growth and
diversification.

Energy

94.     A reliable energy supply is vital to the growth of the economy and
Government is committed to pushing forward reforms in the energy sector that are
needed to provide widespread access to electricity critical to social welfare and
poverty reduction. The energy sector has been plagued by inefficiencies, which have,
for some time, deterred new investments to the sector. Until the early 1980s, Zambia
enjoyed a large surplus power capacity, mainly because of low economic activity and
minimal domestic consumption. However, over the last decade economic activity has
grown substantially, largely driven by the revival of the mining sector since 2000. This
has seen domestic demand increase by several folds. Yet the country has not made major
investments in new generation capacity since the development of the major hydro-power
stations in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. As a result, Zambia today is faced with an
electricity supply deficit, which poses a serious threat to the sustainability of the
economic gains made in recent years. The national electrification rate continues to remain
at approximately 20 percent nationwide, and, especially in rural areas, it is only about 2
to 3 percent.

95.     To tackle the electricity supply deficit, the government has developed a
strategy that seeks to address short-, medium-, and long-term issues in the energy
sector. The strategy is centered on the following elements: (i) opening the transmission
network to private electricity providers in addition to the state-owned ZESCO; (ii) make
ZESCO more operationally efficient while gradually phasing out the need to subsidize
new capital investments; and (iii) raise electricity tariffs to total cost recovery levels in
order to allow private investors to enter the market.

96.      The government has made substantial inroads in improving the operational
efficiency in ZESCO, as well as to address the most important concerns in the power
sector. As major step towards cost recovery, the government announced a multi-year
tariff framework in 2009 that should see electricity tariffs rise to cost-recovery levels by
2011. A first average tariff increase of 35 percent was implemented in August 2009,
followed by an increase of 25.6 percent in August 2010 helping to bring ZESCO's tariff
close to cost reflective levels. Regarding generation, several sizable electricity
generation projects are underway. Work has commenced at the Kariba North Bank
extension project that will add 360 MW of additional capacity in the medium term. The
government has also reached an agreement with a Chinese investor on the financing and
construction for the Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) project, which is expected to add another
600-750 MW of electricity by 2017. Concerning efficiency, ZESCO has agreed with the
ERB on a set of performance benchmarks to improve its financial and operation

efficiency. The company is as well progressing on its plan to expand the installation of
pre-paid electricity meters across the country.

97.      PRSC's support to the government's reform efforts in the energy sectors is
centered in policy actions to improve the operational efficiency of ZESCO and
increasing household access to electricity. The operation has two milestones to monitor
progress towards this goal (i) increase in the total number of new domestic customers
served by ZESCO, and (ii) decrease in the total number of unmetered customers served
by ZESCO. Progress on these actions should in the short term lead to improved
efficiency of ZESCO and a decrease in its financial losses. Both are essential to putting
the utility company in a sustainable path.

98.     Increasing the number of new domestic household connections added to the
ZESCO grid annually. The purpose of this indicator is to capture total access. There
are about 500,000 households with access to electricity in Zambia (with a total of 2.5
million households). The government's program aims at a minimum growth of 4 percent
per year in domestic connections, so as to consistently increase electricity coverage for
households. In 2008, the first year of electricity reform implementation, new domestic
connections reached 25,700, substantially exceeding the target of 18,000. The relevant
PRSC-2 trigger is for ZESCO to add more than 20,000 new domestic connections to its
electricity grid. This has been achieved. At end-2009, ZESCO had added 35,709 new
connections to the grid, well above the target number of 20,000.

99.     In addition, the government has implemented institutional reforms to
ZESCO designed to improve its operational efficiency. It replaced the entire ZESCO
Board of Directors, including its chairperson, and appointed a new CEO in 2010. The
new Board and the CEO have been instructed to meet, within a year, performance targets
in terms of technical operations, nontechnical losses, and revenue collection. This
complements the existing performance-evaluation framework of key performance
indicators (KPIs) that the Energy Regulator has used since 2008 to monitor ZESCO's
operational performance. In light of ZESCO's poor past performance on these KPIs, the
Energy Regulator has decided to change its assessment of performance by linking it to
KPI scores and enforcing penalties should ZESCO underperform.

PRSC-2 Prior Action: New domestic connections to the ZESCO electricity grid
exceed 20,000 in 2009.

100. Reducing the number of unmetered customers on the ZESCO grid. This
indicator is meant to monitor the operational efficiency of ZESCO. By mid-2009, when
the appraisal of the PRSC-1 was completed, ZESCO had reduced the number of
unmetered customers to 114,000 (surpassing the target of 120,000). Progress in this area
has continued. For the PRSC-2 the prior action was for ZESCO to reduce the number of
unmetered customers to its electricity grid to less than 85,000. This requirement was
fulfilled; at end-2009 ZESCO had reduced the number of unmetered customers to 56,558.

PRSC-2 Prior Action: The number of unmetered ZESCO customers reduced to fewer
than 85,000 by end-2009.

Private Sector Development

101. Progress has been made on streamlining business licensing to reduce the
administrative cost of doing business, under the Private Sector Development
Reform Program (PSDRP). The business licensing and regulatory framework has been
identified as a critical constraint to private sector development due to costly and
cumbersome business licensing procedures and requirements. Most business licensing
and procedures lack transparency, are time consuming, and are in many cases
unnecessary or inappropriate to their ostensible objective. The unnecessarily complex
and onerous process of acquiring proper business licenses also discourages formalization,
further restricting many firms' already limited access to formal-sector financing and
negatively impacting business tax revenue. These effects have particularly impeded the
growth of micro, small and medium enterprises. Under the PSDRP licensing procedures
will be made simpler and more transparent through the elimination or consolidation of a
significant number of administrative requirements. In 2009, following completion of the
PRSC-1 a baseline for all licenses to be eliminated was established by the Government's
Business Licensing Reform Committee, which in February 2009, proposed that, out of
the total 517 business licenses that existed at the time in Zambia, 170 were to be
eliminated, and the rest retained, amalgamated or reclassified. Procedures and processes
associated with the remaining business licenses were to be streamlined as well. The
Government has so far passed 18 laws, which cover 151 business licenses, of which 42
have been eliminated, while the remainder have been retained, amalgamated or
reclassified. The government estimates the reduction in compliance cost already
achieved at ZMK 76.5 billion.

102. Reducing administrative barriers to business registration is expected to
alleviate several key constraints on private-sector development. Eliminating
unnecessary bureaucratic requirements, enhancing the transparency of the licensing
process, and allowing businesses to obtain all their necessary licenses in a single location
will reduce startup and closing costs for formal enterprises. Lower administrative costs
will, in turn, improve Zambia's business climate and attract increased investment, both
foreign and domestic. These reforms are also expected to encourage formalization,
particularly among micro, small and medium enterprises. Zambia's informal sector is
vast and employs a large number of the nation's poor. Informal businesses lack access to
formal-sector credit, exacerbating working-capital traps and other forms of credit
constraint. Informal businesses typically do not pay taxes and they are rarely compelled
to comply with standard business laws.            Easing the process requirements for
formalization is expected to alleviate these constraints on growth by encouraging
informal enterprises to join the formal business community.

PRSC-2 Prior Action: GRZ establishes a baseline for the number of licenses to be
eliminated or streamlined.

103. This operation will help to accelerate and sustain the country's program of
reforms in (i) preserving macroeconomic stability and improve public sector
performance, and (ii) supporting broad-based growth through improving efficiency
in the energy sector and reducing the costs of doing business. Table 4 summarizes
eight prior actions that have been chosen as outcome indicators in these areas, along with
triggers for the successor PRSC-3. Some of these indicators are specific policy actions,
while others refer to outputs that reflect a set of underlying actions. On many of these
issues policy dialogue between the government and its cooperating partners is ongoing,
and the output indicators serve both as proxies for the set of instrumental reforms
ultimately defined, and as measures of the success of these reforms.

   a) Macroeconomic Management:
      As part of the pension reform process, the government has implemented a plan to
      reduce arrears owed to PSPF. Accordingly, through the MoFNP, arrears owed by
      the GRZ to PSPF are reduced to no more than ZMK67 billion at end-2009.

   b) Public Sector Reform:
      As part of the PSRP, and in order to improve the efficiency and accountability of
      the public service, (a) draft pay policy (see paragraph 85) is submitted to the
      Cabinet that supports and reinforces improved financial management and public
      sector reform, and (b) Service Delivery Charters are adopted in the Public Sector
      Management Division, the Department of National Registration, the Ministry of
      Tourism and Natural Resources, and the Ministry of Mines and Mineral
      Development; and the Service Delivery Chapter in the Ministry of Mines and
      Mineral Development is institutionalized.

   c) Public Financial Management:
      As part of the PSRP, and in order to (a) improve budget execution, 85 percent of
      budget heads have calculated expenditures of between 95 percent and 105 percent
      of the total funding for the fiscal year 2009, and (b) to improve transparency and
      public financial management procurement guidelines are drafted and submitted by
      the Zambia Public Procurement Authority to the Ministry of Justice at end-2009.

   d) Energy:
      As part of the implementation of the government's electricity strategy, and in
      order to improve household access to electricity and increase the operational
      efficiency of ZESCO, (a) new domestic connections to ZESCO electricity grid
      exceed 20,000 in 2009, and (b) the number of unmetered ZESCO customers
      reduced to fewer than 85,000 by end 2009.

   e) Cost of Doing Business:
      As part of the Private Sector Development Reform Program (PSDRP), GRZ
      establishes a baseline for the number of licenses to be eliminated or streamlined.

           VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                       A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

104. The proposed PRSC-2 will have a positive, though indirect, effect on
poverty reduction through its support of the government's efforts with
regard to NDP implementation and continued growth. The PRSC is expected
to facilitate poverty reduction through three primary channels. The first is by
assisting the government to maintain a growth-conducive macroeconomic
environment, which will provide the necessary stability for poverty reduction and
wealth creation. The second is through its continued support to improving public
sector management processes, enhancing the government's ability to direct its
scarce resources to high-impact expenditure programs designed to reduce poverty.
The third is by contributing to broad-based growth through improvements in the
efficiency of the energy sector, loosening the binding constraint of electricity
production and reducing the cost of doing business. These impacts could be
measured by assessing progress on relevant indicators included in the quadrennial
Living Conditions Monitoring Survey.

105. The effect of higher electricity tariffs on the poverty rate is negligible.
There are two reasons for this: (a) under the current system the poor have almost
no access to electricity--according to recently revised data from the 2006 Living
Conditions Monitoring Survey only 6 percent or the rural population have access
to the electricity grid, and among the three lowest income quintiles electricity
access is only around 2.5 percent--and (b) the electricity tariffs contain a cross-
subsidy element by maintaining a fixed price for the first kilowatt-hours of
consumption.

            B. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

106. Implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the PRSC will be
completed in the context of the assessment of the PAF, undertaken in
collaboration with the GRZ and other cooperating partners. The agreement
reached between the cooperating partners and GRZ, which was made explicit in
the MoU for budget support, defines reporting requirements, sets out a schedule
of bi-annual meetings to discuss progress and possible revisions to the PAF, and
includes institutional arrangements and platforms for evaluation. In addition, the
cooperating partners have agreed to provide budget support in a way that: (i) is
aligned with GRZ cycles for planning, implementation, monitoring, reporting, and
funding; (ii) improves harmonization by eliminating bilateral administrative and
reporting requirements as well as bilateral reviews; (iii) ensures the transparency
of conditions and funding; and (iv) enhances the capacity of GRZ to meet its
commitments by providing appropriate technical assistance and capacity-building
support.

                                C. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

107. Zambia's fiduciary framework is adequate to support the proceeds of
the credit, particularly in light of the progress made in the PFM reform program
being undertaken under PEMFA and PAF--projects to which the Bank is offering
support. The ongoing reforms under PEMFA and PAF will continue to strengthen
the country's financial management systems, providing further assurance of
fiduciary readiness.

108. As noted above, a number of diagnostic studies of Zambia's PFM
system have determined that public financial management faces several key
weaknesses. These studies include the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment 16 for November 2003 and the PEFA assessments for 2005 and
2008 17. The PEMFA project has been addressing weaknesses in PFM, and while
the reform effort has yielded only modest results so far, some notable
improvements have been achieved, including: (i) commencement of the IFMIS
rollout, (ii) an improved MTEF green paper, (iii) approved public procurement
reform legislation, (iv) the implementation of activity-based budgeting, (v) the
development of a revised chart of accounts, (vi) a strengthened external auditing
process, and (vii) enhancements in parliamentary oversight, among others. The
2008 PEFA assessment recorded improvements in transparency,
comprehensiveness and accountability in fiscal management, evidence that
progress is being made under the PEMFA project. Policies designed to further
address PFM weaknesses, especially the public service compensation reforms and
ongoing improvements in budget execution, are also being supported by the
PRSC.

109. The most recent Safeguards Assessment for the Bank of Zambia
(BoZ) was completed by the IMF on January 13, 2009. The assessment found
that aspects of the BoZ safeguards framework have been strengthened since the
previous assessment, completed in 2004. Specifically, the BoZ had implemented
International Financial Reporting Standards in 2005 and recently strengthened its
foreign reserves management and oversight systems. Weak statutory
independence, protracted external audit completion, and the non-publication or
delayed publication of audit information all remain important safeguard concerns.
To address these issues the assessment recommended that the BoZ:

        -   put in place year-end closing and audit-planning procedures to
            facilitate more rapid completion of the annual external audit;

        -   adopt legislative amendments that address all legal safeguard concerns
            raised in the 2004 safeguards report;

16
    A comprehensive Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
   (PEMFAR) was carried out by the Government of the Republic of Zambia with the support of
   cooperating partners and the World Bank in November 2003.
17
   The Government of Zambia has carried out an internal assessment of the PFM system based on
   PEFA indicators finalized in 2005 and in 2008.


                                             40
       -   publish the annual audited financial statements and audit opinions on
           the BoZ's external website no later than one month after audit
           completion;

       -   commission an external quality-assurance review of the work practices
           of the internal audit function and the oversight exercised by the BoZ
           Audit Committee;

       -   mandate that the external audit firm, in coordination with the Internal
           Audit Department, verify unissued currency in vaults at year-end and
           reconcile the confirmed balances with corresponding documentation
           from the printing firms;

       -   request that the MoFNP fill the vacant seat on the Board by appointing
           a person with professional experience in accounting and auditing, who
           should also serve on the Audit Committee; and

       -   implement a review of all program data for accuracy, and for
           consistency with the technical MOU conducted by BoZ's Internal
           Audit Department.

                        D. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

Disbursements

110. A single-tranche credit equivalent to US$30 million will be made
available upon the Poverty Reduction Support Credit's effectiveness. The
proposed credit will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
policy lending. Once the credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective,
and upon receipt of a withdrawal application signed by an authorized signatory,
the proceeds will be deposited by IDA in a US$ account designated by the GRZ at
the BoZ. The credit proceeds will form part of the country's foreign exchange
reserves. Within two business days, the BoZ will credit the Zambian kwacha
(ZMK) equivalent of the credit proceeds to the consolidated accounts maintained
on behalf of the GRZ for budget execution. The Accountant-General will be
notified accordingly. The BoZ will not impose any charges or commission on the
GRZ for these transactions. The conversion from United States dollars to
Zambian kwacha will be based on the prevailing exchange rate on the date that
the funds are credited to the consolidated account. The government, through the
MoFNP, will (i) provide written confirmation to IDA within 30 days that an
amount equivalent to the credit proceeds from IDA has been credited to the
consolidated account along with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (ii)
provide evidence that the ZMK equivalent of the credit proceeds was recorded as
financing the GRZ budget; and (iii) ensure that the ZMK equivalent of the credit
proceeds are subject to effective controls sufficient to ensure its use for eligible,
budgeted public expenditures only as per the Credit Agreement. If the proceeds of
the credit are used for ineligible purposes, IDA will require the GRZ to promptly


                                         41
refund an amount equal to the total of the ineligible expenditures. The refunded
amount will be cancelled, thereby reducing the amount of the credit. The
administration of the credit shall be the responsibility of the MoFNP.

Auditing

111. The use of the ZMK equivalent of Credit proceeds to support
budgetary expenditures will be subject to audit by the Auditor General as
provided for by the Zambian Constitution. The Bank will have access to these
audit reports. The annual financial statements of the BoZ are audited in
accordance with International Standards of Auditing and the financial statements
are publicly available.

                         E. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

112. Environmental Impact. The proposed operation is likely to have no
significant effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources. The
first set of triggers is linked to public administration. The policy goals are
enhanced productivity of civil servants and greater efficiency in the use of public
funds. There will be positive and negative impacts on the natural environment.
The energy triggers are designed to support the government's energy policy and
in particular to effect improvements in the governance and efficiency of ZESCO.
One indicator will require an absolute increase in electrical grid coverage which,
in Zambia, can only result from an increase in power generation. The potential
environmental consequences of this should be positive, on balance. On the one
hand, an increase in the number of connections could be beneficial to the
environment by providing an energy alternative to charcoal, with positive impacts
on deforestation and indoor air pollution. On the other hand, the construction
and/or upgrading of hydroelectric dams, or increased non-hydropower generation,
could have a range of negative consequences for the bio-physical environment.
The country's regulatory systems and environmental legislation is normally
adequate, with suitable legislation on environmental impact assessments (EIA)
and corresponding institutions. Regulatory shortcomings include (a) a legal
provision that enables the reversal of decisions made by the Environment Council
of Zambia, and (b) the lack of compliance with and/or enforcement of decisions
on the adaptation or mitigation of industrial, mining or large-scale agriculture
operations. The government has committed to adopting a new Environment
Policy and to maintaining a dialogue with the Bank and other PRBS financiers on
improved enforcement of its environmental legislation.

                        F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

113. Political Risks. The government is not immune to populist pressures and
the allure of short-term political gains, especially considering the ongoing
campaign for the general elections to be held in mid-2011. This could result in
the postponement of some reforms and weaken the fiscal stance. However, the
potential impact on the steady, consistent administrative direction needed to


                                        42
effectively implement the measures supported by the PRSC in general, and PFM,
Public Service Management and energy strategy reforms in particular, is
relatively minor. For example, despite political-economy constrains, efforts to
introduce a cost-recovery tariff and make the necessary improvements in
ZESCO's operating efficiency have advanced, and now there is ample political
support for the need to improve ZESCO's performance and increase electricity
generating capacity and private investment in the sector. At the macroeconomic
level, the need to increase fiscal revenues and contain current spending will
remain a challenge. Within the current macroeconomic framework the necessary
reforms included in the PSPF could be affected during the run-up to elections in
mid-2011. To mitigate these challenges IDA, working in close collaboration with
GRZ and other cooperating partners, including the IMF under the ECF
arrangement, is striving both at the national and sector level in favor of continuing
the reform program. There is also a frank and open dialogue being conducted
with the political leadership at the highest level, including Members of
Parliament, aimed at highlighting the importance of continued reform momentum
even in the run-up to the national elections.

114. Lower-Than-Expected Growth. Despite significant improvements in
Zambia's fiscal stance, the lasting effects of the global financial crisis and the
economy's continued reliance on a single primary-commodity export could
threaten Zambia's growth rate if copper prices fall. It is not clear that there will
be consensus on how to respond to such a circumstance and, more importantly,
that the political resolve by the government to tackle difficult issues involved will
be present. However, the current ECF arrangement with the IMF and the
relatively large size of the country's international reserves are expected to dampen
the economic contraction that such an event would trigger. The Bank and other
donors are helping the government to diversity the national economy through
program support and policy dialogue on structural reforms. This effort has thus
far been successful, as evidenced by an increase in Zambia's exports of non-
mineral products, which amounted to about US$1 billion in 2010 compared to
US$700 million in 2007.

115. Governance Issues. Concerns have been raised regarding governance
issues in the Ministry of Health, the roads-sector agencies, and the government's
overall commitment to anticorruption measures, including funding for the national
anticorruption agency. Although the official policy of the government is to
support and implement anticorruption policies, the risk is that improvements in
some sectors could be offset by continuing problems in other sectors. In order to
mitigate those risks the Bank, together with other cooperating partners, has been
actively following the activities of the Office of the Auditor General and
supporting efforts to adopt new corrective measures. This is exemplified by the
Governance Road Maps for the public health and road transportation sectors,
which developed a program of remedial actions the implementation of which is
monitored on a regular basis. Moreover, donors have liaised with the
Parliamentary Accounts Committee, which is playing an important oversight role



                                         43
with regard to these specialized audits and the audits of the annual financial
reports.

116. Implementation Capacity. Although the overall program of reforms is
encouraging, there are challenges in policy implementation, specifically in terms
of policies linked to public sector reform, the civil service compensation structure,
and budget execution in public finance management that could derail the reform
efforts encompassed by the PRSC-2. To mitigate this risk an ongoing operation
has been implemented by the Bank and other cooperating partners supporting
government capacity building in public sector management and public
expenditure management, and in the reform of financial accountability protocols.
For instance, the PEMFA program was specifically designed to assist the
authorities in improving institutional capacity and the management of public
finances, and has now been extended by IDA. Several cooperating partners are
also implementing reform programs involving oversight institutions such as the
Office of the Auditor General and the Parliament. A new Procurement Act has
been passed and new guidelines have been issued. The former National Tender
Board has been replaced by the Zambia Public Procurement Authority in line with
the Act. Given the continuing progress in institutional strengthening being made
under these programs, the risk posed by limited implementation capacity should
not present a constraint on the execution of the PRSC-2 program.

      The number of MPSAs where total releases as a proportion of the total approved GRZ budget was between 95 and 105 percent has been increasing in the period 2005 to 2007 (from 25 % to 28.6% to 48%). However, as most of the releases are counted for by PEs, over which there
             is no discretion in the implementation of the budget, a more appropriate indicator that looks at the PEs only has been selected.
             It was initially planned that throughout the year (2009) a quarterly expenditure allocation plan will be developed (commitment ceiling as developed by MoFNP) outlining how the MoFNP will allocate its approved budget on a quarterly basis, however due to the difficult
             fiscal situation the government has found itself in throughout the year this has not been possible. Once this is adopted it will entail a shift in the emphasis of the indicator from one that measures credibility of the budget to one that measures regularity of releases to MPSAs.
             To achieve this a more comprehensive discussion around the MPSA budget profile is required. The Improved formulation of this indicator will be agreed within the frame of the Budget Execution Working group. Any further work that may be required could be carried out
             under the auspices of PEMFA.
             The indicator is calculated by the number of MPSAs who received between 95% and 105% of releases .
             Source of data is Comparison of Expenditure against Releases, produced by the Accountant General's Office and placed on the MoFNP website.
             The Report on Performance will highlight specifically the budget releases as a proportion of budget provision to

    Calculated Expenditure are a composition of Opening Cash Balance plus Total Funding less closing cash balances, where total finding is GRZ releases, donor funds, opening cash balance brought forward from previous year and appropriations in aid (AIA). Reported Expenditure is
             the actual expenditure reported by Ministries, Provinces and Spending Agencies (MPSAs) and does not include imprests, advances which are in suspense, or below the line accounts. Below the line accounts are suspense accounts and are budgeted for above the line and
             only recognized as expenditure once they are acquitted such as imprest, advances, third party payments etc. Calculation of unretired imprests = comparison of the outstanding imprest amounts derived from the imprest statements for institutions against their calculated
             expenditure in percentage form.
             Figures identified in Statement C produced by Office of the Accountant General. These are also included in the Financial Statement FMS 93.00_Expenditure by Head; FMS 93.20_Expenditure by head and Sub Head; and FMS 93.05_Comparison of Expenditure Against
             Releases.
             Measures MPSAs ability to spend and account for the releases provided by MoFNP.
             The development and installation of the IFMIS system will contribute considerably to the improvement of performance in this target (hence the 2011 target). If appropriate, the annual report on performance will provide an update on the implementation of the IFMIS
             programme and for 2010 a comparison of performance between the old and new system.

    ZK Amount of arrears at the end of the financial year, excluding statutory pension arrears.
             Domestic arrears are defined as: (i) any bill that has been received by a spending ministry from a supplier for goods and services delivered (and verified) and for which payment has not been made within 30 days after the due date of payments; (ii) wage, salary and any
             payment to government employees, including all forms of housing allowances, that were due to be paid in a given month but remained unpaid on the 15th of the following month; and (iii) interest or principal obligations which remain unpaid 30 days after the due date of
             payment. This is the same definition of arrears used in the PRGF
             Information for the indictor will be based on audits of the accounts of spending Ministries and agencies, conducted by the Internal Audit division of the MoFNP. This is as per the PRGF (Table 2 of the July Review) which state the audits will be completed and data
             submitted to IMF staff by the Secretary of the Treasury within six weeks of the end of each quarter.
             At present, negligible amount is defined as the equivalent of one months allocation to utility bills. This indicator will be dropped from 2010 onwards.

      Steps for calculation for (a) Total:
                (i)    For each budget head included calculate the deviation between actual expenditure and original budget
                (ii) Sum the absolute value of the deviations for all budget heads
                (iii) Calculate the sum as a % of total budgeted expenditure
                The indicator shall measure the extent to which reallocations between budget heads have contributed to variance in expenditure composition.
                Steps for calculation for (b) Selected Expenditures:
                (i)    For each of the eight budget heads and one sub-head calculate the deviation between actual expenditure and original budget
                (ii) Sum the absolute value of the deviations for the selected budget heads
                (iii) Calculate the sum as a % of total budgeted expenditure for the selected heads
                The Eight selected heads are (a) Ministry of Health; (b) Ministry of Education; (c) MEWD; (d) MACO; (e) MWS; (f) MLGH; (g) OAG; (h) MoFNP.

      The arrears questions should be under control by the end of 2008 (but will still be monitored). The impending problem is however the funding gap. As there is no agreement on what this could be, or the measures in place to address this a number of process indicators are
               included. For the assessment of this indicator, if two are met, then it receives an assessment of part met.

      This is different to the indicator Domestic Revenue as a % of GDP as it specifically excludes revenue from mining companies in the form of company tax, mineral royalty and windfall tax. It does not take out revenues, such as PAYE from employees in the mines. Historically the
                  PAF recorded the total revenues to government, which increased from 16.1 (in 2006) to 17.1 (in 2007) with a target for 2008 of 16.9%. The non mining revenue target in this figure for 2008 was 15.4%. This was included in the previous versions of the PAF. The
                  assumptions that underline the projections for 2009 and 2010 are GDP growth rate of 6% in each year, an inflation rate of 11.5% in 2009 and 10.0% in 2010, as well as Copper Prices of US$2.50 per pound in 2009 and US$2.35 in 2010. This indicator will be dropped from
                  2010 and a new one on Enforcement of Mining Tax Regime.

    The FINSCOPE survey is a nationally representative survey, based on the entire adult population. The calculation is based on the access strand which categorises the adult population as banked, formally included, and financially served. In this Banked is the percentage of
              respondents that say they have a service from a bank, but may also be using formal other or informal providers. Formal other is the percentage of respondents who are not banked, but are using a service from a formal provider (e.g. microfinance institution). These people
              may also be using an informal provider and Informal only: Percentage of respondents who only use informal providers.
              The survey is not carried out every year, as such targets cannot be included. If the FSDP ll is approved and funded then milestones from this can be incorporated in the intervening years, otherwise this will be dropped from the PAF from 2010.

     The indicator will be dropped from 2010 as there are on-going difficulties in measuring this on a national level; The amounts supported by Public Funds would only be a minimal amount of the overall total. This will be replaced by AGR2(b) on growth rate in the Agricultural
              Sector.

      The targets for both indicators will be confirmed one the Roadsip Mid Term Review has been approved

       The lower end of the range is the minimum amount of connections to be made in the year. The upper end is the target if the requested tariff increase is granted to Zesco. The target at the end of the year will be calculated on a pro rata basis (ie for each month left in the year after the
              tariff increase is granted, it is expected 10,000/12 will be added).

     Throughout 2008/9 work has been on-going on setting the baseline and target, including carrying out a Business License Inventory (2008/09). This Inventory of 517 licenses, identifies compliance costs associated with licensing ok K 2.2 trillion. The data source for 2010
             performance will be a repeat of the Business Livence Audit.

     The threshold has changed from 2010 (hence the separate indicator EDU1(b). There remains major problems with the denominator used which is coming from the Population Projections based on the Census
TN14
     A similar difficulty exists with the denominator, hence the shift to a differentiation between boys and girls at a district level; it is assumed that the problems in projecting the population will be a constant for boys and girls

     The targets are cumulative targets, based on an annual increase of 250,000. The Baseline of numbers having received results of 800,000 was set in 2007, based on the ZDHS 2001/2 results on HIV testing, which show 8 percent of the population aged 15 ­ 49 ­ the equivalent of
             400,000 people in this age group had been tested.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under ECF Arrangement
with Zambia and Approves US$28.3 Million Disbursement
Press Release No. 10/484
December 10, 2010


The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed
the fifth review of Zambia's economic performance under a program supported
by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). Completion of the review enables the
immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 18.395 million (about
US$28.3 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR
201.7 million (about US$310.3 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board also granted a waiver for the
nonobservance of a performance criterion on non-concessional external debt at
end-December 2009 and approved the modification of the performance criteria
for end December 2010 on net domestic assets of the Bank of Zambia and on net
domestic financing of the central government, as well as a modification to the
performance criterion on non-concessional external debt. The ECF arrangement
for Zambia was originally approved in June 2008 (see Press Release No 08/134),
and then augmented in May 2009 by SDR 171.185 million (about US$256.4
million) to an amount equivalent to SDR 220.095 million (about
US$329.7 million) (see Press Release No. 09/147). Zambia has been a member of
the Fund since September 1965.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Zambia, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
"Zambia's economic prospects continue to improve, thanks to sound
macroeconomic policies and progress in structural reforms. Growth remains
strong, inflation is subdued, and the external position has been solid. The main
medium-term challenge is to create fiscal space for priority spending, enhance
economic diversification and reduce poverty.
"A prudent policy stance will help shelter the economy from continued global
uncertainty and ensure that underlying inflation, especially on nonfood items,
continues to decline as targeted. The fiscal strategy remains centered on
increasing revenues, including from the mining sector, containing wages and
other recurrent spending, and improving the efficiency of spending. The 2011
budget is consistent with making significant progress in meeting these
challenges.
"Financial sector conditions are gradually improving, with credit to the private
sector slowly reviving, although nonperforming loans remain high. While most
banks are well capitalized and have ample liquidity, the authorities need to
strengthen bank monitoring and contingency planning, to contain vulnerabilities.
"Financing needs are becoming more acute with regard to addressing growth-
critical infrastructural requirements. Increased but prudent reliance on non-


                                       78
concessional financing is appropriate given the challenges in identifying
additional concessional resources and the moderate external debt levels.
However, non-concessional financing should remain strictly directed to growth-
critical spending that would provide high economic returns. The strengthening of
debt management and project appraisal capacity are critical in this regard and the
authorities' determination to make progress in these areas expeditiously is
welcome," added Mr. Shinohara.
