REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTCRS ON A PRCPOSED
LOAN TO THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
AND A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on:  a proposed
loan to the Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC), with the guarantee
of the Republic of Korea, for the equivalent of $33 million with interest
at 7¼s per annum and repayable in 30 years including a six-year period of
grace, and a proposed development credit on standard IDA terms for the
equivalent of $15 million to the Republic of Korea, to be relent to the
ADC on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan. The loan and credit
would help finance irrigation for about 33,000 hectares in the southwest
part of Korea to increase the production of rice, vegetables, fruit and
other crops.
PART I - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
2.        Korea has received six IDA credits amounting to $65.o million,
of which one of $3.5 million for highway studies and engineering has been
incorporated in a loan of $54.5 million for highway construction, and
six Bank loans amounting to $194h5 million, a total of $256.o million.
The largest share of Bank Group financing, $134.2 million, has gone to
the transport sector - $79.7 million for railways and $54.5 million for
highways. The IKorea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) has received
$55 million in Bank loans for relending to private industrial enterprises.
The balance of the Bank Group's past lending is accounted for by $52
million for agriculture (irrigation and livestock) and $14.8 million for
education.
3.        Of the total Bank Group lending of $256.0 million, $178.9 million
remained undisbursed as of November 30, 1971. This relatively large amount
is explained, in part, by the fact that several large loans were made
within the past year and a half, and by the small disbursements made so
far under a 1969 loan of $45 million for the Pyongtaek-Kumgang irrigation
project. The original borrower under that project, the Union of Land
Improvement Associations, was dissolved soon after the loan was made and
replaced by the ADC, the borrower of the loan now proposed. The change
of borrower, combined with the fact it took longer than expected to employ
consultants to supervise the execution of the project, has put the
Pyongtaek-Kumgang project about one year behind schedule. However, a
recent supervision mission reported that the project is now well under way
and may be concluded within the original construction schedule. The
education project was also slow in getting started due to delays in orga-
nizing the project team, but is now progressing satisfactorily.



4.        Before the end of this fiscal year I expect to recommend an
IDA credit for an agricultural credit project, which, together with the
lending operation described here, would increase our contribution to a
sector which has been neglected in the past and which requires heavy
additional investments. Projects under active consideration for next
year include agricultural warehouses, a fourth loan to the Korea Devel-
opment Finance Corporation, education, tourism, port development and
railroads.
5.        IFC has made three investments in Korea and its holdings amount
to $7.4 million in loans and shares. IFC is presently considering an
investment in the shares of the Korea Investment and Finance Corporation,
a new financial institution which will assist the development of the
capital and money markets in Korea. Further investment possibilities are
being investigated by IFC. A statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments is given in Annex I.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.        A report entitled "The Economic Situation and Prospects of the
Republic of Korea" (EAP-25ap dated September 13, 1971) was circulated to
the Executive Directors and members of the Consultative Group on September
17, 1971. The fifth meeting of the Consultative Group was held in Tokyo
in October 1971. Basic data on the country are given in Annex II.
7.        Rapid economic growth, with strong emphasis on industrialization
and exports, has been a basic objective of the Government's policy. This
objective has been effectively fostered by Government policies of active
encouragement of private business, and by a well-educated, disciplined
and low-wage labor force. Agricultural production has advanced at the
fairly satisfactory rate of 3% to 4% a year but farm income has not kept
pace because of the lag of farm prices. GNP increased in real terms by
ll% a year during 1965-70, while GNP per capita rose by almost 9% a year
to reach US$222 in 1970. The population growth rate, restrained by an
active official family planning program, declined from an average 2.8%
a year in the first half of the decade to 2.2% in 1970. The economically
active population increased at 2% a year during 1965-69 while employment
increased at 2.6% a year. Thus, Korea has been able to expand its employ-
ment opportunities suffici ntly to absorb the increase in the labor force
and, at the same time, reduce the level of unemployment from about 7.4%
in 1965 to 4.8% in 1969.
8.        While exports have been rising rapidly, both the expansion of
investment demand at a rate greatly in excess of the rate of increase in
domestic savings, and the low domestic content of industrial production,
have caused an equally rapid increase in imports. Consequently, the
foreign deficit on goods and services increased steadily from $194 million
in 1965 to $803 million in 1970. Large external capital inflows were more
than sufficient to cover the payments deficits, however, and official
foreign exchange reserves increased from $235 million in 1966 to $584
million at the end of 1970.



9.        Koreats outstanding economic performance in terms of growth
has been achieved at the cost of moderate, but continuous inflation, a
persistent balance of payments deficit and heavy external indebtedness.
Realizing the importance of keeping the external debt burden within
manageable limits and of containing inflation, the Government, in late
1969, adopted a set of monetary and fiscal stabilization measures in
agreement with the IMF that were designed to limit the growth of private
consumption, curb credit expansion and cut down the growth of imports
and foreign borrowing.
10.       The stabilization program had significant effects on the econ-
omy in 1970, most important being a fall in investment and foreign bor-
rowing and a slowdown in import growth. Despite the Government's efforts
at stabilization, however, developments in the first ten months of 1971
indicate a recurrence of the financial management problem. The rate of
GNP increase accelerated, with a rapid increase in manufacturing. Import
demand rose sharply. While the pace of export expansion slowed down
somewhat in mid-year, partly because of a stagnant import demand in Japan
and partly because of international economic developments, it still seems
likely that, the export total will not be far below the target for the year.
Thus, while the United States import surcharge undoubtedly had some dis-
ruptive effects, these were not serious. The Government took major sta-
bilization measures in June 1971, which included a devaluation of the Won
by 11.5% and increases in advance deposit requirements. It was hoped
that these measures, in combination with related credit restraint, would
slow the pace of economic activities and imports in the latter part of
1971. While their full effects still remain to be seen, the import
figures in particular are not encouraging. The likely outcome for the
whole year is a goods and services deficit in the balance of payments
that will probably exceed a billion dollars and another large increase
in real GNP - perhaps by as much as 11%, although this might be lower
if the harvest is bad, as early signs indicate.
11.       This is a different pattern of development from that proposed
in the new development plan for the five-year period starting next year.
Hence, adjustments now seem necessary to realign the economy with the
planned pattern of expansion. The Government recognizes the need to con-
tinue, if not reinforce, the present stabilization measures of restraining
domestic credit creation, limiting external borrowings on unfavorable terms
and maintaining a balanced budget.
12.       The manner in which the Government proposes to deal with these
issues is spelled out in Korea's Third Five-Year Economic Development
Plan, to be implemented during 1972-76.  It proposes substantial expansion,
structural changes in agriculture and industry, and a very large increase
in exports, within a fairly stable financial framework and a manageable
balance of payments. The Plan would maintain a still high, but somewhat
slower, economic growth rate of 8.6% a year. Population growth would be
reduced to about 1.5% a year and the per capita income target would be
about $340 (in 1970 dollar prices) by 1976. The Plan emphasizes a better
distribution of development gains, to result mainly from an inerease in
the agricultural growth rate to 4.5% a year, with average annual growth



- 4 -
of industrial output targeted to drop from around 20 to about 13%. The
growth rate of investment would slow down, while national savings would
rise to about 21% of GNP, thus narrowing Korea's resource deficit to 5%
of GNP. These investment and savings trends, combined with a planned
three-fold increase in exports, are expected to reduce the net foreign
capital inflow and keep gross external inflows of foreign loans and
investments to about $4 billion for the five years, or an average of
$800 million a year.
13.       The projected growth rate seems likely to require a larger in-
vestment outlay than allowed for in Korean plans. Thus, Korea's gross require-
ments for external capital will continue to be high even if policies of
restraint are pursued. The reasons for this are the high level of debt
service that has already been reached, the wide gap that remains between
savings and investment even after the impressive gains in savings to a
level of 16% of GNP in 1970 (and the plan target of 21% by 1976), and
the expected deterioration in the service account of Korea's balance of
payments due to withdrawals of U.S. forces from Korea and Korean forces
from Viet-Nam.
14.       Nevertheless, Korean capabilities for economic growth generally,
and for export expansion in particular, should not be underrated, con-
sidering the record of rapid development and effective economic manage-
ment in recent years. Without being specific, the Government has stated
its intention of adjusting economic policies so as to keep within the
modest growth targets of the Plan and to maintain a manageable foreign
exchange and external debt position. This intention was reiterated at
the recent meeting of the Consultative Group for Korea. It seems rea-
sonable to expect Korea to continue on its course of rapid economic
development, and it can be considered creditworthy for further Bank
loans. At the same time, considering Korea's low level of per capita
income and heavy dependence on foreign capital, some of the assistance
from the Bank Group should continue to be on IDA terms.
15.       The number of high priority projects in the public sector
having a substantial foreign exchange element is relatively limited.
Many of the projects with a large foreign exchange component are in the
private industrial sector, and are financed from private sources and
export credit agencies. The Bank Group's financing is going increasingly
into infrastructure, agriculture and education projects which are of high
priority but often have a low foreign exchange component. In these cir-
cumstances, the Bank Group is justified in lending for local expenditure,
PART III - THE PROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
16.       Agriculture provides a livelihood for about half of the country's
total population of 32 million, but contributes only about 26% to GNP.
The country is rugged and mountainous, with forests covering over two-
thirds of the land area. Because of the generally poor quality of the



-5-
wood and the inaccessibility of much of the forest land, forestry con-
tributes only a small part to the value added of the agricultural sector.
During and after the Korean war many of the hills were stripped to provide
fuel, and the Government has undertaken programs of reforestation which
have been quite successful.  The fishery industry, though relatively small,
earns the country an appreciable amount of foreign exchange, and signifi-
cant efforts have been made to modernize the coastal and deep-sea fishing
fleets. Farming is still basically subsistence oriented, with an average
farm size   of less than one hectare. But because Korean farmers are
progressive and extremely hard-working, yields per hectare are quite high.
Roughly half of the total cultivated area produces more than one crop each
year, as a result of interplanting and double cropping. Livestock pro-
duction has increased substantially during the past five years, and the
Government is upgrading the quality of beef and dairy herds through cattle
imports and fattening programs.
17.       In the Third Five-Year Development Plan, to run from 1972 to
1976, the Government has put major emphasis on developing the agricultural
sector. From the time, about ten years ago, that the economy began to
shift from a predominantly agricultural base to one that is highly industry-
oriented, the rural population has slipped considerably behind its urban
counterpart in terms of wages, education, health, shelter and the general
amenities of life. During the decade of the sixties the rate of growth
of agriculture averaged about 4% per year, which is quite good when com-
pared to other developing countries but is far below Korea's overall
growth rate of about 11% per year during the same period. The share of
agricultural income in national income declined from 39% in 1965 to 26%
by 1970, whereas the decline in the proportion of the population engaged
in agriculture was much slower. Real income of farmers increased during
this period, but at a considerably slower rate than that of the urban
population, a result of the slower growth of agricultural productivity
compared to the non-agricultural sectors.
18.       Total gross public and private investment during the Third Plan
is estimated at 4.,525 billion Won ($12 billion), of which 536 billion Won
($1.4 billion) has been allocated to agriculture, forestry and fishery.
This is almost double the share during the Second Plan (1967-71). The
major emphasis will be placed on the distribution of improved seeds, farm
mechanization, and the consolidation of fragmented holdings and providing
them with new and improved irrigation, drainage and roads. most
of these planned activities are in pursuit of one of the Government's
major agricultural goals: to be self-sufficient in rice by 1976.
19.       The Government intends to increase rice production from 3.9
million tons in 1970 to 4.6 million tons in 1976, thereby gradually re-
ducing imports of rice which may be close to one million tons in 1971.
The production of other cereals, such as barley and wheat, are also
expected to increase, but total foodgrain imports will continue at about
two million tons a year. To attain the planned production increases the
Government has adopted an agricultural development strategy consisting
of wider use of modern agricultural inputs, better water resource management,



- 6 -
price incentives for farmers and improved agricultural infrastructure
such as better farm roads and increased availability of electricity. The
use of power tillers and other agricultural machinery will be promoted by
consolidating irregularly shaped and scattered holdings.
20.       In order to attain self-sufficiency in rice, the Government has
been following a policy of high rice prices, through which it expects to
stimulate local production, curtail consumption, and also increase farm
income. Under this policy, minimum guaranteed prices are established each
year, with the Government purchasing about 10% of the rice produced in
the country and then reselling it on the open market. With a steady
increase in the guaranteed prices after 1967 and close control of imports,
prices on the open market have also increased and are now around $300 per
ton, polished, which is about double the c.i.f. price of imported rice.
As pointed out to the Government at the recent Consultative Group meeting,
and also during the negotiations, relying on excessively high prices to
increase production and farm income may keep marginal rice lands from
better alternative uses and could impede the ability of the agricultural
sector to meet the growing denand for non-cereal primary products. While
being aware of these implications, the Government considers it essential
to be self-sufficient in rice for financial, social and political reasons.
Although the project under consideration would not put new land under rice
and so would not divert land better suited to other crops, it would be
desirable to examine the full implications of the rice self-sufficiency
policy before proceeding with further capital-intensive irrigation projects.
The Agriculture Projects Department has agreed to schedule a sector mission
in early FY 1973, the findings of which would provide a ba9is for our
future lending strategy for agriculture. The proposed loan and credit
would finance a feasibility study for the next stage in the overall devel-
opment plan of the Yong San Gang basin and this study, together with the
sector survey, should enable the Government and ourselves to decide whether
the further development of the river basin would be justified.
21.       The amount of funds available to farmers on medium and long-term
is not sufficient to permit an effective reorganization and diversification
of Korean agriculture. The existing channel for agricultural credit is
the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) which relies mostly
on Government funds for its resources. The proposed agricultural credit
project now being processed till make more funds available to farmers
and will strengthen the NACF to make it more responsive to the needs of
the agricultural sector.
22.       Although the Government's major concern in the agricultural
sector is to increase the production of rice and other foodgrains, it is
also trying to stimulate other activities such as sericulture, the live-
stock industry, the provision of adequate storage facilities for agri-
cultural commodities, research into and production of high-yielding seeds,
farm mechanization and more intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides.
Besides these specific areas the Government has an ambitious program to
improve the rural environment during the five years of the Third Devel-
opment Plan through more rural electrification, expansion of the tele-
communications network, improvement of rural housing, modernization of
the water supply systems and the provision of better medical attention.

DESCRIPTION CF THE PROJECT
23.       The Yong San Gang is one of four river basins which the Govern-
ment proposes to develop with large-scale irrigation works under its All
Weather Farming Program. The proposed project, which was prepared with
assistance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and a Japanese team of
consultants (Sanyu Consultants International), will provide assured irri-
gation to 33,000 hectares in a drought-prone area in the southwest portion
of the country.  It would consist of the construction of dams, reservoirs,
irrigation and drainage systems, on-farm development and service roads,
the consolidation of fragmented holdings and the provision of supporting
agricultural services.
24.       With emphasis on the production of rice, fruits, vegetables and
other specialty crops, the proposed project will contribute in an important
way to the Government's agricultural development program and is expected
to more than double the income of the 45,000 farm families involved. As
existing farm holdings are presently fragmented and of irregular shape,
they would be consolidated and arranged into tracts of more or less equal
size to permit efficient use of the irrigation system and mechanized agri-
cultural equipment. In the project area some 24,000 hectares are culti-
vated with rice-barley rotation and an additional 9,000 hectares, mainly
uplands, are cultivated with vegetables and other crops. Because of the
practice of double-cropping, the total area cultivated is equivalent to
5s0,5OO hectares. Rice is the predominant crop, accounting for about half
the cropped area and nearly 80% of the value of production. Following com-
pletion of the project, the area under rice will remain the same but out-
put will rise as a result of an assured water supply and better drainage.
With the increase in the cropping intensity, the total area cultivated
becomes equivalent to 60,000 hectares. The area under barley will decline
while the area under fruit, vegetables and other specialty crops, which are
in growing demand as the real income of the population increases, will
rise appreciably.
25.       Following the practice in the Pyongtaek-Kumgang project, water
rates charged to the farmers benefiting from new or improved irrigation
and reclamation projects would cover the full costs of operation and main-
tenance (including the cost of agricultural extension services) as well
as the repayment of 40% of the capital cost with interest at 3.5% over a
period of about 40 years, roughly equivalent to two-thirds of the capital
cost without interest. On this basis the recovery of the project costs
would amount to about $100 per hectare per year. Recovering only a part
of the capital costs avoids imposing an undue burden on farmers and
weakening their incentive to improve their agricultural practices. The
Government has undertaken to study the feasibility of establishing a
graduated schedule for payment of water charges based on the size of land
holdings and total income from farming operations.
The Implementing Agency
26.       The Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC), a semi-autonomous
public entity within the Ministry of Agriculture, would have overall re-
sponsibility for the project. The ADC has broad responsibilities for the



- 8 -
development of land and water resources in rural areas throughout Korea
and has acquired a large, competent staff of administrators and specialists.
A special project unit was set up to implement the Pyongtaek-Kumgang irri-
gation project and a similar unit will be established for the Yong San
Gang project under the supervision of an ADC director.
27.       Responsibility for day-to-day activities would be delegated to
a central project field office, and four branch offices at each of the
major construction sites would supervise the work. Although the ADC staff
has considerable experience in designing and implementing small-scale irri-
gation projects, it is not geared to undertake two large projects simulta-
neously. The ADC would, therefore, engage a consulting firm to prepare
final designs and tender documents, evaluate bids, and supervise construction.
28.       The ADC, an arm of the Ministry of Agriculture, recovers some
costs from beneficiaries through Land Improvement Associations (associa-
tions of farmers having irrigated land) but most of its resources come in
the form of budgetary allocations from the Government. Following comple-
tion of the project the ADC would operate and maintain the four dams and
main irrigation and drainage systems, while the Land Improvement Associa-
tions would operate and maintain the systems at the farm level.
Cost, Procurement and Financing
29.       The cost of the project, including contingencies of $21.1
million, is estimated at $85.2 million. The proposed Bank Group financing
of $48 million would finance 52% of the project cost and interest during
construction of $3.4 million.  Government budgetary allocations to ADC
would finance the balance.
29.       Contracts for civil works, equipment, materials and supplies
required for the project would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. The tendering of contracts for civil works would be
the responsibility of ADC. The tendering of contracts for equipment,
materials and supplies would be the responsibility of the Office of Supply
of the Republic of Korea (OSROK). Domestic suppliers of equipment would
be given a preference of 15%, or the prevailing customs duty if lower, in
the evaluation of bids. Disbuirsements would be made against the c.i.f.
cost of imported equipment, materials and supplies and the ex-factory cost
of locally supplied items;  and against foreign exchange payments for
consulting services. Disbursements for civil works would be made on a
percentage basis representing the estimated foreign cost of the works.
30.       Bank Group financing would cover the foreign costs of the
project, computed on the assumption that all civil works would be carried
out by local contractors and that equipment, materials and supplies would
be imported. In the event that local bidders win the latter contracts,
the proposed loan and credit would finance up to $2 million of local
expenditures.



-9-
Economic Evaluation
31.       The proposed project would bring about a substantial increase
in agricultural production, mostly through higher productivity. Farm
activities would be diversified from the traditional rice-barley sequence
into higher value crops such as garlic, potatoes, Chinese cabbage and
fruit. The income of participants in the project would be considerably
increased and the country's balance of payments would be benefited to
the extent that less rice would be imported.
32.       In evaluating project benefits, rice and barley prices were
based on the Bank's world market price projections for 1980, while other
crops, which are not traded internationally, were based on the 1965-70
average farm gate price. At full development in 1982, the net value of
production in the project area would be the equivalent of $20.3 million,
compared to less than $4 million without the project. The incremental
benefits and project costs discounted over the 50-year life of the project
would result in an economic rate of return of 13%.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.       The following documents are being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors: The draft Development Credit Agreement between
the Republic of Korea and the Association; the draft Loan Agreement
between the Bank and the Agricultural Development Corporation; the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the Bank; the
report and recommendation of the committees provided for by Article V
Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and by
Article III Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank; and
the text of Resolutions approving the proposed development credit and the
proposed loan.
34.       The draft Development Credit and Loan Agreements contain
provisions common to agreement for projects of this kind. The draft
Guarantee Agreement conforms generally to the standard pattern of
guarantee agreements.
PART V - RECOMMNDATION
35.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.
