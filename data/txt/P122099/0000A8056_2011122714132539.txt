                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1- On May 5, 2011, individual grant agreements for the project were signed with four implementing agency NGOs, namely ACTED, IRC, Premiere Urgence and Solidarites
                         International. This concluded a year-long project preparation process during which extensive consultations were carried out with GoCAR who also endorsed the agreements. This
                         innovative project structure opens the door in CAR to further operations executed by non-government agencies in situations where GoCAR is not best positioned to implement them.
                         2- The project became effective two months later on July 6, 2011 following the meeting of all effectiveness conditions, including preparation of the Project Implementation Manual, by

                         implementing NGOs.
                         3- Implementing NGOs have been trained in the Bank's financial management and procurement policies; full procurement plans have been submitted to the Bank.
                         4- All safeguard documentation, including ESMF, PMP and RPF, has been finalized following workshop held with relevant line ministries to present findings and outputs of the
                         safeguard exercises. This documentation has been submitted to GoCAR for formal adoption and publication.

                         5- Project teams have been hired and are operational within all four implementing NGOs; hiring of additional support staff is underway.
                         6- In line with project needs and the retroactive financing clause in the grant agreements, implementing agencies have spent approximately $0.6 million on project expenditures to
                         date. Withdrawal applications for reimbursement will be submitted as soon as processing of Client Connection applications has been completed.
                         7- The project team is collaborating with the implementing partners to revise the project implementation calendar to account for agricultural cycle and other exogenous constraints;
                         the results framework will be modified to reflect this in turn.
                         8- Security risks in some of the project's target areas have increased due to growing tensions in the North and Center of the country. This has not yet had an impact on the project
                         implementation but the project is adopting a work plan that will target only eligible communities in which implementing agencies can operate in line with their safety standards.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1- The project is being executed by four non-governmental agencies in the northern rebel-controlled areas of the country where government capacity is limited.
                         2- Implementing partners are revising the project implementation calendar in line with agricultural cycle and other constraints and envisage the start of beneficiary activities in January
                         2012.

                         3- The project is assessing security risks on an ongoing basis and implementing agencies will target only communities in which they can operate in line with their safety standards.
