                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1- On May 5, 2011, individual grant agreements for the project were signed with four implementing agency NGOs, namely ACTED, IRC, Premiere Urgence and Solidarites
                         International. This concluded a year-long project preparation process during which extensive consultations were carried out with GoCAR who also endorsed the agreements. This
                         innovative project structure opens the door in CAR to further operations executed by non-government agencies in situations where GoCAR is not best positioned to implement them.
                         2- The project became effective two months later on July 6, 2011 following the meeting of all effectiveness conditions, including preparation of the Project Implementation Manual, by

                         implementing NGOs.
                         3- Implementing NGOs have been trained in the Bank's financial management and procurement policies; full procurement plans have been submitted to the Bank.
                         4- All safeguard documentation, including ESMF, PMP and RPF, has been finalized before being adopted and publicly disclosed by GoCAR on December 23, 2011.
                         5- Project teams operational within all four implementing NGOs; technical personnel for infrastructure rehabilitations are currently being hired.

                         6- Operational activities on the ground, including rehabilitation procurement and direct beneficiary activities began in the first quarter of 2012.
                         7- Project disbursements have reached $3.1m (36%) to date. Further withdrawal applications are being submitted this month.
                         8- The project team is collaborating with the implementing partners to revise the project implementation calendar to account for agricultural cycle and other exogenous constraints.
                         9- Security risks in some of the project's target areas (North and Center of the country) continue to be closely monitored. These have not yet had a noteworthy impact on the project
                         implementation but the project is adopting a work plan that will target only eligible communities in which implementing agencies can operate in line with their safety standards.
                         10- The project was restructured in April 2012, including the extension of the closing date to June 2013 and the revision of the results framework.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1- Implementing partners are revising the project implementation calendar in line with agricultural/seasonal calendar and other constraints.
                         2- The project is assessing security risks on an ongoing basis and implementing agencies will target only communities in which they can operate in line with their safety standards.
                         3- The project has been restructured and extended through to June 2013; the results framework has been revised in turn.
