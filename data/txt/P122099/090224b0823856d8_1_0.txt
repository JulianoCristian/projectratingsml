                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The situation in CAR continues to be extremely volatile with pervasive security issues.
                         The OP07.30 was lifted in November 2013 after an evaluation mission took place in mid-September 2013. However, a hold was put on the sbursements of the CRP in December due
                         to the location of its activities.
                         Each Implementation Partner is preparing and planning to re-start activities as soon as the security situation permits it.
