                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1- According to the ongoing activities, and confirmed by the Mid-Term Review undertaken in September. It is expected to have the project completed by the end of June 2013 as
                         planned.
                         2- Recent security issues raised in the Kabo area of the project and forced Solidarités International to stop their activities for the time being. They are developing a strategy to re-start
                         their activities in early January if security permits.
