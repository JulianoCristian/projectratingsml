                         period the 4 Implementing Partners continued to do their activities especially on rehabilitation of socio-economic infrastructures.
                         2- From mid-February to March 24th the Bangui office was open, however no missions were allowed.

                         suspended all disbursements for Projects in CAR. Therefore the activities of the 4 Implementing Partners (IPs) have been put on hold.
                         4- The Task Team continued to closely monitor the situation on the ground with the 4 IPs however a supervision mission will only be able to take place after that the OP7.30
                         assessment mission has taken place.
