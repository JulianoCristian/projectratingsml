                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY
1. The proposed changes to the CAR Community Reintegration Project (CRP) include
   (i) the extension of closing date of the project from April 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013,
   and (ii) a revision of the results framework due to the modified timeline for activities
   and to ensure common Monitoring and Evaluation approaches across multiple
   recipients.

2. These changes are required because of delays in implementation which are primarily
   due to the slow approval process of safeguards documentation by Government in the
   early stages of the project, as well as instability in some of the target areas.

3. The restructuring will allow the project to successfully achieve its objectives by the
   proposed closing date.

B. PROJECT STATUS
4. With early hurdles to operational effectiveness now overcome, activities under
   Components 1, 2, 3 and 4 have progressed well and it is assumed that the outcomes as
   originally envisioned can be achieved. Over the past two months, the project has
   disbursed US$2.4 million (28%) and the anticipated disbursements until the end of
   FY12 are a further US$1.2 million.

5. However, given the seasonal calendar and instability in some target areas, activities
   have been delayed at different times during project implementation. The first delay
   occurred in late 2011 following project effectiveness in July 2011, when the approval
   of safeguards documentation (ESMF, RPF, PMP) was delayed by the Government.
   With the majority of the project’s activities focusing on agricultural activities and
   rural infrastructure, the project calendar is heavily dependent on access and seasonal
   cycles. As a result of these delays, implementation agencies missed an entire seasonal
   cycle. This is particularly the case for IRC and Première Urgence. In addition, some
   of the partner agencies have faced implementation constraints on their activities due
   to security concerns in target areas. This is the case for Solidarités International.

6. Most of the results, as originally envisioned, are still achievable within the current
   project design, although an extension is necessary to reach all intended outcomes.
   Some minor modifications to intermediate objectives are required where seasonal
   calendar and insecurity require them. Given current financial resources available in
   the project, a no-cost extension is requested until June 30, 2013.

7. There are no outstanding audit reports and this will be the first extension of the
   project.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES
The proposed changes to the CRP include the following:

8. Closing date. The closing date for CAR Community Reintegration Project, P122099
   [TF098355, TF098356, TF098357, TF098358] will be extended from April 30, 2012
   until June 30, 2013.

9. Results framework indicators. The results framework has been revised to
   harmonize indicators used across the project by different recipients. As such, whilst
   some minor changes have been made to proposed activities due to
   seasonal/agricultural cycles and security constraints, changes in the results framework
   are largely attributable to homogenization of Monitoring & Evaluation approaches
   amongst recipients. This will ensure that recipients are measuring and reporting on
   the same core Bank indicators that are common to their activities.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
10. There are no expected changes in the impact of the project as a result of the
    restructuring.
