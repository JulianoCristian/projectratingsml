The report notes\n            the complexity of implementing a far reaching restructuring\n            of the railways, particularly when staff retrenchment and\n            reduction in passenger services is required; it requires a\n            significant amount political capital and can be greatly\n            affected by political instability. Other significant lessons\n            cited include: the need to maintain consistent focus and\n            pressure on the reform in order to assist the Government\n            with weathering political pressures and prevent backsliding;\n            the need to involve the labor unions early and obtain their\n            views on the retrenchment process; and the need to prepare\n            public opinion gradually for the curtailment of the most\n            expensive services. Although there was a genuine commitment\n            to the project by both the Borrower and the Implementation\n            Agency there were also differences in opinions with the Bank\n            about how to interpret project development objectives, which\n            affected the implementation. The following lessons should be\n            addressed in future projects: It is important for the Bank\n            to get a clear agreement from the Government on the kind of\n            railways the country wants to have and can afford; the\n            incumbent railways cannot reasonably be expected to drive\n            the process without strong Government leadership. When\n            higher Government functionaries are made members of the\n            Supervisory Board of the railways, their position should be\n            treated \"ex officio\"; otherwise, the presence of\n            these representatives can seriously diminish the capacities\n            of the Ministries to provide oversight and to provide\n            critical comment."}, "docdt": "2005-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
