satisfactory.\n            Sustainability of the investments in school construction,\n            educational materials, and computerization of the\n            educational system is dependent on adequate funding from the\n            Education Secretariat for maintenance and replacement, and\n            teacher and staff training for the effective use of new\n            materials. World Bank preparation and appraisal, though\n            lengthy, were satisfactory, with the exception of inadequate\n            attention to procurement-related issues. The advent of a new\n            State administration in 1995 was chiefly responsible for\n            raising the level of commitment and led to eventual\n            satisfactory performance. General lessons learned focus on\n            procurement, flexible project design, strong monitoring and\n            evaluation, strong client ownership, minimizing project\n            complexity, and assessing local political cycles. There are\n            also lessons to be learned from several innovative\n            activities undertaken by the State of Sao Paulo, which were\n            supported under this project. This report offers them in\n            case studies of innovations in the following areas:\n            accelerated classes, teacher training, student assessment,\n            school reorganization, information technology, and the\n            school lunch program."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
