SCHEDULE 2
Description of the Project
Page  14
The objective of the Project is to improve primary school learning and retention 
among children of poor and migrant families in Greater Sao Paulo in a manner that 
could eventually be adapted to the States.
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications 
thereof as the Bank and the Borrower may agree upon from time to time to achieve such 
objectives:
Part A:
In-School Quality Improvement
 
This Part of the Project aims at improving the learning and performance of first 
and second grade students by enabling the SEE to implement the Basic Cycle and the 
Extended School Day in all
Borrower Schools in Greater Sao Paulo, by means of the activitieslisted below:
 
(1)
Construction of about 350 new Borrower Schools (about 3,000 new classrooms), 
refurbishing and expansion of about 340 existing Borrower Schools (about 1,150 new 
classrooms) and acquisition and utilization of equipment, furniture, and services of 
consultants specialized in supervision of construction and in low-cost construction 
techniques, all for the said Borrower Schools (at least 10 of such Schools to be 
designed and constructed using low-cost construction techniques and/or materials). The 
work program, as a whole, is targeted to poor school districts in the Greater Sao 
Paulo to benefit primarily poor households.
(2)
Training for Basic Cycle teachers, art and physical education teachers, Basic 
Cycle coordinators, and Borrower School directors, all in Greater Sao Paulo; the 
training program will utilize both distance training through video segments shown in 
local television posts and discussion groups (DT) and face-to-face classwork through 
attendance in meetings chaired by instructors (F to F), and will be divided into two 
phases, as follows:
(a)
DT under the first phase of the above training program will emphasize 
broad principles of the Basic Cycle approach, including continuous student evaluation 
and individualized student pacing, single student and small group activities and class 
flexibility in a classroom enriched with books and other pedagogical materials. F to 
F, under the first phase of such program, will reinforce principal aspects of the 
Basic Cycle in five areas: (i) Basic Cycle pedagogy, for Borrower School district 
supervisors and monitors; (ii) literacy, for Basic Cycle teachers and coordinators; 
(iii) physical education, for teachers thereof; (iv) art education, for teachers 
thereof; and (v) organization of the pedagogical work of the school, for Borrower 
School directors and assistant directors. At the end of the first phase each Borrower 
School will develop a Basic Cycle action plan for the School in question.
(b)
The second phase of the training program under this Part A (2) of the 
Project will be targeted to districts with the largest number of Borrower Schools 
encountering difficulties in implementing Basic Cycle pedagogy as well as to directors 
of Borrower Schools in poor neighborhoods.
(3)
Acquisition of educational materials for, and utilization thereof by, Basic 
Cycle students, including:
(a)
a set of books (about 120 titles) for each Basic Cycle classroom in 
Greater Sao Paulo which will be available during periods of self-directed classroom 
activity as well as for reading
lessons;
(b)
art equipment and materials and educational toys; and
 
(c)
acquisition of additional books and other elements as per (b) above to 
maintain the classroom supply during six years.
(4)
Improving the Borrower Schools students' nutrition by:
 
(a)
changing the current Borrower School menu so as to include more natural 
(rather than processed) foods;
Page  15
(b)
acquiring and utilizing additional kitchen equipment (such as stoves and 
refrigerators, as well as cooking utensils) for purposes of (a) above;
(c)
training Borrower School feeding personnel for purposes of (a) above;
 
(d)
introducing within DSE a management information and cost monitoring 
system; and
(e)
completing a DSE commissioned policy review on improving the efficiency 
of the Borrower School feeding program, including an examination of ways to direct a 
larger proportion of feeding resources to the poorest students.
Part B:
Pre-School Education
 
This Part of the Project aims at increasing pre-school enrollments of poor 
children between the ages of four and six in Greater Sao Paulo by about 120,000, from 
the about 70,000 currently
enrolled, to improve pedagogical quality at the pre-school level and to increase 
children's readiness for learning at the primary school level by means of the 
following activities:
(1)
Execution of Approved Municipal Plans for extending the provision of pre-school 
services to poor children in each Municipality through the carrying out of 
Subprojects.
(2)
Training of about 4,000 pre-school teachers actively providing pre-school 
services to poor children in facilities included in Part B (1) of the Project and 
operated by a Municipality or a PNPO, through the use of services of educational 
consultants for face-to-face classwork activities as well as video segments shown in 
local television posts and discussion groups. The training under this Part B (2) of 
the Project will:
(a)
emphasize modern pedagogical theory and practices, with emphasis on 
"hands-on" learning in an enriched classroom environment, small group interaction, 
strengthening problem solving skills, and developing children's readiness for reading, 
writing and numeracy; and
(b)
prepare teachers for the utilization of educational television programs 
to reinforce classroom learning.
(3)
Utilization by the Borrower of short-term consultants' services for the benefit 
of:
(a)
a Municipality, to assist it in the preparation of the corresponding 
Municipal Plan; and
(b)
a PNPO, to assist and train PNOP's personnel in accounting and other 
school administrative procedures.
Part C:
School Health
 
A school health program to improve the health of about one million children in 
grades one and two of schools and in pre-schools operated by the Borrower or a 
Municipality, or, starting in about 2 years from the Effective Date, a PNPO. The 
program will include the following activities:
(1)
Integration of health and nutrition themes into the regular curricula of pre- 
and primary schools.
(2)
Physical examination upon entrance into pre- and primary schools, administered 
by the Corresponding UBS.

SCHEDULE 4
Procurement and Consultants' Services
Section I.
Procurement of Goods and Works
 
Part A:
International Competitive Bidding
 
Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall be procured under 
contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth in 
Sections I and II of the
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in 
May 1985 (the Guidelines). Consequently, the Borrower shall ensure that, to the extent 
possible, goods and
works are grouped so as to form bidding packages estimated to cost the equivalent of 
$300,000 and $5,000,000, respectively, or more. 
Part B:
Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
 
In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures described in Part 
A hereof, goods manufactured in Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in 
accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the 
Page  19
Guidelines and paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix 2 thereto, provided, however, that:
1.
All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall clearly indicate any 
preference which would be granted, the information required to establish the 
eligibility of a bid for such
preference and the following methods and stages that will be followed in the 
comparison of bids.
2.
After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the following two 
groups:
(a)
Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Brazil if the bidder shall 
have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that such goods 
contain components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the 
complete goods.
(b)
Group B: bids offering any other goods.
 
3.
In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each group, all evaluated bids 
in each group shall first be compared among themselves, without taking into account 
customs duties and other import taxes levied in connection with the importation, or 
the sales and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery of the 
goods pursuant to the bids. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be compared with 
each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from group A is the lowest, 
it shall be selected for the award.
4.
If, as result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above, the lowest evaluated 
bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be further compared with the lowest 
evaluated bid from group A after adding:
(a)
to the evaluated bid price of goods to be imported in each group B bid an 
amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the amount of customs duties and other import 
taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the importation of the goods 
offered in such group B bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods; and
(b)
to the ex-factory bid price of goods supplied domestically offered in 
each group B bid an amount equal to the smaller of: (i) the amount of customs duties 
and other import taxes which would be levied on the goods offered in such group B if 
they originated from the same foreign country as the bid included in group B which 
enjoys the lowest customs duties and other import taxes; or (ii) 15% of the ex-factory 
bid price of such goods. If, as result of this comparison, the bid from group A is the 
lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if not, the lowest evaluated bid from 
group B, as determined under paragraph 3 above, shall be selected for the award.
Part C:
Other Procurement Procedures
 
1.
Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 below, civil works under Part A 
(1) of the Project and under Municipal Sub-projects or goods under Parts A (3), A (4) 
and C of the Project and
under Muncipal Subprojects, which cannot be grouped pursuant to the provisions of Part 
A of this Schedule, shall be grouped to the extent possible so as to enable the 
tendering of bidding packages
for civil works and goods estimated to cost more than the equivalent of $50,000 and 
$25,000, respectively. Bidding packages formed pursuant to the preceding provisions, 
and contracts for civil works and goods which cannot be so grouped but are estimated 
to cost less than the equivalent of $5,000,000 and $300,000, respectively, may be 
tendered for award on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally, in 
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
2.
Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 below, civil works or goods, for the 
Parts of the Project referred to in paragraph 1 above or for Municipal Subprojects, 
which:
(a)
cannot be grouped in bidding packages pursuant to the provisions of Parts 
A or C.1 of this Schedule; and
(b)
are estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less, in the case of 
Page  20
civil works, or the equivalent of $25,000 or less, in the case of goods, may be 
procured under contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of price quotations 
solicited from at least three contractors or suppliers, as the case may be, eligible 
under the Guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
3.
Copyrighted educational materials, including books, for the Project may be 
contracted directly with the owner or licensee thereof.
Part D:
Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
 
1.
Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts:
 
(a)
With respect to each contract for civil works or goods, or bidding 
packages of contracts for civil works or goods proposed to be awarded under Part A of 
this Schedule or each contract to be awarded under Part C.1 of this Schedule, 
estimated to cost more than the equivalent of $50,000, in the case of civil works, or 
more than the equivalent of $25,000, in the case of goods, the procedures set forth in 
paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply, provided, however, 
that in the case of awards made pursuant to the provisions of Part C.1 of this 
Schedule, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cease to apply such procedures 
after the Bank has found nonobjectionable three of such awards. Where payments for the 
contract in question are to be made out of the Special Account, and such procedures 
are applicable, the procedures shall be modified to ensure that the two conformed 
copies of the contract required to be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 
2 (d) shall be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first payment out of 
the Special Account in respect of such contract.
(b)
With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding paragraph, or 
in respect of which the notice referred to in such paragraph has been sent, the 
procedures set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall 
apply. Where payments for such contract are to be made out of the Special Account, 
such procedures shall be modified to ensure that the two
conformed copies of the contract together with the other information required to be 
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be furnished to the Bank as 
part of the evidence to be
furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement.
(c)
The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall not apply to 
contracts on account of which the Bank has authorized withdrawals from the Loan 
Account on the basis of statements of expenditure. Such contracts shall be retained in 
accordance with Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this Agreement.
Part E:
Other
 
For purposes of this Schedule and the Guidelines the term "custom duties and 
other import taxes" includes the FSRMM.
Section II.
Employment of Consultants
 
In order to assist the Borrower in the carrying out of Parts A (1), A (2), A (4) 
(c), A (4) (d), A (4) (e), B (2), B (3), C, D and E of the Project, and the Project 
Unit in the carrying out of such Unit's activities under the Project, the Borrower 
shall employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of 
employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in 
accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the 
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank 
as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981.
SCHEDULE 5
Special Accounts: CESA and FESA
1.
For the purposes of this Schedule:
 
(a)
the term "Eligible Categories" means Categories (1) to (11) set forth in 
the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
Page  21
(b)
the term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan
allocated from time to time to the corresponding Eligible Category in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 2.02 of, and Schedule 1 to, this Agreement; and
(c)
the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to 
$20,250,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited into CESA and FESA 
($20,000,000 equivalent into CESA and $250,000 equivalent into FESA) pursuant to 
paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.
Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of CESA and FESA, as the 
case may be, shall be made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 2.02 of this Agreement and of this Schedule. The Central 
Bank, or the Account Bank, as the case may be, shall authorize withdrawals from CESA 
or FESA, as the case may be, on the basis of evidence that the Bank shall have 
reasonably determined. For each such withdrawal so authorized, the Central Bank, or 
the Account Bank, as the case may be, shall debit or cause to be debited,  CESA or 
FESA, as appropriate, with the dollar equivalent of the amount of the Eligible 
Expenditures in question in cruzeiros, in the case of CESA, or the actual dollar 
amount, or the dollar equivalent of the
Eligible Expenditures in currencies other than dollars or cruzeiros, in the case of 
FESA.
3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that CESA and FESA have 
been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals 
from the Loan Account to replenish CESA or FESA shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the corresponding amount of the Authorized Allocation, 
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits 
which do not exceed the corresponding amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into CESA or FESA, as the case may be, such amount 
or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of CESA or FESA, the Borrower shall furnish to 
the Bank 
requests for deposits into CESA or FESA at such 
intervals as the Bank shall 
specify.
 
(ii)
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to 
the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant 
to paragraph 4 of 
this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into CESA or FESA, as the 
case may be, such amount as the 
Borrower shall have requested and as shall 
have been shown by 
said documents and other evidence to have been made out of 
CESA or FESA, 
as the case may be, for Eligible Expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the 
respective Eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall 
have been justified by said
documents and other evidence.
4.
For each payment made by the Borrower out of CESA or FESA, as the case may be, 
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the 
Bank such documents and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively 
for Eligible Expenditures.
5.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into either CESA or FESA:
(a)
if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
Page  22
(b)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the aggregate 
of Eligible Categories, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered 
into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to 
the Project, shall be equal to the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized 
Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawals from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 
amount of the Loan allocated to the corresponding Eligible Categories shall follow 
such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further 
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been 
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in CESA or FESA, as the case may 
be, as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for Eligible 
Expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
either CESA or FESA: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional 
evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into CESA or FESA, as the case may 
be, (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the 
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the 
Bank shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into CESA or FESA, as the 
case may be, shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such  
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in either CESA or FESA will not be required to cover further payments for the 
corresponding Eligible Expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding amount.
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in CESA or FESA.
(d)
Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawals or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
