objective of the project is to\n            improve primary school learning and retention among children\n            of poor and migrant families in Greater Sao Paulo in a\n            manner that could eventually be adapted to other states.\n            The project will support:  (i) a new curricular approach and\n            extended school day for the first two years of primary\n            school through in-service teacher training, provision of new\n            educational materials, more efficient school feeding\n            programs, and school construction to allow primary schools\n            in poor neighborhoods to operate two daytime five-hour\n            shifts; (ii) expansion of low cost pre-primary education\n            provided by private non-profit organizations and\n            municipalities in poor neighborhoods; (iii) reform of the\n            school health program to emphasize cost-effective screening,\n            referral, and health education; (iv) the strengthening of\n            state and municipal education authorities; and (v)\n            evaluation studies and dissemination activities."}, "docdt": "1991-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
