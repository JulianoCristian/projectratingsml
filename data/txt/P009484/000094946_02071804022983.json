Overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower is\n            evaluated as satisfactory. Lessons learned are the\n            following: 1) Sustainability of research projects with a\n            heavy emphasis on institutional development will not come\n            about simply by securing continuous donor funding.\n            Sustainability can only be achieved by research\n            organizations developing management skills and processes to\n            allow work on priority research to continue even in the face\n            of reduced budgets envelopes, through strict financial\n            management and by ensuring appropriate staffing levels are\n            maintained. 2) The effectiveness of technical assistance and\n            training would be increased if programs are well coordinated\n            and linked technically to ensure they complement each other,\n            and implemented early in the project to allow benefits\n            coming from these activities to be felt during\n            implementation and to allow new processes to be\n            institutionalized before the project ends. In some cases,\n            this might mean outsourcing management of these programs. 3)\n            Procurement management capacity must be assessed\n            realistically at appraisal. 4) Project implementation units\n            are neither necessary or desirable, as they tend to isolate\n            project activities from the mainstream operations of\n            implementing agencies, possibly depriving it of high-level\n            support needed for effective implementation and longer term sustainability."}, "docdt": "2002-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
