      Research Management Project is to increase the efficiency of\n            the national agricultural research system and thereby to\n            generate profitable, relevant, and sustainable agricultural\n            technologies for Bangladeshi agricultural producers. The\n            components of the project are as follows: 1) research\n            management and organization, which will strengthen\n            managerial capabilities of Bangladesh Agricultural Research\n            Council (BARC) through carrying out of institutional\n            reforms, improved economic analysis of research programs,\n            technical assistance, construction and rehabilitation of\n            civil works, training, contract research, and supervision of\n            new master plans for participating Agricultural Research\n            Institutes (ARIs); 2) priority research, which will be\n            carried out in the ARIs on crops, fisheries, livestock and\n            forestry; and 3) participating farming systems research,\n            which will strengthen farming systems research programs\n            through support to research-extension linkages and testing\n            and dissemination of appropriate technology."}, "docdt": "1996-01-16T00:00:00Z"}
