project design allows flexibility to introduce changes\n            based on implementation experience and increasing farmer\n            participation.  The project will reclaim about 45,000 ha\n            over a seven year period in ten districts.  Out of this,\n            about 39,000 ha will be devoted to production systems based\n            on rice and wheat cropping, and 3,000 ha devoted to salt\n            tolerant horticultural crops.  A further 3,000 ha will be\n            reclaimed on community land and devoted to tree cultivation\n            for fuel and fodder. The key components of the project\n            include:  (i) land reclamation through provision of\n            effective drainage networks; on-farm development;\n            application of chemical amendments; irrigation development;\n            and support for the establishment of food and tree crops on\n            privately owned land, and forest tree species on community\n            land; (ii) institutional development comprising\n            strengthening of (a) The Uttar Pradesh Land Development\n            Corporation (LDC), the main implementing agency; (b) the\n            Remote Sensing Application Center responsible for site\n            identification and selection in the planning process and for\n            monitoring and reclamation induced evaluation of changes to\n            soil and ground water environments; and (c) participating\n            nongovernmental organizations through training to assist\n            beneficiary participation; (iii) agricultural development\n            and technology dissemination consisting of demonstrations of\n            reclamation models for the production of crops, fruit trees\n            and forestry species on sodic lands; nursery development for\n            fruit tree seedlings production; and extension support\n            involving motivational campaigns, production of publicity\n            material, use of mass communication techniques; and (iv)\n            reclamation technology development and special studies\n            comprising adaptive research to improve existing reclamation\n            technology, diversification of cropping systems, and\n            development of methods for preventing further expansion of sodicity."}, "docdt": "1993-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
