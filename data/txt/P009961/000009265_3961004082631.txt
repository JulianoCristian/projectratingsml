MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA FOR
THE UTTAR PRADESH SODIC LANDS RECLAMATION PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on the proposed
Development Credit of SDR 39.5 million (US$54.7 million equivalent) to India
is submitted for approval. The IDA Credit would be on standard terms, with 35
years maturity, to help finance the Uttar Pradesh Sodic Lands Reclamation
Project.
2.          Zackgroiad.  Uttar Pradesh (UP) is one of the largest states in
India as it has a population of about 139 million (17% of the national total),
of whom 80% live in rural areas. The State occupies 0.3 million km2, which is
9.2% of the total country area. The cultivated areas in the state total about
28 million hectares (ha), which are spread over ten agro-ecological zones.
The State's economy is dominated by agriculture which generates about 42% of
the State's income, employing about 78% of the total work force. About two-
thirds of all farm holdings are less than 1.0 ha, with a larqe proportion of
owners and dependent laborers living below the poverty line. Agricultural
production in the State has been dominated by traditional food crops,
particularly wheat, rice, and legumes. Through the mid-60s, major
contributors to growth were expansion in cultivated areas, and increased
productivity in irrigated areas. However, in the late 1960s through the
1970s, the agricultural scene changed significantly with increases in
production of most crops coming from rising yields. This, especially for rice
and wheat, was largely due to the introduction of high yielding varieties and
accelerated development of private tubewells. The areas under other cereal
crops, such as maize and barley, declined due to decreasing profitability.
Lucrative cash crops, mainly sugarcane and oilseeds, performed well during
this period, growing at 4% to 5% per annum (p.a.). Potato production
maintained its earlier momentum, growing at 9.5% p.a. In recent years,
however, the rate of growth of agriculture has declined while the population
has continued to increase at about 2.3% p.a.
3.            In UP, as is the case in many other States in India, a
significant proportion of potentially productive land is either non-productive
or producing below its potential, owing to physical constraints such as soil
erosion, overgrazing, accumulation of toxic salts and waterlogging. In India
the salt-affected lands (commonly termed 'usar' land) cover about 8 million ha
(about 5% of total cultivated area) and pose an increasing problem, especially
in irrigated areas. In UP there are about 1.25 m ha of barren and a further
estimated 1.25 m ha of low-yielding single or double cropped salt-affected
lands, covering about 10% of the net cultivated area. This problem is
especially severe in 22 districts in the southern half of the State. The IBRD
Map No. 24701 shows the distribution of such lands in the State.
4.          Over the years, GOUP/GOI have initiated several schemes to assist
the rural poor. These have included allotment of cultivable salt-affected
land to landless laborers and public works programs. However, due to poverty
and social constraints, the allottees have been unable to bring these lands
back to full production. Consequently, over the years many Central and State
government sponsored reclamation schemes were launched which by the end of
1989 had resulted in the rehabilitation of about 157,000 ha in UP.
A survey of previous schemes shows that, in general, the reclamation work
resulted in expansion of cultivated area, increased use of fertilizers,



2
improved seeds and improved productivity. In addition to the public sector
agencies, a grassroots .NGO (Sarvodya Ashram) with funding from an intermediary
NGO, the Society for Promotion of Wasteland Development (SPWD), has assisted
in the reclamation of about 1,000 ha in blocks of about 20 ha each. This
program has successfully motivated and trained farmers to enlarge reclaimed
areas through group efforts. Sodic lands have also been successfully
reclaimed in Haryana and Punjab. In contrast to UP, however, most of the
areas in these two states belonged to relatively large farmers, with good
resource bases for whom reclamation was a way of expanding their farm size.
Therefore, the challenge in UP is to develop models which would enable
resource-poor small and marginal farmers to develop these lands in a cost
effective manner.
5.          Bank Su rtedW Projects.  The Benk has been supporting agriculture
in India since the early 1950s. To date, 130 agricultural projects have
received US$10.2 billion equiva'ent IBRD/IDA financing (81% IDA and 19% Bank),
with irrigation projects dominating the portfolio. Other projects have been
for: agricultural support s rvices (credit, research and extension);
commercial agriculture (seeds, fisheries and agro-industry); forestry,
watershed and resource conservation; livestock development; and drought
assistance. In UP, 14 Bank assisted projects have been completed and 11 are
ongoing. Seven of these projects were exclusively for UP and the rest
involved other Indian states. The basic thrust of Bank involvement in Indian
agriculture has been to: (a) increase the area i;:rigated and improve water use
efficiency; (b) improve lending capability of institutions; (c) increase
production of high value products, such as seeds, fish and silk; (d) improve
storage, processing and other agricultural marketing facilities; (e)
strengthen the research and extension services; and (f) improve the management
systems affecting rainfed agriculture. The Bank has not undertaken any direct
investment in land reclamation activities in India in the past.
6.                 ntation Perf6smane and  asons Learnt.  Many agricultural
projects in India have suffered from implementation problems, resulting in
delays in disbursements and completion. Implementation performance of
projects in UP has been mixed. Common problems are: delays in project
mobilization and procurement; poor quality irrigation and civil works;
institutional weaknesses; insufficient local funding; poor preparation and
inadequate attantion to social issues. The main lessons to be learned from
the Bank and government experiences in UP are that: (a) the institutional
arrangements and planning process must be clearly established to ensure
effective coordination and timely implementation; (b) the availability of
funding should be reviewed at regular intervals to ensure that adequate
funding is provided in a timely fashion; (c) monitoring and evaluation should
be given a higher priority with flexibility in project design to enable
introduction of corrective actions as required; (d) the project design should
pay adequate attention to social issues and beneficiary participation, if
appropriate with NGO support; (e) technology packages being provided should be
regularly updated with appropriately researched extension support; and (f)
private sector participation should be encouraged wherever feasible. These
lessons are central to the design of the proposed project.
7.          Country AsisRtan6. Strategy and Rationale for IDA inmvo1vint.
One of the main emphases of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy is to
support Government's development policies that impact on poverty, which



3
remains India's most serious problem. The focus is on efficient public and
private resource allocation through adjustment reform measures and capacity-
building. The basic strategy for a.gricultural grow*hc which under India's
constiturior. is a State matter, is to strengthen agricultural, irrigation ana
forestry programs at the state level. The main vehicles for the Bank group's
intervention include: (a) reform of Centra' and State government policies that
restrict incentives and distort trade; (b) increase the efficiency of public
investment and promote greater private patticipation which has stagnated due
to the complimentarities between public and private investment and poor
performance of the rural credit system; (c) strengthen the programs wh4ch
generate and disseminate appropriate technologies; and (d) improve the
management of land and water resources through forestry programs and enhanced
performance of the irrigation infrastructure with emphasis on participatory
management. The proposed project fits well within this framework. Systematic
reclamation of sodic lands through sound land and water management planning is
increasingly important in UP due to deterioration of the environment and
natural resources resulting from growing population pressures. IDA's
involvement would help ensure that lessons drawn from previous projects and
NGO pilot efforts are appropriately integrated into the sector's future
development, and that experiences from other countries are brought to UP's
participatory land reclamation efforts. In particular, IDA's continued
participation would lead to the introduction of improved management systems
for identification, planning and monitoring of reclamation work. It would
enable development and dissemination of sustainable production technologies,
and allow strengthening of institutions involved in the reclamation work.
8.          Projent Objectives.   The objectives of the project are to:
(a) develop concomitant moiels for environmental protection and improved
agricultural production through large scale reclamation of sodic lands;
(b) strengthen local institutions to enable effective management of such
programs with strong beneficiary participation and NGO support; and
(c) contribute towards poverty alleviation of families managing sodic lands.
9.          Project lescription.   The proposed project is part of a long-term
program to improve agricultural productivity in areas with a high
concentration of sodic lands. The project would build on successful past
experience and establish models which could be replicated on a much larger
scale. These would emphasize beneficiary participation in the management of
key activities. The project design also allows flexibility to introduce
changes based on the independent monitoring of implementation experience.  The
project would be limited to the reclamation of about 45,000 ha over a seven
year period in ten districts (IBRD Map No. 24700). Out of this about 39,000
ha would be devoted to production systems based on rice and wheat cropping and
3000 ha to salt tolerant horticultural crops. A further 3000 ha would be on
community land, devoted to tree cultivation for fuel and fodder. The key
components of the project would include:
i)    Land Reclamation (US$60 M; 81% of base costs) through provision of
(a) effective drainage netcworks; (b) levelling and bunding
of land to retain available rainfall and irrigation water to
promote leaching of salts and crop growth; (c) application of
gypsum or pyrite for alkalinity reduction in the surface 15 cm.;
(d) irrigation development; and (e) the use of a rice/wheat/green
manure (Sesbania) cropping system and establishment of salt



4
tolerant fruit and tree crops, singly or in combination. The
investment element covers land development activities such as
establishment of drainage networks, amelioration *f soil's
chemical properties and drilling of boreholes.  The support being
provided as a grant focuses on ensuring successful implementation
of different steps in the reclamation process and stabilization of
crop yields through progressive improvement in growing conditions.
These include an assured water supply through a 50% contribution
towards the purchase of pumpsets and provision of farmyard manure
and seeds. For agricultural crops, production support
(fertilizers) would be provided for the first four seasons. For
horticultural activities, support would cover tree establishment
and maintenance until first fruiting. Farmers would contribute
towards the cost of pumpsets and pay full operation and
maintenance costs. They would also contribute their labor
to on-farm development work. Due to the pilot nature of the
forestry model on community land, which would directly benefit
women's groups, these activities would be initially undertaken on
a grant basis with groups contributing labor. Later attempts
would be made to introduce informal savings schemes to enable the
groups to finance input costs.
wii IntAaztntional DeAxwena1it (US$6.9 M; 9% of base costs) comprising
strengthening of (a) the managerial and administrative capacity of
UPLDC, the main implementing agency; (b) Remote Sensing
Application Center (RSAC) that is responsible for site
identification and selection, planning and monitoring ef
environmental improvements due to reclamation; (c) participation
of NGOs, training of field staff, grassroots NGos and farmers; and
formation of farmer groups to encourage beneficiary participation.
An NGO would also assist in improving women's farming operations
and strengthening their role in local decision making bodies;
iii)        ltural Da1ol  nt- and Tgehnnay    seminatinn (US$4.0 M;
5% of base costs) consisting of demonstration of reclamation
models for the production of crops, fruit trees and forestry and
fodder species on sodic lands; nursery development for fruit tree
seedlings production; and extension support involving motivational
campaigns, production of publicity material, use of mass
communication techniques; and
iv)      laMat-orn Taehnn1=            t and Rp.aial Atudi^n (US$3.4 M;
5% of base costs) consisting of adaptive research to improve
existing technology, diversification of cropping systems and
development of systems for preventing further expansion of
sodicity. Two special studies to improve the effectiveness of
drainage systems and efficiency of shallow tubewells would also be
undertaken.
10.         Pr4ojgwt !mplmntatin.  The coordination of the project
implementation would be carried out by the UP Land Development Corporation
(LDC). In preparation for implementation of the proposed project, GOUP has
reorganized and strengthened LDC by recruiting experienced technical staff,
appointing a full time Managing Director and reorganizing Board membership to



5
include senior level representatives for the relevant GOUP departments, State
Agricultural University and NGOs. In addition, LDC has entered into
contractual arrangements with the Remote Sensing Application Center (RSAC);
Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow (IIM) and grassroots and intermediary
NGOs to assist in the planning, monitoring and evaluation of reclamation
program, and formation of farmer groups. The project cost is estimated at
US$80.2 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$14.4
million equivalent (18%) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$8.4
million equivalent. IDA would finance SDR 39.5 million (US$54.7 million
equivalent, 100% of the foreign exchange and 68% of the total). Retroactive
financing is provided up to an amount of SDR 3.6 million  (USS5 million
equivalent) for project expenditures incurred from September 1992 to
accelerate the project implementation, especially strengthening of LDC and
support to be provided by IIM, RSAC and NGOs in beneficiary group formation.
A breakdown of the project costs and the financing plan are in schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement
schedules are shown in Schedule B. Project completion date is SeptembKar 0,
2000 and the closing date is March 31, 2001. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps showing the distribution of salt-
affected lands in UP and the project areas are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 11715-IN of May 10, 1993 is being distributed separately.
II.         Agreed Attinn.  The main assurances obtained from GOUP during
negotiations are summarized as follows: (a) that NGOs would be selected in
accordance with criteria agreed with rDA and their support would be maintained
throughout the project period; (b) that: (i) the Agriculture Production
Commissioner would continue to be the Chairman of the Board of LDC for the
duration of the project; (ii) the staff requirements of LDC would be met in
accordance with the criteria agreed with IDA; (c) that GOUP/LDC would observe
the provisions of each of the Memorandum of Understandings between LDC-IDM and
LWC-RSAC for implementation and monitoring support under the project: (d) that
by December 31 each year starting in 1994 LDC would provide to IDA for review
and comments a copy of the approved Annual Action Plan for the following year;
(e) that: (i) the reclamation site identification, selection and planning
would be undertaken in accordance with the criteria agreed with IDA; and (ii)
from April 1, 1998, GOt? would provide the contributions for the maintenance
of the drainage system which would be accounted for in the annual budget of
the Irrigation Department: (f) technical assistance staff required for special
studies would be appointed no later than September 30, 1994 in accordance with
IDA guidelines; (g) by September 30, 1994 LDC would appoint an NGO or other
suitably qualified agency to undertake an independent assessment of
participatory management program under the project; (h) that by September 30,
1997, GOI and State Government, jointly with IDA would undertake a mid-term
review of project program and implement its recommendations.
12.         Evironmental Tmnae±.      The development of diversified cropping
systems to restore sodic lands to their full production potential would
address problems associated with the deteriorated environment of the salt-
affected lands. It would stabilize soil surfaces now subject to wind erosion
and reduce levels of airborne salt laden particulates during the dry season.
The establishment of systems for fuel wood production on community land would
provide the means of reducing degradation of public wooded areas used for the
collection of these commodities. Upgrading and/or establishment of drainage



6
networks would minimize continued degradation of land due to the accumulation
of salts over land within the catchment area of the drainage network.
Changes in the soil quality and land use patterns would be monitored through
remote sensing and ground surveys. Ground or surface water quality is not
expected to be adversely affected as the irrigation water would be impounded
in the fields (for leaching and crop growth) and any salt present in drainage
water would be diluted by the large volume of monsoon rainwater. Based on data
collected by the Groundwater Department over many years it is concluded that
the increased abstraction of water through the limited numbers of new shallow
tubewells proposed under the project would have no measurable affect on the
quantity of available groundwater reserves. Nonetheless, to develop a better
understanding, the groundwater and surface waters would be monitored
throughout implementation and beyond project completion with respect to
quality and dynamics of the systems. An environmental management and
monitoring plan has been developed by GOUP and agreed with IDA.
13.         InRtitut{onal TmpRot. The project would foster a major change in
the approach to land reclamation from a 'top down' activity to cooperation
with beneficiaries, involving them in a number of decisions. The State is
committed to thias approach, and accepts this as the ntost sustainable way of
maintaining reclaimed are.as in full production. An added institutional
feature is the close coordination of all participating agencies in the
reclamation work. The projent would also establish capacity for systematic
and comprehensive monitoring of environmental impacts, an activity not
undertaken in the State before.
14.         Tmact oni Women. Women contribute considerably to on-farm
activities and are also the main collectors of fodder and fuel wood from
community land or other sources. The proposed forestry model would enhance
availability of forest products which women collect to provide household
subsistence and secondary income. Proposed mobilization of women's groups
with the help of NGOs for training, thrift and credit, as well as other
related activities, would ensure that they benefit from project activities.
Participation would be further supported by training voluntary Mahila Mitra
Kisans (women 'contact' farmers) to help with the project, and an agreement
with GOUP/DOA that, wherever possible, women would be integrated with other
outgoing development programs.
15.         BanafitA.   The proposed project would have both non-monetary and
monetary benefits.   First, the continued degradation of the environment would
be arrested through reclamation of sodic areas and improvements in the soil
quality over the total catchment area served by the drainage network to be
established under the project. Second, new environmentally sustainable
technologies would be developed for the management of problem soils. Third,
the project would strengthen the participating institutions and develop
operational models for effective beneflciary participation while increasing
cooperation between many government departments, beneficiaries and NGOs.   The
lessons from this experience would have wide applicability in a number of
different operations in the country. Fourth, approximately 80,000 small and
marginal farm families would directly benefit from project activities.
Restoration of sodic lands to high productivity would create rural employment
opportunities and increase crop production, which would help to alleviate
poverty in the project area. For many participating farm families, this would
be a first time opportunity to own a small parcel of productive and
potentially valuable land.



7
16.          Rlsks.   There are three main risks to the project.  The first
risk relates to the effective coordination of various reclamation activities
which need to be planned and undertaken in a timely manner. To minimize this
risk, Annual Action Plans using the CPM system would be finalized at least 3
months prior to the beginning of each year's work program. In addition,
support from agencies with specialized expertise and clearly defined
responsibilities would ensure timely completion of agreed actions. A Project
Management Committee, specifically constituted to maximize inter-departmental
cooperation, would help to avoid delays by expediting actions taken by
participating GOUP departments. The second risk relates to the ability to
form and sustain farmer groups to participate in several activities, including
group credit for pumpsets. To ensure fo:mation of successful groups, NGOs
with proven experience in participatory management are working with LDC to
organize motivational campaigns and run training sessions for grassroots NGOs,
LDC staff and farmers. In addition, the project design has flexibility to
adjust reclamation targets in response to farmer demand. They would also
assist in promoting benefits of the reclamation program and assisting groups,
especially with water sharing arrangements. The third risk concerns the
ability of farmers to effectively adopt the fL. reclamation package. This
risk would be minimized through the introduction of models that maintain and
improve farmers income early in the project's life.  In addition, an intensive
deme,.istration program of reclanation package and farmer training would
encourage adoption of the proposed technology. Furthermore, limiting of the
reclamation program to about 45,000 ha over a seven year period would allow
enough time to train farmers and, if required, amend the project design based
on implementation experience.
17.         Recomndat4n. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
