"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "This assessment rates the project\n            outcome moderately satisfactory. The project exceeded\n            expectations in carrying out large-scale reclamation of\n            sodic soils. Over 68,400 hectares were reclaimed with farmer\n            participation. The project also contributed to poverty\n            alleviation by helping increase returns to many small and\n            marginal farmers. But this success is tempered by several\n            significant weaknesses. First, though the project objectives\n            were relevant for poverty reduction and consistent with Bank\n            assistance strategy for India, it gave inadequate attention\n            to several critical systemic issues, among others economic\n            incentives for use and management of water, resources for\n            operation and maintenance of drainage, that are essential to\n            developing a long-term program for improving agricultural\n            productivity in areas with high concentration of sodic lands\n            and deteriorating environment conditions. Second, since the\n            improvement in the quality of soil has been marginal in\n            several areas, and drainage and institutional issues related\n            to soil fertility management have not received enough\n            attention, there is considerable risk that the reclaimed\n            land will revert to it s former state. Third, monitoring of\n            environmental impact has not been adequate. Fourth, the\n            implementation of the participatory process was given\n            inadequate attention and, hence, instead of putting the\n            communities in a position of decision-making and control,\n            the process appears to have created a sense of dependency.\n            Finally, the project efficiency was rated modest after\n            adjusting downwards the unduly optimistic assumptions in the\n            ICR about future crop yields and maintenance of drainage,\n            which had not appropriately accounted for the risk that the\n            reclaimed land could revert to it s former state.  The\n            assessment rates sustainability as unlikely for several\n            reasons, among them-and the most serious-- is continuing\n            inadequate attention to drainage issues. Moreover,\n            institutional constraints related to soil fertility\n            management have not been addressed. On balance, the\n            assessment rates Bank performance as satisfactory. Borrower\n            performance is rated satisfactory."}, "docdt": "2004-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
