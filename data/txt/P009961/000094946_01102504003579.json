Among the many lessons, it\n            is emphasized that project success is founded on a\n            preparatory process which directly involves line\n            departments, and intended beneficiaries, allows ample time\n            for preparatory studies, assimilates experience from similar\n            operations, carries out pilot operations, and, allows for\n            flexible implementation (noting that public corporations, or\n            society has greater flexibility in project implementation\n            than line departments). Moreover, the project's\n            establishment of property rights, and land titling, provided\n            the basis for assuring beneficiaries' involvement, and\n            then, created organizations of poor people, followed by\n            mechanisms for resolving technical problems, and provisions\n            of associated resources. This logical sequence of\n            development activities, was a key factor to success. The\n            ability for beneficiaries to obtain returns in a short\n            period by participating in the project, was a motivating\n            ingredient, a factor conducive to the mobilization, and\n            involvement of communities, essential for a successful\n            implementation. Likewise, joint partnership with all\n            organizations with key roles in project implementation,\n            helped ensure supportive roles."}, "docdt": "2001-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
