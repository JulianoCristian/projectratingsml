   Gentlemen:

         Wilbur Smith and Associates is pleased to submit this Final Report of Phase I of the
   Bolivia National Transport Study.            The Report is in five volumes.            Volumes I and II review
   the              situation and present the main analyses, findings and recommendations.                        Volumes
   III and IV contain supplementary appendices and the fifth volume is a summary of the Report.

         The Report represents the conclusion of over two years effort by a professional team made
   up of consultant's staff and Bolivian nationals.                 During the course of the Study, several
   interim reports and technical papers were produced, culminating in a draft Final Report in
   ~ovember,    1980.     The first review period was concluded in December with the final meeting
   of the Study Steering Committee, when all initial comments on the draft report were pre-
   sented by Bolivian entities and by the World Bank.                 A more lengthy review and discussion
   period followed in which additional valuable contributions were made to the Final Report.

         The Report presents and supports a recommended National Transport Plan set in the con-
   text of the expected development of the Bolivian economy over the next ten years, and with
   consideration for possible developments in the following ten years.                       It is not intended
   that the recommendations be taken as a fixed plan; forecasting the future is a hazardous
   task, and it is impossible to foresee all possible developments.                      Therefore, it is strongly
   recommended that the Government set up a permanent transport planning group, utiliz                              the
   Bolivian counterpart team involved in this Study, to monitor developments and adapt the Plan
   to changing circumstances.          The first steps have been taken in this direction by selecting
  a counterpart team for Phase II of this Study.                 Hopefully, this will form a solid basis for
   the continuing transport planning process, and for a permanent National Transport Center.

         The cooperation and assistance we received throughout the Study from officers of the
  Government and others concerned with transport in Bolivia, is gratefully acknowledged.                              We
   also wish to recognize the contributions made by our colleagues on the national counter-
   part team, and by our local associate consultants, CONSA SRL and ECOVIANA SRL.                          We appreci-
  ate the opportunity to have participated in the study effort, and look forward to the imp-
   lementation of the recommendations.

            NOTE ON CURRENCY AND RATE OF EXCHANGE


     All costs quoted in this report are expressed in 1977
pesos when $ US 1 = $b 20.  Due to inflation, the value of
the peso has declined so that approximately $b 1 (1977)
$b 1.6 (1981).  Also, the exchange rate has changed so that
in 1981, $US 1 = $b 25.
            SUMMARY OF FINAL REPORT
     In October 1974, an agreement was signed between         the
Bolivian Government and the United Nations Development Programme
to undertake a national transport study.       Two phases    were
specified. The first phase was to develop a national transport
policy and also to identify investment projects suitable for
international funding agencies, such as the World Bank. The
second phase was to provide technical assistance to the Bolivian
Government in implementing the Phase 1 recommendations.
     The World Bank was appointed executing agency for the pro-
ject. In October 1978, the Bank contacted Wi~bur Smith and
Associates to carry out Phase 1, and at the same time the Govern-
ment formed a team of Bolivian professionals to work with the
consultants. The joint team of more than 30 professionals com-
pleted Phase 1 in November 1980 and the analyses and findings are
presented in this report.
     A map of Bolivia is provided inside the back cover, which
can fold out for ease of reference while reading this report.
GEOGRAPHICAL BACKGROUND
     Bolivia covers an area of      over   one   million    square
kilorneters--oreater than the size of France and Spain to-
gether--but has    only  five   million   inhabitants.    It    is
land-locked, and access to the sea requires transit of one of its
five neighbors--Peru, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay or Brazil.
     Bolivia is divided into nine administrative departments.
The   national administrative capital is La Paz, where all
ministries and embassies are located, but the legal capital is
Sucre where the Supreme Court sits.
     The country presents sharp contrasts in terrain.        The
sparsely populated regions of the north and east consist of vast
plains with vegetation ranging from open grassland--sometimes
dry, sometimes flooded--to dense rain forests in the north.
These plains lie between 200 and 400 meters above sea level and
cover almost two thirds of the country. The northern part con-
                               -1-
tains large rivers, many of which are navigable and all draining
northward into the Madera River, which itself is a major tribu-
tary of the Amazon. The eastern part drains southwards to the
River Plate basin.    Water courses in the east are not well de-
fined and only the Paraguay River, which touches the country in
the southeastern corner at Puerto Busch, is navigable.
     The west and south of the country are dominated by the Andes
Mountains, with peaks of over 6,000 meters.     In Bolivia, the
Andes are divided into two ranges, the Eastern and Western
Cordilleras, with the Western Cordillera marking the frontier
with Chile.   Between the two ranges lies the 4,000-meters high
plain of the Altiplano. Up to 200 km wide, the Altiplano runs
southwards from Lake Titicaca (the highest navigable lake in the
World) towards the border with Argentina. The northern end of
the Altiplano near Lake Titicaca and La Paz is densely populated
but the southern end is desert.

     The Eastern Cordillera of the Andes separates the high
Altiplano from the northern and eastern lowlands. Up to 300 km
wide, with unstable mountains and broken valleys, it presents a
formidable barrier to communications.     Alignments of railroads
and highways are tortuous, and heavy rains ln the wet season
often cause land slides, temporarily blocking routes. Transport
investment planning in the past has been dominated by the pro-
blems of this region since most of Bolivia's population lives in
or near the Eastern Cordillera.      The important    cities   of
Cochabamba, Sucre and Tarija are located in the larger valleys
and the 4,000-meter high mining city of Potosi is situated on the


                               -2-
western fringe. The main transport axis of the country--linking
the Altiplano cities of La Paz and Oruro with the valley city of
Cochabamba and the lowland city of Santa Cruz--passes through the
widest section of the Eastern Cordillera.
     Transport is strongly affected by the wet and dry season
cycle. The wet season occurs in the four summer months of
December through March when routes can be interrupted by land
slides or flooding.    In the northern and eastern regions, many
communities have ground transport only during the dry season, and
consequently depend on services by river and air for the rest of
the year.

OBJECTIVES OF TRANSPORT POLICY
     The main purpose of the Study was to define a policy to
cover all aspects of inter-urban transport--infrastructure, main-
tenance, tariffs, subsidies, regulation and administration. Be-
fore presenting the analyses and recommendations of the Study,
the basic objectives of transport policy as seen by the Study are
discussed.
     Transport policy is concerned with three main areas:
       i) Use of existing infrastructure
      ii) Regulation of operators
     iii) Improvement of transport infrastructure

     Use of Existing Intrastructure - The use of existing   trans-
port facilities to best advantage implies:

          An Economic Maintenance Policy - The method and fre-
     quency of maintenance should be calculated to minimize the


                                 -3-
overall cost of transport--the sum of vehicle operating,
track maintenance and investment costs--on each link of the
network.
     Optimal Pricing Policies - The volume of traffic and
the choice of mode are influenced by tariffs. High tariffs
may impede economic    development.     In Bolivia,  where
distances are long and transport is inevitably costly,
tariff policy, by attracting traffic to the modes with
lowest marginal costs, could help to reduce the average
costs of transport to the community. Also, since there is




               The bus station at Sucre

ample spare capacity at all times on practically the entire
transport infrastructure, it is important not to suppress
traffic and the activity that it reflects by tariffs need-
lessly higher than the marginal costs attributable to that
traffic.
     Regulation of Vehicles and Drivers - It is universally
accepted that questions of safety require regulation of veh-
icle design and maintenance, and also of driving standards.
It should be considered whether Bolivian regulations are
adequate and effectively enforced, particularly in view of
the difficult and dangerous nature of many of the roads.
Regulation of vehicle size and weight is also generally
accepted as desirable in order to prevent undue damage to
road surfaces and obstruction by oversize vehicles.
     Social Subsidies - It may be considered deSirable, for
non-economic reasons, to relieve isolated and remote com-
munities from some of the costs of transport. This may be

                         -4-
    done by remission of taxes or by payment of grants towards
    the provision of cheap and frequent services by bus, train
    or plane.

     Regulation of Operators - The second main area of transport
policy concerns the efficient provision of transport services on
the available infrastructure, subject to the various charges and
regulations discussed.   The basic objective is to obtain, as
cheaply as possible, services that match consumers' demand in
terms of frequency, convenience and reliability.        The most
important condition is the avoidance of monopoly power and, with
it, price-fixing.   Where traffic volumes are reasonably large,
this is normally not a problem; monopolies are easily broken by
allowing free entry into the industry. But where traffic volumes
are small, monopoly may flourish, and this seems to be a problem
in Bolivia, particularly in the trucking industry.    It may be
desirable in such cases to control rates and to take action
against restrictive practices by operators, as discussed later.
There is no way in which a particular policy on competition can
be proved the best. One can only put forward the arguments for
and against, in the Bolivian situation, and point to experience
elsewhere. This is an area where experience and judgement are
necessary.

     Improvement of Transport Infrastructure      Only when the
existing   infrastructure is well managed and the        services
operating upon it are efficiently organized, is one well placed
to consider the third area of transport policy; namely the

A great deal of improvement is desirable, for both economic and
social objectives, but the cost would far exceed the resources
that could conceivably be obtained for the purpose. The problem
of choosing the best projects is not easy.

     As far as economic objectives are concerned, cost-benefit
analysis facilitates sensible conclusions. A more difficult pro-
blem is to place values on non-economic objectives, e.g., the
connection of isolated communities or assistance to        under-
privileged sections of society.     Projects with such objectives
may yield low economic returns. The best approach to the problem
is to show (a) the benefits expected in physical terms, e.g., the
numbers of people affected and the amount of use they are likely
to make of the facilities provided;       and (b) the opportunity
cost, i.e., the alternative benefits to be sacrificed to make
this project possible.    It is also important to (c) ensure that
cheaper ways of producing the same or similar benefits are not
neglected.

     The final assessment must be a political one, but often a
clear statement of the facts will pOint irresistibly towards the
right conclusion.

DATA COLLECTION AND STUDY METHODOLOGY
     The Study was divided into three logical and conventional
phases: first, collection of data describing the current trans-
port situation; secondly, forecasting the ways in which trans-
port needs and problems could develop in the next 20 years, and
identifying the options for improving the transport system to
meet the challenge; and thirdly, an evaluation of those options,
subject primarily to economic constraints, leading to recommenda-
tions for structural and organizational improvements to the sys-
tem.

     Data Collection - In order to acquire a good knowledge of
the transport situation, inventories were compiled of the infra-
structure--roads, railroads, airports, ports and pipelines--and
surveys were made of transport services and traffic on all modes.
Information was collected about the organization, regulation,
tariffs, costs and financial position of the state transport
authorities, and of private operators of trucks, buses, aircraft
and river boats. The principal sources of transport data were as
follows:

were made throughout the country in 1978 during the wet season
(February and March) and dry season (June).
     Forecasting - For forecasting the future demand for trans-
port, and to assess the impact of new transport projects, a
mathematical computer model was developed.      This model    can
analyze in a systematic manner the many aspects of society and
the economy--popu1ation, employment, income, industrial      pro-
duction, etc.-- and then makes estimates of passenger, freight
and vehicle movements for a hypothetical transport system. Thus,
it is possible to postulate a set of future conditions--for
example, migration to the Beni, fUrther agricultural development
near Santa Cruz, a new railroad between        Santa   Cruz   and
Cochabamba, new factories in Oruro--and then use the model to
predict the transport movements produced by these changes.    The
model involves over 2,500 separate computing stages and generally
takes about three weeks to process on the computer. It was used
to forecast traffic under four separate sets of assumptions for
the year 1989 and one for the year 1999.
     To predict transport flows, the model required input para-
meters describing the two forecast years selected for the Study,
1989 and 1999. These parameters were prepared from predictions
of the transport system, transport costs and, of particular
importance, the country's economy. Guidelines on economic growth
and possible development patterns were formulated following a
workshop organized by the Study in June, 1979, in which repre-
sentatives from the main Bolivian institutions participated.
Population and income were estimated for each of 77 analysis
zones into which the country had been divided, (see Figure 1) as
were the production, consumption, imports and exports of goods,
categorized by 39 commodity groups.
     Eyaluation - All transport projects were evaluated on their
economic merit, mostly by the conventional cost-saving method
whereby benefits to both existing and generated traffic are esti-
mated directly from reductions in transport costs brought about
by the project. Most of the evaluations were based on model re-
sults but some projects, notably international links, were not
included in the model and were examined manually. A separate air
model was used to generate air passenger flows. Most road pro-
jects, including alternative highway maintenance poliCies, were
evaluated using the Highway Design and Maintenance Standards
Model (HOM) (1). This procedure also made use of traffic pre-
dictions from the main model.

     Some projects entailed new extensions to the transport sys-
tem, notably penetration roads in the remote northern and eastern
regions, on which all or most of the traffic would be newly
generated. The cost-saving method was not applicable to such
projects and the producer surplus method, which attempts to place
a net value directly on the economic activity generated by the
new facility, was used instead.

      Following economic evaluation, questions of regional distri-
bution and social policy were considered before an investment
program was drawn up. The recommended investment plan takes into
account the budget likely to be available for transport invest-
ment.
THE EXISTING TRANSPORT SYSTEM
     Bolivia is served by five main modes of transport:    rail-
road, highway, water (river and lake) pipeline and air. This
section describes briefly the principal characteristics of each
mode. The disposition of transport infrastructure is shown in
the fold-out map at the end of this volume.

     Railroads - The rail system, operated by the National Rail
Company ENFE,   is comparatively extensive with 3,643 km of narrow
gauge, single track line, divided between the eastern and the
Andean systems.    Currently, these systems are connected only by
means of a long detour passing through Argentina.
     The rail system was built principally to connect Bolivia
with ocean ports and connections are currently in use to ports in
Chile, Argentina, Brazil and (via a ferry on Lake Titicaca) Peru.

                                -9-
With the exception of Peru, where standard gauge is used, all
these port connections are one meter gauge as in Bolivia.
     Almost invariably, the railroads were originally built with
the minimum possible investment, using light rails and wooden
sleepers placed without ballast. As a result, the system is now
in poor condition, with the exception of 433 km of track
rehabilitated(2) with World Bank help since 1973. Figure 2 shows
the scope and progress of the rehabilitation program.    For the
most part, the track is stable.       Three major exceptions are
Oruro-Cochabamba, Atocha-Villaz6n and Taperas-Robore (on     the
Santa Cruz-Corumba line).
    ENFE equipment can be summarized as follows:


    •
    •
         Diesel-electric locomotives
         Diesel-hydraulic locomotives
                                             54
                                              9
    •    Ferrobuses                          14
    •    Passenger cars                     187 (98 purchased
                                                 after 1950}
    •    Freight wagons (general)         1,927 (1,145 purchased
                                                 after 1973}
    •    Freight wagons (ENFE Use)          140
    •    Freight wagons (Own account--
           mainly YPFB)                     192


     In 1979, ENFE carried 1,212,000 passengers and 1,196,000
tons of freight. Of the latter, over three-quarters was foreign
trade traffic, mainly imports (three-quarters of foreign trade
traffic by rail).
     Highways - The road system is also extensive, but com-
paratively primitive, with only 1,289 km of paved roads. In
December, 1978, the system was as follows (in kilometers):

road system is in poor condition. The older paved roads have

                Badly deteriorated section of the
                Guabira - Yapacanl Highway

     Almost all the paved roads lie on, or are near, the axis La
Paz - Oruro      Cochabamba     Santa Cruz. Traffic volumes are
generally low with only 300 km carrying more than 1,000 vehicles
per day in 1977 (all near the main cities). The La Paz - Oruro
highway was the only inter-urban connection to exceed         500
vehicles per day throughout its length in 1977. On average,
two-thirds of all interurban traffic are trucks or vans and only
15 percent are private passenger vehicles. Freight load factors
on trucks are low with 55 percent recorded without load, but many
are used to carry passengers. Inter-urban bus load factors are
high at 93 percent average.
     The National Road Service (SNC) is an autonomous agency
under the Ministry of Transport and Communications, charged with
planning, constructing, maintaining and administering highways in
Bolivia. Overall, it employs 5,211 persons of whom 194 are
engineers, 501 technicians, 4,329 manual workers and 187 others
(1979).
     Public road transport is largely provided      by   drivers
operating their own vehicle. They must belong to a syndicate and
no member may own more than two vehicles. There are 86 syndi-
cates for non-urban transport and these are grouped into ten
federations, all belonging to the Bolivian Confederation of
Drivers. Transport cooperatives and private transport companies


                               -11-
are also recognized by the State, but their activities are
limited to the domestic transport of passengers and the inter-
national transport of passengers and cargo.       The Ministry of
Transport and Communications fixes transport tariffs and has the
legal power to regulate road transport.

     Water Transport - The country is served by two major river
systems. The Beni-Madre de Dios-Orthon, Ichilo-Mamore, and Ite-
nez, all located in Northern Bolivia, feed the Madera River which
flows into the Amazon. Unfortunately, although some 5,000 km of
this 10,000 km system is navigable within Bolivia, access to the
Amazon, and also between some of the rivers, is blocked by rap-
ids. The main river of this system is the Ichilo-Mamore, which
carried about 200,000 tons of goods traffic in 1978.
     Along the Ichilo-Mamore system, there are three main ports:
(i) Puerto Villarroel, which is connected with Cochabamba by a
240 km long road;   (ii) Puerto Varador and Puerto Almacen near
Trinidad; and (iii) Puerto Guayaramerin. About 82 percent of
the recorded goods movements on the Ichilo-Mamore are between
these ports: the remaining 18 percent are almost all between the
three main ports and other intermediate river ports.

     Southeastern Bolivia drains into the River Plate system and
there is access via the Paraguay River from Corumba (in Brazil)
and Puerto Busch. This river is currently used for exports of
about 100,000 tons of iron ore per year from MutGn, and for about
2,000 tons per year of agricultural traffic, all via Corumba.
Barge trains of up to 9,000 ton capacity can be used on this
river, compared with boat sizes of only 300 tons on the northern
river system.

     Lake Titicaca is the highest navigable lake in the World,
and there are regular services between Guaqui and Chaguaya (both
in Bolivia) and Puno (in Peru). About 120,000 tons were carried
on these services in 1977.

     Pipelines - The country is served by an extensive system of
pipelines   operated by the     National   Hydrocarbon    Company
{YPFB)--about 3,800 km for crude oil and petroleum products and
900 km for gas. Crude oil pipelines are being increasingly used
for petroleum products as exports of crude oil ,decline and
domestic refining increases.

     AiL - Due to poor land connections, many of the remote
regions are served principally by air. There are over 600 air-
ports and airfields in Bolivia but just thirty-three are con-
trolled by the National Airports Administration (AASANA). Of
these, six have paved runways (La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz,
Sucre, Tarija and Trinidad). The main passenger air services are
operated by Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB), but additional services
are operated by the Air Force (TAM) and over 100 private air taxi
companies. Air freight is mainly carried by 25 non-regular air
companies operating 1940s vintage aircraft, principally to carry
meat from the Beni to the Altiplano.

     Overall View - Volumes are generally low on all modes of
transport. Only 300 km of highway carried more than 1,000
vehicles per day in 1977, and no unpaved road carried more than
350 vehicles per day.     The total rail system carried only 1.2
million tons of freight and the same number of passengers.   Air
movements are similarly light, with the maximum takeoffs and

landings per year registered at Trinidad with 38,000 (mainly
light aircraft), compared with a capacity of at least 200,000 for
a single runway.
     As shown in Figure 3, it is estimated that 36 percent of the
total land area has no land connection with the rest of the
country and therefore depends entirely on river and air trans-
port. An additional 31 percent is served by land only during the
six-month dry season.   Hence, only about one-quarter of the
country (albeit with 86 percent of the population) can be con-
sidered to have land access during the entire year.

     It is concluded that it is basic access and the lowering of
transport costs, rather than additional capacity, that is mostly
required to improve transport conditions.   This may imply the
construction of roads into currently inaccessible regions, but
these must be seen in the light of the migration that is needed
to settle such areas. Much more important is the improvement of
the existing infrastructure to reduce maintenance and operating
costs.
TRANSPORT COSTS AND TARIFFS
     The characteristics of transport infrastructure are re-
flected in the costs and tariffs of moving goods and passengers.
Transport costs, the reduction of which is the principal benefit
from investment in infrastructure, were analyzed in-depth for the
various modes.   They were defined in terms of economic or re-
source costs, in constant 1977 pesos.   However, this does not
mean constant prices, and relative changes of transport cost com-
ponents were taken into account;       for example, substantial
increases in fuel costs were projected in the analysis of future

transport costs and flows.     In general, transport costs are
expected to rise by 10 to 20 percent in real terms between 1977
and 1989.

     The main features of the cost analyses for each mode are
discussed below.   Tariffs, which vary considerably within each
mode, are not discussed further in this summary report.

      Railroads - The accounts of the National Railroad Company
were the basis for an extensive analysis of rail transport costs.
Emphasis was placed on the determination of variable and marginal
costs of transport.     The fixed costs, which are incurred if a
line is to be used at all, were also determined for each section
of the network.     Because of the generally low traffic levels,
these fixed costs (together with the costs of central adminis-
tration) account for two-thirds of total railroad costs, an
unusually high proportion.
     Costs vary by line,    but   average   costs   in   1977   were   as
follows:

     Road Transport - The dispersed nature of the industry made
it necessary to perform extensive surveys to obtain reliable
information, both on tariffs and on the costs of providing ser-
vices. Costs were derived from an analysis of the various com-
ponents, such as vehicle depreciation and interest, driver's
salary and the expenses for fuel, tires, spare parts, repairs and
overhead. Also investigated was vehicle usage, in terms of
vehicle life and annual kilometers driven.    Together with the
costs of road maintenance, these were used in a series of
formulae to estimate transport costs as a function of road sur-
face type and geometric characteristics.
     Average costs in 1977 varied by surface type as follows:

                                       PAVED   GRAVEL    EARTH

     Riyer - River costs were derived mainly from the results of
a survey of boat owners. Costs vary from $b 0.3 to $b 0.9 per
ton-kilometer on the Ichilo-Mamore system depending on length of
travel, size of boat and direction of travel. Unit costs on the
other rivers of the north were generally higher owing to the
smaller boats used.    Costs were lower on the Paraguay River,
where very much larger boats can be used, at about $b 0.12 per
ton km.

and size of pipe. Typical costs are shown below for petroleum,

     Air - Costs vary widely depending upon aircraft type, load
factor and operating region.  In particular, the high altitude of
the Altiplano (4000 meters)    restricts loads carried. Typical
costs are as follows:

THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK OF THE TRANSPORT MODES
     As a starting point to the analysis of transport pricing
policy, the financial condition of each mode was examined.
Recommended policy is discussed later in this report.

     Railroads -  The railroads    are   unique   in that   one
organization (ENFE)  is responsible for investment, maintenance
and operation. A stated goal of ENFE is self-sufficiency, but
recent figures show that this is not being achieved.

     ENFE relies heavily on freight (particularly international)
for income.   Clearly, they are in a position of acute financial
difficulty. Traffic receipts in 1979 were disappointing and, un-
less something is done, there can be no reason for optimism in

the next few years.     There must soon be either a big change in
tariffs, which might not remove the deficit, or a change in
ENFE's financial obligations.     Recommendations are presented
later in this report.

     Highways - Financially, the roads are the most complex part
of the transport system because there is no generally accepted
way of charging for their use. The National Road Service (SNC)
is the agency responsible for all the roads covered by this
Study; recent income and expenditure are summarized below:

     In 1976-79, 63 percent of SNC revenue came from the Treasury
and 31 percent from lending agencies. Little more than 1 percent
came directly from road users.  It is quite reasonable,  in view

of the high expenditure on investment, that much of this should
be financed by borrowing.   The direct contribution from road
users comes largely from transit tolls but the revenue of $b 9.83
million in 1979 only just exceeded the cost of running the trans-
sit stations.   Indirectly, road users pay far more, through fuel
tax and customs duties on vehicles and vehicle parts. These pay-
ments do not go directly to SNC but are certainly user charges.
They amounted to 382, 309, 392 and 590 million pesos for each of
the four years 1976 to 1979 respectively, which comfortably
covered costs of road maintenance and minor improvements.
      It is difficult to discover the true financial position of
road transport operators.     In 1977, it is believed that they
realized a loss, but sUbstantial tariff raises in 1979 and 1980
have probably now corrected the situation.
     Water Transport - As with road transport operators, it is
not   easy to identify the true financial position of the
operators, but the situation on the Mamore may be indicative.
Tariffs were fixed in 1974 and remained unchanged until 1980
when, after a petition by boat owners, they were substantially
raised. Between 1974 and 1980, the Bolivian retail price index
rose by 80 to 90 percent, and it is difficult to see how boat
operators survived unless they were making large profits in 1974,
or else were receiving tariffs above the official rate. Even at
the end of the period, just before the tariffs were raised, there
appeared to be excess capacity on the Mamore and no sign that
operators were going out of business.
     In the circumstances it would be difficult without an
in-depth study of all relevant factors, to come to a view about
the true financial position of this sector.

     In order to correct this poor financial situation, domestic
fares for LAB were increased in early 1981 by approximately 40
percent (although there were regional variations).   This change
came too late for detailed analysis by the Study, but it is
thought that the increase has corrected LAB's financial position.

     These figures indicate that AASANA was unable to cover even
its operating costs.  In December, 1979, a 65 percent increase in
tariffs was approved but even so, AASANA will find it hard to
finance new investment costs out of income.

THE BOLIVIAN ECONOMY
     The future use of transport services depends on a number of
socio-economic factors that are behind the generation of trans-
port demand. These include population, its distribution between
urban and rural areas, income levels, location of industry, de-
mand for industrial consumption, imports and       exports.   To
quantify these parameters for each of the 77 analysis zones, it
was first necessary to make a general assessment of the national
economy and its prospects.
     Resources ~ Bolivia is rich in natural resources, containing
a wide variety of climates, soils, vegetation and geological
structure.
     Some 87 percent of the land is suitable for agricultural
production~  1 percent of the land is used for farming and about
40 percent for extensive cattle raising. Virtually every type of
crop, from tropical to temperate, can be grown. There are vast
areas suitable for livestock of every kind. Enormous forests
contain large supplies of valuable timber and, although the
country lacks sea coast, it possesses large rivers and lakes well
stocked with fish.

     Despite the abundance of agricultural potential, Bolivia is
better known for her wealth in minerals.        Practically every
valuable mineral is produced, except coal and bauxite, and even
the latter is thought to be available. The lack of coal is com-
pensated for by substantial reserves of oil and natural gas.

     These generous resources are the heritage of a comparatively
tiny population--about 5 million.    Lack of manpower in some
regions is doubtless one reason why the natural potential of the
country remains largely untouched.

     Recent Growth - The gross domestic product (GDP) increased
by 51 percent between 1970 and 1978, but this is exaggerated by a
shift of many people from subsistence into the cash economy. One
twelfth of the GDP was devoted to transport and communications.

     The value of m1n1ng exports stagnated from 1970 to 1978, de-
clining from 89 to 71 percent of recorded foreign currency earn-
ings. Natural gas earnings rose from 0 to 11 percent, and agri-
cultural products from 3 to 6 percent. This latter trend starts
to reflect the potential of the agricultural sector which, over-
all, has experienced an impressive growth over the past decades.
Having had to import many of its food needs prior to the 1952

                              -22-
revolution, the country is now largely self-sufficient in this
aspect, with the notable exception of wheat and SOme other
grains.

     The Future - After a relatively rapid growth during most of
the 1970s, Bolivia now faces severe economic difficulties for a
variety of reasons which include the high level of foreign debt,
the decline of petroleum production and the general state of the
world economy. Anticipating a rise of natural gas exports in the
relatively near future, the economy is projected to resume a
faster growth rate by the mid-1980s.

     There exists, however, a wide range of development oppor-
tunities, and it is therefore difficult to predict the future
economy in the detail required for transport projections.     For
this reason,  it was decided to formulate three alternative
development patterns for 1999 (designated A, C and D       B was
discarded at an early stage), taking into account several levels
of GDP, different emphases on the growth of the primary versus
the secondary sector, and different regional distributions of
development. This was complemented by a single pattern for 1989,
(shown in Figure 4) since much of the development of the 1980s is
already started or committed. The total GDP was projected to


                              -23-
rise by 71 percent from 1977 to 1989, and by between 54 and 106
percent from 1989 to 1999, depending on the development pattern.
Goods production and consumption (in tonnage terms) would more
than double by 1989, with further increases thereafter.

RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR TRANSPORT INVESTMENT
     While a great number of worthwhile transport investments may
be formulated, it is evident that there is a limit to the funds
that can be allocated for this purpose, within a given period.
As this Study is investigating the transport sector as a whole
rather than only individual projects, an estimate had to be made
of the overall investment budget that might be available.

     The ratio of total national investment to GDP has grown
steadily from 16.7 percent in 1973 to 20.0 percent in 1979; con-
tinued growth is expected, and a ratio of 21.5 percent was pro-
jected for 1989. The public sector accounts for about 57 percent
of total investment, and the basic question is how this will be
divided between such items as industrial development, agri-
culture, mining, transport, education, defense and health ser-
vices.

     Transport's share of public investment rose from 14.7 per-
cent in 1973 to 35.0 percent in 1978 (30 percent in 1978 if LAB
aircraft investments are excluded), but fell back in 1979 to 19.3
percent. Future allocations to the transport sector are likely
to fall within a similar range.In order to cover a reasonable
range of possibilties, both low and high estimates of the trans-
port budget were prepared, corresponding to 20 and 30 percent
respectively of total public investment.   In addition, a pro-
portion was allocated for urban transport investment--5 percent
for 1981-1990 and 10 percent for 1991-2000.         The estimated
inter-urban transport budgets are summarized below by development

     Road transport dominates in 1977 with 93 percent of tonnages
and over 75 percent of ton-kilometers. Both river and pipelines
are more important in terms of ton-kilometers than rail. The
situation changes dramatically in future years with a very large

forecast increase in rail traffic. This is brought about mainly
by a change in rail tariff policy, which would charge nearer
marginal cost, instead of the current average costs. In 1999,
additional traffic is due to the rail interconnection.  Although
road still dominates in tonnage by 1999, rail is closely
approaching the road total in ton-kilometers. Pipeline transport
is expected to increase, but river is expected to decline with
increased competition from road and rail.

     Rail is the dominant non-pipeline mode for 1977 and this is
not expected to change greatly, although both road and water be-
come more important. Water transport is mainly by Lake Titicaca
in 1977 but the large increase forecast is for iron ore and iron
pellet exports on the Paraguay River. Road transport is expected
to increase with the gradual improvement of the currently very
poor road communications with neighboring countries.


     International freight transit traffic was recorded as 42,000
ton in 1979; much of this was an unusual movement of flour and
cereals between Argentina and Chile, but 13,000 tons were metals
between Brazil and both Peru and Chile. Total traffic could rise
to as much as 400,000 tons by 1989 and 900,000 tons by 1999, but
much depends on the growth rates of the economies of the
countries concerned, and the costs by other routes, principally
by sea. Transit traffic is of crucial importance in evaluating a
rail interconnection.

Land passenger travel is expected to increase by about 2 percent
per year, but travel by air is forecast to increase much faster,
perhaps up to 20 percent per year. At present, less than 2 per-

5. Both freight and passenger demands are currently concentrated
in the central east-west corridor linking the largest cities of
La Paz, Oruro, Cochabarnba and Santa Cruz.  North and south of
this corridor, road volumes rarely exceed 150 vehicles per day,
except near large communities.     With the development of the
transport system, two corridors--Oruro-Potosi-Tarija-Bermejo and
Santa Cruz-Yacuiba--are expected to grow in importance, with
volumes reaching six hundred to eight hundred vehicles per day by




              One of the busiest highways:   Santa
              Cruz - Montero

1999. Rail volumes (shown later in Figure 7) are currently
evenly distributed. Construction of the rail interconnection
would emphasize the central east-west corridor, and so would a
large increase on the Santa Cruz-Corumba line due to transport of
products from MutGn.


TRANSPORT PROJECTS SELECTED FOR EVALUATION
     Infrastructure capacity is generally adequate for the low
volumes prevailing, both current and forecast, so that candidate
improvement projects selected by the Study aimed more at reducing
transport costs or at providing connections with areas of poor
accessibility.

     Some projects are already under      construction   or   are
otherwise firmly committed with financing assured, and these pro-


                              -29-
jects were not evaluated by Study. They include an extension of
the railroad line from Yapacani to the Rio Grande,    the third
phase of the railroad rehabilitation program, new airports at
Santa Cruz (Viru-Viru), Cobija, Riberalta and Puerto Suarez, a
new gravel road from Santa Cruz to Trinidad, and new paved roads
between Chimore and Yapacani, Cochabamba and Oruro, and La Paz
and Santa Barbara (in the Yungas Valleys).




                The Quillacollo - Confital highway
                in construction

     To complement this committed program, more than 200 can-
didate projects were defined for evaluation. They include four
different possibilities to interconnect the Andean and        the
Eastern rail systems, a further rail extension to Trinidad, and
rehabilitation of more existing existing railroad lines. Highway
candidate projects range from regravelling to reconstruction and
paving of existing roads,    and also include many entirely new
roads into the remote regions. Many air transport projects were
defined as well as several improvements to the pipeline and river
transport    system, including alternative port sites on the
Paraguay River.


     Based on the definition of these projects,       alternative
future transport systems were defined. The 1989 Committed Net-
work consisted only of existing facilities and committed pro-
jects. The 1989 and 1999 Test Networks, however, included a
great number of candidate projects, selected through an initial
screening process. The computer transport model was used to make
forecasts of traffic on each transport network, and these fore-
casts provided the basis for the economic evaluation of the can-

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE
OF EXISTING HIGHWAYS
     There are nearly 39,000 km of interurban roads of which less
than 1,300 km are paved (at the end of 1978). Most highways are
in poor condition.    Paved surfaces have not been maintained so
that many of them now require reconstruction or overlaying.
About 6,800 km have gravel surfaces, but because of the coarse
gravel used, the surfaces are rough and difficult to maintain
adequately. The 31,000 km of earth roads receive little main-
tenance and many are interrupted in the wet season.

     Figure 6 shows the road projects recommended by the Study,
including penetration roads and international links discussed
later in this report. Projects for paving 765 km of unpaved
roads and for major gravelling of a further 3,643 km are
recommended in the central regions of the country for the next
decade. To a large extent, the projects recommended will mean a
change in emphasis in road planning. Apart from committed new
highway   projects    ($b  5905    million)      and          the
Machacamarca-Challapata highway (96 km at $b 439 million), no new
paved highways are recommended. All the remaining paving pro-
jects are for betterment (669 km at $b 1051 million), where the
road is improved on the existing alignment.

             highway


                              -31-
     Betterment includes widening, improved drainage, improvement
of sharp curves and provision of a 6-meter pavement.        Major
gravelling consists of improvements to drainage and placing a new
surface of selected and compacted gravel.

     In addition, several new highways are recommended in the re-
mote regions (see next section), but these are generally low
volume penetration and feeder roads with gravel or earth surface.
Also, a paved highway is recommended for Santa Barbara-Bella
Vista (99 km at $b 1250 million) which will be part of the high-
way designed to link La Paz with the remote northern regions.
However, it is recommended that this road is built to lower
design standards than currently envisaged.

     The emphasis has been given to such relatively low level
improvements because in 1977, there were no unpaved roads in
Bolivia with volumes higher than 300-400 vehicles per day, and
only 527 km had volumes higher than 200 vehicles per day. High
capacity routes are not required for some time to come and the
emphasis in the 1980s must be on improving surfaces; improve-
ments to alignment should take second place.

     Also recommended is an extensive program of improvements to
existing paved roads, some of which have deteriorated badly. It
is considered that 791 km will require treatment in the next ten
years at an estimated cost of $b 985 million with 211 km of over-
laying ($b 144 million) recommended for the first three years.

     Overloaded trucks are a principal cause of paved road dam-
age, and a regular program of axle load measurements is recom-
mended.  It is recommended later in this report ("Recommendations
on Future Tariff Policy") that the Transito toll system be abol-
ished and it is suggested that these stations be converted to
permanent vehicle weigh stations.

     It is recommended that the current program of improvements
to existing feeder roads    (financed by USAID) be continued at
about the current levels, costing about $b 655 million over the
ten years, 1981-1990.

     An improvement in maintenance standards is also stron9 ly
recommended. The new gravel surfaces (recommended as maJor
gravelling) will require improved maintenance techniques, and
benefits can also be obtained by placing better gravel on the
existing poor surfaces. On paved roads, patching should be in-
creased from the present negligible levels and routine surface
dressing introduced. For gravel roads, better graded gravel
should be used together with watering and compacting every third
grading. With these improvements, frequency of grading could be
reduced from current levels. On the other hand, more intensive
grading and spot gravelling is required on earth roads.




                       Gravel Road Grading

     By 1990 if these recommendations are adopted, overall costs
of road maintenance would more than double from present values,
from about $b 214 million in 1979 to about $b 480 million in
1990. Paved and earth road maintenance costs should increase
sharply but gravel road costs per kilometer are expected to


                              -33-
change little.   Although unit costs for gravel roads would rise
with more sophisticated techniques, maintenance frequencies could
then be reduced from the current high levels.

     Construction of a total of 103 bridges costing $b 487
million is recommended over the next ten years in addition to
bridges required for new highway projects. Thirty-four of these
bridges are required as replacements for existing deficient
structures.




            New bridge in construction near Caranavj


     In addition, a feasibility study is recommended for a new
bridge over the Rfo Grande at Puerto Banegas near Santa Cruz. It
is estimated that such a bridge could be economically feasible by
1987, at a cost of $b 130 million.

     All projects recommended by the Study will require more
detailed feasibility studies, and a program of such studies is
recommended. Such studies should consider all engineering and
economic aspects, and should also re-examine the conclusions of
this Study on modal competition between rail and road.        In
particular, more detailed studies are required of the concept of
betterment (see above) and it is recommended that two pilot
studies be undertaken, one in flat terrain and the other in
undulating to mountainous terrain.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON NEW ROADS AND OTHER TRANSPORT
LINKS IN REMOTE AREAS
     The technology of our time makes it inevitable that roads
should be the leading form of transport for opening up new
regions. Air transport has a pioneering role to play but is too
expensive and restrictive to remain the sole, or dominant means
of transport. Railroads, to be economic, need large, concen-
trated volumes of traffic, which are difficult to foresee in the
remote regions. Rivers offer the cheapest, but much the slowest,
form of transport, since the beginning of history they have pro-
vided impressive natural transport systems, particularly in the
Amazon basin, but they have generated little development along
their banks and little traffic. It is roads, of simple construc-
tion, offering cheap, reasonably fast and convenient transport by
truck, bus and car, that give the best chance of opening up new
areas.


     The essential requirements for a penetration road are:
     (i)   it must give access to areas of   productive    potential;
    (ii)   it must also give access to a market where     the   output
           of the area can be sold;
   (iii)   market prices must offer an attractive profit over      and
           above costs of production and transport;
    (iv)   the size of the market must be sufficient to absorb the
           new source of supply without prices being forced down
           to an unprofitable level.


     Three other conditions which may, in the case of Bolivia, be
equally essential, are:
     (v)   substantial investment may be needed in production
           facilities; roads are not likely to be worthwhile if
           they generate only primitive, extensive farming, espec-
           ially for livestock, producing very low yields per hec-
           tare; if the value of the road depends on more inten-
           sive farming methods, requiring some capital invest-
           ment, there must be good reason to believe that this
           will be achieved;
    (vi)   there must be sufficient supply of immigrant labor;


                               -35-
   (vii)   adequate living conditions must be provided to attract
           the migrants, i.e., homes, schools, medical facilities,
           shops, etc.


     If the right conditions prevail, there are three reasons why
it could be in the national interest to open up new areas of
agriculture, including livestock, forestry and fish: first, to
reduce imports of commodities like wheat that could be produced
in Bolivia;   secondly, to create new sources of exports; and
thirdly, to enable part of the population to move from areas of
low productivity to areas wher~ it could be much higher.

     There is in Bolivia another reason for penetration roads.
Some areas have already been partly opened up by means of air
transport. These areas are mainly in the Beni and depend on the
production of meat for La Paz and the Altiplano. Without roads,




               The existing highway from Santa Cruz
               to Trinidad
the economic and social development of these areas is strictly
limited. Several of the roads evaluated by the Study are of this
sort; they are designed, not to open up virgin territory, but to
stimulate a fuller and more efficient development of areas al-
ready under production.




                               -36-
     Penetration Road Analysis - A total of 16 penetration roads
were identified and analyzed in detail, ranging in length from 45
to 560 km.    The producer surplus potential from agriculture was
estimated, taking into account the likely start-up period for the
development to occur. The projects were then rated according to
a point scoring system in order to assess the likelihood for
development to be successful.    Besides potential agricultural
productivity, other criteria were taken into account such as
market size, distance from market and probability of sufficient
migration taking place to the area in question.

     It was concluded that several penetration roads in northern
La Paz, Beni, Pando and eastern Santa Cruz should be built.
Their construction, and that of the associated feeder roads,
should be coordinated with agricultural colonization schemes and
proceed in stages. The speed with which these roads are extended
into new areas should be gauged according to the success of each
scheme. Some of the roads might be extended faster to achieve
strategic or integrationa1 objectives.

        The principal routes recommended are as follows:

     Other Projects in Remote Regions - Apart from penetration
roads, numerous projects to improve land connections with Trini-
dad (capital of Beni Department) were evaluated, partly based on
results from the transport model. A road from Santa Cruz is now
nearing completion, and another road connection from La Paz is
steadily being improved.    Further improvements are justified to
the road from La Paz costing Sb 1550 million, as well as a major
new road connection from Cochabamba, costing Sb 1116 million.
However, no economic justification could be found for extending
the railroad from Santa Cruz beyond the Rio Grande.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON RAIL TRANSPORT
     Rail has traditionally been associated with Bolivian foreign
trade carrying, in 1978, 81 percent of all exports and 58 percent
of all imports by weight. The rail share of domestic transport
has by contrast been low -- 2 percent by tonnage and 6 percent by
ton-kilometers. The Study forecasts a sharp change from these
patterns combining a steady increase in foreign trade traffic and
a very high increase in domestic traffic.    This projected in-
crease can be attributed to three assumptions:        a change in
tariff policy to encourage more domestic traffic in commodities
where demand is elastic, an increase in traffic associated with
the development of the Mutun iron ore reserves in eastern Santa
Cruz Department, and (for the 1990s) the opening of a rail system
interconnection within Bolivia(3).    Thus total traffic is fore-
cast to increase from 600 million ton-kilometers in 1979 to 1,500
million ton-kilometers by 1989 and possibly to 5000 million

       recommended to start in the 1980s, but fUrther studies
       could modify this conclusion -- see later.


                               -39-
ton-kilometers by 1999.    The forecast traffic for 1989 is con-
trasted with 1977 volumes in Figure 7.

     The major project evaluated by the Study was a rail system
interconnection between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz.        Several
alternative alignments were studied and these are shown in Figure
8. The best alignment of those examined would link Cochabamba
with Santa Cruz via Aiquile and Mataral, at an estimated cost of
between $b 12,000 million and $b 15,000 million.    It was con-
cluded that it would probably not be justified economically until
the 1990s, but more studies are recommended to evaluate a
possibly cheaper northern alignment, and the potential for tran-
sit traffic. If these studies prove favorable, the project could
be brought forward, although financial limitations will probably
limit construction in the 1980s.

     A number of other new rail projects were evaluated but only
two     Mutun-Motacucito ($b 183 million) and Guaqui-Desaguadero
($b 186 million) -- were found to be economically feasible. Both
depend on other factors~ the rate of development of Mutun for
the former and the completion of the Peruvian line from Puno to
Desaguadero for the latter.

     Reconstruction of the Taperas-Robore section      of   Santa
Cruz-Corumba, damaged by floods in 1979, is recommended on the
existing alignment at a cost of $b 400 million, with works spread
over ten years. Re-construction of sections of Oruro-Cochabamba,
which are subject to annual interruptions by earth slides, is not
recommended at current traffic volumes; it is more economical to
continue with the current program of defense and repair works
each year.

     Three lines    should    be    considered    for    closure;
Cochabamba-Aiquile, Machacamarca-Uncla and PotosI-Sucre, although
the latter could be viable, given an increase in freight traffic
and better exploitation of tourist traffic. Retention of the re-
mainder of the system can be justified easily for foreign traffic
alone; the large increase forecast in domestic traffic rein-
forces this conclusion.

      On the basis of cost data supplied to the Study, the current
railroad rehabilitation program does not seem to be particularly
worthwhile, either with the current low volumes of traffic, or
even, in most cases, with the higher traffic volumes forecast by
the Study.    Use of a lower standard of rehabilitation than cur-
rently practiced would improve the evaluation results but, in
general, it would appear to be more economic to continue with an
unrehabilitated track and associated higher routine maintenance
costs.

     There are two factors which modify this pessimistic con-
clusion on rehabilitation.    The first is that many investments
have already been made in rehabilitation -- in equipment, ballast
production facilities, crew training, etc.     and it is possible
that the unit costs of rehabilitation supplied to the Study do




                             Rehabilitated rail track
                             Oruro - Cochabamba




                               -41-
not reflect this properly.     Secondly, although higher routine
maintenance on unrehabilitated tracks may in theory appear to be
better than rehabilitation, in practice funds for maintenance are
vulnerable to cutbacks in times of economic stringency, without
proper regard for their importance. Therefore, rehabilitation is
probably better justified than the bare facts of the economic
evaluation seem to indicate and it is tentatively recommended
that the rehabilitation program continues.      However,  it   is
recommended that the proposed fourth phase be delayed until the
period of 1984-1986, completing the third phase in the meantime,
and that no more than about 1,100 km be included in the fourth
phase in the 1980s at a cost of $b 1,000 million.    It is also
recommended that further investigation be made of rehabilitation
costs and benefits, which could change these conclusions.

     Current levels of track maintenance are too low and higher
levels of maintenance (considered as desirable in a recent study
of ENFE) are recommended on unrehabilitated lines.   Maintenance
costs are estimated as follows:

                         (thousands of 1979 pesos per km per year)

     There is much interest in ENFE in the electrification of the
Bolivian Railroad System. However, even with high future in-
creases in petroleum costs, electrification is very unlikely to
be justified in the 1980s.
     Accompanying the forecast in freight traffic,    substantial
equipment purchases are recommended in the 1980s, totalling 49
locomotives and 2,383 wagons for an estimated cost of $b 2,300
million. Purchases should be dependent on traffic growth, but
timed so that equipment shortage does not constrict growth.

     Rail passenger services are economic on the Eastern System
where road services are almost non-existent. On the Andean Sys-
tem, road services are competitive and are likely to become more
so as the paved road system is extended.  ENFE is currently gain-
ing traffic by holding fares below economic levels but this is
not in the economic interests of the Nation.   Therefore,  it is


                              -42-
recommended that fares should be revised immediately so that at
least variable costs are covered. In the long run, ENFE might
consider withdrawing from passenger services on the Andean Sys-
tem.
     The operational record of ENFE is not particularly good in
terms of equipment utilization, especially for locomotives. Im-
provements are required in equipment maintenance, spare parts ac-
quisition and employee productivity.
     Some centralization of overall ENFE functions (such as
long-term planning), is required, combined with a decentral-
ization of operational aspects.   The planning department must
acquire expertise in economic evaluation of projects~ useful
subjects for immediate study are the rehabilitation program and
the rail interconnection.
RECOMMENDATIONS ON AIR TRANSPORT
     The National Airport Administation (AASANA) administers 33
airports out of a total of over 600 airports and landing strips.
Six of the AASANA airports     have    paved   runways--La  Paz,




                          Sucre airport


Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Sucre, Tarija and Trinidad--and regular
jet passenger services are operated between them.
     Many of the other AASANA airports are in poor condition and
an Airport Rehabilitation Plan is recommended to improve runways
and terminals at 16 of these smaller airports.        This plan
(estimated to cost $b 250 million), would allow improved F27


                              -43-
turboprop operations, and also (at six of the airports) opera-
tions of the new F28 passenger jets on order by LAB. The recom-
mendations on airports are summarized in Figure 9.

     It is recommended strongly that the committed Air Navigation
and Communication Equipment Plan ($b 200 million) be implemented
with no further delay.

     There are committed projects for new airports with paved
runways at Santa Cruz (Viru-Viru), Cobija, Puerto Suarez (all in
construction) and Riberalta. Two projects for new airports at
San Borja and Santa Ana de Yacuma are no longer considered to be
committed. This is partly because estimated costs have risen 4
to 5 times since initial estimates in 1978, partly because road
construction into these regions is well underway reducing the
need for such airports, and partly because of other priorities in
the air sector.

     Other airport investments which are committed include runway
repairs at Trinidad ($b 70 million), completion of a World Bank
funded project at Tarija for $b 50 million and improvements at
Potosi ($b 50 million).     Improvements   are   recommended   at
Cochabamba (runway extension at $b 90 million) and La Paz ($b 590
million). A sum of $b 1200 millions has been allocated to Cocha-
bamba for the end of the 1980s, representing about 85 percent of
the cost of a new terminal and runway, the remaining funds to be
allocated in the 1990s. This project is said to be required for
urban safety reasons and, as such, was not evaluated by the Study
being outside the Terms of Reference.

recommended that this latter project, which would cost $b 400
million, is phased over the next ten years, with most expenditure
concentated in the next six years. Only two 40 km sections of
the Santa Cruz-Corumb§ Highway are recommended in order to start
exploiting the agricultural potential of the Tucavaca Valley.
     It is recommended that the Santa Cruz-Yacuiba road be sub-
ject to major gravelling at a cost of $b 272 million. Paving to
the standard of betterment (see "Recommendations for Improvement
and Maintenance of Existing Highways") could be justified for
sections of this road but funding is unlikely to be available.
Rehabilitation of the rail line in this corridor is not generally
recommended, although it could be worthwhile in some sections.
      It is considered that the Guayaramer!n-Porto Velho-Belem
corridor could be profitably exploited by Bolivia, particularly
for exporting cattle products from the Beni to Europe. Improve-
ments to this corridor, which lies mainly in Brazil, are
programmed, including paving of the Guajara Mirim-Porto Velho
Highway. It is recommended that Bolivia negotiate with Brazil
regarding the provision of refrigerated      container handling
facilities at Port Velho.
      Several projects proposed in Northern Argentina could be
exploited by Bolivia if completed, including a rail line from
Or an to Bermejo and various canal and river projects. None would
be worth developing for Bolivian trade alone.
     Construction   of   the   Guaqui-Desaguadero   railroad    is
recommended at a    cost of $b 186 million, timed to coincide with

completion of the Puno-Desaguadero railroad in Peru.    A design
study   is recommended immediately.     Paving   of   the     Rio
Seco-Desaguadero road is recommended to the standard of better-
ment at a cost of $b 134 million (with bridges) and encouragement
should be given to the Desaguadero-I10 and Desaguadero-Puno
highway projects in Peru.
      It is concluded that the Viacha-Arica railroad is worth
keeping in operation, but the low volumes of traffic (restricted
by Chile to 7,000 tons per month) do not justify rehabilitation
at the present time. Higher routine maintenance levels on this
railroad are recommended.   As a complementary project, major
gravelling    and bridge building is     recommended  on     the
Patacamaya-Tambo Quemado highway at a total cost of $b 121
million.
     On foreign trade by air, it is recommended that LAB expand
their international and freight services by the purchase of an
additional cargo Boeing 707. The proposal to purchase Boeing
747s for foreign trade is not recommended at the present time.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS OF TRANSPORT
      Except for the rail sector, transport operations are in the
hands of numerous small enterprises, with the state empowered to
intervene as a controlling agent.    Air passenger transport is
dominated by a single carrier, as a result of the technical dic-
tates of the mode and the need to operate internationally.    How-
ever, many small airlines have evolved to serve the air cargo
sector.
     Road transport is provided by syndicated truckers grouped
into a national confederation. Government control is exercised
by the Ministry of Transport's General Directorate of Road Trans-
port (DGTA). This agency, however, has not been given sufficient
capacity to effectively perform its function, so that real power
lies in the hands of the syndicates.         While providing an
acceptable and financially self-supporting service, truckers are
seen to engage occasionally in monopolistic practices: this
raises the question whether the current legal and organizational
framework of the road transport industry should be modified to
better serve the needs of the economy.
     Several alternatives to the existing structure of road
transport were therefore considered, ranging from complete free-
dom of competition to the nationalization of all trucking ser-
Vlces. It was concluded to stay with the existing system, at
least initially, but to strengthen substantially DGTA's capacity


                               -47-
                Truck transport of passengers and
                their cargo
as a controlling agent.     If this recommendation proves to be
ineffective, consideration should be given to the repeal of the
Supreme Decree which restricts provision of road transport to the
syndicates.
     It is recommended that a more effective system of register-
ing vehicles is initiated, which takes proper account of vehicles
going out of service. At present, it is not possible to arrive
at a credible estimate of the vehicle fleet in the nation.
     The road infrastructure is mostly provided and maintained by
the National Road Service (SNC), which has grown to over 5,000
employees. Its organization is highly centralized both with
regard to the relation between headquarters and district offices,
and with regard to the staff organization at headquarters.     To
improve SNC's effectiveness, it is proposed to give greater
decision power to the district offices and to group the eleven
existing headquarters departments into three subdirectorates.
     In the air transport sector, the recent creation of an
Aeronautics Ministry is likely to call for a reorganization of
the various entities involved. It is suggested that the National
Airport Administration be strengthened and that the various
commercial air operations be put on the same basis with regard to
such items as insurance and airport landing fees. Moreover, a
conSUltative council is recommended, which would combine repre-
sentatives of government, airport administration and air trans-
port operators.
     River transport in northern Bolivia is provided by a large
number of boat operators. Until recently, tariffs were fixed by

                              -48-
the General Directorate of the Merchant Marine (DGMM) while other
government control over river transport lay in the hands of the
Bolivian Navy.   This duplication of State functions proved to be
inefficient. On January 8, 1981, Supreme Decrees 17918 and 17919
established a new Subsecretariat of Maritime, River and Lake
Interests under the control of the Ministry of Defense. The
functions of the new subsecretariat were not fully defined at the
time of the Study but it is hoped that this change will resolve
the problem of control of river transport. The Study also pro-
poses that the maintenance and operation of the river ports of
the northern river system be delegated to the local level,
essentially to the departmental development corporations.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON FUTURE TARIFF POLICY
     The main aim of tariff policy in Bolivia should be to charge
low tariffs for infrastructure where this       might   encourage
traffic, but on no account should the tariff be less than the
marginal costs attributable to the traffic.     Where demand is
highly inelastic, it is reasonable to charge tariffs above
average costs in order to offset the deficit on other, low tariff
traffic.
     To ensure coordination    between  competing   modes,   the
difference in their tariffs should equal the difference in their
marginal costs, thereby exercising an appropriate influence on
modal choice.


                              -49-
      Railroad Tariffs - A lower tariff policy, charging somewhere
between marginal costs and the currently charged average costs,
is recommended in order to encourage fuller use of the railroad
system. Higher tariffs should be imposed on traffic insensitive
to the tariff level (principally international traffic), in order
to subsidize low tariff traffic (principally domestic traffic).
     The policy goal of ENFE earning sufficient revenues to cover
current expenditures, including the servicing of capital, should
continue. Estimates by the Study indicate that this should still
be possible, even with lower tariffs for some domestic traffic as
recommended by the Study. If it does become necessary to provide
subsidies, they should be in the form of a bonus per ton carried
of specific goods on specific routes, and similarly for pas-
sengers; or as grants for specific capital improvements.
     To carry out this tariff policy, the marketing department of
ENFE should make a complete study of demand elasticities of all
relevant commodity movements. Using the findings of this study,
ENFE should reduce tariffs for internal traffic in steps expand-
ing the fleet as necessary as soon as demands begin to approach
the capacity of available rolling stock.

     Road User Charges - These include the taxation of vehiCles
as a charge for using the roads. Marginal costs of road use in
Bolivia comprise variable road maintenance costs and the costs of
improvements associated with marginal increases in traffic. Com-
parisons of the level of direct taxes on vehicles (fuel, oil,
tires, spare parts) with marginal costs of road use by vehicle
class using 1979 values indicate that large buses and trucks cur-
rently pay substantially less than their costs, while small and
medium trucks pay appreciably more.
     However, these marginal (variable) costs are less than
one-third of total road system infrastructure costs: fixed main-
tenance costs account for about 15 percent and new construction
over 50 percent. If it is accepted that present road users
should pay for full maintenance costs and the construction costs
of new highways which reduce travel costs in corridors already
served by roads, substantial increases in road user taxation are
warranted, particularly for large trucks but also for buses. The
payment of these additional costs by road users, with minimum
deterrent effect on road use, should be achieved by increases in
purchase tax or custom duties.
     Except for special cases, such as the Autopista in La Paz,
the current Transito toll system is considered as unsuitable for
the collection of road charges.    In 1979, revenues collected
barely exceeded costs of running the toll stations. If charges

                               -50-
were to be increased sufficiently to provide a substantial in-
come, problems of control and security would increase greatly.
Also, as traffic volumes rise, the delays at transito stations
will become intolerable.    It is therefore recommended that the
system be abolished. A better use of both the stations and staff
would be for the purpose of conducting regular truck axle load
measurements, as recommended earlier in this report.
     Tariffs for Road Transport - This focuses on the question of
controlling tariffs charged by bus and truck operators.        In
Bolivia, truck operators are not permitted to expand their fleets
and by law must join syndicates.       To control the tendency of
syndicates to charge excessive tariffs, the central government
controls tariff levels.    This system eliminates free tariff
negotiation based on competition, and imposes an undesirable
rigidity and excessive uniformity of tariffs.
     Modifications in the regulatory system are proposed (see
previous section) to reduce the syndicates' monopoly power,
thereby permitting a freer tariff policy.   A system of fork
tariffs, i.e., a system where maximum and minimum tariffs are
set, should be introduced. When a state of healthy competition
is attained, the range of the fork may be widened until
eventually it becomes irrelevant.

     As roads are improved, the lower operating costs must be re-
flected in lower tariffs so that the benefits will be passed on
to consumers and full developmental potentials realized.
     While the same principles apply to buses, published fares
reflecting maximum rates must be available to passengers. Where
there is competition, a range of tariffs should be permitted,
facilitating development of different levels of service and
thereby providing passengers with more choice.

     Air Transport Char~es - Marginal costs of accommodating air
traffic tend to be much higher, relative to average costs, than
with railroads and roads.      A comparatively small volume of
traffic, in terms of passengers and freight tons, requires
improvements to the runway, airport buildings, navigational aids,
maintenance facilities, etc. Therefore, tariffs should recover
costs of operation, maintenance and routine improvements, except
at very small airports where temporary subsidies may be desirable
until traffic growth is sufficient to cover full-cost tariffs.
Such subsidies could be provided at Riberalta, Puerto Su~rez,
Apolo, Robore and San Joaquin.
     Where airports provide the only access to a region, social
subsidies are in order.     Candidates for such subsidies include

                              -51-
Cobija, Guayaramerfn, San Matias, Ixiamas, Santa Ana de Yacuma,
San Borja, San Ignacio de Velasco and Ascension de Guarayos.
      An increase of one-third in AASANA's charges would amount to
only 2 percent of airline operating costs. AASANA charges should
cover normal operating costs and service capital costs for
routine small-scale investments.     A general increase in airport
charges to generate the necessary revenues is needed and is
recommended. The increased charges should be based on a thorough
analysis of the costs of runways, aircraft servicing, air navi-
gation, passenger and freight handling       and    administration,
attributable to different classes of aircraft. Large projects,
such as the new Viru Viru airport, and economic and social sub-
sidies should corne from government treasury funds.
     Lloyd Aereo Boliviano - Each route should meet its total
annual costs including operations, depreciation and interest pay-
ments. Special fares should be introduced to even out passenger
flow during peak periods, and discount fares used to raise load
factors. LAB indicates historic tariff adjustments have resulted
in some inconsistencies~    a revised full-cost rate structure
should reflect the appropriate allocation of costs among forecast
passengers using each route. With continuing increases in fuel
and other costs, a flexible tariff policy is recommended to keep
costs and tariffs in close relationship.
     Subsidies for certain routes serving development areas or
remote communities should be designed to increase frequency of
service; they should not reflect subnormal tariffs.

PROPOSED TRANSPORT INVESTMENT PLAN
     The Investment Plan proposed by the Study brings together
all the recommendations on equipment and infrastructure presented
in this report.    It is prepared in two parts; a detailed plan
for the period 1981-1990, followed by an outline plan for the
period 1991-2000.
     All costs are quoted in 1977 pesos when $ US 1 = $b20.    Due
to inflation, the value of the peso 'has declined so that approxi-
mately $b 1 (1977) = $b 1.6 (1981). Also, the exchange rate has
changed so that in 1981, $ US 1 = $b 25.
     Transport Budgets and Previous Committments - There are two
serious constraints in preparing an investment plan. These are
first, the likely limits on funds available for transport invest-
ment and secondly, the large number of already committed trans-
port   projects.   Both these constraints are likely to        be
particularly severe in the early 1980s.

                               -52-
     Possible budgets are compared with previous commitments

The major committed expenditures are for new road projects, which
account for nearly half the total commitment. Other important
projects committing relatively large sums are the new airports at
Santa Cruz (Viru Viru      $b 1,290 million), Cobija ($b 260
million), Puerto Suarez ($b 250 million), Riberalta ($b 427
million), the railroad Yapacani-Rlo Grande ($b 550 million) and
the railroad rehabilitation program (completion of Phase III - $b
250 million).

     Committed projects will account for 38 percent of all pro-
jected transport investments in the 1980s, and for 79 percent of
transport investments in the period 1981-1983. This assumes that
the high budget will be available. If only the low budget is
available (as in 1979), then committed projects will account for
92 percent of all available funds until 1987, and many of the
"commitments" of the first three years would have to be post-
poned. These are startling figures, and indicate that the scope
for effective planning of new investments is limited, especially
in the immediate future.

     It can be argued that a number of the currently committed
projects have been chosen on weak grounds: it is difficult to
support the evaluation of the new airport at Santa Cruz (Viru
Viru); the rail line from Yapacanf to Rio Grande was never
formally evaluated (and benefits are dubious);       the   design
standards (and therefore the costs) for the La paz-Cotapata-santa
Barbara and the Quillacollo-Confital highways are probably too
high. There are those who will argue to the contrary:    who say
that such projects are essential to develop the country, and that
to build to lower standards is, in some way, inferior. The reply
must be that while funds are concentrated on a few expensive pro-
jects, with low benefits compared with costs, the transport sys-
tem in general will remain in its present primitive condition for
many more years.

     Recommended expenditures together with funds for committed
projects, take up the entire high budget, although it is unlikely
that such sums will be available. Therefore, priorities have
been specified in the event that only the medium or low budgets
are avail able.
     For rail, priority should be given to increased track
maintenance and to purchases of new equipment. The very severe
low budget would require postponement of most of the fourth phase
of the rehabilitation program, part of the Taperas-Robore recon-
struction and all new construction until the 1990s. The medium
budget would permit about two-thirds of the fourth phase of the
rehabilitation   program and most     of   the     Taperas-Robor~
reconstruction, but new projects would still have to be postponed
until the 1990s.

     Highway priorities should be for paved road rehabilitation,
upgrading of routine road maintenance and the axle load enforce-
ment program. With the very restrictive low budget, about half
the program for new projects would have to be postponed until the
1990s,    including Santa B~rbara-Bella Vista, Eteramazama-San
Ignacio, the Rio Grande bridge and much of the program for new
penetration and feeder roads.     All other projects would be de-
layed. Under the medium budget, all except Santa Barbara-Bella
Vista, Eteramazama-San Ignacio and about one-third of the new
penetration and feeder road program, could be completed in the
1980s, but later than programmed under the high budget.

      Air priorities should be for the Airport Rehabilitation Plan
and for improved maintenance. Under the low budget, the new run-
way and terminal at Cochabamba and part of the improvements at La
Paz would have to be postponed until the 1990s. Under the medium
budget, only the Cochabamba project would thus be affected,
although all other projects would be delayed until later in the
1980 s.

     For water transport, the second stage of the Paraguay River
port would have to be postponed until the 1990s under the low
budget, but it is recommended that the water investment program
remain unchanged with the medium budget.

     The Investment Program 1991-2000 - Investment limits are not
expected to be so stringent in the 1990s.   Investments by mode
have been estimated approximately as follows (although these can-
not be taken as recommendations for a period so far ahead):


              MODE          TOTAL IBYESTMENT    PERCENT

     Rail expenditures in the 1990s include the rail inter-
connection (dependent on further studies, which could also bring
the project forward to the late 1980s) at about $b 12,000
million. Road investments include 3,600 km of paving and about
1,500 km of new penetration and feeder roads.   Air investments


                               -56-
include paving at San Ignacio de Velasco, Yacuiba, San Borja and
Santa Ana de Yacuma, as well as possible airport relocations for
La Paz, Oruro, Potosi, Trinidad and Cochabamba.        The river
investments include a third stage of a Paraquay River Port and a
major expansion of the Paraguay River fleet.
     A possible transport system for the year 2000   is   shown   in
Figure 11.

CONCLUSIONS
     Likely restriction on funds for      transport   investment,
coupled with many previous commitments to transport projects,
limit the scope for planning new projects in the immediate
future. Therefore the Study's recommendations for the near
future address improvements to the existing infrastructure, and
the organization of the services using it, rather than proposals
for major new projects.      For example, the highest priority
recommendations in the highway sector are for strengthening and
rebuilding 820 km of existing paved highways and initiating a
better program of road maintenance.      There is little sense in
continuing the building of new paved highways, and then letting
them deteriorate to the point where reconstruction is required,
as has happened in the past.

     Similarly for rail, it is recommended that levels of main-
tenance be increased and that the railroad track rehabilitation
continue. Most important is the proposal for a radically new
tariff policy intended to attract more freight traffic to rail
and thereby spurring use of the existing rail lines. These lines
represent past investments which are used less than appears to be
in the national interest.

     Some entirely new projects are recommended for later in the
1980s, including a road from Cochabamba to Trinidad and a new
port in the east to give Bolivia access to the Paraguay River.
New penetration roads in the lowlands are also proposed, and
these should be built with complementary networks of feeder
roads, and match the pace of land settlements and exploitation
induced by the new road. Most infrastructure projects are for
improvements on the existing alignment, including nearly 700 km
of road betterment with paving and just over 3,600 km of major
gravelling.

     All projects recommended by the Study should be the subject
of   detailed feasibility studies,     considering   in   detail
engineering, economic and other aspects.     In addition, these


                               -57-
feasibility   studies should re-examine the      conclusions   on
inter-modal competition presented in this report, with the aim of
avoiding unnecessary duplication of facilities in the        same
corridor. This is not to say that parallel facilities should be
avoided--indeed, most corridors today contain both a railroad and
a highway, but for the most part serving different types of
traffic. However, before major improvements for one mode can be
contemplated, the capacity and performance of an existing alter-
native   mode must first be examined.       Examples   are    the
advisability of improving the Santa Cruz-Yacuiba highway parallel

to the existing railroad, and the real requirement for a rail
interconnection in a corridor already served by one paved road,
and shortly to be provided with another (with the construction of
the Chimore-Yapacanf project).
      More new projects are envisaged for the 1990s, when the
country's economy is expected to permit a higher level of infra-
structure investment. The largest among these would be the rail
interconnection Santa Cruz-Cochabamba;    however, the justifica-
tion of that project has yet to be established. In addition, an
extensive system of paved highways should be in place by the end
of this century, reaching some of the currently more isolated
parts    of the country, including     Yacuiba,   Trinidad    and
Guayaramerin.

     Some restructuring is recommended     for   all   the   main
organizations concerned with transport infrastructure and ser-
vices, including ENFE, SNC and the organizations charged with the
control of water transport. Also, it is proposed to strengthen
the Ministry of Transport's General Directorate of Road Transport

      The recommendations made by this Study are the result of a
massive analytical effort, using criteria of economic evaluation.
However, the proposed transport plan will require updating in the
future, as unforeseen developments take place or as the nation's
priorities change. Transport planning is a continuing process
which has been launched with this Study. To reap the full bene-
fit from the investment made the Study, the continuing transport
planning process must now be firmly established.
     To achieve this, the creation of a National Transport Center
has been proposed as an autonomous agency under the Ministry of
Transport. Its staff would largely consist of this Study's
counterpart team who have now acquired knowledge of the tech-
niques   of comprehensive transport planning.      It would    be
unfortunate indeed if this accumulated knowledge were dispersed
and thereby lost.
     The function of the Center would be to act as an advisory
group to the Government with regard to overall transport policy.
It would also act as a body coordinating the implementation of
the transport plan.    This latter function has already been
defined under Phase II of the National Transport Study which is
planned to commence upon completion of this report.
