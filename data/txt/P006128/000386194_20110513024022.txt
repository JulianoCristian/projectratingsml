   Gentlemen:

      Wilbur Smith and Associates is pleased to submit this Final Report of Phase I of the
   Bolivia National Transport Study.          The Report is in five volumes.          Volumes I and II review
   the existing situation and present the main analyses, findings and recommendations.                      Volumes
   III and IV contain supplementary appendices and the fifth volume is a summary of the Report.

      The Report represents the conclusion of over two years effort by a professional team made
   up of consultant's staff and Bolivian nationals.              During the course of the Study, several
   interim reports and technical papers were produced, culminating in a draft Final Report in
   November, 1980.       The first review period was concluded in December with the final meeting
   of the Study Steering Committee, when all initial comments on the draft report were pre-
   sented by Bolivian entities and by the World Bank.              A more lengthy review and discussion
   period followed in which additional valuable contributions were made to the Final Report.

      The Report presents and supports a recommended National Transport Plan set in the con-
   text of the expected development of the Bolivian economy over the next ten years, and with
   consideration for possible developments in the following ten years.                  It is not intended
   that the recommendations be taken as a fixed plan; forecasting the future is a hazardous
   task, and it is impossible to foresee all possible developments.                 Therefore, it is strongly
   recommended that the Government set up a permanent transport planning group, utilizing the
   Bolivian counterpart team involved in this Study,to monitor developments and adapt the Plan
   to changing circumstances.        The first steps have been taken in this direction by selecting
  a counterpart team for Phase II of this Study.              Hopefully, this will form a solid basis for
   the continuing transport planning process, and for a permanent National Transport Center.

      The cooperation and assistance we received throughout the Study from officers of the
  Government and others concerned with transport in Bolivia, is gratefully acknowledged.                        We
  also wish to recognize the contributions made by our colleagues on the national counter-
  part team, and by our local associate consultants, CONSA SRL and ECOVIANA SRL.                      We appreci-
  ate the opportunity to have participated in the study effort, and look forward to the imp-
   lementation of the recommendations.

       DEFINITION OF ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS

     To foresee future transport needs, it is necessary to have
a clear idea about the future characteristics of the country's
economy, including its population distribution, agricultural
and industrial development. As no physical development plan
currently exists for Bolivia, the Study had to make its own
predictions of possible ways in which the economy might
develop. This has been discussed in Working Paper 46a, from which
some excerpts are repeated in the following pages.


Method of Formulating Development Patterns
      Given the generous provision of natural resources and
the relatively small supply of labor and capital, Bolivia can-
not expect to develop all her resources within the next twenty
years (1). Somehow a choice has to be made, and will be made,
between the numerous opportunities competing for investment
and manpower. A pattern of development will emerge, but what
it will be is difficult to predict. It will result from
political and ~conomic pressures. It will reflect the judge-
ment and speculations of the day. It will not necessarily be
rational nor, in retrospect, commendable. New mineral deposits
mayor may not be found. The decision to go ahead with either
mineral or agricultural projects may hinge on world prices at
the time and on market forecasts that could easily go astray.
     Hence it would be unrealistic, and more so in Bolivia
than in most countries, to expect to identify a future develop-
ment pattern that was logical, optimal or probable. In reali-
ty there are many possible development projects, which could
occur in anyone of innumerable permutations and combinations.
Development "strategies" can be conceived based on broad prin-
ciples and philosophies, but there is no reason to believe
that any such strategy will be adopted and consistently fol-
lowed.

     In the shorter run, to 1989, many developments are al-
ready committed or being planned. The range of possibility
is limited by the time and investment available. Economic
growth in the early 1980s is expected to be restricted by the
international recession and by Bolivia's external debt. It
is therefore not too difficult to predict the development pat-
tern in 1989. There is not much danger of being wildly wrong.
     In 1999, the three development patterns were chosen to
reflect some broad differences of scale and direction of de-
velopment. The size of the gross domestic product (GDP) is
as unpredictable as its distribution. Hence a range of GDP
assumptions was incorporated in the alternative patterns:
Alternative C was given the official (Central Bank) assumption
of GDP, Alternative A 10 percent lower and Alternative D 20
percent higher.
     A second element of variation was the emphasis on pri-
mary or secondary production. This was related to the dif-
ferences in GDP because secondary industrial development,
i.e. manufacturing, is generally the more capital-intensive.
Therefore Alternative A has a greater emphasis on the develop-
ment of primary production in the form of agriculture and min-
ing, Alternative C introduces greater industrial investment
and Alternative D takes it much further still.
     The third principal contrast is in regional distribution.
Alternative A represents a continuation of recent trends,
with growth concentrated heavily in a few areas. Alternative
C incorporates more regional development intended to spread
economic prosperity more evenly between different parts of
the country. Alternative D contains the same regional develop-
ment projects but, having a much greater GDP, concentrates its
additional product in an industrial axis from La Paz through
Cochabamba and Santa Cruz to Mutun.
     In order to help formulate these development patterns, a
thorough search was made for all development projects being
considered or suggested, however tentatively, throughout the
country. The most important of these are described in another
document (2) 1 they formed the raw material from which the pat-
terns were made. The way in which the selected development
projects were incorporated into the zonal projections of socio-
economic variables is described in Working Paper 49 (3).

The 1989 Development Pattern
      Numerous developments are currently in progress or are
strongly committed. They will absorb much of the development
potential until 1989 and therefore enable one to predict fair-
ly well the scale and nature of economic development in 1989.
As shown in Figure 7B-1,&me 44 major projects were included, of
which 18 were agricultural. Schemes to be completed by 1989
are located at San Ignacio de Velasco, San Javier, Valles Me-
sot~rmicos, Ulla-Ulla, Ingavi, Chimor~, Challapata and Alto
Beni. Other agricultural projects due to be underway but not
completed by 1989 are at Abap6-Izozog, Gran Chaco, Misicuni,
Rurrenabaque - San Buenaventura, Villamontes, San Jacinto and
Tucavaca. Agricultural projects tend to take a very long time
to implement fully and many of these projects will continue
their development right through the 1990s, especially those
involving the construction of dams. Apart from major defin-
able projects, there are numerous areas where agriculture is
steadily expanding and will probably continue to do so. Most
important is the cattle development in the Beni, the cultiva-
tion of various foodstuffs in the Yungas and Valleys to feed
the growing populations of La Paz and Cochabamba, the expan-
sion of corn, sugar and horticultural production around Santa
Cruz, and the prqduction of a wide variety of fruits in Tarija.
     In the mining sector there are 12 major projects of which
8 should be completed by 1989, at Catavi, Centenario, Relaves
El Kenko, Integral Bolivar,Colquiri, Sud Lipez, La Palca and
Machacamarca. The development of MutGn is important.
     There are also 14 major industrial projects, including
the automobile project at Cochabamba, which will continue in-
to the 1990s, cement plants in Oruro, east Santa Cruz and Ta-
rija, paper factories in Santa Cruz and Tarija, steel in San-
ta Cruz, textile and glass factories, and plants for the pro-
duction of vegetable oil and processed fruit. Most important
is the development of natural gas for export, on which the
growth of the whole economy depends.
      In addition to these major projects, which have been
taken into account individually in the formulation of the de-
velopment pattern, there will of course be innumerable smaller
developments, which have been predicted in a more aggregated
way. A prime objective in this work was to produce a detailed
socio-economic forecast, zone by zone, consistent both with the
macro-economic predictions, especially the GDP prediction of
117,500 million pesos (1977 pesos), and with the major develop-
ment projects that will contribute towards those predictions.

DEVELOPMENT                                                 PATTERN 1989
                                                                                                 FIGURE                78-1
1999 Development Pattern A
     The first of the three patterns is pessimistic about
economic growth. GDP at 181,300 million pesos (1977) repre-
sents a growth of 54.3 percent since 1989, which is only
15.4 percent per head. This relatively low growth is partly
the result of low investment and it also limits the amount
available for future investment, which in 1999 is estimated
at 36,300 million pesos.
     Major projects, shown in Figure 7B-2, are largely in the
agricultural sector with the continuation of the Abap6-Izozog,
Gran Chaco, Misicuni, San Buenaventura, Villamontes, San Ja-
cinto and Tucavaca developments. No major new agricultural
projects are included.
     Mining developments continue at Uyuni, Farellones -
Kellwani and El Rodeo butnot much expansion at Mutdn is fore-
seen in this Alternative.
      Little industrial investment is included. The major pro-
jects are continuations from 1989, namely the automobile pro-
ject, the Karachipampa chemical complex and the Aquila che-
mical works. In the all-important field of hydrocarbons a
considerable increase in gas production is foreseen, while pe-
troleum output declines.
     The lack of major projects in this alternative means that
much of the economic growth, such as it is, consists ·of small
unidentifiable developments in all three sectors, agriculture,
mining and industry. A general growth of production is in-
corporated, consistent with the macro-economic predictions.
Because of the low growth in income per head, there is neces-
sarily an emphasis on agricultural development.
     This development pattern does not reflect eith~r the
hopes or the expectations of the Study. It is a pessi~i8tic
view of the future containing a slow and unenterprising ex-
ploitation of the country's resources. It represents the
minimum conceivable demand for transport facilities in 1999.
1999 Development Pattern B/c
     As already stated, the pattern initially put forward as
B differed so little from that produced independently as C
that the two were merged into one and can be called Alternative
C. This is the most important of the alternatives because it
conforms with the Central Bank macro-economic predictions and
can be regarded as the most likely or most feasible pattern
of the future.


                         -292-
      Alternative C assumes that by 1989 the Government will
be organized to make rational economic decisions to promote
                                                                              '.
production in certain industries, particularly those utiliz-
ing national resources such as agriculture, livestock, minerals
and hydrocarbons, and that productive resources will be better
distributed to permit a high level of employment. Various re-
gions, e.g. Abap6-Izozog, Chan~-Pira!, Villamontes, San Julian
and North La Paz, have been selected for agricultural develop-
ment.
     Developing countries have intensified their search for
                                                                              "I
solutions to their economic and social handicaps, recognizing
that this is a common problem for the whole international com-
munity. Variou~ conferences, in Bandung, Belgrade, Cairo,
Lusaka, Algiers and Lima, have gradually developed a doctrine
based on general standards that could underpin a just and
equitable international economic order. In 1974, the United
Nations General Assembly approved the Charter of Economic
Rights and Duties of Nations. In 1975, Bolivia was a signatory
to the International Strategy for Industrial Development which
took as its starting pOint the pattern and structure of inter-
national trade. This resulted in the Action ,Plan of Lima
which presented a series of agreed measures, at national, sub-
regional and international level. Of interest in the present
context was the formulation of a long-term plan for the pro-
motion of trade between developing countries, trade agree-
ments with industrialized countries, and economic harmoniza-
tion, especially in the industrial field, backed up by con-
crete measures and effective national bodies to evaluate, re-
fine and execute the plan.
     In the case of Bolivia, economic harmonization and inter-
national agreements must follow a path of negotiation proceed-
ing from the national level to that of the Andean Group, then
to the Free Trade Association of Latin America (4). and,' fin~lly to
the rest of the Third ~7orld. The UNIDO is making various
studies to implement the Lima agreements and to identify, by
studying a large sample of countries, typical growth paths
and the sort of changes, and their pace, that occur in the
structure of industry. Messrs. Singer, Tinberger and Vaitsos
have studied the Lima initiatives (5) and the UNIDO has de-
veloped a model of world industrial cooperation which will
lead to a regional model called LIDO (Lima Industrial Develop-
ment Objective) designed to evolve and evaluate schemes for
realizing the Lima objectives.

     Alternative C rests on the Lima objective of accelerat-
ing industrial growth in order to improve the pattern of in-
ternational trade. This in turn implies a reconsideration of
the policy of the Andean Group which was the outcome of a
narrower set of intentions. The broad lines of Alternative C
may be expressed as follows:
     (a)   State control of natural resources, and their
           exploitation in order to achieve industrializa-
           tion;
     (b)   Strengthening of trade programs, with complementary
           agreements within the Andean Group and LAFTA;
     (c)   Large-scale promotion of farming in order to pro-
           vide employment;
     (d)   Creation of steel, petrochemical and engineering
           industries to reduce the need for imports;
     (e)   Exploitation of the potential value of natural re-
           sources, especially agriculture, by development of
           associated processing industries;
     (f)   Establishment within the Andean Group of engineer-
           ing, electrical and chemical industries and expan-
           sion of the range of manufactures for mass consump-
           tion such as foodstuffs, construction materials,
           textiles, leather and other light manufactures;
     (g)   Incentives for small businesses and craft trades;
     (h)   Establishment of negotiating machinery for questions
           of foreign trade.
      The development projects in Pattern C were selected in
accordance with the above objectives and are shown in Figure
78-3. In addition to these major, identified projects, there
are many smaller ones that should conform to the same stra-
tegy, which may be summarized as follows:
     (a)   The exploitation of land, forest and mineral de-
           posits under State control should avoid unreasonable
           deterioration and rapid depletion. A degree of in-
           dustrial processing before exporting is highly de-
           sirable; therefore the mineral smelting projects
           are included, as also the plans for steel and pe-
           trochemical industries.



                         -294-
     (b)   Settlement in selected colonization areas should
           be accelerated under a planned program for produc-
           tion of foodstuffs suitable for industrial proces-
           sing, preferably cereals and others now being im-
           ported.

     (c)   Industries should be set up to exploit the output
           of meat, timber, citrus fruits and milk, including
           small workshops and craft industries.

     (d)   The steel program should be initiated on a reduced
           scale, using iron from Mutun and setting up forging,
           smelting and metal engineering plants.

     (e)   As a multinational operation, the petrochemical
           industry should be an important step toward the es-
           tablishment of basic industries.

     (f)   Development of potential mineral resources, par-
           ticularly in the Precambri'an area, should merit
           priority.

     Alternative C comprises all the major projects in Alter-
                                                                  'I
native A plus some important additions; the Rositas, Pilcoma-
yo and Bala agricultural projects are included. Mineral de-
velopment at Playa Verde and in the Precambrico are included
and output from Mutun is expanded.  In. the industrial sector,
the major additions are the petrochemical, fertilizer, steel
and palm oil plants.  In addition there is generally higher
output from most sectors of production, especially industrial
sectors and natural gas.

1999 Development Pattern D

     The main purpose of Pattern D was to explore the impli-
cations of a much faster rate of growth.  Income per head         .,.
rises between 1989 and 1999 by 53.7 percent, compared with 28
percent in C and only 15.4 percent in A.  The higher national
product implies higher output in most industries but especial-
ly in gas, processed food, building materials and non-ferrous
metals, for domestic consumption, and in export industries
such as meat, other animal products, non-ferrous minerals,
iron and timber.

     The broad strategy in Alternative D is the same as in C
but the pace is faster and hence the emphasiS on the industrial
axis between La Paz and Mutun is greater.  Rising incomes lead
to a much faster growth of demand for manufactures than for
food, and especially for better housing and for transport.

  DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS CaadD (1999'
UAL,.~-J..A~l#j            FIGURE 78-3
This high rate of economic growth is hardly feasible unless
a much bigger share of industrial demand is met domestically:
hence the emphasis on industrial development.
     No new major projects are added to this pattern, not be-
cause there would not be any but because they have not yet
been conceived. As is detailed in Working Paper 49, major
expansion of numerous industries is involved but individual
development projects, additional to those already incorporated
in Alternative C, have not been identified.
     A big growth in meat output and export from the Beni is
assumed, together with other animal products. Wheat output
from Tucavaca eliminates imports of this cereal. In the
mineral sector there is a major development of Mutan and in
the output of building materials, also of non-metallic min-
erals. In the industrial sector there is general growth but
especially in flour and grain products, wood and wood pro-
ducts, chemicals, manufactured building materials and cement,
steel and fabricated metals, and - though still on a small
scale - in vehicles and machinery.
     To make this pattern feasible, major expansion of exports
is assumed in meat, animal products and timber through the
Amazon, in minerals, iron pellets and chemical down the Rio
Paraguay, and in processed foodstuffs~

     FORECAST AND DISTRIBUTION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC VARIABLES

Introduction
     The demand for and use of transportation facilities are
directly related to levels of social and economic activity.
For the purposes of a transport study, many of these activities
are numerically represented by a few socio-economic variables.
The selection of these variables depends on the characteristics
of the study area and the availability of current and historic
data. The following variables were selected for detailed
quantification and are discussed in this Appendix:
     Total population
     Dispersed population
     Economically active population
     GDP per head
     Goods production
     Goods consumption.
     These variables were estimated first for 1977 and then
projected to the 1989 and 1999 target years. The national
projections for the six variables are given in Table 7C-1 and
discussed in detail in Working Paper 41. The variables are
used in the traffic generation and distribution models and
must therefore be estimated for each of the 77 analysis
zones adopted by the Study for each of the years under
consideration.
     These projections reflect a trend forecast of the
future development of the country.     As discussed in
the preceding Appendix,   several   development patterns were
formulated in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of transport
needs to the way in which the economy is developed. These
alternatives, A, C and D, only apply to 1999. One development
pattern was considered adequate for 1989. The socio-economic
variables for 1999 were altered to reflect the differences in
the four development patterns.
      To facilitate presentation of the data, the 77 zones were
aggregated to 20 districts. These districts, as shown in Figure
7C-1 conform to Department boundaries with the exception of
District 1, where the Beni Province of Vaca Diez was combined
with the Pando Department. The zonal distribution of the
variables is provided in a series of computer printouts
included in Appendix 7D.

OJSTRICTS        USED IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC
                  ANALYSIS    FIGURE 7C-1
     The following sections discuss the methodology, the
assumptions and the data sources. As a working device, a trend
projection was made first, which was then modified to reflect
the alternative development patterns. The projection of population
and income will be described first, followed by a detailed discus-
sion of the forecasts of goods production and consumption.


Trend Projection of Population and Income Distribution

      The socio-economic variables were developed for each of
the 77 zones and 20 districts for 1977 and estimated on a trend
basis for 1989 and 1999. This trend distribution provides the
base on which specific development projects or other features
are later superimposed to give the required developrrent patterns. Where no
specific developrrent projects are required, the trend projections remain unchanged.

     Population Distribution - Population by province was
available from the 1950 and 1976 censuses and was aggregated
to the corresponding study zones and districts.  The 1977
zonal population was estimated by uniformly applying a factor
of 1.109 to the 1976 zonal population.  This factor was derived
from the difference between the results of the 1976 census
(4,647,800) and the 1977 population estimate adopted for the
Study (5,155,600). (1)

     The 1989 and 1999 populations by zone were projected at
the annual rate of growth in each zone between 1950 and 1977.
The zonal data were adjusted to conform to the 1989 and 1999
national totals of 7,164,800 and 9,576,800 respectively.  The
percentage increase in district population during the 1977 -
1999 period varies from a low of 23.3 percent in District 2,
northern La Paz Department, to 275.2 percent in District 11,
which contains the city of Santa Cruz and adjacent rural
areas. With few exceptions, the area east of the Cordillera
Real exhibits a higher rate of growth than the western portion.
The population of Bolivia as a whole is projected to increase
by 85.8 percent during this period, i.e. 2.85 percent per year.
The 1977, 1989 and 1999 populations are summarized by district
in Table 7c-2.

     Dispersed Population - The demand per capita for most
goods and services is generally lower in rural than in urban
areas because of the dispersed nature of the population, lower
cash incomes and lack of infrastructure (transport, electricity,
etc.).  To reflect this situation, the dispersed population
was estimated for 1977 and projected to 1989 and 1999 on a
trend basis by district and zone.  The dispersed population

for each department.  (2)

     The 1976 dispersed population was obtained directly from
census data and aggregated to the zone and district level. The
factor of 1.109 was applied to the 1976 data to obtain the 1977
dispersed population.

     It was assumed that between 1977 and 1999 the dispersed
population would decrease by 13.2 percent, i.e. an average of
0.57 percent per year. This was based on the decrease in rural
population shown by the 1950 and 1976 censuses. The definition
of rural population includes both dispersed population and
inhabitants of villages containing 2,000 persons or less.
Rural population is therefore slightly higher than dispersed
population (57.9 percent of the population as against 49.6
percent).

     From the results of the two censuses it was estimated
that although the dispersed population would increase, it would
fall as a percentage of total population from 49.6 percent in
1977 to 42.4 percent in 1989 and 36.4 percent in 1999. The
dispersed population is summarized by district in Table 7C-3 for
the target ~ears.  District 19, in southern Chuquisaca Depart-
ment, conta~ns the highest percentage of'dispersed population,
while District 4 which includes the city of La Paz, has the
lowest.

     Economically Active Population - The analysis of economically
active population is based on 1976 census data, which were
extracted from computer tapes and aggregated to zones and
districts, initially for five categories of activities -
agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transport and communications,
and others. The 1976 economically active, excluding unemployed
and persons looking for work for the first time, totalled
1,494,900 persons which provides a participation rate of 32.2
percent.   This is somewhat lower than expected. The number is
believed to exclude family members who work but are not paid
wages.   This definition would probably affect the agricultural
sector most.

     The census provides the only source of economically active
population by geographic area and is considered adequate for
study purposes. However, because of the relatively low
participation rate of 32.2 percent, this rate was increased to
33.5 percent in 1989 and 35.0 percent in 1999.

     The 1976 economically active population in each zone,
was increased by a factor of 1.1105 to correspond to the 1977
population.  It was concluded at this time that a single
category of economically active would be adequate for modelling
purposes and the five economic sectors were combined to provide
the total for each zone and district.

     In order to obtain a zonal estimate of 1989 economically
active, the 1977 participation rate was multiplied by a
constant factor and this result was then multiplied by the
1989 population in each zone. The same procedure was utilized
to obtain the 1999 economically active population. A factor
of 1.04037 was used_n 1989 and 1.044 used in 1999. The
constant factor was calculated by dividing the 1989 participation
rate (33.5) by the 1977 participation rate (32.2). The 1999
factor was obtained by dividing the 1999 participation rate
(35.0) by the 1989 rate (33.5).  Zonal totals were adjusted
manually to conform to the established control totals of
1,660,130 in 1977, 2,401,400 in 1989 and 3,354,130 in 1999.
The economically active populations and corresponding partici-
pation rates are summarized by district in Table 7C-4.


     Income - Little detailed information was found regarding
income by geographic subarea. The 1976 census did not provide
this type of information. For transport modelling it is
necessary to provide a measure of income for both dispersed
and non-dispersed population in each district and zone.
Theoretically, the measure of income could be in several forms,
such as household, family or per capita and further refined in
such forms as gross and net, or disposable income.  In lieu of
a direct income measure, Gross Domestic Product (GDP or PIB)
was utilized.

     Past trends and future projections of GDP were made
available by Banco Central (3).  In addition, the Ministry of
Planning and Coordination had previously estimated GDP by
department by major economic sector (4). Because of the lack
of other definitive income data, per capita GDP was selected
as the measure of income.

     As an initial step, it was necessary to estimate base year
and future year per capita income for both dispersed and non-
dispersed population. The Banco Central estimates of GDP were
converted to 1977 Bolivian pesos and the per capita GDP
computed for the base and the two future years. A previous
study (5) has estimated the ratio of urban to rural income for
the years 1958 through 1969 with the ratio varying from 6.64 in

in 1962 to 8.50 in 1969. As a result of discussions with local
staff, familiar with agricultural conditions in Bolivia, it is
believed that the urban/rural income ratio has been decreasing
and will continue to do so. This is largely a statistical
consequence of poor rural inhabitants migrating to the towns.
Therefore, a ratio of 7.0 was selected for 1977 decreasing to
5.8 in 1989 and 4.5 in 1999. Given estimates of GDP and the
above urban/rural income ratios, the national averages were
as shown in Table 7C-5.The per capita income values do not
include the value of subsistence crops.
     The following equation was used to calculate the per capita
GDP of the dispersed and non-dispersed population:
        RP x RI + UP x RI x F              T
                              T
        Thus RI = RP + F x UP

        and UI   =   F x RI
        Where:
        F = Ratio of non-dispersed to dispersed income
        UP = Proportion of non-dispersed population
        RP = Proportion of dispersed population
        UI = Non-dispersed population GDP
        RI = Dispersed population GDP
        R = Average national GDP.
     Per capita GDP was estimated for each zone by subjectively
assigning a relative ranking to the dispersed and non-dispersed
categories. The control total for the country was equated to
1.00 and each zone was ranked in relation to this. As a check
on the control income, a weighted average of the zones within
a district was calculated and then a weighted average of the
districts calculated and compared with the control total. The
following example using hypothetical zones and districts
illustrates this process. A control mean per capita GDP of
$b. 5,000 is used.

     The district per capita GDP is the weighted average
multiplied by the income control total.  In the example, for
District 1 it is obtained by dividing 9,050 by 10,000 which
gives the RMI of .91. The RMI (.91) is multiplied by the
control income (Sb. 5,000) resulting in the district mean per
capita GDP (Sb. 4,550).  If the weighted average of the
districts does not approximate an RMI of 1.00, the zonal
figures must be adjusted to obtain balance.

     The future year per capita GDP was estimated by adjusting
the RMI for each zone. The adjustment was made according to
judgement on whether the zone would remain the same, increase
or decrease in per capita GDP relative to the country as a
whole. The same process was used in estimating per capita
GDP of dispersed and non-dispersed population. The gross
per capita GDP is given by district in Table 7C-6 for the base
and target years.

Goods Consumption and Supply/Demand

     Initially, indications of the consumption of movable
goods are derived as a residual, from the equation:

              C   =   P + M- E
     Where:

              C   Consumption, defined to include all domestic
                  use of goods both in intermediate and final
                  demand
              P = Domestic production of goods
              M = Import of goods
              E = Export of goods.

      In this manner estimates of goods consumption were
derived for 1977. For the projections of goods consumption,
however, it was found advisable first to identify that portion
of each class of commodity which is attributable to intermediate
demand, i.e., is used in one or more stages of production, not
only of goods but also of services, and that which is
attributable to domestic final demand in its several forms,
namely, personal consumption, government consumption, fixed
capital formation and net inventory change.   Intermediate and
final goods consumption were then extrapolated separately to
the target years on the basis of projected measures of the
factors that approximate the demand, and the results were then
introduced into the supply/demand equations to evaluate the
impact on the other three elements as defined above.   It was
then a matter of judgement to determine where adjustments
should be made to satisfy the supply/demand equation while

still ensuring that the sum of the separate components equalled
the control totals developed in the projections of gross
domestic product. Because of this inter-relationship, it is
preferable to discuss consumption in this separate section
where it can be related to the supply/demand equation. Also,
it is desirable at this point to present the greatest disaggre-
gation of commodity classes used in the socio-economic analysis,
which heretofore have been more aggregated to facilitate
presentation.
     Initially, the commodity classification consisted of 56
classes, 18 in agriculture and forestry, 11 in mining and 27
in manufacturing. For modelling purposes, the 56 commodity
classes could be combined to 39 categories.
      Because of the number of commodity classes involved, the
explanation of estimates and projections of goods consumption
will be presented in four groups, Le., agriculture, hydrocarbons,
mining and manufacturing. Details by zone are given in the Appendix.
     Agricultural Supply/Demand - The output of agricultural
activity consists of crops, livestock products and forestry
products.
     Crops now account for 95 percent of agricultural output
and are expected to maintain this percentage. Crops also
account for 95 percent of agricultural consumption. The
current supply/demand patterns for the 12 classes of
agricultural product and the projections to 1989 and 1999 are
given in Appendix 7D. The classifications are as follows:
     1.   Live animals           7.    Other cereals
     2.   Meat and fish          8.    Potatoes and other tubers
     3.   Other animal products 9.     Fruit
     4.   Maize                 10.    Vegetables and plants
     5.   Rice                  11.    Sugar cane
     6.   Wheat                 12.    Other agricultural including
                                       industrial crops and fodder.
     The consumption of industrial crops including sugar cane
is accounted for entirely by intermediate demand, since by
definition they all require some industrial processing. Crops
of this nature, which include coffee and cacao beans, soya and
other vegetable products used to produce edible oils and meals,
either for human or animal consumption, and cotton fiber,
accounted for 55 percent of total crop production in 1977, due
primarily to the bulkiness of sugar cane production. Projections
of the consumption of industrial crops, because of their nature,
were derived on the basis of projected production of refined
sugar, for sugar cane, and of other food and textiles for the
other industrial crops.

                               -317-
     The consumption of cereals, except corn, tends to be
primarily accounted for by intermediate demand, since some
milling is usually required to obtain a product suitable for
human consumption. It was estimated, however, that slightly
more than a tenth of cereal output, excluding corn, is milled
rudimentarily by the consumer and thus is accounted for by
final demand. In the case of corn, much is consumed as a
vegetable or milled by the consumer. In any event, since the
milled product is ultimately accounted for by final demand,
consumption of cereals was directly related to population
trends.                                                            •
     Between 1968 and 1977, the consumption of marketed cereals
has remained unchanged at 146 kilograms per capita. Wheat and
rice consumption per capita increased from 20 and 16 kilos
per capita respectively, in 1968, to 35 and 19 kilos in 1977,
while the consumption of corn of both varieties declined from
99 to 78 kilos and that of other cereals remained constant at
14 kilos. Because wheat consumption will still require imports
in the future, it was assumed that its per capita consumption
will remain at 35 kilos. The consumption per capita of other
cereals was also assumed to continue unchanged. It was further     •
assumed that the decline in corn consumption will continue,
as will the growth in that of rice, but that the net effect will
be no change in the total cereal consumption of 150 kilos per
capita. Therefore, by 1999, corn consumption per capita is
expected to fall to 57 kilos while rice consumption rises to
43 kilos.
     Most of the supply of potatoes and other tubers, and
the wide variety of other vegetables and fruit, either grown
in Bolivi~ or imported is accounted for by final demand since      •
these crops do not require industrial processing. A proportion
estimated at between 15 and 30 percent of the crop is, however,
accounted for by intermediate demand for canning and preserving.
The drying and dehydrating of potatoes typical of the Altiplano
culture in Bolivia represents a final demand. The ultimate
consumption of these crops is related to population, and
consumption projections were derived from per capita trends.
     Tuber consumption per capita has declined from 210 kilos
in 1968 to 203 kilos in 1977. It was assumed that this
consumption would stabilize at 200 kilos in 1989 and 1999.
The consumption of other vegetables declined from 50 to 38
kilos over the 1968-1977 period and it was assumed that this
consumption would stabilize at 40 kilos per capita in the
target years. On the other hand, fruit consumption per
capita rose from 120 kilos to 132 kilos and it was assumed it
would remain at about this level in the future.

                         -318-
     Application of the above assumptions to the projections
of population and industrial output, as appropriate, result
in the projected consumption reported in Ap'pendix 7D. Domestic
crop production is likely to exceed projected consumption
requirements, if recent trends continue, except for wheat,
which will continue to require imports, and fodder, which is
likely to equal demand.
     Livestock products represent 3 percent of agricultural
output in terms of tonnage both produced and consumed, and
are expected to remain at about this level. The current
consumption of meat and fish is 28 kilos per capita. A
special analysis of meat consumption performed in the Study
indicates that meat consumption per capita will increase to
30 kilos by 1989 and 34 kilos by 1999. Aside from livestock
imported for breeding purposes, it is anticipated that all
meat production, to satisfy projected consumption, will
originate from domestic livestock raising. The increased
number of livestock will require more intensive grazing on
existing pastures as well as extension of land devoted to
grazing. A special analysis indicates sufficient potential
to meet the anticipated demand.
     At present, a large quantity of the skins and wool
produced when livestock are slaughtered is discarded. It is
assumed that better methods of recuperation will be adopted
when planned improvements are made in 5laughtering facilities,
particularly in the Beni, to give greater utilization of skins
and wool.                    '.
     Hydrocarbons - This group consists of commodity classes
13-17.  Projections for classes 13, oil, and 14, natural gas,
are taken from Working Paper 41 where they were considered in
some detail.
     Class 15 is bottled gas which does not lend itself to
importation or exportation. Domestic consumption is expected
to rise rapidly.
     Class 16 is oil and lubricants which are largely related
to the use of motor vehicles. Consumption is projected to
rise at 8 percent a year, requiring an increase in refinery
capacity if imports are to be avoided. It is assumed that
by 1999 about a quarter of requirements will in fact be
imported.
     Class 17 consists of refined products in the form of
gasoline, diesel, aviation, kerosene and fuel oil. Large
increases in consumption are inevitable from the transport
industries but kerosene and fuel oil will be largely replaced
by natural gas. Nevertheless some continuing consumption of
the latter is likely.

                          -319-
     The projections of production and consumption of the
hydrocarbon commodities are shown in Appendix 70.
     Solid Minerals SU     Demand - Various types of metallic
minerals and a ew non-metallic minerals, of which crude
sulphur is the most important, presently form the principal
source of Bolivia's export earnings. About 81 percent of the
output of this mining activity is exported.
     Obviously, all domestic consumption of minerals is
accounted for by intermediate demand, in effect, the input          "
requirements of existing and planned smelters and blast
furnaces. The national smelting company, Empresa Nacional
de Fundiciones (ENAF), has informed the Study of the production
planned at its two major smelters, Vinto, in the Department of
Oruro and Karachipampa, in the Department of Potos!, through
1984. (6) It is assumed that the same volume of tin and
antimony, at Vinto, and lead, silver, zinc, antimony, tin,
copper and bismuth, at Karachipampa, will be produced in 1989.
For 1999 it is assumed that for metals currently smelted such
as tin and antimony, the 1989-1999 rate of growth will be
half that of 1977-1989, following ENAF's projections for 1984.
A growth rate slightly higher than the projected rate for
antimony smelting was postulated for the new metals to be
smelted, lead, silver, zinc, tin and copper. The results of
these assumptions for solid mineral extraction and domestic
consumption are shown in Ap~ix7D.The categories included
in this table are as follows:
                18.   Iron ore
                19.   Non-ferrous metallic minerals
                20.   Non-metallic minerals
                30.   Sand and aggregates
                31.   Lime and gypsum.
     Similar projections of future operations were not available
from the national steel company, Empresa Siderurgica Boliviana,
S.A. (SIDERSA). Iron ore production at Mutun was therefdre set
at levels to satisfy a very modest export program (7). A more
vigorous expansion of non-metallic minerals such as crude

      tons of iron ore from Mutun by 1985 compared to 95,000 and

     Lime and gypsum and other lower grade minerals (primarily
sand and clay, but also including small amounts of salt) are
presently not exported due mainly to the high transport costs.
No information was found on the production of these commodities.
It was therefore necessary to estimate the minimum output
produced from the input requirements of the cement, other
building materials (mainly bricks and tiles) and primary non-
ferrous industries as reported by INE (8).

     In the case of lime input for the cement and primary non-
ferrous industries, the INE data probably refers to crushed
lime, not the tonnage of crude limestone quarried to produce
crushed lime. Since the crushing usually occurs at the quarry,
movement of the limestone in interzonal transport is probably
not involved. However, limestone may be used in construction
and, to the extent that this occurs in Bolivia, the estimates
of lower grade minerals are understated, since no quarry
output of dimension stone for construction is included, due
to lack of information.

     Likewise, sand, gravel and crush stone used as aggregate
in the construction of buildings, highways, railroads and
other types of physical infrastructure are not included in the
Ministry of Mining reports on mining output. Therefore the
estimates of output in this class of lower grade minerals,
being based solely on the input requirements of manufacturers
of "other non-metallic building materials", may understate the
total tonnages actually produced.

     Manufacturing Supply/Demand- The details of manufactured
goods supply/demand are presented in three major groups:
first, food, textiles, wood and paper products; second, petro-
chemicals and related products; and third, non-metallic
building materials and the various classes of metal-related
products, designated as metal-mechanic products to approximate
the Bolivian expression, "metal-mec.!nico". The commodity
classes included in the manufacturing sector are as follows:

      21.   Sugar and confectionery
      22.   Flour and grain products
      23.   Beverages
      24.   Other food and tobacco products
      25.   Textiles
      26.   Wood and wood products
      27.   Pulp and paper products
      28.   Fertilizers
      29.   Other chemicals
      32.   Bricks, ceramics, concrete products and others
      33.   Cement

     34 and 35.   Primary iron and steel and other fabricated
                  metals
     36.   Primary non-ferrous metals
     37.   Vehicles and transport equipment
     38.   Machinery
     39.   Miscellaneous manufactures.
      The first group includes seven types of commodities (n~ed
21 through 27). Four of the commodity types are the products of
the general industrial grouping, food, beverages and tobacco
products, which are heavily consumer-oriented. Less than 20
percent of the domestic consumption of food, beverages and
tobacco products is used in intermediate demand, and this is
due mainly to the use of flour by bakeries, estimated to
account for almost half of the output of flour and bakery
products. Otherwise, beverages are almost entirely consumed
by final demand and other food products vary between 91 and
86 percent in the proportion accounted for by final demand.
About 41 percent of textiles, apparel and leather products
output is accounted for by intermediate demand but, as with
flour and bakery products, this is due to further processing
within the industry grouping. Ultimately, the production of
these consumer non-durables is determined by personal
consumption patterns. Therefore, the projection of consumption
in this group of commodities was related solely to per capita
trends.                             .       0




     Per capita consumption of food, beverages and tobacco
products increased from 162 kilos in 1968 to 193 kilos in
1977, and varied from an average annual rate of increase of
1.54 percent for beverages to 1.93% for both milled rice and
coffee and other food and tobacco products. Adjusted to
exclude food products used in intermediate demand, per capita
intake of food products and beverages amounted to 153 kilos
in 1977, when one includes farm products consumed without any
industrial process, the total food intake is 540 kilos per
capita, (about 1.5 kilos per day). To reflect the effect of
rising incomes on food consumption patterns, it was assumed
that during the 1977-1989 period, 80 percent of the
differential between the rate of increase in gross domestic
product and that of population would occur in the rate of
increase experienced by a given type of food product in the
1970-1977 period. The equation used is as follows:
     Rot + 1 = (Rt + 1 _ Rt + 1) * R~ * f
      ~            y        P           ~


     where:   R~ + 1   = Average annual rate of increase in the

                        in the t + 1 period defined as 1977-1989,

         Y                      domestic product in the t + 1 period,
     Rt + 1             =       Average annual rate of increase in population
         P                      in the t + 1 period,
     R~
      ~
                        =       Average annual rate of increase in the per
                                capita consumption of the ith item in the t
                                period defined as 1970-1977, and
     f                  =       The factor set to adjust the equation; in
                                the instance of the 1977-1989 period, 0.8.

     For the 1989-1999 period, the full differential has been
postulated and, therefore, f was set at 1 (with t + 2 to
designate the later time period).

     In the case of               textiles, apparel and leather products,
there was a decline               in the "consumption" per capita, from 22
kilos in 1970 to 21               kilos in 1977. It was postulated that by
1989 the per capita               consumption of this class of goods would
remain at 21 kilos,               and by 1999 would increase to 23 kilos.

     For wood products and furniture, and the two classes of
paper products, separate methods were used to project
consumption by intermediate demand and domestic final demand.
Intermediate demand for wood products, much of which is accounted
for by processing within the industry group, represents about
53 percent of total consumption.  In addition to some use by
other manufacturing industries, a significant proportion of the
intermediate demand for wood products is used in the construction
industry. However, since projections of output and employment
in this industry have not been made in the Study, total
manufacturing production was used both as an indicator of
intermediate demand consumption by that sector and as a proxy
for such demand by construction. For the final demand portion
of wood products consumption, which it may be noted includes
furniture deliveries to business as one form of fixed capital
formation, per capita ratios were used.  In this instance, the
following equation was adopted:

              R~       =    Rt + ( (R t - Rt)   *   f)
               ~            p          y.   p

    Where:         R~
                    ~
                                Average annual rate of increase in per capita
                                consumption by final demand of the ith item
                                in the tth period,
                            =   Average annual rate of increase in population
                                in the tth period,
                            =   Average annual rate of increase in gross
                                domestic product in the tth period, and
                   f        =   Factor selected to modify the equation,
                                set at 0.8 for 1977-1989, and 1 for 1989-1999.

     Consumption of pulp and bulk paper products is entirely
accounted for by intermediate demand, either as inputs to
other paper products per ~, or to the printing industry.
Projected consumption of pulp and bulk paper products was
therefore based on projected production of other paper products.
Intermediate demand for other paper products represents 83
percent of total consumption and occurs in connection with all
types of economic activity. The projected growth in gross
domestic product was therefore used as the base for projecting
intermediate demand consumption of other paper products.
Consumption by final demand was projected as described above
for final demand consumption of wood products and furniture.
     The second group, petrochemicals, refers to three types
of chemical products, three forms of refined petroleum products,
rubber and miscellaneous plastic products. The basic plastics
used to make miscellaneous plastic products are included with
industrial chemicals, and these and refined petroleum products
are often inputs to other industrial chemicals, fertilizers,
other chemicals and rubber products, which include synthetic
rubber products.
     Intermediate demand accounts for all consumption of indus-
trial chemicals and fertilizers, 45 percent of other chemicals,
40 percent of liquified petroleum gas (LPG), 82 percent for        'I

other refined petroleum products, and 77 percent of rubber and
miscellaneous petroleum products. In general, this intermediate
demand reflects input requirements of a broad spectrum of
industries in addition to those represented in the further
processing of these types of commodities. Therefore for all
types, projections of intermediate demand consumption were
based on projections of gross domestic product.
     The final demand portions of other chemicals, rubber and
miscellaneous plastic products were projected in the same
manner as described above for wood products and furniture.
     Eight categories are included in the third group of
commodities. The class, miscellaneous manufactures, although
it does contain some metal-based products such as instruments,
is largely a collection of widely diverse manufactures with
little in common, and not strictly one of the metal-mechanic
grouping of commodities. It is included here mainly for
convenience. Otherwise, this group refers to durable goods
used either in industrial production or capital formation.




                           -324-
     Intermediate demand accounts for 83 percent of the
consumption of cement and other non-metallic building materials,
principally as inputs to the construction industry. Note that
it is the output of the construction industry, residential
and commercial buildings, highways and all types of physical
infrastructure, that represent deliveries to the fixed capital
formation component of final demand. All but an insignificant
portion of primary metals consumption, both ferrous and non-
ferrous, is accounted for by intermediate demand. Use in
industry represents 53 percent of the tonnages of fabricated
metals consumption, 34 percent of non-electrical machinery,
32 percent of electrical equipment and 27 percent of transport
equipment. The high percentage of machinery and equipment
consumption attributable to final demand is due mainly to
fixed capital formation, i.e., the installation of machinery
and equipment by industry. For miscellaneous manufactures,
consumption by intermediate demand is also a less significant
portion of the total, 28 percent.

     Projections of intermediate demand for cement and other
non-metallic building materials were based on projected growth
of gross domestic product, in the absence of forecasts of
construction activity. No change was postulated in the small
final demand consumption per capita of these two classes of
commodities.

     Intermediate demand consumption of the two classes of
primary metals was based on projected growth of production by
the other metal-mechanic industries. Intermediate demand
consumption of other metal-mechanic products and miscellaneous
manufactures was projected in proportion to gross domestic
product, while the final demand portion was treated as
described above for wood products and furniture.

Goods Production by Zone

     A total of 39 commodity classes were adopted for the
purpose of modelling goods movements. Production in each class
was estimated by zone for 1977 and projected to the years 1989
and 1999. The size of these matrices prohibits their inclusion
in the text of this working paper. Therefore, for ease of
presentation and clarity, the 39 categories have been aggregated
to the four basic economic sectors. The goods production for
each of the 39 categories for each of the 77 zones are included
in Appendix 7D.   The four basic economic sectors are as follows:

     1.   Agriculture including forest and livestock products
     2.   Hydrocarbons
     3.   Minerals
     4.   Manufacturing.

                                                                       '.


     The following discusses the data sources and methodology
employed to estimate and project these commodity categories
at the zonal level.

     1. A ricultural and Forestr      The Ministry of Land
Reform and Agriculture Ministerio de Asuntos Campesinos y
Agricultura - MACA) provided the Study with special tabulations
of agricultural production by department that were far more
complete in the variety of crops covered than any available
elsewhere. A special survey was conducted of agricultural
extension agents in the field.  This was supplemented by
questions on the distribution of crop raising, livestock
raising and forestry activity (as well as mining and manufacturing)
in a special survey by the study of the regional development
corporations (Corporaciones Regionales de Desarrollo). Data
received from the extension agents covered about three-quarters
of the 99 provinces into which Bolivia is organized for
administrative and statistical purposes.

     With respect to crops reported by neither the extension
agents nor the development corporations, MACA data for the
Department were allocated by province on the basis of the
distribution of similar crops,   (e.g. oca and papalisas on
the basis of potatoes and cassava, respectively.). For the
missing provinces, the balance of MACA data on crop production
by department was distributed on the basis of hectares under
cultivation.  In the dozen or ,so instances where provinces were
split to form zones, provincial data were allocated on the basis
of the approximate share of the total hectares involved, e.g.
inspection of maps indicated that zones 5 and 6, which represent
a split of Larecaja Province, contain approximately 60 and 40
percent respectively of the province's total area.

     A MACA study (9) served as the basis for the Department's
details on cattle slaughtered and the weight of carcasses. The         ,
other major livestock products, mutton and pork, were established
                                                                            ,-~




on a provincial basis on the basis of the extension agents'
reports.   Lesser livestock production, chicken and other fowl,
llama, etc., is reported for the departments by MACA, and was
allocated by province on the basis of sheep/pig marketings and
mutton/pork carcass production. For missing provinces, hectares
of pastures were used to allocate departmental livestock
production not accounted for in the data reported for covered
provinces.   Total production of other livestock products such
as wool and skins was allocated by department and zone on the
basis of total animal livestock products.

                           -326-
     Another set of MACA studies (10) served as the basis for
estimates of tonnages of Brazil nuts, crude rubber and logs,
firewood and bark by department, and then by province and
zone, using areas of forest as the allocation factor.


     2. H drocarbons, Production b Zone - The extraction and
refining 0  oil and natura gas ta e p ace in only a few zones.
Statistics are good, the sources being the annual Anexos Esta-
d!sticos and "Diez Allos de Estad!stica Petrol era de Bolivia,
1969-78", published by the YPFB.   This information makes it
simple to allocate national totals in 1977 to zones.   The
allocation of 1989 and 1999 totals has been done on the advice
of the YPFB. Production projections are shown in Table 8 for
1989 and 1999 Development Pattern B.

     3. Mining, Production by Zone - The Ministry of Mining
and Metallurgy furnished the Study with details on the source
of mining output by the type of mineral in varying degrees of
detail. For COMIBOL, the geographical location of the mines
was supplied so that the zone could be identified. All output
data by COMIBOL were reported in both fine and gross tons.
Output data for the intermediate mines were reported by
company and by province, but only in fine tons.  Data for total
exports reported by the Ministry in both fine and gross tons
were used to estimate output by the intermediate mines in gross
tons from the reported fine tons by province. Output by the
small mines was also reported by province and in fine tons,
which were converted to gross on the basis of the export
details reported for small mines in both fine and gross tons.
Production details by province not identified on a zonal basis
were then aggregated to zones as appropriate.

     The distribution by zone of lower-grade mineral production,
lime and gypsum, and sand, gravel, clay and aggregates, was
estimated from the location of industries using these commodi-
ties as inputs, namely the cement, other non-metallic building
materials and primary metals industries. Since no data are
available on the volume of these minerals used directly in the
construction industry, the estimates are based on the road,
rail and river movement surveys. Mining production is shown
in Table 9 with trend projections for 1989 and 1999.

      4. Manufacturing Output by Zone - The distribution by
department of manufacturing production in 1977 was derived
from the partial data reported in INE's Estad!sticas Indus-
triales ABo 1975, augmented by the establishment data
reported in the industrial directory published by the
Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, as described
earlier. Most establishments listed in the directory are
located in the principal city of the department. For the
industries that are particularly consumer-oriented such as
food products and textiles, apparel and leather products, it         ''1
was assumed that the directory fails to include many establish-
ments located outside the central city that would be termed
"cottage" industries or artesans.  It was assumed that directory-
listed establishments accounted for two-thirds of the industry
output of this nature in the department, but that those located
in the central city were twice as important as those outside.
The balance of one-third attributed to unlisted "cottage"
establishments was then distributed by zone on the basis of the
economically active population engaged in manufacturing as
determined from the INE 1976 Census tapes.

      For the industries oriented largely to intermediate demand
(paper products through the various metal manufacturers), it
was further assumed that establishments located in the central
city were twice as important as those ou~side, except where it
was evident that the most important establishment was outside
the central city, e.g. the cement plant at Viacha. Thus, in
most instances, all but relatively small volumes of output were
attributed to the zone in which the central city of the
department is located.

      The bases for projecting manufacturing activities by zone     ,""
are extremely limited. There is little information on the
coverage represented by the Department details of manufacturing
output reported in INE's 1970 Estad!sticas Industriales.            ,   .~


Changes in industry definition have occurred and the use of
measures of volume other than weight complicates the identi-
fication of trends in physical output. The general approach
                                                                     , f;'
adopted was to derive the shifts that occurred in the
departments' shares of output by industry as indicated by the
INE Estad!sticas Industriales for 1970 and 1975, and to
extrapolate these shifts to 1989, using considerable judgement
wherever radical shifts occurred, since there is a major
question as to comparability.   In the process, account was
taken of plans by the regional development corporations for
projects to expand manufacturing activity in the departments
for which they are responsible.   If the base for extrapolating
share shifts to 1989 was reasonable, a further extrapolation
to 1999 was made. Otherwise, the distribution by department
developed for 1989 was used also for 1999.   Zone shares of
projected output by industry in each department were then
derived for both target years on the basis of their share in
1977.

                           -328-
     Goods Consumption - The allocation to zones was made
separately for intermediate and final consumption.  Inter-
mediate consumption was placed in the zones where the
relevant industries are known or predicted to be located,
in proportion to their capacity.

     The allocation of final consumption was made on the basis
of population and income. Judgement was applied in regard to
the relative needs of the dispersed and non-dispersed population.

     The construction of the rail interconnection between
Santa Cruz and Cochabamba would provide the possibility of
direct rail travel between Peru and Chile, and Brazil.

     Traffic on the rail connection, if built, will be of three
types - internal to internal movements, internal to external
movements and external to external movements. This Appendix
sets out to estimate the volume involved in this final category
of movement.

Potential Transit Routes Affectinq Bolivia

     Bolivia shares a border with five countries, namely Peru,
Chile, Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil.   There is thus the pos-
sibility of transit traffic between all of these countries af-
fecting Bolivia. However, in fact many share cornmon borders -
the only flows which need to cross Bolivia in reality are those
between Peru/Chile and Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina. The
flows between Peru/Chile and Paraguay/Argentina do not affect
the rail connection, using other parts of the existing network.
Thus the problem of estimating future flows resolves itself
into one of predicting trade between Peru and northern Chile
and Brazil.

     Surprisingly, although they share a frontier, there is some
transit traffic through Bolivia between Chile and Argentina
- such traffic however does not affect the rail connection and
is difficult to explain.

Past Trends in Trade

      In the absence of finnforecasts of governmental intentions
regarding future policy from the countries concerned, the best
course of action is to examine the historical experience and
assume no major change, unless there is reason to expect other-
wise.    Data is available for the years 1971-1979 for trade
flows between Brazil and Peru,and for a single year for flows
between Brazil and Chile. In addition some information was
obtained from mining concerns in northern Chile and southern
Peru relating to their present trade with Brazil and future
plans.




                         -395-
     The statistics (Table9C-l} show that the volume of trade
between Peru and Brazil grew steadily during the early 1970's,
reaching a peak in 1976. This was followed by a marked fall
in trade as both countries entered a period of economic reces-
sion and financial crisis, experiencing high inflation and poor
productivity. A more detailed analysis of the figures reveals
considerable fluctuation from year to year in the direction of
trade and in ~articular commodities - for instance Brazil is
                                                                           it
an exporter of maize in years when she has a surplus, Peru
exported large quantities of petroleum products in some years
and not in others. These factors combine to make the task of
forecasting future trade movements a formidable one, with the
results subject to great uncertainty.

Projected Trade Flows

     In the projections that follow, the assumption has been
made that trade patterns will follow past trends, and that
trade between the countries will grow at the same level of the
leading partner, in this case Brazil. This is a grossly simplify-
inq assumption, but in the absence of further data it is the
best that can be made.

Peru-Brazil

      The historical pattern has been that imports to Brazil
from Peru have been, on average, 0.2 percent of Brazil's total iIrports:
they have grown at roughly the same rate as imports as a whole
 (in value).  Exports have similarly been fairly constant as a
percentage in value over the past 10 years (~le 9C-2). Assuming
that the value to weight ratio of imports and exports remains
the same in future years, and excluding petroleum sales from
Peru to Brazil (which would be transported by ships, not rail)
the future volumes of trade using the route through Bolivia and
thus the rail connection, are shown in Table 9C-3. The assunption
here is that the economy of Brazil will expand at a rate of 7 percent
p. a. to 1987 and then increase its rate of growth to 9 percent p.a. to
1999 (as it frees itself from the constraints at present imposed
by the lack of domestic energy supplies) (1). Thus trade with
Peru grows at these identical rates, overall.      (The Peruvian
economy is expected to grow at approxinately 5 percent p.a. over the
period 1980-1990).

Brazil-Chile

     Once again the major partner is Brazil, therefore the same
rates of qrowth will be applied. The problem in this case,lies


(l)This assumption may be optimistic: Brazilian GNP has grown
   at roughly 7 percent p.a. for the last 5 years. However, this year
   growth is expected to slow to 6 percent with a very poor last quarter
   of the year expected and unless inflation is controlled growth
   may continue to decline in 1981.
                                                                           II!

in deciding what percentage of Chilean/Brazilian trade will
pass throuqh Bolivia. The main centers of production of the
two contries are in Sao Paulo and Santiago: the route between
them does not affect Bolivia. The traffic which will make use
of the rail connection will be that between the mining region
of northern Chile and Brazil; this traffic is only a small per-
centage of total trade between the two countries, though im-
portant in terms of tonnage, since a large part is made up
of metal movements.

     The original movement between Sao Paulo and northern Chile
used to take 30 days by boat; now,however,a change to using
rail and road through Bolivia is taking place. The traffic
cost is much the same but the time is halved to an average of
15 days. This traffic will undoubtedly use the connection
should it be built.

     It is assumed in Table9C-4that the major movement will be
of copper from Chile to Brazil and that 75 percent of Chilean copper   ~
production for the Brazilian market comes from the northern
region.  This trade is assumed to grow at the same rate as the
rest of the Brazilian economy, namely 7 percent to 1987 and 9
percent thereafter.

Brazil-Rest of the World

     It has been suggested that the large volume of trade bet-
ween Brazil and countries of the Pacific region may find it
desirable to utilize the rail connection. This particularly
relates to trade with Japan which was the source of 438,518            'II
tons of imports in 1978, and which took 22,089,256 tons
bf exports in the same year. However, the economics
ot shipping are such that there is little or no benefit to be
gained in shortening the distance the cargo travels by boat
relative to that travelled overland.   Ocean shipping costs
are more sensitive to fixed costs than variable, and there is
no consistent relationship between distance and cost per ton
carried. Thus it is most unlikely that the Brazilian export
trade with Japan will use the rail connection: they will use
the overland route to the nearest port (in most cases Santos)
as they do at present. The increased rail cost and uncertainty
involved in traversing three countries to reach a Pacific port
would outweigh any decrease in shipping costs.

Conclusion

     The result of this, admittedly general, analysis is that
the total tonnage of transit traffic that can be expected to
use ~ rail connection is of the order of 392,000 tons

in 1989. As has been pointed out this figure depends upon key
assumptions regarding the likely continuation of past patterns
of trade and the future pattern of growth of the economies in-
volved (See Table 9C-S). Table 9C-6 shows the impact upon flows
of a lowering of the assumed Brazilian growth rate (which is
the critical element).
      Is should be pointed out that this estimated volume does
not include any generation effect induced by the reduction in
transport costs brought about by construction of the link.
However such an effect is not thought to be very significant:
transport between the three main areas of production/consump-
tion is already feasible and economic using existing infrastruc
ture. The change in costs induced by the rail connection for -
a complete trip Sao Paulo-Lima; for example. is of the order
of 10 percent. Thus, at the ITOst, the volurre estinated in Table 9C-S
could be raised 10 percent to allow for generated traffic. In view
of the quality of service element at present offered by the
railroads this estimate may be on the generous side.

Air Projects

     Most air projects involve improvements to airfields but
it was not practicable to assign a separate project number to
every possible improvement. These could include such things
as runway paving., runway extension, terminal improvement,
improvement to air navigation and even airport relocation.
Instead, a project number was assigned to each airfield where
improvements have been suggested which embraces all the im-
provements considered at that airfield.

            VEHICLE AXLE LOAD MEASUREMENT PROGRAM



       In Chapter II, it is recommended that a program for
vehicle axle load measurements be initiated on paved roads.
This appendix outlines such a program.

Location of Weighing Stations and Opening Dates

It is recommended that 18 permanent stations are set up
on all paved roads on the outskirts of the department capitals.
Timing would depend on the opening of paved roads at each
location but nine stations are recommended for immediate
opening.  It is also recommended that three mobile units be
provided, empowered to make random checks along the main
highways.

       The proposed locations of 18 permanent stations are shown
in Table 11A-l together with suggested inauguration dates.
These have been chosen to cover the more important roads
currently in good condition in the early stages, and to extend
the system to other paved roads as they are constructed or
improved.

       It was recommended in Chapter 16 that the present
Transito toll system be abolished, principally because receipts
at the present time barely cover costs, and because there would
be difficult problems with successfully administering higher
tolls as well as increasing problems of congestion at these
stations as traffic volumes build up. It is therefore
recommended that vehicle weighing stations be set up at these
Transito stations, taking over the covered facilities and also
the existing teams of government officials, who could be
retrained to administer the vehicle weighing operations. Only
at Guabira would completely new stations be required.

Program Costs

       Costs are not expected to be high. The only real
additional cost would be for the purchase of the weighing
machines and for their installation.   In 1977 prices, fixed
machines might cost $b 500,000 each and installation should
not be more than about $b 10,000. Hence, the 18 permanent
location machines recommended, together with installation,
might cost $b 9.2 million. Mobile machines would cost about
$b 200,000 and a further $b 0.4 million should be allowed
for thr~e vehicles £or the mobile statioris. Total initiation
costs of the program might therefore be about $b 10.2 million

and an estimated $b 6.5 million of this would be incurred in
the period 1981-1983. Running costs for the whole system
should be less than the current cost of running the present
Transito system ($b 8.5 million in 1979) since less stations
would be required, and probably less staff. An estimate could
be made of about $b 4-5 million per year for the running costs
of a full system. It would make sense for the day-to-day
running of the weighing stations to be under the control of
Transito, but with technical direction from SNC.

               COSTS OF BETTERMENT OF UNPAVED ROADS

     The betterment of a low volume unpaved road is a policy
recommended by the Study in place of completely new construction
making little use of the existing alignment. Betterment is
defined as improvement of the existing road alignment, and
comprises the following:
      •    Widening to seven meters
      •    Additional drainage
      •    Additional retaining walls
      •    Improved surface -- either good gravel or a 6-meter
             pavement.
     Table IlB-l sets out the assumptions on necessary work,
unit costs of construction and the final costs used in the
evaluation. Surfacing costs are given separately from Table
IlB-l.
     Unit prices are based on Working Paper 38a (1). See
Table 45, prices for La Paz!Oruro, factored to pesos at
SUS 1 = $b 20. Some modifications were made, as follows:
      a)    The costs related to earth works in mountainous
            regions were taken from the costs for very
            mountainous regions.
      b)    Drainage costs were doubled to reflect the probably
            higher costs for this type of improvement compared
            with a new construction project.
      c)    Costs of surface treatment are lower based on a
            note from the National Road Service (Servicio Nacio-
            nal de Caminos - SNC) for single surface treatment.
Surfacing Costs
     For a paved surface, the design illustrated below was
assumed.          ~           7m                      I

Total Costs

     Table 11B-2 presents the final costs of betterment for
the two surface types.

     Costs were factored by 15 percent to allow for contingencies,
and another 15 percent to bring costs to 1985 relative levels
(but still in terms of 1977 pesos).

Regional Adjustment

      On the basis of data supplied by SNC, a regional factor of
1.4 was estimated to augment the costs given in Table 11B-2 for
betterment work in the east of the country.   In particular, the
factor was applied to the following roads:

                  •    Santa Cruz-Yacuiba
                  •    Santa Cruz-Puerto Pailas
                  •    Km 87-Puerto Banegas.

                   HIGHWAY DESIGN STANDARDS

     It is common practice for highway departments to specify
standards for the design of highways but in practice, they are
very rarely adhered to in every detail. This is as it should
be. Design standards are useful as a guide but the design of
a particular road must take account of the specific factors
which cannot be covered in a set of general standards.
Important examples of such factors are as follows:
     Costs - Construction costs are generally related to
     terrain, so that standards are usually lower in more
     difficult terrain to avoid prohibitively high costs.
     But it is usually difficult to encompass the full range
     of terrains in a general design standard. Special
     features in one region may allow relatively easy
     alignments through otherwise difficult territory while
     other regions pose extreme difficulties -- the Yungas
     valleys being a notorious example. The engineer must
     accomodate his design to the specific problems
     encountered in order to get a cost-effective solution.
     Funding Limits - Highway investment planning must take
     account of the funds available and the number of projects
     competing for them. It can be bad policy to build one
     road strictly in accordance with design standards but at
     the same time postponing other similar projects. It
     could be better to lower the design standards and obtain
     more kilometers of reasonable standard highway for the
     same money.
     Condition of the EXistin¥ Road - It may be possible to
     delay new road construct on and improve the existing
     road instead. Much depends upon the condition of the
     existing road and on the traffic volumes.
      It is essential that every highway project is preceeded
by a design study to examine the costs and effectiveness of
alternative solutions, taking account of the factors specified
above. It is a recommendation of this Study that low cost
solutions making full use of the existing roadway, such as
betterment, should have priority over completely new roads,
especially considering the low volumes and severe financial
restraints which currently prevail.
     The section following indicates design standards for new
roads and the subsequent section recommends action for improving
existing highways.

Design Standards for New Roads
     Design standards for new roads are presented in Table
llC-l. They are based largely on the recommendation of
Frederick W. Cron in his review of highway design standards
in developing countries (1). In general, the standards allow
lower geometric standards for a given design speed (tighter
curve radii, shorter sight distances, steeper gradients) than
do the SNC standards presented in the Main Report in Table
11-5, which are based on American highway design
practices. Also, recommended standards generally specify a
lower design speed for a given traffic category and terrain
class, than do the SNC standards. The traffic ranges for
each design level are expressed in terms of average daily
traffic on opening.
     In general, narrower shoulder widths are specified than
recommended by Cron, in order to save costs.
Improvements of Existing Roads
     The design standards specified in Table llC-l are for
completely new roads. Where a road already exists, it may be
possible to improve the existing alignment, thus postponing
new construction until traffic volumes have grown to between
1,000 and 1,500 vehicles per day. Two major improvements are
possiblei major gravelling to improve drainage and place a
15 cm good gravel surface; and betterment, which includes
widening to 7 meters, special widening of difficult curves,
retaining walls where necessary, additional drainage and a
6 meter pavement. Projects for major gravelling and betterment
were evaluated in Chapter 11.
     It is very difficult to specify standards for betterment.
The philosophy of this type of improvement is that it is more
worthwhile to invest money in a good surface than in improving
the alignment. Betterment is thus specific in requiring a 7
meter roadway width with a 6 meter pavement, probably of single
surface treatment at low volumes of traffic. However, this          1Il!
standard is deliberately vague on the amount of work to be put
into straightening of bends or removing sharp vertical curves.
This must be left to the judgement of the design team responsible
for each project and it is suggested that each project team is
required to work within a specified total cost. Appendix llB
details the quantities assumed in the costing of betterment
used in the evaluations in this Study.

     The recommendation of only a 6 meter pavement may be
considered controversial. The following comments can be made:

      1.   The Cron based standards for new roads (see Table
           11C-1) envisage the possibility of 6 meter roads up
           to 400 vehicles per day in all circumstances and up
           to 1,000 vehicles per day in some.

      2.   Congestion effects are unlikely to be felt in any
           terrain with road widths of 6 meters or more, for
           volumes up to about 800 vehicles per day. This
           represents about one vehicle per minute. This
           subject is discussed in Appendix 11D.
      3.   Evidence of increased accident rates with 6 meter
           roads in place of 7 meters is contradictory. A recent
           study (2) by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory
            (TRRL) of the United Kingdom found that road width
           was a significant factor in affecting the accident
           rate in Jamaica, but that it was not important in Kenya.
           In Jamaica, the report suggests that a reduction of
           one meter in road width will bring about an increase
           of 0.755 personal injury accidents per one million
           vehicle kilometers. That is to say, on a 100 km road
           with 200 vehicles per day, there will be about five
           more personal injury accidents per year on a 6 meter
           road compared with a 7 meter road. However, this
           same increase in accidents is predicted when comparing
           roads of 7 meter width against those of 8 meters, or
           of 5 meter width against those of 6 meters. What is        It
           an "acceptable" accident rate is a delicate subject,
           but the Jamaica results are not in themselves an
           argument against 6 meter roads.   In Kenya, no link
           was found between accident rate and road width.   In
           both countries, the number of junctions per kilometer,
           which is little affected by design standar~s, was
           important.

      4.   There is some precedent for a 6 meter pavement in Bo-
           livia in the Santa Cruz-Cochabarnba highway, which is
           being reconstructed to this width. Also, it is noted
           that the La Paz-Cotapata paved highway is constructed
           with half meter shoulders.

     It is strongly recommended that the first project studied
for betterment be treated as a pilot study, to establish the
possibilities for this type of improvement.  It is frankly
admitted that the procedure is untried in Bolivia and costs
must still be uncertain. However, it is the view of the Study
that it is a procedure well worth pursuing further in order to
extend the paved road system of Bolivia at reasonable cost.

     Table llC-2 indicates the range of traffic volumes on
unpaved roads where the three alternative improvements --
major gravelling, betterment and new road -- could be feasible.
It is emphasized that Table llC-2 is a guide only and that a
feasibility study should be undertaken for each project.

Concluding Remarks

     In producing the design standards given in this Appendix,
account was taken of the HOM Model evaluations of road design
levels. More work could be done using this model to further
refine these standards, and it is suggested that this could be
a suitable task for the proposed SNC Studies and Investigation
Department (see Chapter 16).

      The basic source for relationships on highway capacity is
the Highway Capacity Manual (1) but for convenience, the
relationships derived from this source for the World Bank Road
Analysis Model (RAM) (2) have been used in this Appendix.

     Section 38 of the RAM Manual gives equations for average
vehicle speed which depend on design speed, volume-to-capacity
ratio (VIC Ratio) and the percentage of the road section
where sight distances exceed 1,500 feet.  Assuming the worst
case for the latter parameter of zero percent, Table llD-l
shows how average speed varies according to the other
parameters.

     From the speeds in Table llD-l, the following values can
be deduced for the VIc Ratio at which congestion effects will
begin to be felt.

     The capacity of a 7.3 meter tWo-lane road (there are few
roads of greater size in Bolivia) is basically 2,000 cars per
hour or 30,800 cars per day.  This basic capacity is affected
by the number of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream, road
width, edge clearance and design speed (assumed here to be linked
to terrain).  Using values in the RAM Manual, values of capacity
reduction are calculated for each terrain type in Table 110-2,
assuming fairly poor road conditions.

     Basic daily capacities can be estimated using the factors
derived in Table 110-2 as follows:

     Level Terrain:       0.32 x 30,800 = 9,856 veh/day
     Rolling Terrain:     0.14 x 30,800 = 4,312 veh/day
     Mountainous Terrain: 0.06 x 30,800 = 1,848 veh/day.

     Hence, volumes at which congestion effects first start
becoming noticed are as follows:
                     VOLUMES BELOW WHICH CONGESTION EFFECTS ARE:
       TERRAIN                 Zero           Slight                 "

     Mountainous                462               924

Conclusions

     These are pessimistic values to indicate the volumes at
which congestion may become a factor under the worst conditions.
If these values are approached, a special calculation would be
required to take into account the particular characteristics
of the road in question.  In most cases, the volume at which
capacity effects would be noticed will be above the values
given in this Appendix.

     In the evaluation of existing unpaved roads reported in
Chapter 11, three classes of road improvements were considered:
new construction, betterment and major gravelling.   In these
evaluations, improvements to the alignment and road surface
and the provision of minor drainage structures were considered,
but not the provision of bridges.   In this Appendix, the
economic feasibility of the provision of bridges is analyzed.

     The evaluation was carried out based on the calculations
of savings due to the elimination of interruptions caused by
lack of bridges. The analysis was made for the year 1989,
taking into account the projected traffic volumes in the
recommended network and calculating the rates of return for
the first year.

     The analysis was based on a survey on bridge needs,
carried out by the Study in nine districts of the National
Road Service (SNC). A total of 325 river crossings were
identified where bridges might be required at an estimated
total cost of 2,414 million 1977 pesos.

     As a basis for the evaluation, tables were prepared on
costs of delays for two kinds of interruptions:

    •   Short interruptions of up to 10 hours
    •   Longer interruptions of more than 10 hours.

     In the first part of this Appendix, it is explained how
the delay tables were prepared, and in the second part, the
analysis itself is described and conclusions presented.

     Costs of Dela~s for Interruptions of Less than 10 Hours -
In Tables 1ip-1 an I1F-2, costs are presented for interruptions
of 3, 6 and B hours and for occurrences of 2 to 40 days in the
rainy season from December to March. These tables were
calculated with the following formula:
                                           H2
                        C   =   D x V x    20 x awc

    Where:   C     =   Cost of the delay
             D     =   Number of days of interruption during the
                         rainy season
             V     =   Average daily traffic
             H     =   Delay length in hours
             awc   =   Average weighted cost of one hour of delay
                         of the vehicle mix.

     This formula assumes that, on average, vehicles encounter
only half the length of the delay and that vehicles are in
operation for ten hours each day.

     The value awc is the avel:'age weighted cost of one hour
of vehicle operation and passenger time for an average mix
of vehicles. The cost of vehicle operations considered in
the value awc refer only to costs related to time. These
are:                                                                     '.

     These costs are shown in Table 11F-3 for three types of
surface and for estimated vehicle utilizations corresponding
to 1977 and 1999. Averages of the costs corresponding to
paved and gravel surfaces and to 1977 and 1999 utilizations               '!II

costs are shown in Tables iiF-4 to 11F-7. For these longer
interruptions, three types of delay costs were calculated:

                     •       Vehicle delay costs
                                                                             '.

     Vehicle delay costs were calculated using the following
formula:                                                                     '1

                          average for the vehicle mix)
                V    = Average daily traffic.
     Costs of delays are calculated over only a 24 hour period
since i t is considered that activities will be rearranged
during longer interruptions to compensate. Values of "awvc"
were taken from Table 11F-3 using the average vehicle mixes
specified earlier and the annual operating hours as specified
in Chapter 5 of the Main Report.

     The passengers' time costs were calculated with the
following formula:

                     C       == 8 x N x awt x ppd
                         t

     Where:     C   == Passenger time costs due to the delays
                Nt  = Number of interruptions per year
                awt = Value of passenger time (weighted average
                         for the vehicle mix)
                ppd = Average number of passengers per day.

      The following values were taken of the passenger time:
                Light vehicles            12 $b/hr
                Buses                      5 $b/hr
                Trucks                     4 $b/hr.

     It was considered 8 hours of economic value that a
passenger loses in a day.
     The time costs for freight were calculated with the
following formula:
                 C
                  f
                      =   8 x tpd

      Where:   C   = Time costs for freight
               tPd = Tons per day.
     The average cost for a one-day delay to 1 ton of freight
was taken as 8 $b/ton-day. This figure is an average of 4
$b/ton and 15 $b/ton for agricultural and non-agricultural
products respectively.
     To obtain the tpd, the following values were used for the
load factor and average load:
                           LOAD FACTOR   AVERAGE CAPACITY
      Small truck              0.27            4 tons
      Medium truck             0.34            8 tons
      Large truck              0.48           12 tons.

Bridge Project Screening
     As mentioned above, information on interruptions was
taken from the bridge survey carried out by the National
Transport Study and also from the "Socio-economic Studies
Report" of the "National Bridge Program" (2) carried out by
the Planning Department of SNC.
     SNC evaluated the economic feasibility of 19 bridges
located in seven road sections throughout the country. In
general, the duration of the interruptions considered by SNC
is greater than that registered by the Study survey.

     In a first stage of the bridge analysis, several road          III
sections were chosen to analyze the feasibility of bridge
provision. The economic feasibility of bridges was evaluated
independently of other improvements.
     In the analysis, penetration roads and completely new
road links, where bridges are considered as part of the
construction, and links where the interruptions are due to
other causes than lack of bridges (such as slides and floodings),
were not considered.
     Figure 11F-1 illustrates the selection of road sections
for the bridge analysis.
     Using the delay cost tables presented earlier, bridge
projects were screened to eliminate road sections with very
low traffic or with minimal interruptions. The following
road sections were subsequently removed from further analysis:


               •   Caracollo-Tambo Quemado
               •   Oruro-Caihuasi
               •   Challapata-Uyuni
               •   Uyuni-Tupiza
               •   Cuchu Ingenio-Mojo
               •   Potos!-Uyuni
               •   Aiquile-Palizada
               •   Vallegrande-Ipitg
     The section San Borja-San Ignacio-Trinidad is treated
separately from this analysis in Chapter 12.                         ."
Bridge Evaluation Procedure
     The bridges in the road sections selected were evaluated
by comparing the operating cost savings due to a bridge
(extracted from the relevant delay cost table) with the
bridge investment required.
     It was assumed that the interruption magnitudes obtained
from either the NTS or the SNC surveys apply to all the rivers
in the section under evaluation. That is to say, it is
necessary to construct all the bridges of the section considered
to eliminate the recorded interruption.
     First year rates of return were calculated for each set
of bridges and these are shown in Table llF-8.

  (2) Assumed value
     In Table 11F-8, 29 bridges totalling 1,038 meters, reach
a rate of return for the first year greater or equal to 12
percent and another 18 bridges can be justified, totalling
837 meters, if a first year rate of return of 8 percent is        'W

considered acceptable.
     The following observations are made on the results shown
in Table 11F-8 •.
     In the R!o Seco-Desaguadero project, the four bridges
proposed by the SNC were evaluated, of which only two were
identified by this Study.                                         '•.
     The SNC proposes only one bridge in the Machacamarca-
Unc!a section although this Study identified 4 additional
bridges. Taking into account the interruptions considered
by SNC, it is possible to justify all the bridges identified
by this Study.
     For the Epizana-Sucre section, SNC identified two of
thirteen bridges identified by this Study. The rate of return
estimated for the year 1989 for these two bridges, considering
the interruptions of SNC, is of the order of 9.1 percent.
SNC justified these two bridges with an internal rate of
                                                                  •
return of 19.5 percent.                                          ''II

     Two bridges in the Mataral-Vallegrande section have been
evaluated by SNC, out of three identified by this Study. The
third bridge is an existing one which is not considered in
Table 11F-8.
Bridge Replacement
     SNC have prepared a list of bridges requiring replacement
due to low weight restrictions and narrow widths. These are
shown in Table 1IF-9.

              THE RIO SECO - DESAGUADERO HIGHWAY


     The study recommends betterment for the Rio Seco - Desaguadero
highway (see Chapters 11 and .15), which is a relatively low cost
improvement with a 6-meter pavement. In contrast, previous
studies have recommended more expensive projects to higher levels
of design. This appendix looks at the issues involved.
The Existi'ng Rfo Seco-Des'agua'd'ero' Highway
     The following description is based on the SNC Inventory of
this route.
     The highway is 98 km long running through mostly flat
terrain, but with just over 9 km classified as undulating. The
surface is gravel, side slopes are stable and the soil type is
good (CBR assessed as 40 percent).
     Alignment - The alignment is generally good with 67 km
classified as flat and straight (the best possible) and a
further 15 km as flat but with some curves which affect speeds.
Only 13 km are classified as sinuous alignment, of which 6 km
are located in a steeply aligned section just east of Pucara.
87 percent of the road has adequate passing sight distance.
The road width is also good with only 3 km less than 7 meters,
and with 9 km reaching 9-meter width.
     Surface - The gravel surface is in extremely poor condition.
The problem is that oversized gravel is used, sometimes contain-
ing large stones, so that a good surface cannot be obtained, even
wfthfrequent grading. Truckers have complained about the poor
surface which accelerates the deterioration of their vehicles:
they also note that grading operations seem to make little dif-
ference to surface quality.
Traffic Volum:es
     past traffic volumes together with traffic forecasts, are
shown in Table 1.1G-1.Values' are shown for each section of the
highway, and as a weighted average for the entire route.
     Traffic volumes are currently very low, reachihg 235 average
daily traffic (ADT) in .1980 (average of nine mOhths' counts by ,
$Nct. Growth in traffic has not been high over recent years,
averaging 7 .. 4 percent per year from 1961, but only 3.8 percent
per year from .1972. This also reflects an apparent decline in
traffic over the last three years.

       According to SNC,(1) traffic is expected to grow to about
  600 AnT by 1989 and 1,150 AnT by 1999. This represents a
  growth rate of from 6 to 7 percent per year. However, the
. 1980 projection is about 40 percent high compared with 1980
  counts. Adjusting the SNC projection in this ratio produces
  revised forecasts of about 420 and 800 ADT for 1989 and 1999
  respectively(with the same growth rate as before).
     The Study forecasts are lower, reaching only 380 ADT and
560 ADT in 1989 and 1999 respectively, about 10 percent and
30 percent below the SNC modified forecasts for the years 1989
and 1999 respectively. This is partly because a comparatively
low growth rate in local traffic was calculated using the
computer transport model, and because it is assumed that some
international traffic will transfer to rail when the Guaqui-
Puno line is completed.
     None of the flows can be considered high. Even the volume
on the busiest link in the optimistic forecast of SNC for 1999,
represents a flow of only about 100 vehicles per hour on average,
with a peak of probably less than three vehicles per minute.
According to the Study forecasts for the busiest link, peak
volumes would average about one vehicle per minute in 1999.
Possible Improvement Projects
        Four basic projects can be defined:
             1)   Major gravelling
             2)   SNC/SOINCO project
             3)   New road
             4}   Betterment now, new road later.
        (All costs given below are in 1977 pesos).
     Major gravelling consists of improving all the necessary
small drainage structures, and then placing and compacting a
surface of 15 cm of selected or crushed materials. This would
bring about a dramatic improvement in driving quality, and
would cost about $b 43 million. Maintenance thereafter would be
considerably easier than maintenance of the existing surface.
Such a project could be justified immediately.    .
     The SNc/sOINCO project is for a 96 kID road, making use
of the existing alignment. Road platform width would be 10
meters and the cost of the project is estimated at about
$b 400 million. If the pos.sibilities for betterment (see below)
are ignored, this project could be justified for the mid-80s.

     A project for a completely new 96 kIn road was prepared in
1976 by Prudencio Claros-Delcanda, and costs are estimated at
about $b 630 million. A project of this cost could not be             .
justified economically until the 1990s.
      The project of betterment (see Chapter 111, to be followed
by a new road, is reconunended by this Study. Betterment emphasizes
the improvement of the surface by construction of drainage
structures and paving. At current and projected traffic volumes,
major improvements to alignment are not worthwhile. Costs of
betterment are estimated at $b 109 million, plus $b 25 million
for four new bridges. Benefits are high, giving a 34 percent
rate of return on the betterment and 18 percent for the bridges.
In other words, the cost of the project will be "repaid" in
lower vehicle operating cost benefits in 3-4 years. Once
volumes reach about 1,000 ADT, a new road could be justified,
but even on the optimistic SNC forecasts, this will not for
                                                                      '.
about another eighteen years. In the interim period, surface
dressing could be required every 5-6 years (in addition to            .
routine patching} at a cost each time of $b 30 million, in
order to re-seal and strengthen the surface.
     It can be noted that these costs, although very low,
are likely to be an over-estimate. Most of the cost is in the
new surface, and it is very possible that a new subbase could
be omitted relying instead on the, gravel in the eXisting road
                                                                      ,.
bed, which is classified with a high CBR (see earlier). Also,
probably less drainage structures are required for this road
than most others.
     If betterment were considered to 9 meters overall width
with a 7 meter pavement, costs would rise from $b 109 million
to $b 139 million, a 27 percent increase. However, this extra
width is not considered necessary and would mean postponement
of improvements elsewhere in the transport system.
     Although the project for betterment could be justified
inunediately,due to budget limits and also the need to prepare
a final design, the project is reconunended for construction
starting in 1984.                                                     ~,

           The costs for both the SNC/SOINCO project and the Prudencio
      Claros-Delcanda designs, seem to be very high.  It has been
      claimed that the SNC/SOINCO project is similar to betterment,
      in that it makes use of the existing alignment.  If so, it is
      strange that the estimated costs are more than double those of
      recent completely new highways through similar terrains.  It is
      even more costly than Huarina-Tiquina, which passes through more
      difficult terrain.

      Comment on Design Standards

           A paved width of six meters is considered perfectly satis-
      factory for a road with currently only 235 ADT, and which is
      unlikely to reach 1,000 ADT before the end of the century (see
      Appendix llC on design standards).  This is the pavement width
      to which Santa Cruz-Siberia (on the Cochabamba-Santa Cruz high-
      way) is currently being re-constructed by SNC.  It is claimed
      that Rio Seco-Desaguadero requires a greater width (7 meters)
      since it is a major international highway, but in reality,
      current and future volumes for at least the next 10 - 20 years
      do not justify this.




                                         -459-
     Most of the other betterments proposed by the study are
on roads with similar credentials -- Route No.1, the Pan American
highway, etc. There are insufficient funds to build major new
roads in all these locations, and there does not appear to be
any particular reason why RIo Seco-Desaguadero merits special
treatment.
     rt is recognized that there are international treaties on
road standards. These, however, are long term objectives and it      "
cannot be expected that they be complied with immediately. In
the case of RIo Seco-Desaguadero, the Study is simply recommending
a major upgrading of the existing road until such time that a new
road, to full international standards, can be justified and also
afforded.


     The study recommends a betterment project for RIo Seco-
Desaguadero in order to improve the current poor driving
conditions. A 6-meter pavement is considered sufficient for
the current and forecast traffic volumes, but a 7-meter pavement
would cost only $b 30 million more. It is recommended that the
current SNC/SOINCO plan costing $b 400 million is abandoned.
Dmplementation of the SNC/SOINCO project of 96 km would require
about half the funds allocated by the Study for the next six
years to improve over 1,500 kID of unpaved roads.
     Phase II is about implementation of the Transport Plan.
In reality, there must still be a major element of study and
evaluation of alternatives. It is recommended that a more
detailed study of the possibilities for betterment be made
jointly with SNC in Phase II, preferably as part of a pilot
project. This shoUld have a high priority.

       This Appendix gives background material on the evaluation
of penetration and feeder roads.      Extracted from Working
Papers 66 and 68, it first presents a theoretical discussion
of penetration and feeder roads, followed by a general assess-
ment     of areas with agricultural potential, which lead to the
definition of candidate road projetts to be evaluated by this
Study.     This is followed by a number of tables summarizing
the potential benefits that could be expected from these
roads.    The Appendix concludes with a presentation of the
scoring system used to derive the recommended priorities among
the penetration roads studied.

      DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF PENETRATION AND FEEDER
                            ROAD NETWORKS


     In most countries a large part of the road network - more
                                                                     '.
than half in terms of length - performs the sole or primary
function of serving rural areas.  This is especially the case
in most developing countries. Yet there remain enormous areas
of the world, as in Bolivia, where such roads do not exist, or
only sparsely, and then often in extremely poor condition.
Road building in such areas is intended, not so much to improve
travelling conditions for the traffic that already exists, if any,
but to make modern road transport feasible and hence to remove
a major obstacle to the economic development of the area.

     This section is concerned with the large-scale design and
evaluation of new road systems, or networks, in such areas.    It
is based on the concept of a two-class network.    A penetration
road, on which two-way traffic can maintain speeds of 50-60
Km!hr., is driven deep into the area and is served at intervals
by feeder roads built to a lower standard designed to take much
lower volumes of traffic with average speeds of about 30 Km/hr.

     The first part of this section will be theoretical. The se-
cond part will try to interpret the theoretical conclusions in
relation to the actual problems of Bolivia.

The Theoretical Framework                                             II

     In order to highlight the general problems of feeder road
development, rather than the special problems of any particular
area, some simplifying assumptions are made:

     (a)   the area is virgin territory which, in the absence of
           the roads, has no market value;

     (b)   the penetration road connects the area with a market
           in which or through which the surplus produce of the
           area may be sold;

     (c)   expected market prices, i.e. prices payable to pro-
           ducers or traders at the market, are known for the re-
           levant commodities; if the new penetration road does
           not commence at the market itself, but at a point on
           the road system - or on the rail, river or air system -
           distant from the market, the value of the commodities
           at that point may be imputed simply by deducting trans-
                                                                     '.
           port costs to the market from that point; this adjust-
           ment is made purely for convenience of presentation;




                            -464-
     (d)     production costs for each relevant commodity are
             uniform throughout the area; they include labour
             costs, whether paid in cash or in kind, and capital
             depreciation; they do not include any price, rent
             or tax paid for land because this, if it exists, is
             not a cost of production but a transfer payment in
             which some of the value of the land generated by the
             roadbuilding is extracted from the producer by
             another party;

     (e)     the expected excess of market price over production
             cost, per kilo, is the same for all relevant commo-
             dities; this is not a realistic assumption but is
             introduced in order to limit the problem to "whether
             or not to produce", and avoid the complications of
             "what to produce where".

     (f)     transport costs from point of production to market
             are paid either directly by the producer or indirect-
             ly through an equivalent deduction from the price re-
             ceived at his gate.

Objectives

     The construction of penetration and feeder roads may be
motivated by economic, social or political ends.  In this theore-
tical discussion it is assumed that the aim is purely economic.
The objective is to estimate whether the investment in roads is
likely to produce a worthwhile economic return.  Strictly there
are two objectives: first to determine the most profitable way
(to the community) of investing given amounts in roads, and se-
condly to determine the amount of such investment that will give
the maximum return over and above a required minimum rate.

     The investment cost consists of the construction costs of
the roads together with other necessary preliminary expenditure
designed to generate the expected future return.   This may in-
clude specifically agricultural investments such as irrigation
schemes or land drainage.  It may also include the costs of mov-
ing people into the area.  It should not include the cost of
facilities such as houses, schools and health clinics, if these
would have been provided anyway somewhere else.

     The return on the investment is the annual value of pro-
duce sold (at the commencement point of the penetration road)
less the production costs and the cost of transport to that
pOint.   It is assumed that the people working in the area would
otherwise have been subsistence farmers. Auto-consumption is
therefore not reckoned as additional production and is not in-
cluded as a return on investment. At the same time labour ex-
pended on production for the market is considered as labour re-
moved from subsistence production and is costed at its alter-
native value in subsistence farming_


                             -465-
Network Design

     The motivating factor is the surplus of market prices over
production costs (the cost-price surplus).  If products can be
transported to market at a cost less than this surplus there
will be a profit.  The farther the point of production is from
the market, the greater will be the transport cost and the less
the profit. Clearly there will be a boundary beyond which pro-
duction is no longer profitable, and this boundary marks the
"area of profitable production" (APP). For a given cost-price
surplus the size of this area will vary according to the quality
of the roads - the better the roads, the larger the area.   The
shape of the area will depend on the shape or design of the
road network.

     The road network which max~m~zes the APP will evidently be
relatively costly, with a high density of high-quality roads,
and will probably be unjustifiable as an investment. On the
other hand a much cheaper road network, of low quality and low
density, will generate a smaller area of profitable production
with a lower level of profitability on account of higher trans-
port costs both on and off the road.

     Clearly, in a given situation, there must be an optimal de-
sign and quality of road network, which will maximize the net
present value of road investment in the area.

     If w   = the cost-price difference, i.e. market price  - cost
              of production in pesos per kg.,
        a   = area of profitable production (APP) in sq.kms.,        '"
        y   = yield, in kgs per sq. km. ,                            ~

        T   = total cost of transport to market, on and off the
              roads,
        R   = annual cost of road maintenance,

then the annual benefit from the investment is:

        (wya - T - R) pesos,

Given a discount rate of i, the net present value V of road in-
vestment I, over a 20 year period, is:
          20
                                     -n
     V=     ~  (wya - T - R) (1 + i)    - I
                                                                      t



            n=1

in the simplest case where I takes place in one year and area
a is opened up immediately and produces a constant output each
year from the first year.  The design of the roads affects T,
and hence a, and also R and I. The object is to find the net-
work design that maximizes V.

Design Principles
     Let M be the commencement point of a new penetration road.
All commercial production from the outlying area has to be sold
at, or through, M.
     Transport costs may comprise four elements: C is the cost
                                                  1
per Kg-Km on a penetration road, C2 the cost on a feeder road,
and C3 the cost off the road. It-:is assumed that the route off
the road is always direct by the shortest path to the road which
minimizes the total cost of transport to M. There is also a
standing charge £, so that transport cost to M is



where Xl' X2 and X3 are the distances travelled in Kms.       The APP
is defined by the line C = w.
Case 1 - No Road
     Without any road all transport is directly cross-country
to M. The APP is a semi-circle defined, as in Figure 1, by
X3 = w - b. We are not concerned with the area along the
                    C

           ~ng roa   M.   Th e APP measures   IT    (w-b) 2

                                                      3
Case 2 - Single Penetration Road
      As sha!.m in Figure 12A-1, a penetration road is built from M
without feeder roads. The APP is defined by w = b + C1 X1 + C3 X3 •
Clearly production could extend along the road for a distance
w-b Kms. to P. The APP is V-shaped with a base spreading w-b
 C                                                                C
  1                                                                 3

(w-b) 2
C       C       •
    1       3

Case 3 - Penetration Road and One Additional Road
     Before extending the penetration road as far as P it would
be more profitable to build feeder roads opening up areas much
closer to M. The most profitable road actually is not a feeder
road but another direct connection to M, at right angles to the
penetration road. Clearly there could be one on both sides, as




                               -467-
                                                                     •


                                                                     •
in Figure 12A-2. Logically, assuming that these areas are equally
undeveloped, it would be more profitable to build three penetra-
tion roads (MA, ME, MC) each one-third the length of MP in
Figure 12A-1. The APP measures approximately:




which is much larger than in Case 2 and has a higher average
profitability since average costs to market are less.

Case 4 - Penetration Road and One Feeder Road

     We shall now assume that the main direction of intended de-
velopment is along the initial penetration road but that there
is also a road of feeder road standard joining the penetration
road at right angles at M.  It is clearly not a feeder road and
will be called the base lateral road,

       We now consider the introduction of a feeder road. A
feeder road serves two purposes: (1) to increase the APP, and
(2) to reduce transport costs from areas already in the APP.
The most profitable location for a single feeder road will de-
pend on the value of C (off-the-road costs). The higher is
                        3
C 3 ' the smaller will be the APP produced by the penetration road
and the greater will be the relative impact of a feeder road in
increasing the APP. In Figure 12A-3 two positions are shown (left
and right of the penetration road).  It is evident that the road
on the left, AB, is the maximum feasible distance from M. Any
road farther away from M, like CD, would obviously entail higher
transport costs for the whole area that it opened up, which area     ,
would be smaller than that opened up by AB.
                                                                     •
     A road closer to M would involve some overlapping or dupli-
cation of APP.  There is little advantage in this overlapping,       •
unless it is substantial, because the overlapped areas lie near
the edge of both areas; in other words they are almost equally       •
poorly served by the two roads to which they have access.  The
advantage of locating the feeder road closer to M is that it
opens up an area closer to M with lower average transport costs;
but because of overlapping the addition to APP may be smaller.
                                                                     •
     The optimal solution to this problem must depend on the
particular situation, especially on the values of C 3 (off-road
costs) and y (yield per sq.Km.).  In Figure 12A-3 if is assumed
that C = 4C 2 = 8C ,

CASE       4
                                FIGURE   12 A-3
 Case 5 - A Network of Rectangular Feeder Roads
      The addition of successive feeder roads involves a repeti-
 tion of the problem described in Case 4, namely the problem of
 spacing. Figure 12A-4 shows the APP resulting from a penetration
road with rectangular feeder roads at 10 km intervals.
      In this example, transport costs are taken as follows:
      C1   =   0.0025 pesos per Kg-KID
      C2   =   0.005 pesos per Kg-KID
      C3   =   0.01 pesos per Kg-KID

     The values for C1 and C2 are taken from Baquero's formulae,
                               * The value C . is an arbitrary
with Bolivian prices as at 1977.              3
choice. It represents a terrain where produce can be moved re-
latively easily and cheaply along farm tracks created and main-
tained by the farm workers themselves.
      For w (the cost-price difference), a series of values are
 taken, from 0.1 to 1.0 pesos per Kg. As w increases, the APP
 increases rapidly.
      A number of conclusions arise from this example.
        (1) The values of w considered are small. With market
prices at Santa Cruz of around 17 pesos per Kg. for coffee and
groundnuts, 10 for soya, between 6 and 12 for meat carcass,
2 1/2 for rice, 2 for maize and 1.7 for yuca, values of w bet-
ween 0.1 and 1.0 are relatively small. Given reasonably good
conditions for producing such crops, production costs are cer-
tainly low enough to make these values of w easily achievable.
And yet with these modest values the size of the APP becomes
enormous. When w = 0.5 the APP extends nearly 200 Km. along
the penetration road and reaches out 90 KID on each side along
the top lateral road. The size of this area is about 22,500
sq. KID.
     (2)   For some products, like bananas and sugar cane, with
a low price-volume ratio, such a large APP is not feasible.



*   In order to give more realistic costs for the future, a
    price of $b 5 per litre has been used.




                                -469-
                                                                             .
                                                                             ).




      (3)  The road network assumed in this example is rudimen-
tary.   It consists of a two-lane gravel penetration road and
single-lane, earth feeder roads at 10 Km. intervals.   The in-
vestment in roads is certainly not extravagant but even so it
must be shown to be economically justified.

      (4)   An optimistic value was assumed for C (off-road costs).
                                               3
This could be of critical importance.  It assumes that, except
near the periphery of the APP, farmers will cultivate land up
to 5 Km. from a road and will manage to haul their produce to
the road by one means or another. Apart from the actual cost
of doing this, it implies that rights of way will be established
to enable the farmers whose land does not border the road to ob-
tain access.  It implies, in other words, a new class of public
roads, being the crudest form of farm tracks necessary to give
access. Whether these tracks would need to take motor vehicles
or would be restricted to pedestrians, animals and carts, would
depend on local circumstances.

     Clearly, if feeder roads had to b~ at 5 Km. intervals in
order to generate the same APP, investment costs would be nearly
doubled, as would road maintenance costs.

      (5) From an analysis of this kind one can produce a table
of essential statistics about the APP, given the values of w,
C , C , C and the spacing of feeder roads, for the rectangular
 1    2   3
pattern as described.   The table shows, for different values of
w, the size of the APP, the length of roads required, their
capital and maintenance costs, the total transport costs of pro-
duce to market (for any value of y) and the gross and net profits
thus generated.   From these figures can be deduced an annual rate
of return on the investment, assuming complete development of the
area.   It is not possible to deduce an overall rate of return or
net present value without introducing major new assumptions about
the rate of development over time.

     Three such tables are shown in Tables 12A-1 to 12A-3 with feeder road
spacing of 10 Km., 20 Km., and 40 Km. respectively.        The annual
rates of return on investIrent are given in Table 12A-4.   The tables
show that, while a closer spacing leads to a larger APP and a
greater profit, the increased profit is relatively small compared
with the extra costs of road construction and maintenance.

     In Tables 12A-1 to 12A-3 the oosts and profits related to the volume
of production (i.e columns 5-8) are given as a multiple of ~,
the yield per hectare in kilograms. A typical yield is between
1000 and 2000 Kgs. per hectare. Whatever the yield, these figures
of cost and profit must be multiplied by the yield.          To give a
general idea, one may take y = 1000 as a minimum. This assump-
tion is employed for Table 12A-4.

     In Table 12A-4 it can be seen that when w is small, 1. e. only
0.1 or 0.2, the rate of return of road investment is very low,
but as w increases the rate of return rises very rapidly. The
annual surplus is not affected much by the density, i.e. the
spacing of feeder roads, because the extra profits generated by
closer spacing are partly offset by higher road maintenance
costs.
      When ~ = 0.6, the highest annual surplus comes from the 10
Km. spacing, but the additional surplus of $b 47 mn. (over the
40 KID. spacing) represents only 5 percent on the additional road
investment, but the 20 KID. spacing gives 8% on the increment.
      Clearly these results are critically dependent on the level
of off-road costs assumed. No capital or maintenance costs have
been included for off-road tracks. If these are taken into ac-
count, the 20 KID. spacing is almost certainly preferable to the
40 KID., and the 10 KID. spacing could be preferable to the 20
KID. spacing although this seems unlikely.
Case 6 - A Network of Radial Feeder Roads
     A disadvantage of rectangular road systems is that all traf-
fic going to market, except that originating on the penetration
road, has to travel along two sides of a triangle rather than di-
rectly along the third side. The extent of this disadvantage de-
pends on the width of the APP. This is clear from Figure 12A-5,
as follows:
Distance MO = a KID. Cost of transport along MO = 2.5 pesos/ton.
Distance OA = 1a KID. Cost of transport from M to A via 0 = 5.0

road direct from M to A = 5.59 pesos/ton. In this case the
superiority of the penetration road more than offsets the extra
distance involved. But at point B, where OB = a, a direct feeder
route would be cheaper. This iss~ in Table 12A-5. As one pro-
ceeds farther away from the penetration road the disadvantage
of the rectangular route becomes progressively greater.
     On the other hand, as one proceeds farther along the penetra-
tion road the advantage of the penetration road obviously increa-
ses and the width of the APP diminishes.
     The form of a pure radial system is shown in Figure 12A-6. A
fairly uniform spacing between roads is achieved by means of suc-
cessive branching while maintaining as far as possible the radial
directions of the roads.

CASE •
     One disadvantage of this system is that it fails to con-
centrate, or channelize, the traffic, thus providing little
reason for upgrading any of the roads above the standards of
feeder roads. Hence the APP of such a system does not extend
so far as that of the two-class rectangular system. It only
extends 62 percent as far as that of the penetration road con-
sidered in Case 5.
     The shape of the APP of a radial system is roughly semi-
circular, rather than triangular as in Case 5. It measures
slightly less, abut 98 percent of the triangular APP. See Fi-
gure 12A-7.
     The principal drawback of the pure radial system, however,
is that is takes more road to cover an equal area with a given
maximum spacing. Its semicircular APP can be covered by a rec-
tangular system of only 56 percent the length of roads. This
occurs because the branching characteristic of the radial sys-
tem leads to a large amount of "redundant" accessibility.
Case 7 - Semiradial Network of Feeder Roads
     It is clear from Case 6 that both rectangular and radial
systems have fundamental drawbacks; the rectangular system gene-
rates journeys much longer and often more costly than the radial
system, but the latter uses far more roadway and provides no op-
portunity for the economies of scale inherent in a more chan-
nelized system.
     A semiradial system is a hybrid of the two former systems.
It is structured round a penetration road but the feeder roads
are angled (as in Figure 12A-"8) so as to minimize the combined cost
of travelling along the feeder road and penetration road to the
market. The optimal angle depends on the ratio of transport
costs per Km. on the two roads. Given the costs adopted in this
paper the optimal angle is 60 degrees. The angle, however, is
not critical.
     Figure 12A-8 indicates the shape of the semi-radial APP for a
spacing of 20 Km. The system has a slight disadvantage in that,
because of the angling of the feeder roads, a somewhat greater
length of road is needed to cover a given area, with a given
maximum spacing, than with the rectangular system. Two calcula-
tions were made; one with a rectangular area, the other with a
triangular area; in both cases the semiradial system required
more road, by 8 percent and 9 percent respectively.
     Figure UA-8 is based on a value of w = 0.55 and an angle of
45 degrees. The APP was calculated for a number of deSigns,
building up to the one shown, as follows:



                             -477-
 (1)    Penetration road with no other roads:         APP = 13,333 Sq.Km.
 (2)    P. R. with base lateral road:                 APP = 14,290 Sq.KIn.
 (3 )   P.R. with first radial feeder:                APP = 14,514 Sq.KIn.
(4)     P.R. with base lateral and first feeder: ,APP       = 15,490 Sq.KIn.
(5)     P. R. with base lateral and feeders at        APP = 19,200 Sq.Km.
           40 KIn. spacing:
(6)     P.R. with base lateral and feeders at         APP   = 20,012 Sq.Km.
          20 KIn. spacing:
(7)     P. R. with base lateral and feeders at        APP   =   20,750 Sq.Km.
           10 KIn. spacing:
(8)     P.R. with base lateral and feeders at         APP   =   21,000 Sq.KIn.
          5 Km. spacing:
     These figures show that additional feeder roads have re-
latively little effect in increasing the APP. What they do is
to reduce transport costs within the APP and hence increase the
profitability of the area. But this conclusion is critically
dependent on the off-road transport costs. If these off-road
costs were much higher than the value assumed, the effect of
closer spacing would be much greater.
    In Fiqure 12A-:-9, a serniradial. system is shown with 10 KIn. spac-
ing, and the APPs for different values of w (from 0.1 to 0.6)
are indicated.'                                   -
     In Tables 12A-6 and 12A-7, the characteristics of the APP for spacing of
10 Krn. and 20 Km., are qiven. These tables are comparable
with Tcibles 12A-1 and 12A-2 for the rectangular system. The serniradial
system produces slightly greater net profits for any given
value of w, because average transport costs are less and the APP
is a bit larger. But road investment is a little higher for a
given APP, and road maintenance costs (per area cultivated) are
marginally less because of the lower volume of traffic.
    In Table 12A-8, the annual rates of return on investments are
shown, assuming y = 1,000. It can be seen, that, except at low
values of ~, high rates of return result.
    A comparison with Table 12A-4, referring to the rectangular
system, shows almost identical rates of return for each value
of w. But this is somewhat misleading because the APPs in the
semiradial system are more than 11 percent larger than in the
rectangular system.

         NB.   (a) and (b) refer to spacing at 10 Km. and 20 Km. respectively.                         (c) refers
               to spacing of 10 KID. with same area cultivated as in Case Sa.
                                                                       II



       If the two systems are compared for identical APPs (or
more accurately, identical areas of cultivation), the semi-
radial system shows a better rate of return on road investment,
but only slightly. The results are given in columns (c) of             'I,
Table 12A-S. For instance, when w = 0.5, the semiradial system
gives 15.1 percent, the rectangular system 13.9 percent.
     Another pOint that needs careful interpretation is the
effect of spacing. Table 12A-S, like Table 12A-4, gives higher rates
of return on 20 Km. spacing than on 10 Km. spacing. But, pro-
vided the rates are high enough, the latter choice is to be
preferred. Comparing columns (b) and (c), at w = 0.5, the
return on the incremental investment in (c) is only $b 11 mn.
on $b 332 mn., i.e. 3.3 percent, which is low; at higher values
of w the incremental rate of return reaches 5.5 percent, which
is still low. But one must take into account that no allowance
has been made for the costs of constructing and maintaining
farm tracks. At 20 Km. spacing, these costs would be roughly
double the costs at 10 Km. spacing. Also one must recall that
tHe assumed operating cost of off-road transport, which was
twice the cost on a feeder road, implies a track of reasonable
quality which would cost much more to provide in some terrains         lI,
than in others. The question of optimal spacing is obviously
critically dependent upon the nature of the terrain and, in            "I

particular, the problem of reaching the feeder road during the
wet season.
Case S - Alternative Semiradial Network
     It is apparent from both Case 7 and Case 5 that the weak
parts of the network are in the outer areas near the base la-
teral road. These areas do not benefit from the penetration
road; consequently the APP does not extend very far (relatively)       'III
from the market.
     It is also apparent that if the base lateral road, or part
of it, were built as a penetration road rather than as a feeder
road, the investment might yield a better return than some of
the investment at the far end of the eXisting penetration road
and its feeders.
     Case S therefore consists of a penetration road as the
base lateral in addition to the original penetration road. This
is shown in Figure 12A-10. The comparable form of rectangular sys-     ,,"
tem is shown in Figure 12A-11. An estimate has been made of the
APP characteristics of the semiradial network for one case, where
w = 0.4. The results are as follows, in comparison with Case 7a.

but for a more marginal case the cheaper, single penetration
road would be better.

               FEEDER ROAD POLICY IN BOLIVIA

       The foregoing pages have been theoretical. Their purpose      ''I<
was to gain a better understanding of the issues and factors in-
volved in the design and evaluation of penetration and feeder
roads. An attempt will now be made to draw some practical con-
clusions of relevance to the problems facing Bolivia at the pre-
sent time.
Removal of Simplifying Assumptions
      The analysis was facilitated by a number of specific as-
sumptions outlined earlier. In moving  from theory to practice,
it is first necessary to remove these simplifications. In fact,
most of the assumptions made are quite acceptable in many parts
of BoliVia. There are large areas of nearly virgin territory.
There are large expanses of land which is either homogeneous or
where lack of homogeneity does not invalidate the analysis of
feeder roads. There are certainly many places where crops of
various kinds could be grown at a cost of production substantially
below market prices.
      The only assumption made which was clearly not realistic
was the assumption that the cost-price surplus was the same for
all relevant crops in an area. This is obviously not true but
the introduction of different crops with different cost-price
surpluses (i.e different values of w) merely complicates the
analysis; it does not invalidate it~
     It is necessary, however, to examine more carefully the
question of the cost-price surplus before proceeding any fur-
ther, because the whole analysis depends upon it.
The Cost-price Surplus
     There is without doubt a clear surplus between the poten-
                                                                     ••
tial cost of production and current market price of many crops
studied in the penetration road studies carried out as part of
the National Transport Study. But two important problems arise.
First, can one rely upon the stability of market prices in the
future? With every major crop the past history of world prices
has shown tremendous fluctuations. Prices have soared at times,
only to 'be followed after a few years by a catastrophic crash.
The World Bank has published long-term forecasts of agricultural
and mineral prices but these do not, of course, attempt to in-
clude the violent fluctuations which seem to be an inevitable         'Ii
characteristic of these markets.




                            -484-
                                                                      '.
     The magnitude of these fluctuations in world prices, from
which Bolivia cannot escape, is far bigger than the cost-price
surpluses considered in the foregoing analysis. Hence the
element of uncertainty and risk must play a large part in the
minds of potential producers before they decide to go into
these undeveloped areas. The existence of a current cost-price
surplus is by no means enough to attract producers.

     Secondly, apart from movement of world prices, what will
be the local impact of a big increase in the production of cer-
tain crops? The sizes of area and the magnitudes of production
considered in the analysis are enormous. There are no inter-
nal markets in Bolivia capable of absorbing the huge volumes of
production indicated. Agricultural production on the scale sug-
gested could lead rapidly to a collapse of local prices. Hence
production must either be limited to the capacity of Bolivian
markets or be clearly destined for export.

     The problem of marketing the production of these new areas
is of dominant importance.  In other words, where can the pro-
duce be sold, at what price, and at what cost of transport?
There is no point in considering feeder road development at all
until one is sure that there is a realistic possibility of mar-
keting the produce of the area at a profit. And the scale of
profitable production possible may be far less than suggested
in the analysis. The analysis assumes that market price is in-
dependent of the volume of supply from the area. With some
crops, where there is access to major foreign markets, this may
be true; with others, it is definitely not true.

The Simple Penetration Road

     Given a realistic possibility of marketing the produce of
the area at a profit, one may proceed to the question of road
development.  It is shown very easily that the concept of a
long penetration road makes no economic sense unless it is sup-
ported by a network of feeder roads.  There is no economic case
for building a long penetration road as a single project.   If
it is built at all, it should be built section by section, with
feeder road support, over a long period of time depending on
the speed with which agricultural development takes place.

     There is, of course, the possibility that such a road may
serve the additional function of a link in the national highway
system.  In this case, it must be evaluated as such, not just
as a development road.
                                                                   ,.
                                                                   •
                                                                   ....
Location of Penetration Roads
                                                                   •
      It is evident that these roads should be located near to
the target markets, other things being equal. It is clearly
uneconomic to open up more distant areas before the nearer areas
have been developed, unless the productive potential of the for-
mer areas is sufficiently superior to justify it. There is a
natural desire to develop fertile land and to grow the crops
that it is best suited to, but this may be uneconomic if the
land is badly situated relative to "markets and transport. It       •
mfiY be better to develop inferior land and to grow the crops
t at can be sold at a profit rather than the crops that can be
grown most easily.
     In general, therefore, unless there is a demonstrable case
for going otherwise, penetration roads should be pushed out gra-
dually from the major markets and should be supported by feeder
roads designed to open up first the land nearest to the markets.
Pattern of Feeder Roads
                                                                   ..
                                                                   ..
     The analysis has considered the three main patterns of
feeder roads - rectangular, radial and semiradial - and has con-   •
                                                                   ...
cluded that the semiradial system is most economic. This con-
clusion depends upon the simple situation where an agricultural
area is focused on a single market. In a more complex case,
where produce is being sold in two or more markets, the rectan-
                                                                   ..
gular pattern could be preferable.
     In Bolivia, however, the former situation seems to be most
common. There must therefore be a case for trying to develop
                                                                   •
feeder roads on the semiradial principle.
     The optimal angle of semiradial feeder roads depends on the
relative operating costs on feeder and penetration roads.
     It was shown that a single penetration road with feeders      'W

may not be the most efficient pattern. A better return on in-
vestment and a larger APP can be obtained from two penetration
roads at right angles, with feeder roads of the semiradial or,      '!!!
depending on the geographical situation, rectangular type.
Spacing
     The analysis has shown the importance of spacing. It is
undesirable to space feeder roads so widely that large areas of
land between the roads remain undeveloped. It is also undesira-
ble to space them so closely that their fields of influence
overlap unduly.




                           -486-
     The optimal spacing depends largely on the cost of trans-
port off the road. Clearly, this varies from one area to another
according to the type of terrain. Very little seems to be known
about off-road costs or about the distances from the road that
farmers are willing to develop.
     The idea was mentioned of a separate class of public road,
below the level of feeder roads. If feeder roads are much far-
ther apart than the typical width of two farms, or if farms are
fragmented, then public roads (or tracks) are essential to give
access to the feeder roads themselves. This is a question that
perhaps needs further study.
The Area of Profitable Production
     The calculation showed that enormous areas could, in theory,
be profitably developed, given quite small cost-price surpluses.
In other words, the costs of providing feeder roads and using
them are relatively modest. The cost of transport is not the
major question. More jimportant are the questions of actually pro-
moting the agricultural development and, as already discussed,
marketing the produce.
     In practice, the estimated areas of profitable production
would take decades to develop. The question of "area of influence"
therefore becomes relatively unimportant. Much more important is
the question of speed of development.
Transport Costs
     It should be added that the costs of building and using roads
were estimated in flat, easy terrain. In mountainous or swampy
country the costs could be considerably higher.
Labor
     One of the major factors in promoting the development of
virgin lands is the immigration of labor. The rate of return on
the road investment depends crucially on the speed with which de-
velopment occurs, and this depends mainly on the speed of immigra-
tion or colonization. The whole question of development has to
be considered in the light of migration. This question is just
as relevant to the economic evaluation of this sort of road in-
vestment as is the question of agricultural potential.
     In particular, in this Study, all penetration or feeder road
projects should ultimately be considered as a whole since they
all depend on the same source of labor.
     It must be emphasized that the value of the road investment
depends crucially on the speed with which the developmental
impact builds up. The rate of investment of this kind must be
related to the rate at which development can realistally take
place. If too many penetration and feeder roads are provided
too soon, much of the investment will lie adle and unproductive
for a long time.

Analysis of Potential Agricultural Areas

     This assessment is largely based on the Map of vegetation
and Land Use produced by the ERTS and GEOBOL.   They divide the    ''II
country into eight land categories of which only four are
suitable for agriculture, though these four cover 87 percent
of the national territory. The category most exploited at
present is called "pasture, with and without shrubs" which,
for our purpose, should be divided into "wet" and "not wet";       ...
both can be used for million hectares. The second category
consists of forest which, in places, could be cleared and
used for cultivation or iliivestock; there could be about 46.6
million hectares used in this way, after allowing for areas
                                                                   '.
that should remain under forest as a protection against
erosion.

     The third category is land under cultivation or lying
fallow.  This occupies only 2.9 million hectares but could be      ''II
expanded to 22 million hectares by the utilization of prairies
and forests in two former categories. Finally there are
another 2.4 million hectares of general inundated land suitable
only for water buffalo.

      Figure 12-2 of the Main Report shows the areas under
production, but only areas where the farming is relatively
intensive.   In addition there are large areas under extensive
farming, which is generally extremely extensive and primitive.
Virtually no capital is employed and little is done to maintain,
let alone improve, the fertility of the land. The land is not
fenced, nor drained, and there is practically no attempt to
irrigate where this is needed. Yields are very low. The
                                                                   '.
                                                                   ,it

intensive farming is not intensive by, say, European standards,
but use is made of machinery, fertilizers and pesticides,
fields are fenced, and efforts are made to counter the
                                                                   ..
problems of climate and season. Yields per hectare are there-
fore much higher, though still low by the standards of really
intensive farming.
                                                                   ..
     This distinction is of vital importance. There are large
areas of extensive farming but only a few small areas of
relatively intensive farming.  For our purpose the extensive
areas can be considered as largely unexploited; their potential
is much greater than their current production.                     .
     Not surprisingly, all the areas of intensive farming are
served by road, but much of the extensive farming is in areas
devoid of roads. These areas are mainly in the Beni and North
and West Santa Cruz.

     In Northern La Paz, two roads are suggested in Iturralde
province to open up a large, low area for coffee, rice and
citrus fruits for the La Paz market, also timber for San Bue-
naventura and possible cattle for export to Per~ and Chile.
A third road, mainly in Franz Tamayo province, passes through
part of the lower Altiplano where sheep and forest products
could be produced. In Pando two roads are proposed in country
good for rubber and tropical nuts, with a view to exportation
via Guayaramer!n and the Amazon.
     Big opportunities are seen for the development of beef
cattle but these have to be linked with export outlets. In
the Beni five roads are designed to open up intensive cattle-
rearing for export partly through the Amazon to Europe and
partly by air to Per~ and Chile. In the far east a road (with
an alternative route) is intended to connect Pampas de San
Mat!as with the rest of the country, and further south a road
from Puerto Su~rez is designed to stimulate cattle production
for export via the R!o Paraguay.
     This last road continues through the Tucavaca valley in
order to open up a large area for the cultivation of cereals,
to replace imports, and also citrus fruits, rice and soya for
export down the R!o Paraguay. It is connected by another new
road to the city of Santa Cruz, passing through an area
suitable for yuca. Farther south a road is proposed to open
up a large inaccessible area in Chuquisaca and Tarija, in order
to exploit its varied climates and fertile valleys for the
production of olives, vines and many other fruits both temperate
and subtropical.
     Finally, in the Brazilian Shield, a long road is suggested
with the intention of exploiting mineral deposits, although
the location and commercial feasibility of such deposits have
not yet been adequately established.

      The selected road proposals have been defined as sixteen
separate projects. Each one can be divided, of course, into

     For analysis and evaluation they can be treated in seven
groups. Three are centered on Ixiarnas in Northern La Paz. Two
are linked in the Pando. Five are designed to open up cattle
farming in the Beni. Two are alternative routes to San Matias,
again in cattle country. Two are linked in an effort to promote
soya, meat and timber production for export from the Rio
Paraguay. One goes to the far south of Tarija, and finally
there is one running along the Brazilian Shield which is
dependent on the disoover:y of worthwhile mineral deposits there.

     All these roads., if builtin their entirety, would
eventually form links in the national or international road
network and could therefore serve through-traffic unrelated to
the economic development that they are designed to generate.
This traffic could only appear, of course, if and when a
complete link was built, and in most cases the volumes o·f such
traffic would be trivial. Six of the roads terminate at the
frontier, where they would attract very little traffic. The
only ones that are close to an urban area of any size are
No. 735,Tunasto San Jos~ de Chiquitos, which gives access
to Santa Cruz from the east, and No. 677 which runs north from
Trinidad to San Rarn6n, but both these roads are situated in
areas of very sparse population.

     The sixteen roads are listed in the Main Report Volume
with their length and estimated construction cost. The roads
are assumed to be 6 meters wide in mountainous terrain, other-
wise 8 meters wide, and gravel-surfaced except in the Beni
and Pando where they are made of earth. Feeder roads are
4 1/2 meters wide and earth-surfaced.

     The estimated construction cost of all these roads,
(4,174 km) is about $b 10,600 million ($US 530 million) at
1977 prices. If they were supported by feeder roads at, say,
10 km or 5 km intervals, in cattle and other country respectively,


                                                                       •
                                                                       'II

extending an average of 15 km on both sides, this would open up
10 million hectares, i.e. about 9 percent of the area of Boli-
via. * This amount of feeder roads is purely hypothetical, to
give an idea of the magnitude of cost involved. The total of
$b 27,100 million ($US 1,355 million) equals about one-third
of the predicted budget for all public investment in transport
during the next 20 years, or about 65 percent of the available
budget for roads outside urban areas.

     It is clear, therefore, that whatever the value of these
roads, they are not all likely to be built during the next
20 years. A process of selection and ranking is essential.




*   These estimates omit road No.12, which is an alternative
    to road No. 13, and allocate only 50 km of feeder road to
    the mineral road No. 11.

               PENETRATION ROAD EVALUATION
                        CRITERIA




    See Chapter 12, section entitled Evaluation of Potential
RQads.

    Sixteen penetration roads have been designed with the
object of helping to promote agricultural (or, in one case,
mineral) development in currently inaccessible parts of the
country, at the same time boosting export earnings and re-
distributing population in a way calculated to raise
productivity and incomes. The justification of these roads,
and of the feeder roads that are generally an essential
accessory, lies in the extent to which they generate surplus
profits, over and above the normal return expected on capital




                                                                     •
                          -504-
employed in the productive activities themselves. These
surplus profits must be large enough to provide an acceptable
return on the capital cost of the roads and to cover road
maintenance costs if these are not already covered by
vehicle taxation.
     In practice it would be spurious to predict the
economic rate of return on these penetration roads, because
there are too many uncertainties. The biggest uncertainty is
the speed of development, which sharply affects the rate of
return. Market prices for primary commodities are notoriously
unpredictable, and they are often of critical importance to
the rate of return. Production and transport costs are
relatively easy to predict but yields cannot be known
reliably until farmers have actually started to grow crops
in the areas under consideration. The scale of development
is also very difficult to predict since it is influenced by
non-economic factors like the supply of migrants and
considerations of climate, culture and environment.
     The approach adopted here, therefore, has been to
calculate, in terms of hectares and profit margins, the
minimum amount of development necessary to justify the cost
of road construction and maintenance, allowing a reasonable
gestation period, and then to assess the probability that
this minimum will be achieved. This assessment cannot depend
solely on quantifiable factors: it must contain a number of
difficult judgements concerning, for example, migrants'
reactions, market prospects and methods of production.
     In reaching this assessment a scoring system was
used. A score    was   given to each of several criteria
on which the assessment will be based. The score will
usually be between 0 and 10 but in one case the upper limit
is 15, in another 5. The selected criteria are as follows:
     (1)   Level of Benefits Needed to Justify Road Investment
                 The data are taken from Table 12-2 of the Main Report. As
           was explained before, the required benefits per developed
           hectare diminish as the area of influence, i.e. the
           number of hectares developed increases. But the
           general level (or curve) for some roads is higher
           than for others. For an area of influence of 20,000
           hectares, the required benefits per hectare vary
           between 850 and 2,950 pesos.
                Scoring system: 0 = 3,000 pesos, 10      = 500   pesos
           with linear interpolation.



                               -505-
(2)   Estimated Level of    Pro~itability       at 1977 Prices                 "Ill



           The profit margins, in pesos/hectare, naturally
      vary for different crops. A weighted average has to
      be arrived at by judging the relative areas devoted
      to each crop.      '

           Scoring system:  0 = 500 pesos/ha.              10      =   3,000
      pesos/ha. 15 = 4,250 pesos/ha or more.

           Thus all projects must score more than 10 on
      the first two criteria combined if they are to be
      profitable.

(3)   Price Variability
           The prices of some commodities are highly
      variable, which introduces an additional risk into
      their production. World commodity prices are
      recorded since 1955 by the World Bank, in both
      current and constant dollars. Using the constant
      dollar series, a measure of variability is the
      standard deviation divided by the mean.

              Scoring system:   0   =   0.35 or more: 10       =   0.15 or
      less.

(4)   Price Prospects

           The World Bank gives forecasts for world
      commodity prices to 1990. Obviously these cannot                                •
      be accepted as reliable but they do give an indication
      of the prospects as viewed by one competent authority.
      As a measure, we take the 1990 forecast (in constant
      dollars) as a ratio' of the 1977 price.

              Scoring system:   o = 0.8    or less: 10     =    1.8 or
      more.

(5)   Market Size

           It is extremely difficult to assess market size.
      In some cases we have described the market as "small ll ,
      in other cases "without practical limit". It is
      difficult to be more precise. One can guess in broad
      terms the number of hectares that the market might
      support.

           Scoring system: 0 = 0; 1         =
                                       10,000: 2 = 20,000:
      3 = 40,000; 4 = 80,000; 5 = 120,000; 6 = 200,000;
      7 = 320,000: 8 = 460,000; 9 = 600,000: 10 = 750,000
      or more.


                           -506-
(6)   Labor Intensiveness

           The more labor required per hectare, the more
      difficult it is to attract the required number of
      migrants. Labor intensiveness varies from 2.5 to 68
      man-days per hectare for the different roads.

           Scoring system:             0   = 100    man-days!ha; 10   =   0
      man-days!ha.

(7)   Capital Intensiveness

           The more capital required per hectare, the more
      difficult it is to attract development.  Insufficient
      data are available to permit quantification of capital
      requirements.

           Some products clearly need more capital than
      others.  In particular, products with a long gestation
      period like cattle, coffee, cocoa, citrus fruits and
      olives, require working capital to finance the early
      years when there is little or no income. Lacking data
      on these capital costs, a rough classification will
      be used to show the relative capital needs per hectare
      of the different areas.

           Scoring system:             0   = High   capital requirement.
                                      10   =   Zero capital requirement.

(8)   Climate

           The attractiveness of the climate to live in,
      from the point of view of migrants from the Alti-
      plano and Valleys, will be expressed as a function
      of temperature and humidity.

           Scoring system:             0   =   Relatively bad.
                                       5   =   Relatively good.

(9)   Isolation

           Isolation will be measured as the sum S where:

           S    =   a
                        1
                            + a 2 + a 3 + a 4 + as

                                   -507-
        The cities are defined as the five urban centers
    which maximize S. Distances are straight-line distances
    taken from a point 20 km along the penetration road.
    Populations are taken from the 1976 census.   Only
    urban centers exceeding 5,000 in population are
    considered.

             Scoring system:    0   =   0.1; 10   =   0.4.

(10) Distance from Altiplano and Valleys

        The Altiplano and Valleys cover a large area and
    one cannot make a precise measurement of distances
    to and from this area. The penetration roads are
    therefore ranked in order of their distance to the
    nearest importance area of population within the
    Altiplano or the Valleys.


             Scoring system:    0 = farthest; 10 = nearest.

             EVALUATION OF THE SANTA BARBARA-BELLA VISTA HIGHWAY


           Much of the highway from La Paz to San Borja is either under
      construction or committed and there remains only one section to
      be evaluated between Santa B~rbara and Bella Vista. An evalua-
      tion of this highway already exists, made as part of the De Leuw
      Cather, Canada Ltd. (DELCANDA) Study (1) of the La Paz- Rio Alto
      Beni route and completed in 1974. Since then, costs have changed
      and it becomes worthwhile to re-evaluate the project using costs
      and benefits compatible with the other evaluations undertaken in
      this Study.

      Project Costs

           The new road would have a length of 99 km compared with
      the existing road length of 111.5 km. The cost of the road can
      be estimated as follows, based on the DELCANDA Study, and the
      contract cost of the La Paz-Cotapata section:

                                                              COST IN US$ MILLICNS
      La Paz-cotapata             DEICANDA estimate (1973)            20.843
          (48 kIn)                Contract cost (1977)               7l.
      Santa B6rbara-Bella Vista   DELCANDA estimate (1973)           43.255
          (99 kIn)                Hence, 1977 estimate              146.

            Hence, cost in pesos (1977) = $b2900             millions.
                     cost in pesos (1989)      =   $b3500    millions.

          It is possible that the costs arrived at by this calculation
      are misleadingly high. Many~in SNC believe that the costs
      for the La Paz-Cotapata contract are unnecessarily high,
      being influenced in part by the fact that only one tender
      was received for this contract. Thus the high costs are not
      necessarily solely attributable to the difficult terrain.

           It is hoped that costs can, indeed, be reduced. The
      conclusion of this appendix is that Santa Barbara-Bella Vista
      cannot be justified economically at these construction costs.
      Furthermore, it is recommended in Chapter 12 that ways are
      found to reduce costs, and if one of these ways is stricter
      control of the contract, so much the better.

           The rest of this appendix continues to assume the costs
      estimated above.

      (Feasibility Study of the La Paz-Alto Beni River Highway)
      De Leuw Cather, Ltd. and Prudencio Claros y Asociados for
      Ministry of Transport, Communications and Civil Aeronautics,
      La Paz, 1974.                -510-
Estimated Traffic

     Traffic estimates were available from two sources; the
model estimates made by this Study and the earlier estimates
made by DELCANDA. The model estimates gave low volumes on
this route while the DELCANDA forecasts were very high.                                 '.
     The low model forecasts are explained by the fact that
Trinidad, the end point of the complete route, will also be
served by two additional new roads in 1989, one from Santa
Cruz (now under construction) and one from Cochabamba (evalu-
ated and recommended by this Study) and this is likely to em-
phasize the links between Trinidad and these two cities at the
expense of the link with La Paz. On the other hand, the model
estimates do not satisfactorily take account of the potential for
development in the La Paz-San Borja corridor and so are not en-                         'If

tirely acceptable as they stand.

     The high forecasts of DELCANDA are also not acceptable,
being based on far too optimistic growth rates. This can be
demonstrated by comparing DELCANDA normal traffic forecasts with
other counts as shown in Table 12B-1.

     In other words, apart from the section Cotapata-Santa B~n­
bara (where traffic figures appear to be anomalous), observed
growth has been very much less than predicted by DELCANDA.    In
fact, the weighted average of traffic growth on the section
La Paz-Caranavi was observed to be negative from 1973 to 1978,                          I
a 4 percent per year increase from 1973 to 1979, and 3 percent
increase from 1973 to 1980, compared with a 9 percent per year
increase predicted by DELCANDA. Possibly the comparatively                              ,Ii
large observed increase in traffic in the Cotapata-Santa B~nbara
sections is connected with the La Paz-Cotapata construction                            'II
traffic. The counts on either side certainly do not indicate a
growth in long distance traffic.                                                        .,
     A compromise was adopted to obtain traffic volumes for use
in the analysis. The without-project case traffic volumes were
obtained by increasing 1977 observed volumes by 4 percent per
year. With-project volumes were obtained by adding the generated
traffic estimated in the DELCANDA Study (446 vehicles per day) .
This gave the following daily flows:

Project Benefits

     These come from four sources:

     1.   Change in road maintenance costs.
     2.   Change in vehicle operating costs (including passenger
            time costs) •
     3.   Meat traffic benefits.
     4.   Agricultural benefits.

     Road maintenance costs increase with the project due mainly
to higher traffic volumes. They are calculated using the equa-
tions:

     Without-Project (gravel)        =   (12T   + 3,000) x W x L    'III!


     With-Project (paved)            =     6T + 5,000) x W x L

          Where T   =   Daily traffic
                W   =   Width in meters
                L   =   Length in krns

     The cost increase with project was calculated as $b 3.3
million per year.

     Operating cost savings were calculated using unit vehicle
operating costs developed by the Study. The savings per vehicle
on each link are shown in Table 12B-2. Total vehicle operating
cost savings are shown in Table 12B-3 and sum to $b 83.8 million.

     Meat traffic savings assume that once the new road is com-
pleted, meat can be moved from the San Borja region by refriger-
ated truck instead of by air. About 5,000 tons of meat moved
from the San Borja region in 1977 and this could double by 1989.
Normal road costs per ton, assuming an improved route, are about
.55 pesos per kilo which might be increased by 30 percent to 0.7
pesos per kilo to allow for special trucks with a worse backhaul
factor. Air costs are about 3.7 pesos per kilo. Hence potential
                                                                     '.
meat traffic savings in 1989 are $b 30 million pesos.
                                                                      ,
     Agricultural benefits on this route were estimated at US$
2.5 millions (1973) by DELCANDA. Doubling this figure to convert
to 1977 values, a benefit of $b 100 million can be estimated.

     Benefits can be summarized as follows:

              ETERAMAZAMA-SAN IGNACIO DE MOXOS


     This 272 km highway would complete the highway link
between Cochabamba and Trinidad. The location is shown in
Figure 12C-1.

Evaluation Methodology

     The highway wasevaluated using the methodology set out in
Appendix 3H --Evaluation of the New Modes on Existing Links.
The new road is in competition with the only other existing
link in the corridor, the Mamor~ River. The demand curve and
the benefit coefficients as set out in Figure 3H-3 and Table
3H-4 respectively were used, with the rail values in these
data representing the river for this evaluation.

Forecast Volumes

     The volumes forecast on the road in 1989 are shown in
Table 12C-1, by different size of truck and by sector to
sector movement. The sectors are shown in Figure 12C-2.

     A total of nearly 190,000 tons per year is expected to use
the road by 1989, averaging 96 vehicles per day of which 79
would be trucks.

Evaluation

     Tables 12C-2 and 12C-3 show the details of the evaluation
for agricultural and non-agricultural products respectively.
The 1989 annual benefits can be summarized from these tables
as follows:

     Maintenance costs can be calculated as follows:

Maintenance Cost in 1989 = Ma9 = 1.5 (12T + 3000) x W x D

     Where: T = 1989 average daily traffic
            W = Width = 8 m
            D = Distance = 272 km.

          MS9    =   1.5 (12 x 96 + 3000) x 8 x 272
                 =   $b 13.5 million.

     Only half this figure is taken since most of the traffic
is diverted from other routes where maintenance costs would be
saved.

     Hence M89   =    $b6.7 million

Capital cost in 1989      = $b   1,116 million
                                                      (147.1 - 6.7)
Hence: 1989 Single Year Rate of Return           =       1,116
                                                                      x 100

     EVALUATION OF THE ICHILO-MAMORE RIVER SYSTEM CLEANING
                            PROJECT


     The object of the project is to build and equip a boat
to extract embedded tree trunks, and to remove sand bars, in
the Ichilo-Mamore river system between Puerto Villarroel and
Guayaramer!n. It is also planned that some large loops of
the river will be bypassed by specially cut canals, mainly to
avoid the need to clear the loops so isolated.
     It is assumed that the boat would take two years to build
and equip and that the initial cleaning operation would take
five years to complete, three years for the section Puerto
Villarroel to Trinidad and two years for the section Trinidad
to Guayaramer!n. After this, the boat would be used less
intensively to maintain the river in clean condition.
     Based on verbal reports, an estimated cost of 30 million
pesos is allowed for the boat and equipment, but this is
probably    an   overestimate. Operating costs are assumed to
be 2.3 million pesos per year for the first five years and 1.0
million pesos per year thereafter.
Other Transport Infrastructure
     It is assumed that the railroad to R!o Grande will be
opened in 1985 but that the extension to Trinidad will not be
built. It is also assumed that the road from Trinidad to
Guayaramer!n will be opened as a complete link by 1987, as
will the Cochabamba-Trinidad and the Santa Cruz-Trinidad roads.
Traffic Volumes
     These are shown in Table 12D-l."Normal" traffic is taken
from the model forecasts, as are petroleum flows. Imports
and exports volumes were selected based on the general fore-
casts of the Study. Cattle volumes are the additional incre-
ments associated with the plan to export meat via Guayaramer!n.
Non-recorded movements were taken as equivalent to "normal"
volumes.
Benefits
     The principal benefit is reduced voyage time by the boats
carrying cargo on the river.
     The analysis of existing river transport costs contained
in Working Paper 34, Table 2, indicated the navigation times
and journey times for round trips, as follows:

       It is assumed that the difference between navigation time
and voyage time represents delays on route due to darkness and
obstacles.   It is further assumed: (1) that 80 percent of the
voyage delays will be eliminated by the navigation improvements;
(2) that navigation time will be reduced in proportion to the
reduced distance; and (3) that the value of boat's time is as
derived from Working Paper 34, i.e. 1,560 pesos per day at 1977
pr ices.
  .   Puerto Villarroel to Trinidad - Normal number of round
~r~ps for,Class liB" boat units is 12 per year; annual volume

          2 x 93.6 x 12 = 79 boats
      Present route distance (one way) is 470 km. The future
route distance, according to the improvements postulated will be
38.0 km less.   Therefore the time saved by each boat due to
reduced length of channel is:

      The time saved by each boat due to removal of palos and
palizadas, either directly or by elimination of such impediments
through cutting off loops of the river and due to installation
of navigation aids, consists of:

       (7.08 - 5.04) x 12 x 0.8      =    19.58 days per year

Boat time saved,annually:

      Trinidad to Guayaramer1n - Normal number of round trips is 10
per year for Class "B" boat-units. Annual volume is approximately
106,000 tons and average boat-load = 93.6 tons. Thus the number of

     NOTE:       All costs, benefits and savings in millions of 1977 pesos.
     The IRR for the projects, as summarized in Table 120-2, is 10.3.
Close examnation of the figures shows that the Trinidad-Guaya-
ramer!n section contributes most of the benefit and that the
FYRR on the Villarroel-Trinidad section is only about 7 percent,
undiscounted. This, however, is probably an unfair comparison
and it can be reasoned that the project must be treated as a
whole, since to do only part of the project would required the
same level of investment.

     If the very high cost of the boat and equipment is reduced
the project would be more viable. A reduction in costs of one
third, as has been suggested, is likely increase the IRR to
about 14 percent.

   EVALUATION OF THE RAILROAD   FROM RIO GRAN.DE TO TRINIDAD


     This project was discussed in Chapter 12 of the Report
where the results of the evaluations were presented. The
puerpose of this Appendix is to present the assumptions made
in the evaluation in more detail.
The Project
     Construction of the planned line from Santa Cruz to Tri-
nidad started in the 1970s and the first two sections to Santa
Rosa and to Yapacan! were completed in 1976 and 1978 respectively.
A third section from Yapacan! to R!o Grande was started in late
1980 and is expected to be completed by 1985. The project from
Rio Grande to Trinidad represents the final section of this railroad.
     The line from R!o .Grande to Trinidad would be 149 km long
and is estimated to cost 1,003 million pesos (in 1977 prices).
Methodology
     The basis for the evaluation methodology was presented in
Appendix 3H -- Evaluation of New Modes on Existing Links -- but
several complioations arise. These were due first to the
formulation of the transport networks used for transport
demand forecasting and secondly to the fact that four modes
CQuid potentially serve this corridor: one already in existence
-- the river, one now under construction -- a road, one partly
built where extension is the subject of this evaluation -- the
railroad and one other potential mode -- a petroleum product
pipeline.
     Concerning   the transport network, two sets of results
were available for 1989, the Committed Network and the Test
Network. The rail project was included in the Test Network but
so also was the Cochabamba-Trinidad road, which has a strong
influence also on the Santa Cruz-Trinidad corridor. The
Committed Network contained neither of these projects.
     It was decided that the rail line should be evaluated
assuming that the Cochabamba-Trinidad road was not built. The
reasoning was that justification of this road appeared to be
unlikely (an assumption since proved to be wrong -- see
Appendix 12C) and that in any case, the presence
of the Cochabamba-Trinidad road would reduce the benefits of
the railroad. Therefore to give the maximum chance of success
to the railroad, it was assumed that the Cochabamba-Trinidad

road would not be built, and therefore the Test Network traffic
forecasts had to be modified to remove the influence of the
Cochabamba-Trinidad road.     The volumes forecast on the                  "
railroad were based on the low domestic traffic postulated
for the 1989 computer model tests.
     Concerning the competition between the four potential
competing modes, the following decisions were made. The
product pipeline was evaluated first and it was quickly
established that there was no hope of justification in the
next twenty years on present forecast volumes. Therefore, all
the petroleum product movements were assumed to use the rail-
road and then, if necessary, the river. Without the project,
transfer to river would be at R!o Grande and with the project,
transfer would be at Trinidad (for products moving further
than Trinidad).
     As a result of this treatment of the pipeline, three modes
were left in competition - the railroad, the river and the
highway. The full complexity of three-way evaluation could not
be contemplated and so 'an approximation was made. The total
volume in the corridor was first divided into road-biased movements
and river-biased movements. Then,two sets of benefit calcula-
tianswere made, one for the new railroad in competition with
the river and one for the new railroad in competition with the
road. The two sets of benefits were then added to obtain the
total benefit for the project. These calculations covered                   ·It.
non-petroleum product internal traffic only; additional benefits
were calculated for foreign trade traffic and also for petroleum
products traffic.
Estimation of Volumes
     Volumes on the 1989 Committed Network corresponded to the
without-project case. For the with-project case,volumes on the
1989 Test Network were modified to remove the influence of the
Cochabamba-Trinidad Highway.
     The following movements were identified to be using the
Cochabamba-Trinidad Highway in the Test Network.

Calculation of Benefits
     As described above, the calculation of benefits for internal
non-petroleum products was made in two parts, considering first
the benefits of traffic transferring from road to rail, and then
the benefits to traffic transferring from river to rail. This was
a compromise calculation to avoid the problems of a three-way
modal diversion procedure. The method of calculation for each
part of evaluations, followed that method set out in Appendix 3H
- Evaluation of New Modes on Existing Links.
      The benefit calculation for the road-rail case used the
demand curves shown in Figure 3H-2 and the benefit coefficient
in Table 3H-3.    In the river-rail case, the demand curve and
benefits shown in Figure 3H-3 and Table .3H-4 respectively were
used, equating the new rail line with the"road" and the existing
river as the "rail". This follows the extended use of the
diversion curves, originally based on road-rail competition data,
to model road-river and rail-river modal choice, as explained
 in Appendix 3H.
     One problem arose with this compromise calculation. The
modal choice procedure as followed in the model resulted in a
certain allocation of traffic between the three modes in the
Santa Cruz-Trinidad corridor. In attempting to divide these
volumes into road biased and river biased movements, so as to
obtain two separate evaluations and thus avoid a three-way modal
choice, it was impossible to obtain volumes entirely consistant
with the modal costs in the two sub-cases. That is to say, on

the basis of a simple river-rail cost comparison in one case.
and a simple road-rail comparison in the other, the "river
biased" and "road biased" voltunes could not be allocated to
the t.hree modes in the same manner as the full modal allocation
procedure predicted. This was a result of the step-by-step allocation procedure
used in the model. The problem was nost serious for the road-rail canparison and
relatively minor for the river-rail case.
     Thus, two    values could be calculated for x,the percentage
of traffic using rail, one based on a simple comparison of two
modal costs (road and rail in one case, river and rail in the
other), and one based on the original modal allocation and its
subsequent division in road and river biased movements. For the
road-rail evaluation, where the differences were most serious,
two sets of evaluations were completed, one for each set of values
for x. The results of the evaluation using the two different
sets of values, turned out to be almost identical.
      The benefit calculations are set out in detail in Tables
12E-2 to 12E-5 and can be summarized as follows:

     Savings in Maintenance Costs - It was estimated that
constructIon ol the railroad would cause 8,567 tons per year
to switch from road to rail, or the equivalent of 4 vehicles
per day_
     The annual variable costs of maintenance are given by
the following formulae:
     Road     1.5x 12 x V x W x D

     Rail     0.9 x 0.015 'x T x D

     Where:    V=      volume in vehicles per day
               W=      road width in meters
               T =     tons per year
               D=      distance in km.
                                                                          II
     Variable costs of maintenance for the two modes can be
calculated as follows:
     Road   = 1.5    x 12 x 4 x 9 x546      = $b   0.35 million

     Rail   = 0.9    x 0.015 x 55,699 x 437        = $b   0.32 million

           Savings in maintenance $b 0.03 million.

Evaluation of R!o Grande-Trinidad Line
    The 1989 FYRR is given by the following formulae:
            FYRR = B - F x 100%
                        C

    Where:      B = benefits in 1989
                F = fixed costs in 1989
                C = costs of construction.
     Benefits - These can be assumed as follows, taking only
the most lavorable case for internal non-petroleum product
traffic.

     Fixed Costs - Two sets of fixed costs apply, one for
generar--bperations,and one for maintenance.
     Fixed costs of operation           = 149 x (107,500 x 1.2)          = 19.2
     Fixed costs of maintenance         =   149 x (23,000 x 0.9)         =    3.1
                                                                    $b       22. 3million
     Costs - Construction is expected to take four years, so

construction costs must be factured by 1.16 to obtain an
equivalent single year cost.

          ASSUMPTIONS ON COSTS FOR THE EVALUATION
            OF RAILROAD REHABILITATION PROJECTS



     The purpose of this Appendix is to record the. assumptions
made on costs required to evaluate rehabilitation projects for
railroads. Cost data have been taken from a number of sources,
some of them published but most of them in the form of informal
notes. For this reason, it is worthwhile to bring all the
relevant facts together for detailed review.
     The costs discussed in this paper refer to basic track
rehabilitation. The special needs for track realignment to
avoid difficult zones subject to earth slides or flooding are
not considered here, but such projects were evaluated. Also
not considered in this note is the need to re-align certain
very sharp curves to 'avoid excessive costs of track maintenance
and rail replacement.
Classes of Cost
     A rehabilitation project implies a partial reconstruction
of the track requiring substantial investment, The size of the
investment is determined by the extent of the rehabilitation
work, and a range exists between simple "revision" (see below)
to a major realignment of the track.
     The purpose of rehabilitation project is to reduce the
costs of maintenance and the costs of train operations. Also,
a reahabilitation project, by improving the condition of the
track, reduces the number of derailments and other accidents.
It has been suggested that without a rehabilitation project,
rail lines would have to close down but this does not seem
to be the prevailing view now.
     In general, then,   fou~   c1ases of costs can be identified
as follows:
     1)   Construction costs of rehabilitation.
     2)   Track maintenance costs, before and after rehabilitation.
     3)   Operating costs, before and after . rehabilitation.
     4)   Costs of accidents caused by the bad state of the
          unrehabi1itated track~
Conversion of Costs to 1985
     For evaluating rehabilitation works over the next ten years,
it was decided to work in terms of 1985 costs. The costs presented


                           -543-
in this .Appendix have not been adjusted to 1985 levels, partly
because it is perhaps easier to appreciate the reality of the
costs by presenting them in current, or near current, terms.
However, factors are presented below which where used to adjust
the costs presented in this paper, before evaluations were
undertaken.
      Construction costs       1977-1985    1.14
      Maintenance costs        1979-1985    0.9
      Operating costs          1989-1985    0.95
      Accident costs           1979-1985    0.9

       It is emphasized that the evaluation is in terms of
economic costs at constant 1977 pesos values. The adjustment
factors listed above are designed to reflect changes in costs
relative to average costs and do not include allowance for infla-
tion. Thus, adjustments from 1979 to 1985 take into account that
1979 values are inflated above 1977 values so that the final adjust:Itent to 1985
 price levels in constant 1977 pesos is a downward one.
Construction Costs of Rehabilitation
     Three levels of rehabilitation have been identified for
evaluation. One is the type of rehabilitation currently being
undertaken by ENFE with World Bank assistance, and this has
been termed "reconstruction"~ Then there is a lower level of
rehabilitation termed "revision". This implies use of already
used materials obtained from other track rehabilitation and
confines ballasting of the track to certain locations. Finally,
there is a higher level of rehabilitation which includes
substantial realignment of the track which normally results
in the same types of saving as for other projects plus higher
operating    speeds. These three levels of rehabilitation are
summarised below:
1.    Revision - A low grade rehabilitation en:ploying where possible,
      used materials from other rehabilitated lines. Ballasting
      is not generally provided, except where corrections of
      alignment are required. Where necessary, the track is re-
      leveled with selected sand placed under the sleepers. Switch
      pOints in stations are replaced to permit higher operat-
      ing speeds for through trains.     This is an operation
      particularly suitable for lightly used lines.
2.    Reconstruction - Essentially the type of work currently
      being performed by ENFE on certain sections. Defective
      materials, particularly sleepers and if necessary, rails                      'III

      are replaced, rails are welded into 40 m sections and the
      track is fully    ballasted. Switch points in stations are
      also replaced to permit higher operating speeds by through
      trains.



                                -544-
                                                                                    ..
                                                                                    '
3.   Re-alignment - A higher grade operation with the aim
     of eliminating tight curves to allow higher operating
     speeds. This is done at the same time as reconstruction
     of the track, and all costs given below for re-alignment
     reflect both operations.
     Clearly, there are other levels of rehabilitation, both
within and outside this range of projects, but these three
levels were considered to represent an appropriate set for
evaluation.
    A major consideration when estimating the costs of
rehabilitation is whether or not rails are to be replaced.
Is is understood that in the current rehabilitation progam,
rails are only being replaced when in poor condition. It
would appear that rail replacement should be treated in~dent­
ly of track rehabilitation, and should not be included in the
cost of rehabilitation when evaluatinq sudhschemes. Hence
rail replacement cost~ have been excluded from consideration
on the basis that this is really a part of long term maintenance
and is required whether or not the track is rehabilitated.
Rehabilitation does include welding of rails into longer
lengths and, pf course, a rehabilitation operation can include
replacement of rail if this is necessary. Replacement of
sleepers, however, is more fudarnental to a track rehabilitation
and these costs are included.
    Cost estimates of reha~ilitations were made by the Study
rail expert Dr. Antonio Cresp!, taking into account the state
of the sleepers. Equations for costs are given in Table 13A-l.
     These costs are considerably higher than those recently
experienced by ENFE wh~ch are quoted below.

     Therefore, the ENFE figures were used as a basis for costs
and the Cresp! figures were used as indicators of relative
costs for different regions and types of rehabilitation. To

     According to ENFE, sleepers are completely replaced in all
rehabilitations, but those which are in good condition can be
re-used in routine maintenance. Therefore costs should be
modified to reflect the salvage value of sleepers. Assuming
that the salvage value is 30 percent of the new cost of 184
pesos per sleeper (1979), and that on average, 1600 sleepers
per km are required, the salvage value per km can be related to
the percentage of sleepers in poor condition by the following
formulae:
          Salvage Value = 883    [100 - pJ pesos per km (1979)
    Where P   = percent   sleepers in poor condition.
     Other materials can also be salvaged which have a reuse
value. Data given by ENFE indicate an additional salvage value
of 14,150 pesos per km.
     In 1977 costs, the total salvage value per km is given as:
         82,000 - 706 P     pesos per km (P as above)
and this equation was used to modify (reduce) the basic costs
of rehabilitation given above.
     Table 13A-2 summari~es the percentages of sleepers in poor
condition for each line and therefore the cost of each type of
rehabilitation.

Track Maintenance Costs
     ENFE state that their current costs of maintenance are
not sufficient( to prevent a oontinuing deterioration of the track.
Studies have been done by ENFE to indicate the desirable level
of costs for the unrehabilitated track to be adequately
maintained, and these are considerably higher than current
 costs. Costs are also available for maintaining a rehabilitated
track and these are oonsiderable l<::JWer than either of the previous sets.
     From the various sources, the following maintenance costs
have been deduced.

     At the low volumes of traffic encountered in Bolivia,
maintenance costs can be taken as mainly fixed. However, some
high volumes are forecast and it was thought worthwhile to
identify the variable element. It was indicated that costs
varied by 4,12 and 6 percent per 100,000 t-kms respectively for
the altiplano, mountain and eastern lines.    On the basis of

      Detailed analyses were made of operating costs and of the
effect on costs of the various types of rehabilitation project.
Reductions in costs from current conditions arise due to savings
lin running time of equipment, savings in crew costs (or, more
correctly, greater productivity), reduced wear and tear of
                                                                        ..
equipment and fuel savings.
     Tables 13A-3 and 13A-4 show the assurrptians on operating costs
for each line. Costs are assumed for 1989 conditions which
are expected to be 9 percent and 19 percent higher thah 1977
costs (in constant pesos terms) for passenger and freight
traffic respectively. Also, the base costs shown for lines
already rehabilitated refer to the conditions before
rehabilitation.
      Reductions in operating costs are not very great; about
ten percent for a revision or reconstruction, and approaching
fifteen to twenty percent for a realignment.
Train Accident Costs
     Few data are available on train accident costs, defined            ..,
as any accident involving moving rail equipment, apart from
the statement that the cost of accidents due to the poor
state of the track for the Andean system in 1979 was 1,990,280
pesos.Exc1uding the rehabilitated .Viacha-Oruro line, this cost
can be applied to 330 million t-kms on the Andean system in              ...
1974 to arrive to a cost of 0.006 pesos per t-km in 1979. This
can be treated as an additional operating cost of unrehabilitated
lines. Train accident costs do appear to be very low and pos-
sibly, they only refer to minor derailments and do not cover
cases where equipment is lost or irreparably damaged.

Costs of Other Repairs to Infrastructure

      Other disruptions, caused by such natural causes as
floods or landslides which do not involve moving equipment,
also require repair.  It was assumed that these special repairs
are additional to the cost of the track maintenance as set out
earlier section, including the desirable level track
maintenance costs estimated by ENFE to prevent track deterioration.
These costs are, of course, unaffected by the types of rehabilita-
tion discussed in this Appendix.       .

            EVALUATION OF RAILROAD REHABILITATION PROJECTS


     Tables 13B-1 to 13B-3 set out th~ details of the evaluation
of railroad projects which is summarized in Chapter 13. Evalua-
tions are presented for three cases as follows:

     1980    (based on 1979 traffic)

     1989    Low traffic, assuming that freight tariffs continue
             as at present

     1989    High traffic, assuming that freight traffic increases
             to the levels forecast by the Study with a new low
             tariff policy (see Chapter 17).

     For both the 1989 cases, passenger volumes are assumed to
double from 1980.

     All construction costs and benefits are based on the assump-
tions set out in Appendix 13A.

the carriers (which comprise the majority), operate independently
with smaller boats.
     The objectives of these associations are to rationalize the        •
allocation of cargo among associated companies, defend their
interests before the government, and to regulate tariffs, rates
and taxes.          .

              OPERATING COSTS AND REVENUES

     In Chapter 17 of the Report, summaries were presented of
the operating costs and revenues for ENFE freight traffic for
1989. The three tables following give more details of these
calculations.
     The results were derived from the 1989 computer forecasts
of rail flows made for the committed transport network, i.e.
excluding the proposed rail interconnection. Two computer pro-
jections were made; one with a continuation of current tariffs
('High' in the following tables), the other with a low tariff
policy in which tariffs on all internal traffic were approximate-
ly equal to 1989 variable costs, but below this level for some
lightly used lines. From these results, estimates were derived
of the effects of a medium tariff policy which is considered
appropriate to use as a starting point for developing a new
ratl tariff policy.
    Results are presented in Tables 17A-l to 17A-3 for each
line.

 Current Road Maintenance
      Table 18A-1 shows a breakdown of SNC costs for the past
 four years. The 1979 figures for maintenance can be summarized
 as follows~

 where direct costs include labor, machinery and materials.
      It is also possible to compare these costs with theoretical
 costs obtained by multiplying Study costs (financial} by the
 1979 SNCreported quantities shown in Table 18A-2.

     To this sum must be added the administrative and supervision
costs which are essential to a maintenance operation. Also, i t
is possible, on the basis of the quantities reported in Table

     Current maintenance should cover the basic maintenance of
the previous section, plus additional costs of maintenance due
to improved maintenance standards recommended by the World Bank.
In fact, the allowed sum barely covers the basic maintenance
costs of $b 257 million. Almost certainly, therefore, sums will
have to be allocated to the three districts additional to those
currently allowed in the pilot maintenance project, in order to
raise the levels of current maintenance to the required levels.
For budget presentation purposes, it is assumed that the $b 290
million (1981-1983) and the $b 75 million (1984..,.198G1 are
included in the sums allowed in the Investment Program for basic
maintenance and additional maintenance.             .
