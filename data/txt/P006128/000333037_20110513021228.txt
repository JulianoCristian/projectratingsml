   Gentlemen:

       Wilbur Smith and Associates is pleased to submit this Final Report of Phase I of the
   Bolivia National Transport Study.            The Report is in five volumes.            Volumes I and II review
   the existing situation and present the main analyses, findings and recommendations.                            Volumes
   III and IV contain supplementary appendices and the fifth volume is a summary of the Report.

       The Report represents the conclusion of over two years effort by a professional team made
   up of consultant's staff and Bolivian nationals.                 During the course of the Study, several
   interim reports and technical papers were produced, culminating in a draft Final Report in
   November, 1980.        The first review period was concluded in December with the final meeting
   of the Study Steering Committee, when all initial comments on the draft report were pre-
   sented by Bolivian entities and by the World Bank.                  A more lengthy review and discussion
   period followed in which additional valuable contributions were made to the Final Report.

      The Report presents and supports a recommended National Transport Plan set in the con-
   text of the expected development of the Bolivian economy over the next ten years, and with
   consideration for possible developments in the following ten years.                       It is not intended
   that the recommendations be taken as a fixed plan; forecasting the future is a hazardous
   task, and it is impossible to foresee all possible developments.                      Therefore, it is strongly
   recommended that the Government set up a permanent transport planning group, utilizing the
   Bolivian counterpart team involved in this Study,to monitor developments and adapt the Plan
   to changing circumstances.          The first steps have been taken in this direction by selecting
   a counterpart team for Phase II of this Study.                Hopefully, this will form a solid basis for
   the continuing transport planning process, and for a permanent National Transport Center.

       The cooperation and assistance we received throughout the Study from officers of the
   Government and others concerned with transport in Bolivia, is gratefully acknowledged.                             We
   also wish to recognize the contributions made by our colleagues on the national counter-
   part team, and by our local associate consultants, CONSA SRL and ECOVIANA SRL.                          We appreci-
   ate the opportunity to have participated in the study effort, and look forward to the imp-
   lementation of the recommendations.

CHAPTER 11

IMPROVEMENT AND
MAINTENANCE, OF EXISTING HIGHWAYS
     The importance of highway transport in Bolivia is hard
to overstate. In 1977, 96 percent of domestic freight tonr
(excluding commodities carried in pipelines) and 96 percent
of domestic passengers moved by road and these
proportions are not expected to change much in the immediate
future. Yet highway standards must be classified as poor.
There are less than 1,300 km of paved interurban roads in
the entire country and many of these have been allowed to
deteriorate badly. The rest of the system is gravel and
earth and the surfaces are also poor. In addition, the
unpaved roads often lack drainage structures and bridges,
so that travel is uncertain during the wet season from
December to March.
     Clearly, much can be done to improve the existing
highway system. However, funds for investment are limited
and existing commitments to highway projects will take up
much of the available budget for the next two to three
years. It is therefore of utmost importance to see that
the remaining money is spent wisely and that priorities are
established and observed. This will inevitably mean
changes in the pattern of highway expenditure from the past.
This chapter sets out the reasoning leading to the
recommended changes.
Budget Restrictions
     In preparing a highway program for the next ten years,
it is necessary to take account of the sums likely to be
available for new investment in transport during the period,
and of their timing. This study made estimates of low,
medium and high transport budgets, assuming that transport
investment as a proportion of all public investment would be
20, 25 and 30 percent respectively. The high budget has
only been exceeded once in the past few years (1978), and
the transport budget for both 1979 and 1980 was between 20
and 25 percent of public investment. This subject is
discussed in more detail in Chapter 8 and the allocation of
funds amongst modes is discussed in Chapter 18.
     Under the low budget, few funds beyond those already
committed would be available in the next six years. This
pessimistic possibility has been discounted and in the
selection of projects for a highway program, it has been

                                                                   •


                          ,
assumed that either the medium or the high budget will be
available. Conclusions are presented in this chapter for
both possibilities.

Anal~tical   Tools

     Besides the transport model, two important computer
procedures were used in developing the highway program.
One was the World Bank Highway Design and Maintenance
Standards Model (HOM) which was used to analyze the benefits
of alternative highway improvements and maintenance policies
for both paved and unpaved roads. An analysis program using
the HOM was designed in five stages, requiring a total of
28 major tests together with about 10 sub-tests (see Chapter 3).
                                                                   "'
     The second important analytical tool was the budget
allocation program, also described in Chapter 3. Many high-
way projects were found to be justified in the early part
of the period 1981-1g90, but funds are unlikely to be
available then, under either the medium or the high budget
assumptions. The budget allocation program was used to stage
the main elements of the highway program -- major paved and
unpaved road improvements and road maintenance -- in an opti-
mum manner in accordance with likely budgets, using
the criterion of maximizing total net present value.

Improvements to Existing Paved Roads

     There are almost 1,300 km of interurban paved roads in
the country of which many are now in poor condition. In
some cases, patching and overlaying will be sufficient to
restore the surface to good condition but in others, a more
expensive reconstruction is required. This particularly
applies to sections of the Cochabamba-Santa Cruz highway,
which was the first paved highway built in Bolivia, but
which has deteriorated badly. For this reason, this road is
discussed,separately from the other paved roads.

     Before presenting specific improvement policies, the
related subjects of pavement design and vehicle axle loads
are discussed.

     Pavement Design and Axle Loads - It has been policy to
build comparatively weak pavements, except for roads near
urban areas where traffic is denser. At the same time, the
legal axle load is comparatively high at 11 tons per single
axle (a standard for the Andean Pact) and this is frequently
exceeded.  It is estimated that one third of all trucks of
more than 9 tons carrying capacity exceed the legal axle load.
     The combination of high axle loads and weak pavements
can lead to the rapid deterioration of pavements and to high
maintenance costs. Therefore, analyses were made of the

                         -184-
relationships between the'key parameters -- pavement design,
axle loadings and traffic volumes.

     Combinations of six pavement designs, three vehicle mixes
(each with a different axle load distribution) and four
traffic levels were analyzed and the results are presented
in Working Paper 119. The following conclusions were reached:
           Pavement Design - The weak pavements used in Bolivia
      are not necessarily bad at the low traffic volumes
      encountered, so long as a policy is followed of
      strengthening by overlaying when the traffic volumes
      increase. However, timely overlaying has not been a
      feature of pavement management over recent years.
           For new designs, a roodified structural number (SN)
      (1) in the region of 3 appears to be most economic. This
      is a conservative design since a weaker pavement could
      give better results, if overlayed at the correct time.
      A stronger design needs overlaying less frequently and is
      consequently less likely to suffer from neglect. A
      weaker design withan SN of 2.5 could be acceptable at
      volumes below 250 vehicles per day but a stronger design,
      with an SN of about 3.5, would be better for daily volumes
      above 700 vehicles. Details of the designs will vary
      depending upon local soil conditions, available materials
      and climatic and drainage characteristics. It was
      envisaged in the analysis that designs with ~ equal to
      3 or less would use surface treatment while stronger
      designs would use asphaltic concrete.
           Axle Loads - The analysis considered three alternative
      conditions of vehicle axle loading: first, that the
      present situation continues with a number of overloaded
      single-rear-axle trucks, secondly, that the current law is
      enforced and thirdly, that a lower axle loading is enforced.
      The results were not very conclusive in that total costs --
      costs of vehicle operations, costs of pavement maintenance
      and costs of pavement provision -- did not vary greatly
      from one alternative to another, although they generally
      decreased with lower axle loads. However, costs of annual
      recurring maintenance provided by the National Road Service
      (SNC) were greatly reduced with lower axle loads, especially
      for the weaker pavements generally in place today. This is
      shown in Table 11-1. It is therefore recommended that the
      current law be enforced. The uncertainties of the relation-
      ships between axle loads and pavement deterioration did
      not permit a firm conclusion on a policy for reducing legal
      axle loads.

      outside the urban areas have modified structural numbers
      of between 2 and 3.

     The enforcement of legal axle loads should involve the
following:

      (i)   Restriction of imports to suitable vehicles.
            Many European vehicles currently imported by
            Bolivia are designed for 13 ton axle loads,
            above the legal maximum in Bolivia.

     (ii)   Control of the carrying capacity of vehicles,
            which is currently decided by the owner.

    (iii)   A vehicle taxation policy which encourages
            tandem rear axle vehicles.

     (iv)   A system of roadside checks, either at ran-
            domly chosen locations using portable scales,
            or at permanent locations such as at the
            transit stations on the outskirts of cities.

     A vehicle taxation policy is discussed in Chapter 17 and
a program of roadside vehicle weight checks is set out in
Appendix llA.

     The Cochabamba-Santa Cruz Highway - This 495 km highway
was built in the 1950s with paving completed in 1958, apart
from a 35 km section with particularly severe climate in the
region of Siberia, on the border of Santa Cruz and Cochabamba
departments. Figure 11-1 shows the location of the route
with the main towns and villages.



     Apart from a surface dressing applied in about 1970,
little maintenance has been done, and consequently the road
has deteriorated badly. Pavement edges have eroded, potholes
are frequent and in sections as long as several hundred meters,
the surface has virtually reverted to gravel. The rate of
deterioration has been accelerated by the number of overloaded
trucks using this route.

     Conditions are particularly bad in the part of the road
in Santa Cruz department, and work has now started on rehabil-
itation by the National Road Service (Servicio Nacional de Cam-
inJs - SNC). A 46 km section from Santa Cruz to Jorochito was
rehabilitated in 1979 and two further sections totalling 84 km,
between Jorochito and Bermejo and between Abra del Quine and
Comarapa, are currently being rehabilitated.  In each case, the
road is being constructed to a width of six meters (compared
with the existi~g width of between 5.5 and 6.5 meters), a new 10
cm base is being laid on the existing surface and a new surface
of 5 cm of asphaltic concrete is being laid. The sections cur-
rently being rehabilitated were reviewed, and projects for
further rehabilitation and improvement were evaluated.


                          -187-
     The evaluations took into account the likely opening of
the Chimore-Yapacani highway in 1985, which will offer a more
attractive paved route between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. It
was estimated that just over 400 vehicles per day would be di-
verted from the existing route in 1985, leaving volumes much
reduced in the central section of the highway, and at about
1977 observed volumes nearer to Cochabamba and Santa Cruz.

     Table 11-2 presents the results of the evaluation. The
optimum policies support the choice of the rehabilitation
projects selected by SNC for immediate execution, and indicate
that the remainder of the paved road between Santa Cruz and
Siberia is also well worth rehabilitating. For the section
between Siberia and Epizana, it was concluded that rehabili-
tation was worthwhile if done early, but if this project had
to be delayed for budget reasons, rehabilitation would not
be worthwhile with the very low volumes of traffic expected
after the opening of the Chimor~-Yapacan! road. Between
Cochabamba and Epizana, it was concluded that overlaying,
if performed immediately, would be worthwhile but if this
project has to be del,ayed, then rehabilitation would become
necessary by 1985. The project for paving the 50 km section
between Siberia and Comarapa is not worthwhile, because of
the low volumes expected on this section after 1985. Based
on the analysis of unpaved roads presented later in this
chapter, it is recommended instead that a good gravel surface
be provided for this section in the period 1984-1986 at a cost
of $b 11 million.

     Budget restrictions require several modifications to the
optimum program.· Under the high budget, both the gravelling
of Siberia-Comarapa and the rehabilitation of Comarapa-Joro-
chito would have to be postponed to the second period. Post-
ponement also of the Epizana-Siberia rehabilitation project
makes it no longer viable so it is abandoned. Both costs and
NPV under the high budget reduce by nearly a quarter compared
with optimum.

     under the medium budget, all projects are delayed until
the last period, so that Epizana-Siberia is abandoned, as
under the high budget, and also, rehabilitation is required
for Cochabamba-Epizana instead of cheaper overlaying. Costs
are consequently similar to the optimum but the NPV drops to
only 35 percent of optimum.
     Other Paved Roads - In addition to the Cochabamba-Santa
Cruz highway, a further 574 km of paved highway were evaluated.
There are other existing paved highways, either of recent
construction or which have been the subject of recent
improvements. It may well be that later in the 1980s, some
work will be required on these more recent roads, but a program
for this work should be considered nearer the time.

     Three main groups of highways were identified by
geographical region: Altiplano roads, the Cochabamba-Chimo~~
highway and GuabirS Area roads. The results of the evaluat~ons

      It was concluded that the Altiplano roads were relatively
well constructed, although all those examined were in need of
overlaying within the next three years. Some overlaying is
currently being carried out on the El Alto-Patacamaya road in
the region of San Antonio. It was concluded that for these
roads, overlaying could be postponed for a few years without
the pavements deteriorating to the point of requiring rehabil-
itation, although postponement of overlaying is not the opti-
mum policy. Under the high budget, postponement would be
required for all but one section (El Alto-Patacamaya) until
1984-1986, but under the medium budget, overlaying would have
to be postponed on all sections until 1987-1990.

     The Cochabamba-Chimor~ road is also relatively well con-
structed with both base and sub-base provided. A policy of
overlaying proved to be optimal although not required until
1984/86.  In this case, it may be convenient to overlay in the
year before the opening of the Chimor~-Yapacani road which is
currently proqrammed for completion in1985/86~     The last sec-
tion of this road from Villa Tunari to Chimore does not need
rehabilitation or overlaying in the next ten years, although
a surface dressing could be required in this period. Under
the high budget, overlaying in the optimum year is allowed,
but the medium budget requires postponement until 1987. On
the assumption that the high budget is available, it is also
recommended that the 29 km of unpaved road in the Cochabamba-
Villa Tunari road be paved in the period 1984-1986 at an est-
imated cost of 23 million pesos.
                                         ,
     The three roads leading from Guabira to Puerto Banegas,
Chan~ and Yapacani, are all of very weak construction, built
without sub-base.   It was concluded that an overlaying policy
was not suitable and that complete reconstruction was requir-
ed. For part of the road to Puerto Banegas, and for the two
sections to Yapacani, which will become ~art of the new
Cochabamba-Santa Cruz highway via Chimore, rehabilitation is
desirable immediately. For the lower volume sections to Puerto
Banegas and to Chane, rehabilitation can be delayed until the
end of the decade.

     Under the medium budget assumption, all the Guabir~ pro-
jects are delayed to the 1987-1990 period. under the high
budget, the short section San carlos-Yapacan1 is advanced to
1984-1986. It is recommended that the entire section from
Guabira to Yapacanl is rehabilitated in 1984 before the open-
ing of the Chimore-Yapacan1 highway.  Improvements to the
Guabira-puerto Banegas road should coincide with the construc-
tion of a road bridge at Puerto Banegas (see later in this
Chapter).

     Costs are identical under all three budget assumptions.
The more serious postponements under the medium budget result
in a drop in NPV of 32 percent and the postponements neces-
sary under the high budget assumption reduce NPV by l5 percent.

Policies for Improving Unpaved Roads

     The 1977 transport system coded for the computer transport
model contains nearly 13,000 km of unpaved roads on routes
between the 77 analysis zones defined for the Study. Some of
these routes have now been, or are in the process of being,
improved to better gravel or to paved standards leaving 5,780
km of gravel road and 5,560 km of earth roads as candidates
for possible improvement projects. The total road system
contains an additional 25,000 km of unpaved feeder roads
which are discussed later in this chapter.

     Several possibilities are available for improving unpaved
roads, but the three projects   selected below were chosen for
detailed analysis:

    (i)   New construction - when a new road is built making
          little or no use of the existing alignment.

   (ii)   Betterment - when the existing alignment is improved
          by widening, provision of better drainage, correction
          of severe bends and provision of a better surface --
          either gravel or paving.

  (iii)   Major gravelling - when adequate drainage and a good
          gravel surface are provided, but no improvements are
          made to width or to alignment.

     The feature common to all these improvements is the provi-
sion of a better road surface. Existing unpaved surfaces are
poor, being either of earth or of poorly graded gravel.  In the
latter case, even frequent grading is insufficient to reduce
road roughness to acceptable levels due to the coarse gravel
currently in use. Better routine maintenance using selected
materials can improve road surfaces, and this is discussed later
in the chapter. However, it is considered that at least major
gravelling, as described above, is required to make a significant
and lasting improvement to unpaved surfaces.

     In the rest of this chapter, poor gravel will refer to the
existing gravel surfaces which feature oversized material, and
good gravel to the surfaces after improvement using properly
selected and graded materials. Where a good gravel surface is
provided, improved routine maintenance standards are implied as
discussed later.
     The characteristics of existing roads and the assumptions '
made on improvement costs are presented below followed by the
evaluation and selection of improvement policies. Recommended
projects for unpaved road improvements are discussed in the
section after.

          PAVED ROAD DETERIORATION
              GUABIRA-YAPACANI ROAD
      Characteristics of Unpaved Roads - The basic characteristics
of unpaved roads are shown in Table 11-4. For the most part,
they are characterized by narrow widths, poor alignments
 (especially in undulating and mountainous terrain) and low
traffic volumes. Over sixty percent of unpaved roads carry
less than 50 vehicles per day" less than 5 percent (527 kms)
carry more than 200 vehicles per day and none have more than
400 vehicles per day_ On average, nearly two thirds of all
vehicles are trucks, and on many roads the proportion of trucks
is much higher.

     New Construction - The standards currently guiding
the design of new roads are shown in Table 11-5. Five design
levels are shown with different standards for each of three
terrains. These design levels were taken as the basis for
analysis although in reality, designs depart from these
standards quite frequently_  The traffic volumes assigned to
each design level in this table were disregarded, since it
was the basic objective of the analysis reported here to
assess the traffic volumes appropriate for each design.

     The alignment characteristics and estimated costs of
construction for each combination of design level and terrain
are shown in Table 11-6. Costs are in 1977 pesos but at 1985
price levels, the average for the ten years of the inve~tment
program under consideration. Construction costs were derived
from a detailed analysis of recent and current construction
projects and this analysis is presented in Working Paper 38a.

     Costs were initially calculated assuming roadway and
shoulder widths based on those given in Table 11-5. Later
analysis showed that few paved roads could be justified unless
design standards were reduced, and so alternative costs were
calculated for both a seven meter gravel road and for a six
meter paved road with half meter gravel shoulders. This is
commented on in more detail later in the Chapter.

     The original designs assume an asphaltic concrete
pavement for design level I and surface treatment
for design levels II to V. The reduced six meter pavement
designs assume surface treatment for opening volumes up to
700 vehicles per day and asphaltic concrete for higher volumes.

     Betterment and Major Gravelling - Betterment is defined
as improvement of the existing road alignment, and comprises
the following:

     •   Widening to seven meters
     •   Additional drainage
     •   Enlargement of sharp bends
     •   Additional retaining walls
     •   Improved surface -- either good gravel or a six meter
         pavement.

         NOTE: Costs in eastern Bolivia - essentially the region of Santa Cruz and the corr~or from Santa
                Cruz to Yacuiba - are estimated to be about 40 percent higher than the costs given here which
                apply to the valleys and the Altiplano.

     The costs of betterment are presented in detail in Appendix
lIB. The crucial factors affecting costs are the terrain, the
existing road width and the surface provided.

     For major gravelling, it is considered that a new gravel sur-
face on its own would not be sufficient to improve the quality of
the road and that improvements would also be needed to the drainage.
It was assumed that 2, 2.5 and 3 drains per km would be needed in
flat, rolling and mountainous terrain respectively.

     Costs of betterment and major gravelling are summarized in
Table 11-7.

     The geometric standards for major gravelling are, of course,
the same as for the original road. The standards for betterment
were assumed to be half way between those of the existing roads and
those of design Level V (see Table 11-6).

     Road Construction in   Special Areas - Some parts of the country
feature quite exceptional   terrain which requires special construc-
tion techniques at higher   costs.  In particular, the Yungas valleys
to the east of La Paz are   steep and new road construction is extremely
costly. For example, the    cost per km on the La Paz-Cotapata road now
under construction in the   Yungas is at least double that of the
Quillacollo-Confital road   which also runs through mountainous terrain.

     Another region requiring special construction techniques is the
Beni. Flooding is the problem here so that roads have to be built
on embankments and many bridges and drainage structures are required.
Most of the roads in these regions, including the extension of the
La Paz-Cotapata route to the northern La Paz and Trinidad, are dealt
with separately in Chapter 12. The construction costs for these
roads are not considered in this Chapter.

     Evaluation of Road Improvements - The HDM model was used to
evaluate road improvements in each type of terrain, for different
traffic volumes. For each type of improvement, benefits, in terms
of reduced vehicle operating costs and time savings compared with
doing nothing, were estimated and they are reported in Table 11-8.

     From these results, it is concluded that almost any new design
can be justified at quite low traffic volumes, when compared with
leaving the road completely alone. The qualification is important
and will be returned to in a moment.  If it is assumed that benefits
to traffic in the year of opening must equal or exceed 12 percent
of the construction costs, all designs in flat terrain can be justi-
fied at less than 300 vehicles per day. The volume required in the
year of opening tends to go up as terrain becomes more severe. In
general, new paved designs can be justified at a lower traffic vol-
ume than new gravel designs, despite the additional construction
cost required, because of the much higher benefits associated with
a better surface.

     The question of the basis for comparison of a road improvement
is now returned to. It is emphasized most strongly that a simple
comparison with existing conditions is not,a ,sufficient basis, for
justifying a new road. For example, an eXlstlng unpaved road ln
poor condition can be improved quite cheaply by placing a properly
graded and compacted gravel surface, together with sufficient
drainage. This should result in a significant reduction in road
maintenance and vehicle operating costs. A better design is only
worthwhile if it can produce sufficient additional benefits to
justify the additional construction costs.

     In general, the optimum improvements to an unpaved road are
major gravelling at low volumes, betterment with paving at inter-
mediate volumes and the construction of a new paved road to
a higher geometric alignment than can be achieved by betterment
for higher volumes.   New gravel roads on new alignments, to
replace existing unpaved roads, are never justified. The exact
volume at which a higher level of project becomes justified depends
much upon the type of terrain and the condition of the road in
question, particularly its width. Therefore, it is not possible
to specify a general table of optimum design levels.

     Selection of Improvement Policies - The general evaluation
of road improvements reported above was the basis of a more detailed
investigation of unpaved roads. For each road category reported in
Table 11-4, a set of alternative projects was specified, including
major gravelling, betterment and new road construction, each with
alternative construction start dates of 1981, 1984 and 1987. Thus,
at least nine projects were specified for each category. In some
cases, more than one design level was investigated for new road
construction so that up to 15 alternative projects were specified
for some road categories.

     Traffic volumes were derived from an analysis of the transport
model forecasts considering normal traffic, traffic generated by a
gravelling project and traffic generated by a paving project. Thus,
for each project in each road category, a distinct traffic forecast
was derived, reflecting the type and timing of the improvement
project.

     Each project was evaluated using .the HDM model, and the alter-
natives within a category were then compared. The optimum improve-
ment, that is the one with the highest net present value, is shown
in Table 11-9 for each category (omitting some low volume categories
where no improvements of this nature could be justified).

     Optimum improvement policies imply many more projects in the
next few years than funds can possible permit. Therefore, the budget
allocation program described in Chapter 3 was used to select improve-
ment policies for each road category. Competing for the same funds
were projects for road maintenance, paved road improvements, bridges,
penetration roads and feeder roads. The final set of unpaved road
improvements selected for each category under assumptions of the
medium and the high budget is also shown in Table 11-9.

     In all cases, the optimum improvements are either major
gravelling or betterment with paving. No projects for
completely new roads were selected as worthwhile compared
with betterment, and this is really a reflection of the very
low traffic volumes on existing roads.  In total, 1,106 km
of betterment with paving and 4,191 km of major gravelling
could be justified with no budget restriction.

     All but 172 km of betterment is in flat terrain, where
this type of improvement can be justified at quite low traffic
volumes.  In undulating terrain, the highest volume category
also merits betterment, but none of the mountainous roads had
sufficient volumes to do so.

     The effects of budget restraint are summarized below:

                                                                         ~

     The main effect of budget restraint is to postpone projects
until later in the decade. The postponement is most severe under
the medium budget, which does not permit any expenditure on new
projects for the first six years.  In this case also, it is not
possible to justify gravelling of category 18 roads.

     Under the high budget, investment is permitted in ?ome road
categories at an earlier date than under the medium budget, but at
a lower level -- major gravelling instead of paving. In total, the
quantity of major gravelling in each period is very similar to the
optimum (except in the last period), but the quantity of betterment
is reduced.

     Total expenditures compared with the optimum are reduced by
15 percent under the high budget and by 17 percent under the med-
ium budget. NPVs are reduced by 15 percent under the high budget
 (similar to the expenditure reductions) but by 42 percent under
the medium budget.

                               -202-
     The analysis reported above was completed considering 21 road
categories, each category made up of as much as 20 individual links
in different parts of the country, but all having the same charac-
teristics of surface, terrain and traffic volume. In interpreting
these results, other factors had to be taken into account,  In par-
ticular, it was desirable to have continuity along reasonable route
lengths. A mixture of recommendations for betterment, major gravel-
ling or even for doing nothing, all for different years, within,
say, less than 50 km, would be confusing and difficult to implement.
Also, there were cases when the particular characteristics of a link
differed sufficiently from the overall category characteristics, that
it warranted a different type of improvement. Hence, each link was
evaluated, either separately, or as part of a group, and the results
are presented in Appendix lIE. A description of the improvements
recommended by region is given in the next section of this Chapter.

     It can be noted also that other changes occurred in the final
stages of preparing the investment program.  In particular, it
became evident that more construction remained to be completed on
committed projects at the end of 1980 than previously expected.
Consequently, new projects had to be postponed until later in the
decade or, in a few cases, abandoned. The final program can be
summarized as follows:

      Conclusions on Unpaved Road Improvement Policies - It was conclu-
ded on the basis of this analysis, that £0£ traffic volumes·forecast
for the next ten years, no completely new roads could be justified
economically to replace roads already in existance (2). Rather, it
is recommend.ed that improvements are made on the existing alignments
with either major gravelling or betterment. Major gravelling includes

construction of all necessary minor    drainage structures, together
with placing and compacting a 15 cm    surface of good gravel. Better-
ment includes, in addition to major    gravelling, widening to 7 meters,
minor improvements to alignment and    the construction of a 6 meter
pavement.

     These recommendations are based on the finding that improvements
to surface are more important than improvements to alignment. A six
meter pavement is considered sufficient for betterment for low volumes
of traffic. Even 1,000 vehicles per day, a volume greater than fore-
cast on any currently unpaved road for the next ten years, repre-
sents at the most two vehicles per minute. This is discussed further
in Appendices llC and lID, and a case study of the Rio Seco-Desaquadero    ,',
highway is presented in more detail in Appendix 3G.

      Both major gravelling and betterment can be regarded as interim
improvements until such time as new roads can be economically justi-
fied.   This will be when volumes reach between 1,000 and 1,500
vehicles per day.   The advantage of both types of improvement is
that they are cheap compared with new construction, so that improve-
ments can be made to a greater length of road than would be possible       .r
if only new construction to ambitious design standards is considered.
A further advantage is that works can be broken down into compara-
tively small contracts which will not require international bidding,
which has resulted in high construction costs in the past.

     It is accepted that the concept of betterment is new and that
the estimates of quantities and costs as set out in Appendix lIB
could be in error.  It is therefore recommended that the first one
or two betterment projects be regarded as pilot studies, to investi-
gate further the desirable design and construction requirements, and
also in more detail the benefits. They could be a combination of
engineering investigations and theoretical analysis using the World
Bank HDM model (see earlier).

     The design standards currently in use (see Table ll-5) were
reviewed and, although no new roads are recommended to replace exis-
ting highways, a revised set of design standards are suggested in
Appendix llC.

     Both major gravelling and betterment have high benefits and
many improvements of this type could be economically justified immed-
iately.  However, the Study had to take account of the likely limits
on funds in the next ten years, and especially in the next few years.
To a great degree, these limits are due to the large number of com-
mitted projects, of which many are in the highway sector. Also com-
peting for the remaining non-committed funds are (in the highway
sector) projects for bridges, for better maintenance and for over-
laying and reconstructing existing paved highways.  Both these latter
projects tend to have priority, so that much of the program for
improving unpaved roads has been postponed to later in the decade.

following sections.
Recommended Improvements to Unpaved Roads
     In the previous section, the evaluation of improvement policies
for existing unpaved roads was discussed by road category. In this
section, individual projects are discussed within the overall context
of the evaluation. Details of the evaluation of each road are given
in Appendix lIE.  It should be noted that all reco~endatio~s . .
presented here are subject to the findings of deta~led feas~b~l~ty
studies which should reconsider, where appropriate, the quest~on
of intermoda1 competition.
     Projects are discussed for seven areas of the country as
follows:

             •   Western Bolivia
             •   South Yungas
             •   Southern Bolivia
             •   Cochabamba Region
             •   Oruro-Sucre-Boyuibe Corridor
             •   Central Bolivia
             •   Santa Cruz Region
     Many of the road improvements in the border regions are best
discussed in the context of a strategy for moving external trade.
Therefore, detailed discussion of these links is found in Chapter
15. This is noted where appropriate in the discussion below.
Whenever betterment is recommended, it includes a six meter pave-
ment, as discussed above.

     Rio Seco-Desaguadero is the main highway route to Per~ and
has been the subject of several studies. This route is discussed
in more detail in Appendix IlG and also in Chapter 15.

     Patacamaya-Tambo Quemado has also been the subject of a final
design study, but the resulting high standard paved design is not
recommended by this Study.

     A new gravel section of road of approximately 42 km is required
between El Monte and Tres Cruces in the link Las Carreras-Iscayachi,
where the road is currently located in the bed of a river.

     The route Potosi-Tarija is currently under study by the consul-
tant TRANARG, but no information has yet become available (apart
from the cost for El Monte-Tres Cruces given above).

     It is noted that there are plans to construct dams in the rivers
near Bermejo, but it is unlikely that they will be realized for sev-
eral years.  In this event, relocation of the Padcaya-Bermejo highway
will be required. This route is discussed further in Chapter 15, as
are two other international routes, Boyuibe-Yacuiba and Pefias Fortin
Villazon.

     It is understood that an ambitious plan to relocate a large sec-
tion of the Tarija-Villamontes road have been discussed but no details
were available.  It is very unlikely that such a major improvement
could be justified economically in the foreseeable future.

     The route Tarata-C1iza-Punata-Arani is close and parallel to
the paved Cochabamba-Santa Cruz highway. It has been commented that
the recommended paving project is therefore a duplication of the exis-
ting highway. This argument is not accepted. There is already a con-
siderable volume of traffic on the gravel roads linking these towns
which prefers not to divert at least 14 km to use the main highway.
There is ample justification to improve these roads by paving, so that
this traffic can enjoy benefits of reduced operating costs.

     Machacamarca-Cha11apata is the only new paved road recommended
in the central part of the country.   It passes through a flat region
subject to overflow from Lake Poopo in the wet season, and the pro-
posa1, in the 1980 Prudenci.o C1aros-De1canda Study, is that the new
road is constructed on a raised embankment. However, the estimated
costs of this project of $b439 million (1977) -- derived from the
1980 estimate of $b614 million -- does seem high, and it is strongly
recommended that the design is reviewed to find ways of reducing
costs.

     The central road in this corridor from Uncla to Muyupampa via
Sucre was the subject of a recent feasibility study. That Study
suggested that sections of the road could be worth paving and rec-
ommended that detailed engineering studies be undertaken. The
recommendation is not supported by this Study for the immediate
future.  Current and predicted traffic volumes do not justify a
major road on this route, especially when funds for transport
investment are so limited.  It is recommended that any further
studies undertaken on this road concentrate of the possibilities
for major gravelling, or possible betterment (although this latter
project is not recommended in the foreseeable future).  It is
further recommended that funds for major improvement be concentra-
ted on the road from Oruro to Sucre via Machacamarca, Challapata,
Ventilla and Potosi.

Existing Feeder Roads

     Besides the 14,000 km of roads included in the computer network,
there are a further 25,000 of unpaved feeder roads, mainly located
in the central regions of the country. They range from tracks to
important rural access roads vital for agricultural production.

     A proper assessment of such roads requires detailed study of
the areas served by the road. Assessments must be made of the poten-
tial production in the regions served, both from the point of view of
the quality of the land and of the people living there, and of the
markets which can absorb this production. Such studies are best
conducted for comparatively small areas.

     This study did not have the resources to conduct the necessary
detailed surveys required to prepare detailed recommendations. How-
ever, it is recognized that feeder roads play an important role and
that a proportion of the transport budget must be allocated for
maintenance and improvements of these links.

     until recently, feeder road maintenance and development had been
neglected. However, in 1976, the Feeder Road Department of SNC was
created with the task of undertaking rural road improvement, with the
assistance of USAID. One USAID project has been started, and another
defined, which between them are intended to improve 2,200 km of rural
access roads at a total cost of about 700 milllon pesos. This pro-
gram was scheduled to be finished in 1983, but there were delays in
the early stages, and USAID is currently suspended.

     For the purposes of defining an overall investment program, it
is assumed that spending on feeder roads will continue at about the
current rate.

Road Maintenance Program

     An analysis was made of road maintenance policies with two main
objectives:

     (i)    To establish the optimum relationship between investment
            in road maintenance and investment in road improvements.

    (ii).   To outline a possible road maintenance program for the
            decade 1981-1990.

     A four year Pilot Maintenance Study, funded by the World Bank,
commenced in March 1981. It was originally planned that the Main-
tenance Study should overlap with this Study, so that the planning of
a nationwide maintenance program could take advantage of both the
global view provided by this Study, and the more detailed expertise
of the Maintenance Study Team. Unfortunately, an overlap was not
possible since the Maintenance Study had not commenced before the
National Transport Study had ended. Nevertheless, the program pre-
sented here is intended to form the basis of a program to be refined
and developed by the Pilot Maintenance Study.

     Of necessity, the analysis presented here is general in nature.
Detailed data about the existing conditions of roads were available
only for the La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz districts of SNC.
These had been collected for the World Bank Mission in 1977 and 1978,
and by the World Bank Pilot Maintenance Study, completed in 1979.
Also, although separate road maintenance costs were identified by
region (see Chapter 5), it was necessary to conduct the rather exten-
sive analysis of maintenance policies using average countrywide costs,
in order to reduce the scope of work to manageable proportions.

     This section is concerned with routine maintenance only. It
includes patching and surface dressing for paved roads and grading,
routine gravel resurfacing and spot gravelling for unpaved roads.
It also includes regular maintenance of ditches, drainage and shoul-
ders for all roads. Major improvements, including overlaying and
rehabilitation for paved roads, and betterment and major gravelling
for unpaved roads, were considered earlier in this chapter.

     Current Maintenance Policies - Road maintenance is the reponsi-
bility of the National Road Service (Servicio Nacional de Caminos-SNC) •
The work is handled by the ten SNC district offices which are each
responsible for between one and six sub-offices (Residencias).   (See
Chapter 16, Figure 16-4). Unpaved road maintenance dominates since
such roads constitute 97 percent of the road network and are more main-
tenance intensive than paved roads.

     Three levels of maintenance, which recognize to some extent differ-
ent levels of traffic,  are defined by SNC as follows:

    (i)   Permanent maintenance, performed on 9,348 km of
          relatively high volume roads, including all paved
          roads, and using SNC equipment and labor.

   (ii)   Temporary maintenance, performed on 8,096 km of
          less important unpaved roads, again using SNC
          equipment and labor, but less frequently than
          permanent maintenance.

  (iii)   Occasional maintenance performed infrequently
          on the remaining 21,384 km of roads in the system,
          using labor from "prestaci6n Vial" services, and
          also the work force and equipment of the Feeder
          Road Department of SNC.

     An estimate of the lengths of roads in 1979 by surface and by
type of maintenance is given below:

Gravel              5,172        l,543             83        6,798
Earth               2,887        6,553         21,301       30,741

Total               9,348        8,096         21,384       38,828



      Table 11-10 shows the quantities of maintenance performed by SNC
in 1979. Routine paved road maintenance (excluding rehabilitation)
was minimal with not much patching (about 0.5 percent of the road sur-
face area) and with little surface dressing or overlaying (about 4 km
of each). The result of such a low policy is clearly apparent ip. the
state of the older paved roads, mostly located in Santa Cruz Depart-
ment.  Potholes are frequent , road edges have deteriorated reducing
road width, and in some sections, especially parts of the Santa Cruz-
Cochabamba road, the pavement has vanished for sections of up to
several hundred meters.   The result of this neglect is that complete

rehabilitation is now required for some roads, as discussed earlier
in this chapter.  It is noted that while criticism is directed at
the quantity of maintenance performed, the quality of the work which
has been observed appears to be good.

     Gravel road maintenance is more intensive with a grading once
every 3,000 vehicle passes pn average, or about once per month.
The major problem is that it is difficult to keep surface in good
condition, even with frequent grading, due to the use of large size
gravel. Measurements made in 1977 and 1978 indicated average rough-
ness values of 11,000 rom/km in the wet season and 18,000 rom/km in
the dry season, well above an attainable 5-6,000 rom/km for a pro-
perly gravelled and maintained surface.

     Earth roads receive only light maintenance with the length
of grading in 1979 one quarter of the total length of earth roads
in the country. On average, one grading pass per year is made on
earth roads subject to permanent or temporary maintenance, or
about once every 11,000 vehicle passes.

     The total cost of maintenance in 1979, including administra-
tion and supervision, was estimated at $b 333 million in current
prices, or $b 264 million in 1977 pesos. This gives an average
maintenance cost of about $b 6,800 per km.  These figures can be
sub-classified in two ways as follows:

By surface type               Paved            $b 47,479 per km

                              Gravel              27,400

                              Earth                  480

By maintenance category       Permanent        $b 22,507 per kID

                              Temporary            3,347

                              Occasional           1,286

     If only routine paved maintenance is considered (i.e. excluding
overlaying or rehabilitation which were carried out on a total of about
50 km in 1979), the average expenditure for paved roads reduces from
$b 47,479 to $b 6,284 per km.
     If only the costs of maintenance by "prestaci~n vial" are con-
sidered for occasional maintenance, the expenditure per kID drops
from $b 1,286 to $b 260.

     Evaluation of Future Maintenance Policies - The World Bank HDM
Model (see earlier) was used to evaluate alternative routine mainten-
ance policies. The work was carried out in two stages.




                               -214-
     In the first stage, a wide range of initial policies were evalu-
ated for each surface type; distinguishing earth, poor gravel (i.e.
not subject to major gravelling), good gravel and paved. Initial
unpaved policies differed principally in the grading frequency, but
also considered different intensities of spot gravelling and gravel
resurfacing.  Initial paved policies were defined by the frequency
of patching and surface treatment operations.

     In the second stage, based on the evaluation of the initial
policies, the better policies for each surface type were selected,
and combined into a set of six alternative overall policies (of
which one represented current maintenance). They are presented
later in Table 11-13. These overall policies were then evaluated
over the ten year period 1981-1990, assuming the improvements inclu-
ded in the recommended road investment program, in order to select
the optimum policy.

     It is emphasized that the objective of this work was not to
specify in detail a set of maintenance operations. This requires
detailed consideration of local conditions and materials.  Rather,
the objective was to investigate priorities and level of funding
for maintenance, given also other requirements for highway invest-
ment (rehabilitation, betterment, new infrastructure), and limits
on budget available. The conclusion is that improved maintenance
has a high priority and that current spending should be doubled
over the period 1981-1990.

     The analyses are discussed below.

     Analysis of Initial Unpaved Road Maintenance Policies - A range
of policies were examined for each of the three surface types of earth,
poor gravel and good gravel.

     Existing unpaved roads were first classified by traffic volume,
giving four categories each for earth and gravel. For each of the
four earth categories, six initial maintenance policies were speci-
fied for analysis, each with a different grading frequency but all,
except for the two minimum policies, assuming 20 cubic meters per
year spot gravelling.   Similarly six initial maintenance policies
were specified for the four gravel categories based on grading fre-
quency, but also varying the volume of spot regravelling and the
resurfacing policy.

     Ideally, gravel roads should be subclassified into those with
poor gravel surfaces and those with good gravel, but few good gravel
surfaces could be identified. Therefore, two sets of HDM Model runs
were made, both coded with the same geometric characteristics for
existing gravel roads, but one specifying poor gravel surface and the
other good gravel.  In this way, separate sets of maintenance poli-
cies were investigated for the two surface types.



                               -215-
     The main differences between poor gravel and good gravel main-
tenance operations are in the type of gravel placed, and in the
sophistication of the maintenance operation. In place of the coarse
gravel currently in use, good gravel surfaces require selected and
screened materials, either natural or crushed, to give a smoother
surface. Also, good gravel maintenance requires watering and com-
paction every third grading. Therefore, unit costs for maintaining
good gravel surfaces are approximately twice as high as for poor
gravel but the rate of deterioration is slower and they require less
frequent grading.


      The initial maintenance policies, as specified above, were
tested for each of the earth and gravel road categories, over the
period 1981-1990. Traffic growths over this period were derived
from the Transport Model. The results of the test, in terms of
total discounted economic costs over the period -- the sum of vehicle
user costs, vehicle time costs and road maintenance costs -- are
shown for each policy in Table 11-11. It is observed that total costs
do not vary much over quite a wide range of grading frequencies.    For
example, costs for earth roads vary by only 10 percent over a range
of grading frequencies from once every 1,000 vehicle passes to once
every 20,000 passes. The variation in costs for gravel roads is even
less.   In other words, the decrease in vehicle operating costs due
to smoother road surfaces, is balanced by the increase in mainten-
ance costs required to obtain the smoother surface.

     On the basis of these results, optimum frequencies were selected
as follows:

     Earth:         Every 4 to 5,000 vehicle passes
     Poor Gravel:   Every 6,000 vehicle passes
     Good Gravel:   Every 12,000 vehicle passes.

     That is to say, more frequent grading than currently practised
can be justified for earth roads, but less frequent grading is
appropriate on gravel roads, very much less frequent if good gravel
surfaces are placed. This is similar to the conclusion of the World
Bank 1978 Highway Maintenance Project Report.

     Analysis of Initial Paved Road Maintenance policies - Paved
roads were classified into five groups decided partly by location,
and partly by traffic volume and likely traffic growth character-
istics.  Eight initial paved road policies were defined for analysis,
based on variations in the frequency and intensity of the patching
and surface dressing operations. These policies were tested for each
paved road group for the period 1981-1990, and the results of the
evaluations, in terms of total discounted economic costs for each
policy, are shown in Table 11-12.

       The same basic conclusions can be reached as for unpaved road
 policies; that total transport costs do not vary much over quite
 a wide range of maintenance policies. The smallest variations
 observed in total cost over the range of policies tested were for
.road groups 1 and 4 (4 percent) and the largest was for group 5
  (12 percent).  In general, policies combining a higher level of
 patching with a medium frequency of surface dressing appeared to
 do better. At higher traffic volumes, an increased frequency of
 surface dressing becomes justified.

     Selection of a National Road Maintenance Program - From the
analyses of the initial road maintenance policies by road surface
type presented above, a set of five policies was selected, combin-
ing paved and unpaved policies, for evaluation together with the
road improvement investment program. These are specified in Table
11-13, together with a policy representing current practice (0)
which was obtained by adjusting the policies in HOM Model in a
calibration process until observed maintenance quantities were
reproduced.

     Some changes were made from the initial policies described
above, the most important concerning the 'maintenance of poor gravel
roads.  In the analysis of the initial policies presented above, it
was assumed that good gravel standards were only attainable on roads
subject to major gravelling, as described earlier in the chapter.
However, it seemed reasonable to assume that if routine resurfacing
and maintenance operations for poor gravel roads started to make
use of better gravel, some benefit would be felt.   It was considered
that the benefits to this better maintenance operation would be
about half the benefit derived from a full scale conversion to a
good gravel surface. On this basis, improved maintenance operations
of this nature could be justified for poor gravel surfaces with
volumes above 30 vehicles per day.   In ~ddition, the current policy
for paved roads assumed a limit of 50 m per kilometer for patching
operations, instead of 100 m2 assumed previously.

     Each of the maintenance policies defined in Table 11-13 were
tested for the period 1981-1990, assuming an investment program
for major road improvements -- committed road projects, road better-
ment with paving and major gravelling. Each policy was compared to
the current policy, and the following net present values were cal-
culated (presented in order of increasing cost):

     Policies are worth considering if they show an increase in net
present value for increasing cost. On this basis, any of the poli-
cies 1, 3 and 5 are worth considering and the best policy depends
on what other demands are made on funds for investment. An optimum
policy was selected using the budget allocation procedure. The
alternative maintenance policies were assumed to be in competition
with major road improvement projects -- betterment and major gravel-
ling -- for the same funds.

     Under the high budget assumption (see first section of this
Chapter), maintenance policy 3 was selected but under the medium
budget, no policy was selected - that is to say, the current policy
should be continued. However, with only a slight relaxation of the
very stringent investment limits in the first period for the medium
budget, maintenance policy 1 is selected.  If it is assumed that
total funds over the period 1981-1990 will correspond to the medium
budget, but that more will be available in the first period than
previously considered, then maintenance policy 3 is again selected.

     It is therefore recommended that maintenance standards as
specified in policy 3 (see Table 11-13) should be adopted as a
guide to maintenance operations. Maintenance quantities implied
by Policy 3, compared with current maintenance, are shown in Table
11-14. The requirement for grading of gravel roads falls as good
gravel and better techniques are introduced, but grading on earth
roads increases. Surface dressing frequencies on paved roads are
high (average of once every five to six years) probably due to the
comparatively weak pavements both on existing roads and on roads
recommended for betterment. This aspect should be looked at more
closely by the new Maintenance Study.

     In fact, the total quantities indicated in Table 11-14 will
not be achieved as it will take time to introduce the new policies.
It is assumed that the recommended new policy will be introduced
in the three districts of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz over
the four years of the Pilot Maintenance Study, and that this same
study will also prepare the way for the introduction of better
maintenance standards to the rest of the country afterwards.   It
is expected that more detailed evaluations during the Pilot Main-
tenance Study will result in modifications to the policy recommended
here, at least to introduce local and regional variations.

here covers only the roads in the Study computer transport network.
This includes all paved roads, 95 percent of gravel roads but only
20 percent of earth roads.

Of this latter category, all roads currently maintained under
"prestacion vial" (see earlier), and some roads covered by
the SNC 'temporary' maintenance category, were excluded from
the computer network. To allow for this for budget presenta-
tion purposes total gravel road maintenance costs were increased
by 5 percent and total earth road costs by 50 percent (assuming
that most of these roads have very low volumes of traffic and
require little maintenance). The Pilot Maintenance Study should
investigate this in more detail.

     Also, to allow for a start-up period for improved main-
tenance, costs were adjusted as follows:

      1981-1983   - Additional maintenance under Policy 3 inclu-
                    ded only for the three districts of La Paz,
                    Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. The deferred
                    maintenance of the Pilot Maintenance Project
                    is assumed to be a part of this.

      1984-1986   - Additional maintenance under Policy 3 is
                    included in full for the three districts
                    listed above, together with half the
                    additional maintenance for the remainder
                    of the country.

      1987-1990   - All additional costs under Policy 3 are
                    included.

     Finally, costs of maintenance so far present exclude costs
of administration and supervision - essentially the cost of
running the SNC Maintenance Divisions throughout the country;
these are added below.

     Estimated costs of routine maintenance for the ten years,
1981-1990, are as follows:

     By the end of the period 1981-1990, average costs of
maintenance by surface type would change considerably, as
indicated below (averaging over all roads in the country) :

     Paved road costs. increase greatly due to more intense
patching and also to the introduction of surface dressing on
a large scale. Gravel road costs stay about the same, which
is the effect of two contrary influences: while unit costs
go up due to the introduction of new techniques, including
use of good gravel, the frequency of gravel road maintenance
operation can be decreased substantially due to the greater
durability of the improved surfaces. Earth road maintenance
costs increase sharply from the present low levels.

     Average traffic volumes on roads included in the compu-
ter Transport Network in 1989, according to the results of
the Recommended Network Test, were as follows:


     Paved  (2,204 km)       =         782 vehicles per day
     Gravel (5,834 km)                 137 vehicles per day
     Earth (4,857 km)        =          21 vehicles per day


Bridge Construction

      The Study made a survey of bridge requirements and iden-
 tified a total of 325 locations where bridges could be required,
 totalling 17,700 meters. This compares with between 150 and
 200 bridges built in the twenty-one years from 1960 to 1980
 with a total length of 9,100 meters. The cost of building all
.325 bridges identified is estimated at $b 2,414 million.

     SNC also identified for the Study 34 old bridges in
need of replacement, totalling 1,327 meters. All of these
bridges are for single direction traffic and have low load-
ing limits. The cost of replacing these bridges would be
about $b 179 million.

     The Chimore-Yapacani project is already committed with
construction expected to start in 1982. The other three pro-
jects are all discussed in detail in Chapter 12. With the
exception of San Borja-Trinidad, the bridges for these projects
will require special contracts and the design would be beyond
the capacity of the SNC bridge department.
     For the remaining new bridge projects, assessments were
made of the probable benefits due to bridges through avoi-
dance of traffic interruptions. The extent of road inter-
ruptions varies widely, from delays of only two or three
hours, up to interruptions of a few days. Interruptions are
concentrated in the wet season, which usually last from the
beginning of December to the end of March. After a prelimin-
ary screening, 69 bridge projects remained for evaluation.:
The bridge evaluations are described in detail in Appendix llF.
     The cost of delays without bridge construction were cal-
culated separately for short and long interruptions. For
short interruptions, it was assumed that only vehicle, crew
and passenger time costs were of importance. The number of
vehicles likely to encounter the delay were calculated and
each was assumed to experience half of the length of the
delay on average.
     For longer interruptions, cargo delay costs were also
taken into account. Also, it was assumed that for long delays,
neither passengers nor vehicles or crew would be entirely idle
throughout the interruption, but that there would be the
ability to compensate by the rescheduling of activities.
     The results of the evaluations of the bridges are shown
in Table il-15. First year rates of return are shown for
the year 1989 and projects are listed in order of priority.

Sixty-nine bridges are considered totalling 2,280 meters and
costing an estimated 308 million pesos. Of these, only 26
bridges, totalling 888 meters, attain a first year rate of
return greater than 12 percent.
     It is notoriously difficult to assess accurately the delays
caused by lack of bridges, or the effect that lack of bridges
has on restricting the development of a region.   Therefore, all
bridges shown in Table 11-15, together with the bridges for
San Borja-Trinidad and the replacement of existing bridges indi-
cated above, should all be considered as candidate projects for
the next ten years. Of these bridges, those on the Patacamaya-
Puerto Japon~s-Tambo Quemado route area special case, in that the
beds of the rivers crossed are unstable resulting in not infre-
quent loss of vehicles. These bridges are therefore required to
make the route safe, rather than to avoid delays.


Evaluation of the Ri'o Grande Crossing

     The Rlo Grande, east of Santa Cruz, presents a serious
obstacle to travel. Although it is crossed by a 1.8 km rail-
road bridge at Puerto Pailas on the Santa Cruz-Corumba line,
no permanent road crossing exists.  Instead, vehicles have to
use a ferry crossing further north at Puerto Banegas. A plan
of the region is shown in Figure 11-9.

     The Puerto Banegas road ferry is unsatisfactory for many
reasons. First, it cannot operate for periods during the wet
season because of strong currents. Secondly, the pontoons
which carry the vehicles are manipulated solely by manual
labor and are consequently very slow. Thirdly, the approaches
to the ferry are unsatisfactory, passing over mud flats when
water levels are low. Fourthly, long delays are often
encountered. Lastly, very high tariffs are charged by the
operators. Normal tariffs are between $b 200 and $b 400 for
a truck, but tariffs charged can rise to between $b 2,000 and
$b 2,500 in times of high demand due to the monopoly of the
operators.

     A preliminary evaluation was made of four alternatives to
the existing ferry, as follows:

     •   Motorized pontoons at Puerto Banegas
     •   Hovercraft ferry at Puerto Banegas
     •   Road bridge at Puerto Banegas
     •   Use of rail bridge at Puerto Pailas.

     The results of the evaluations are summarized in Table
11-16.

                                                              THE RIO GRANDE

     Traffic volumes in 1989 are estimated at 260 vehicles
per day, or roughly 95,000 vehicles per year, of which 70
percent would originate in Santa Cruz and 30 percent in the
Montero area.
     It is assumed that two motorized pontoons with a capacity
of 6 vehicles would be required at a cost of $b 1.5 million
each. Likewise, a minimum of two hovercraft would be needed.
Hovercraft costs are likely to be about $b 40 million each for
a craft capable of taking about three trucks. In both cases,
it is assumed that pontoons and hovercraft would have to be
replaced after 10 years.
     The cost of a 1.5 km road bridge was estimated at $b 130
million based on estimate costs for a 1 km bridge in the
Chimore-Yapacan1 contract currently being negotiated. Invest-
ment costs for the rail bridge include qecking the bridge,
providing a telephone system, paving the road from Cotoca to
        .
Puerto Pailas
         ~
              and the construction of a new 70 km gravel road
                                                    ~
from Pa1lon to Los Troncos on the east bank of the R10 Grande.
     Operating costs for the current service, the motorized
pontoon and the hovercraft were estimated at 40, 150 and 360
pesos per vehicle respectively. Operating costs for the rail
bridge alternative consist of salaries for an attendent at
each end of the bridge to operate an alternating one-way
traffic system.
     Road vehicle operating costs and road maintenance costs
were calculated using values estimated by the Study (see
Chapter 5). Delay costs assumed the following delay values:

                            AVERAGE LENGTH OF DELAYS
                        Light Vehicles    Heavy Vehicles
Existing Situation        1.0 hours         3.0 hours
Motorized pontoon         0.5               1.5
Hovercraft                0.25              0.25
Road bridge               o                 o
Rail bridge               0.25              0.25


     Results of the Evaluation - The motorized pontoon appears
economically feasible, but probably such a service is not tech-
nically feasible due to the shallow water and the constantly
moving sand bars. Neither would it remove.the problem of the
approaches to the ferry at low water levels, which pass over
mud flats.




                         -229-
     Hovercraft, which could negotiate the sand bars and mud
flats, are not economically feasible since both initial invest-
ment costs and annual operating costs are relatively high.
Moreover, the hovercraft requires a higher investment for lower
benefits than the rail bridge alternative.

     The rail bridge alternative does appear to be feasible,
despite the higher road vehicle operating costs due to the need
for vehicles to travel a longer distance on gravel roads. How-
ever" the new road bridge is also feasible with a single year
rate of return on the additional investment over the rail bridge
alternative of nearly 40 percent. Even if the present plans to
implement the rail bridge alternative are completed, the addi-
tional benefits of the road bridge justify the total investment
required. Also, given that the rail bridge alternative is
implemented, it would still be better to build the road bridge
than to pave the Pai16n-Los Troncos road.

     In fact, the evaluation is very conservative. It takes
no account of the exorbitant fees currently charged by the
ferry operators, assuming that the authorities could regulate
the existing services better than at present. Also, current
delays can be very much longer then the three hours assumed
for trucks so that, again, the evaluation assumes that consi-
derable improvements could be made in the existing ferry
services. Finally, no account was taken of the interuption
to the existing ferry service each year or of the potential
benefits from exploiting the regions on the east bank of the
Rio Grande.

     On the basis of this analysis, a road bridge at Puerto
Banegas appears to be a worthwhile project, even if construc-
tion costs were to double over present estimates.  It is the
best alternative since it would remove completely the problem
of delays, would cost nothing to operate (apart from mainten-
ance), would be in the best location for most potential traffic,
and would make full use of the already available paved road
system on the west bank of the Rio Grande. A detailed feasi-
bility study investigating bridge location and cost, as well as
traffic levels and development potential on the east bank of
the Rio Grande, is strongly recommended. For investment pro-
gramming purposes, it is assumed that the project will prove to
be feasible for the period 1987-1990.


New Roads in the Central and Southern Regions

     Some projects were identified for new roads   in the more
developed regions of the country.  In all cases,   they were for
low standard unpaved roads linking comparatively   small popula-
tion centers. None of the projects proved to be    feasible



                          -230-
solely as strategic transport links. Some could perhaps be
justified as part of a rural development scheme, but this re-
quires further study.

     The projects are shown in Figure 11-10 and are listed
below:

     1.   Inquisivi-Independencia
     2.   Lambate-La Plazuela
     3.   Rio Caine-Anzaldo
     4.   Bolivar-Anzaldo
     5.   Villa Serrano-Pucara
                         .~
     6.   Vallegrande-Ip1ta
     7•   Trementinal-Carapari.

     In the case of Vallegrande-Ipita, a road does exist but
three bridges are required as well as improved surface and
drainage.  The road is currently impassable.

     All roads were included in the 1989 Test Transport Net-
work and flows were estimated using the Transport Model.
Forecast flows were low or even zero in some cases, and it is
not possible to justify construction of any of these links by
1989. Forecast flows on the Trementinal-Carapari road were
the highest of this group but even so, the rate of return was
only 7 percent. The physical characteristics, estimated
costs, forecast flows and results of the evaluations are
summarized in Table 11-17.

     In all cases, these roads could serve to open up new
agricultural land, although in the case of the two routes in
the Yungas valleys, the additional land would be marginal.
The region of the Vallegrande and Pucara roads is underpopulated
and the prospects for agricultural exploitation would probably
depend upon a well-organized rural development scheme. A
similar conclusion can be reached about the Trementinal-Cara-
par{ road, although this route has a more important network
function than the other roads, and therefore requires less
rural development benefits.  In contrast the region of Anzaldo
is comparatively densely populated with good agricultural
prospects.

     In conclusion, it can be affirmed that these roads would
have a minimal function as part of the strategic road system
and could not be justified at the present time on this basis.
Combined with rural development projects these roads could be
useful in opening up new areas, with the best chances of
success being in the Anzaldo and Trementinal regions. Studies
of the potential of these two regions are recommended. Without
combined rural development projects, it is not recommended
that any of these roads are constructed.

high, for example, the designs for Santa Cruz-Yacuiba, Rio Seco-
Desaguadero (by Prudencio Claros-Delcanda) and the preliminary
design for Unc1a-Sucre-Muyupampa. Before most of the projects
recommended by the Study can be implemented, further studies
will be required. These studies should reconsider, where
appropriate, the question of modal competition between road
and rail in the same corridor.

     Two types of studies are needed (although they are often
merged):  feasibility studies to investigate levels of design
in relation to technical problems and to prove economic feasi-
bility; and design studies, to prepare construction plans and
final costs.  In the investment program, all necessary studies
are assumed to cost two percent of the final project cost.
This figure was based on an analysis of recent road feasibility
and design studies.

     In general, studies should be completed two to three years
in advance of the projected construction date, to allow time
for detailed project programming and letting of contracts.   In
some cases, though, it is best to complete a feasibility study
for a complete route, and then follow with design studies
nearer the planned construction date for each stage. This
particularly applies to the penetration roads recommended.

     There is no point in preparing a detailed program of
studies for the next ten years since it can be expected that
priorities will change from those specified in this Report,
as more information becomes available, or as circumstances
change. Therefore, a study program is specified for only the
next three years.

    Studies of seven types of projects are considered below:

           (i)   Penetration roads
          (ii)   Betterment
         (iii)   Existing paved roads
          (iv)   Major gravelling
           (v)   Bridges
          (vi)   New highways
         (vii)   Other studies.




                           -233-
     Penetration Roads - Three major penetration roads are recom-
mended by the Study:

      (i)    Rurrenabaque-Ixiamas-Guarayos-Chive

     (ii)    Trinidad-San Ramon-Puerto Siles-Guayaramer1n

    (iii)    Puerto Suarez-Quituanquina

     The first two of these roads are recommended for completion
in the period 1981-1990, and an overall feasibility study is
required for each route as soon as possible. Such studies should
take into account the needs for feeder road construction, and
should be coordinated closely with the plans of other affected
Ministries (Agriculture, Migration, etc.).  Individual design
studies for each section should be completed according to the
staging of construction.

     The completion of Puerto Suarez-Quitunquifia is not recom-
mended in the next ten years, so a complete feasibility study
does not have high priority. Design studies are required for
the two sections recommended in Chapter 12.

     Betterment - About 600 km of betterment (s£e earlier)
have been recommended in the next ten years, but it is accepted
that this concept of road improvement is untried. Therefore,
it is strongly recommended that the first betterment projects
are treated as pilot studies, with the objective of determining
cost and benefits of such projects in more detail. Such pilot
studies should try to establish general rules on the applica-
tion of this technique throughout the country.

     Two projects are suggested as pilot studies:

     (i)    R.10 Seco-Desaguadero
    (ii)    Challapata-Ventilla.

     These two projects pass through   different types of terrain
   mainly flat for the former and at   least partly mountainous
for the latter. Although the latter    project is not recommended
for construction until 1987-1990, it   would be a very suitable
route to study.

     If it is objected that betterment is not appropriate for
Rlo Seco-Desaguadero, (being an international highway subject
to special treaty - see Appendix IlG) , then Huarina-Achacachi
could be substituted.

     Apart from these pilot studies, feasibility and design




                            -234-
studies (probably combined) will be required for the following
betterment projects:

       (i)    Santa Cruz-Cotoca
      (ii)    CObija-porvenir
     (iii)    Trinidad-Puerto A1macen
      (iv)    Huarina-Achacachi
       (V)    Rio Seco-Desaguadero
      (vi)     Machac~marca-Huanuni
     (vii)     potosl-Cucho Ingenio
    (viii)     Potosl~Sij11ani
      (i±)     Sucre-Pu1quia1to.

     Major Gravelling - Major studies are not required for
these projects, but route surveys must be completed to deter-
ment the work required on new drainage structures. Such
surveys do not need to be prepared so far in advance of the
construction date as recommended for other projects. The fol-
lowing routes should be studied in the next three years.
      (i)     Unduavi-Chu1umani
     (ii)     Oruro-To1edo
    (iii)     Camargo-Las Carreres
     (iv)     Iscayachi-Tomatas
      (v)     Sucre-Tarabuco
     (vi)     Mutun-Quijarro.

     Existing Paved Roads - A program of just over 500 km
of overlaying and 188 km of rehabilitation is recommended
for the next six years. Probably, no detailed studies are
required for overlaying, but designs must be prepared for
the rehabilitation projects. These are:

     (i)     Comarapa-Jorochito      (120 kID)
    (ii)     Guabira-Yapacan1        ( 68 km)

     Also, a design study will be required for paving the 29
km section still unpaved in Cochabamba-Vi11a Tunari.

     Bridges - SNC are already in the process of preparing
plans for nineteen bridges of the recommended bridge program,
for possible financing by the Interamerican Development Bank
(IDB). In general, bridge construction should coincide with
other route improvements where possible, and this should
determine the appropriate program for feasibility and design
studies.

     New Highways - Studies are required for new roads but •
not until later in the decade, e.g. Eteramazama-San Ignacio
de Moxos and Santa Barbara-Bella Vista. Studies are already



                             -235-
complete, or nearly complete, for San Borja-Trinidad, Machaca-
marca-Challapata and Las Carreras-Iscayachi.  In the case of
San Borja-Trinidad, though, it is recommended that investiga-
tion, and perhaps experiments, are made on a method of sealing
the road surface avoiding the use of expensive gravel (see
Chapter 12).  It is also recommended that the design for Macha-
camarca-Challapata be re-examined to see if costs can be reduced.

     It was noted earlier that none of the seven new roads
studied in central and southern Bolivia could be recommended
for strategic reasons, although some could be worthwhile as
part of a rural development project. Two of these roads --
Bolivar-Anzaldo and Trementinal-Carapar1 -- are particularly
recommended for such studies.

     Other Studies - An axle load measurement program is
specified in Appendix llA, but this should be studied in
more detail before initiation.

     Concluding Remarks on Design Studies - Many expensive
design studies have been undertaken in recent years, three
of which were listed in the introduction of this section.
Such studies, by preparing designs which cannot realistically
be justified or afforded for many years to come, serve very
little purpose.  It is strongly recommended that future studies
are defined within the framework of the Investment Program
recommended by this Study, including the studies outlined
above for the next three years.

Conclusions on Existing Highways

     Projects for paving 736 km of unpaved roads and for major
gravelling of a further 3,643 km are recommended in the central,
more developed regions of the country for the next decade. To
a large extent, the projects recommended will mean a change in
emphasis in road planning. Apart from committed projects and
the Machacamarca-Challapata highway, no major new highways are
recommended. All the remaining paving projects are for better-
ment, where the road is improved on the existing alignment.

     Betterment includes widening, improved drainage, improvement
of sharp curves and provision of a 6-meter pavement. Major
gravelling consists of improvements to drainage and placing a
new surface of selected and compacted gravel.

      In addition, several new highways are recommended in the
remote regions (see Chapter 12), but these are generally low
volume penetration and feeder roads with gravel or earth
surface. The only paved highway recommended in Chapter 12 is
Santa Barbara-Bella Vista, but it is recommended that this
road is built to lower design standards than currently envis-
aged.

                          -236-
     The emphasis has been given to such relatively low level
improvements because there are no unpaved roads in Bolivia with
volumes higher than 300-400 vehicles per day, and only 527 km
carry volumes higher than 200 vehicles per day, so that high
capacity routes are not required for some time to come. The
emphasis in the next decade must be on improving surfaces;
improvements to alignment must take second place.

     Also recommended is an extensive program of improvements
to existing paved roads, some of which have deteriorated badly.
It is considered that 820 km will require treatment in the next
ten years with 211 km of overlaying recommended for the first
three years.

     It is recommended that the current program of improvements
to existing feeder roads (financed by USAID) be continued at
about the current levels.

     An improvement in maintenance standards is also strongly
recommended. The new gravel surfaces (recommended as major
gravelling) will require improved maintenance techniques, and
benefit can also be obtained by placing better gravel on the
existing poor surfaces.

     On paved roads, patching should be increased from the pre-
sent negligible levels and routine surface dressing introduced.
For gravel roads, better graded gravel should be used together
with watering and compacting every third grading. With these
improvements, frequency of grading could be reduced from current
levels. On the other hand, more intensive grading and spot
gravelling is required on earth roads.

     Construction of a total of 103 bridges is recommended over
the next ten years, apart from bridges required for new highway
projects.  34 of the 103 bridges are required as replacements
for existing deficient structures.
     In addition, a feasibility study is recommended for a new
bridge over the Rio Grande at Puerto Banegas near Santa Cruz.
It is estimated that such a bridge could be economically feas-
ible by 1987.
     All projects recommended by the Study will require more
detailed feasibility studies, and a program of such studies is
recommended.  In particular, more detailed studies are required
of the concept of betterment (see above) and it is recommended
that two pilot studies are undertaken, one in flat terrain and
the other in undulating to mountainous terrain. Whe~e apprQpipte
feasibility studies should reconsider the question of modal
competition.

NEW PENETRATION ROADS AND
  OTHER TRANSPORT LINKS
     IN REMOTE AREAS
CHAPTER 12

NEW PENETRATION ROADSAND
OTHER TRANSPORT LINKS IN REMOTE AREAS
     The road and rail networks are concentrated in the center
and southwest of the country, where most of the people live.
The previous chapter was devoted to projects for improving
the roads in that area where there are already roads. In this
chapter, the attention remains mainly on roads but shifts to
the northern and eastern quarters of the country where there
are few people and little transport except by air or river.
     It might be argued that, with so much land, it would be
better to concentrate on the best and ignore the rest. By
and large, the people have chosen the Altiplano and have turned
their backs on the hot lowlands. But the capacity for agricul-
tural production on the Altiplano is limited, and that area is
becoming less able to provide for the growing population. The
lowlands have a difficult climate and lack the attractions of
the Andes, but they offer the possib~lity of greater agricultural
production, as evident from Figure 12-1. Moreover, Bolivia is a
nation and there are already communities of Bolivians scattered
through the remote forests and pampas of Pando, the Beni and
Santa Cruz. Government policy is to strengthen the links with
these isolated outposts of the nation and foster the develop-
ment of the natural resources that abound there.
     The technology of our time makes it inevitable that roads
should be the leading form of transport for opening up new
regions. Air transport has a pioneering role to play but is
too expensive and restrictive to remain the sole, or dominant
means of transport. Railroads, to be economic, need large,
concentrated volumes of traffic, which are difficult to fore-
see in these parts of Bolivia. Rivers offer the cheapest, but
much the slowest, form of transport; since the beginning of
history they have provided impressive natural transport
systems, particularly in the Amazon basin, but they have gen-
erated little development along their banks and little traffic.
It is roads, of simple construction, offering cheap, reasonably
fast and convenient transport by truck, bus and car, that give
the best chance of opening up new areas. That is why this
chapter is almost exclusively about roads.
     The first part of the chapter is about penetration and
feeder roads. These are pure development roads, driven into
empty, inaccessible areas with the sole or predominant intention
of stimulating settlement and development. The second part is
concerned with new links in the national network,which pass


                         -239-
                                                                      •



through large remote areas. Trinidad, though at present only
a small unpretentious town, is the focus of these links. There
is the long, difficult link between La Paz and Trinidad,
descending the Andes and crossing extensive cattle country
now dependent on air transport. There is the proposed road
from Cochabarnba to Trinidad, passing through an area which,
although practically at the geometric center of the country,
is almost unknown. Finally there is the Central Beni Corridor,
a transport spine proceeding from Santa Cruz northwards through
Trinidad and beyond, involving the Mamor~ River and the rail-
road extension from Yapacan!, as well as more roads.

New Penetration and Feeder Roads

     In function there is no difference between a penetration
road and a feeder road, but the penetration road is of a
higher class, permitting higher traffic speeds and hence
possessing the capability of opening up more remote areas.
Given a large inaccessible area, the logical way to open it
up is to build one or more penetration roads into it,
supported by a number of feeder roads. The design of such
systems of penetration and f~eder roaQs was studied
theoretically, as presented ~n Append 1 x l2A.

     An important principle to be observed is that it is seldom
economic to build long stretches of penetration road without .
feeder roads (and without rural development prpgrams accompany~ng
them). The roads should generally be focussed on a market so
that transport costs to the market from all the extremities of
the systenl are equal. The angle and spacing of the feeder roads
should be calculated to maximize the net benefit from the whole
development. The optimum spacing of feeder roads depen?s critically
on the cost of off-road transport, i.e. the cost of mov~ng produce
from the point of production to the feeder road, and this depends
on the nature of the terrain and the type of product.

     It is considered that, in cattle country, feeder roads
should be built at intervals of approximately 10 km. This
allows farms of 5,000 hectares to be established with direct
access to a public road.  In areas of arable farming, it is
assumed that feeder roads would be provided at invervals of
about 5 km unless there are geographical obstacles.

     Conditions for Successful Development - A penetration
road is intended to enable people to move into the neighboring
area, to exploit its possibilities, be they agriculture, cattle
breeding, forestry or whatever, and to transport their surplus
output to market. Many such roads, however, have failed to
produce that impact. The essential requirements for a
penetration road are:

     eLi)     it must also give access to a market where the
              output of the area can be sold;

     (iv)     the size of the market must be sufficient to absorb
              the new source of supply without prices being forced
              down to an unprofitable level.
      Three other conditions which may, in the case of Bolivia,
be equally essential, are:
      (Vl     substantial investment may be needed in production
              facilities; roads are not likely to be worthwhile
              if they generate only primitive, extensive farming,
              especially for livestock, producing very low yields
              per hectare; if the value of the road depends on
              more intensive farming methods, requiring some
              capital investment, there must be good reason to
              believe that this will be achieved;
     ('vil    there must be a sufficient supply of immigrant labor;
    (vii}     adequate living conditions must be provided to attract
              the migrants, i.e. homes, schools, medical facilities,
              shops, etc.
     If the right conditions prevail, there are three reasons
why it could be in the national interest to open up new areas
of agriculture, including livestock, forestry and fish: first,
to reduce imports of commodities like wheat that could be
produced in Bolivia; secondly, to create new sources of exports;
and thirdly, to enable part of the population to move from
areas of low productivity to areas where it could be much
higher.

      The first two reasons are related to the country's balance
 bf payments problem, which is probably the biggest obstacle at
 present to economic growth. The third reason is related to the
 distribution of population, which is a major cause of low
 incomes in Bolivia. In these ways, it may be argued, the
 opening up of new areas of primary production could not only
 raise incomes directly but could do so in a way that improves
 the external balance of payments and thus helps to promote
 further growth.




                             -241-
     Before accepting the need for penetration roads, however
one should consider two other questions. First, are there not
already penetration roads that have failed to attract develop-
ment? For example, the road from Cochabamba to the Chapare was
partly built as a penetration road but little developemnt has
taken place since its construction. Secondly, before attempting
to move people from the poor Altiplano, is it not possible to
increase their productivity where they are?

      It will be difficult to predict that new penetration        ;1


roads will attract development if existing roads in equally       I,
promising places have failed to do so. In certain cases,
their lack of success may have been due to the absence of
supporting feeder roads, and this Study therefore considers
these as a necessary complement to major penetration roads.       'I

The failure of certain past road investments to attract
development may also have been the lack of accompanying
settlement and agricultural programs, further discussed           1
below.
     The second issue concerns the efficiency of existing
agricultural production. Instead of expanding the area
under cUltivation it might be more economic to invest money
and effort in raising the productivity of land already in
cultivation. It is a considerable undertaking, and a great
social upheaval, to shift thousands of people from one part
of the country to another, to clear great areas of forest
and to establish new farming communities, together with
transport and marketing facilities. The final result could
be simply a transfer of inefficient farming from one part of
the country to another. Before commencing such an undertaking
one should be sure that the prospect of higher productivity in
the new areas is realistic and that there are not easier ways
of achieving the same gain in productivity by improving the
methods of cultivation on existing farms.
     This question, however, lies beyond the scope of this
Study, as a transport analysis cannot investigate the
efficiency of agricultural production. Nevertheless it would
be wrong to build new roads on the supposition that they will
attract efficient and profitable agriculture without putting
into action a complementary development program to ensure
that this will actually happen.
     The case for penetration roads obviously depends on the
existence of potentially profitable areas. In Bolivia it is
easy to find areas where various kinds of commodities could
be produced, but to be profitable they must have an adequate
market. Within Bolivia, the market for such commodities lies
mostly in La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and, to a smaller



                         -242-
extent, the other towns of appreciable size, but this market
is already well supplied from domestic production with all
important agricultural commodities except wheat, apples and
pears. The domestic market is, of course, growing and will
provide an outlet for steadily increasing production, but
this will not be sufficient to support schemes for large and
rapid expansion. For them, one must look to export markets.

     There are few export opportunities in the neighboring
countries, because they tend to be surplus producers of the
same products; one important exception being the sale of meat
in the cities of Chile and Peru. The main opportunities,
however, lie in Europe and Japan, for meat, leather and timber,
and in the United States for timber.  If these markets are to
be developed, cheap, efficient transport connections are essen-
tial, which at present do not exist.

      Other things being equal, new agricultural areas should be
near to La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz if their target is
the domestic market, and near to good export routes if they are
aiming for foreign markets. One of the objectives of this Study
was to find ways of improving the export routes through the
Amazon Basin and the Paraguay River. The assessment of pene-
tration roads considered that such improvements can and will be
made.

     Finally, there is in Bolivia another reason for penetration
roads. Some areas have already been partly opened up by means
of air transport. These areas are mainly in the Beni and depend
on the production of meat for La Paz and the Altiplano. Without
roads, the economic and social development of these areas is
strictly limited. The introduction of roads is sorely needed
and will undoubtedly transform life in these areas. Several of
the roads discussed in this chapter are of this sort; they are
designed, not to open up virgin territory, but to stimulate a
fuller and more efficient development of areas already under
production.

 Selection of Penetration Road Projects

     The study of penetration roads assumed that there was a
need for such roads, if promising conditions could be found.
Figure 12-2 demonstrates that it is above all the north and
east of the country that lacks road access.  It was mostly in
these areas that a systematic examination of agricultural and
mineral potential (summarized in Appendix 12A) revealed more
than 20 possible penetration roads which, in most cases, would
be supported by feeder roads.

     After an initial screening process, 16 roads were selected
for detailed evaluation; they are shown in Figure 12-3, and
Table 12-1 lists them together with their lengths and construc-
tion costs. They were studied in six groups.   Three roads a r e "
in northern La Paz near Ixiamas where coffee, cacao, rice, cit-
rus fruits and hardwoods are of interest. Two together cover
the length of Pando with the idea of stimulating the production
of rubber and nuts.  Five are designed to open up cattle farming
in the Beni.  One is a long road running along the Brazilian
Shield in Beni and Santa Cruz departments, which is dependent
on the discovery of mineral deposits there.  Then there are four
roads in eastern Santa Cruz department, of which two are alter-
native routes to San Matias; the other two are between Santa
Cruz and Puerto Su~rez in an effort to promote the development
of the Tucavaca valley with wheat, corn and yucca for the home
market and soya, meat, timber and fruit for export down the
Paraguay River.  The last road goes from Chuguisaca to the far
south of Tarija through an area capable of producing olives,
vines and a great variety of other fruit.

     The cost of these 16 roads is estimated at $b 10,653
million but/when properly supported by feeder roads, the total
cost would probably be over $b 27,000 million, which is about
half of the budget likely to be available for road investment
outside urban areas in the next 20 years. Clearly they will
not all be built in that time, and a process of selection and
ranking is necessary.

Method of Approach for Evaluation of Penetration Roads

     The conventional method, when comparing and choosing
between a number of road proposals, is to predict and
evaluate their costs and benefits over a long period of years,
and to express their net benefits as a rate of return on
capital cost or, alternatively, as a net present value.

     This approach was not considered practicable here.   It is
not possible to predict with any assurance the impact of a
penetration road.  It is not only the nature and mag~it~de of
the impact that is difficult to predict, although th1s 1S
difficult enough, but the speed with which it will occur,
which is vital to the rate of return on investment. There
is no empirical basis on whi~h to forecast either the
scale or the pace of such developments.

     Consequently a less precise approach was adopted. The
starting point is the construction cost of the road, or of
the first section of the road, together with feeder roads.
Then the minimum benefit necessary to justify the investment
can be calculated. The net benefit from the road consists of
the net profits of the induced agricultural development, over
and above a normal return on capital employed therein, less
road maintenance costs and any other net public expenditure.
Given a knowledge of the crops to be produced, their produc-       ,I

tion costs and market prices, one can translate the required
benefits into the number of hectares of land that must be
developed at an assumed rate per annum; and the slower the
rate of development, the larger the number of hectares that
must be developed. What is the probability that the scale
and pace of development will equal or exceed these require-
ments? That is the key question to be answered. And, given
several proposals for penetration roads, which ones offer the
highest probability of meeting their respective requirements?

     Thus the problem was turned from what would have been
a spurious attempt to estimate a rate of return into a
probability judgement that there would be a clearly defined
minimum amount of development.
     The subsequent analysis took the following steps for
each project:

     (i 1   Estimate road construction and maintenance costs:

    (;ii)   Assess production potential of area accessible to
            proposed road and feeder roads, i.e. the type of
            products possible, the methods of production and
            likely yields per hectare;

   liii)    Calculate minimum requirements of net benefit to
            justify investment and maintenance: this follows
            from the above information together with assumptions
            about the minimum rate of return, which was taken as
            12 percent, and the starting-up period, which is
            discussed below;

    (ivL    Translate these requirements into hectares developed
            and profit margins after starting-up; for a given
            profit per hectare one can calculate the number of
            hectares that must be developed to produce the
            minimum benefit requirements; thus one obtains
            a number of possible combinations of hectares and
            profit margins that would satisfy the requirements;
            it is assumed that profit, over and above a normal
            return on capital invested in agriculture, is an
            acceptable measurement of economic benefit;

     (v)   Estimate costs of production per hectare, for each
           relevant crop;
    (vi)   Identify possible markets and transport costs to
           market;
   (yiil   Consider present and future market prices and
           profit margins;
  (viii)   Assess limitations of market size and other
           constraints on output;
    (ix)   Assess need for migrant labor and capital, and
           prospects of attracting it;
     (x)   Assess probability that development will exceed
           minimum requirements; this assessment is not a
           numerical measurement of probability but is arrived
           at by a method of numerical scoring.
     The last two steps, (ix) and (x) , have to be taken with
all the proposed roads together, since all are competing for
migrants and capital. In the final analysis one must
consider that the more roads are built, the smaller is the
chance of any of them being a success.

     Starting-Up Period - This important aspect needs explan-
ation. A particular problem with development roads is that
the development takes time. A starting-up period is needed
after the road is built, during which the development can take
place. Hence the benefits from the road will probably be low
in the first year and below the required rate of return for
several years at least. The internal rate of return and net
present value are severely affected by this starting-up period.

     It can be shown that if it takes 12 years for the
developmental impact of a road to take place, the required
final annual rate of return must be double the required
average annual rate on the whole investment, i.e. double the
required internal rate of return.

     In fact the most unpredictable aspect of penetration
roads is the speed with which development will follow. It
will depend on how fast they are built. If they outstrip
the available supply of migrants, the s~arting-up period will
be needlessly long. A basic assumption in this analysis is




                          -247-
that the building of penetration roads will be gradual and
will be related to the need, i.e. the construction program
will be flexible and will proceed just as fast as is
necessary to absorb the supply of migrants in an efficient
way.

     Even so, there will still be a starting-up period. At the
very least it takes time for migrants to prepare their land
and bring it into full production. This period might be 3
years for annual crops and could be as much as 10 years for
intensive cattle farming.  On the other hand, some land
suitable for agriculture contains saleable timber which must
be quickly removed and sold, thus bringing an immediate
once-and-for-all return. Land to be used only for timber
production may also begin to yield a maximum income in the
first year.

     It was assumed that the starting-up period would be 6 years
in arable areas, 12 years in cattle areas and 3 years in
forestry areas. Where an immediate income is possible from
cleared timber, this was deducted from the capital cost of
the project. It follows that the minimum annual rate of
return required on the net capital cost of the project when
in full production is 18 percent from arable development,
24 percent from cattle, and 15 percent from timber.

      These rates of return refer to the profits accruing to
land owners and farmers after a reasonable return has been
allowed on capital invested in the land itself. A similar
return should also be deducted for any net capital expenditure
from public funds on social infrastructure but the estimate
of each capital investment should be strictly net of the
expenditure that would have been necessary anyway somewhere
else.

        Minimum Benefits Required - The annual benefits required
   after the starting-up period were calculated, taking account of
   road construction and maintenance, and the effect of the
.. starting-up per iod. The benef i ts could in theory be· obtained from
  smaller or larger areas of cultivation with correspondingly
  higher or lower profits per hectare. The larger is the area,
 ·the greater is the length of penetration and feeder roads
  needed to serve it but, as shown in Appendix 12A,         there
  are quite big economies of scale in feeder road networks, so
   the required profit per hectare diminishes as the area of
  development expands.




                           -248-
     Table 12-2 shows the annual benefits required trom each
road for five alternative areas of development, and the
required profit per hectare, which varies from $b 2,950 for
a small development on road No. 2 (Apolo-Tumupasa) to $b 230
for a large development on road No. 12 (San Ignacio-San
Mat!as). This demonstrates the wide range in profitability
required to justify the provision of roads, resulting from
variations of construction cost, maintenance cost, starting-up
period and scale of development.
Economic Potential of Candidate Penetration Roads
     Each road was examined in accordance with the above
method. The details are described in Working Paper 66. The
conclusions regarding economic potential are summarized below.
     Road No.1, Ixiamas-Chive - This 219 km long road, shown in
Figure 12-4 together with others considered in northern La Paz,
passes through country of modest agricultural potential. It
is very poorly situated in relation to markets. Coffee could
be produced in certain areas and exported profitably through
Arica or Matarani. A possible market for rice and citrus
fruits exists in La Paz, and there is a possibility of
developing beef exports by air freight from Ixiamas to Peru
and Chile. It is probable that development, if it occurred,
would be on a relatively small scale. No more than an
initial 90 km section of penetration road from Ixiamas towards
Guarayos, with feeder roads, could be justified economically
within the foreseeable future. To justify the investment, annual
benefits of about $b 2,300 per hectare are likely to be
required. This return seems easily obtainable from coffee
and citrus fruits, and also from rice. Beef might also be
profitable, if produced intensively. For strategic reasons,
it may be desirable to extend this road another 129 km to
Chive, thereby completing a continuous land connection from
La Paz to Pando's capital, Cobija. It would also form part
of a major international connection (Carretera Marginal de
la Selva) planned to connect eastern Peru with Brazil and
Argentina.
      Road No.2, Apolo-Tumupasa - There appear to be some
highly profitable opportunities in the Apolo-Tumupasa area,
particularly in the production of cacao, rice and coffee.
But the area is badly located for export markets and must
depend mainly on the La Paz market. The potential for
expanding sales of rice and coffee in La Paz is small, and
the possibility of developing a sizeable market for cacao
in La Paz is uncertain. Furthermore, this 190 km long road
 would be costly because of the difficult terrain.

     It must be concluded that the development potential of
this road is doubtful and small in scale. It is therefore
improbably that one could justify in the foreseeable future
more than a short section, north of Apolo.

     Road No.3, Ixiamas-Tumupasa - This road is short, only
45 km, and would serve both as a development road and,
together with an improvement of the existing Tumupasa-San
Buenaventura road, as a network link connecting Ixiamas to
La Paz. The developmental potential of the road is modest and
probably does not justify any feeder roads in the foreseeable
future.  But there is some potential for timber for local
consumption, and possibly for the La Paz market, which would
yield relatively high benefits and would go a long way towards
justifying the cost of the road. The road could be justified
by the San Buenaventura sugar refinery project alone if this
went ahead quickly and successfully. It could also be justi-
fied by successful agricultural development along road No. 1
north of Ixiamas.

     Roads Nos. 4 and 5, Nacebe-Riberalta and Humait~-Fortaleza­
As shown in Figure 12-5, the proposed roads (181 km and 230 km
in length) are in an extremely isolated area where the costs of
transport to market are very high. The agricultural potent,ial
of the area is limited to rubber, nuts and timber, but there is
little commercial prospect for rubber, or for coconuts. There
are possibilities of profitable export of cashew nuts and wild
Brazil nuts, and there may be a market for high-quality timber.
But the scale of development is likely to be small and thus,
for as long as this remains true, there is no case for building ~
more than a short 50 km section of road from Riberalta to Humaita.

     As funds become available, either to national entities or
the Pando Development Corporation, it will be desirable to
continue the road as far as Nacebe, a distance of 131 km. This,
then, would provide a road connection from Riberalta/Guayaramerin
to Cobija, which currently is only possible through Brazilian
territory.

     Roads Nos. 6 to 10 in Beni Department - All five penetration
roads considered in the Beni (see Figure 12-6) run through large
areas of prairie land where, given adequate feeder roads, very
large cattle development could take place exceeding 0.5 million
hectares per road. The required annual benefit to justify the
roads would be $b 300-400 per hectare; this appears to be easily
achievable in export markets.

     It would take several decades to develop fully the cattle
opportunities of the Beni. It would therefore be wasteful to
build all five penetration roads, with feeders, in the near
future, supposing that this were feasible. An order of road
development is needed. The economic criteria for determining
this order are as follows:

                                                                    'I




       •   Quality of land
       •   Proximity to markets
       •   Proximity to urban facilities
       •   Utility of road as national network link
       •   Cost of road construction.
     The roads, or sections of roads, that best satisfy these       .,
criteria are the ones most likely to produce profitable and
speedy development. Having taken all these criteria into
account, the following order of development is suggested:
ROAD NO.

   9        Trinidad - San Ram6n, first section, 60 km
   8        Guayaramer!n - Puerto Siles, first section, 100 km
   9        Trinidad - San Ram6n, second section, 60 km
   8        Guayaramer!n - Puerto Siles, second section, 50 km
   9        Trinidad - San Ram6n, third section, 71 km
   8        Guayaramer!n - Puerto Siles, third section, 65 km
  10        San Ram6n - Magdalena, 60 km
   6        Santa Rosa - Riberalta, in sections, 270 km
   7        Blanca Flor - Puerto Siles, first section, 110 km       "
  10        Casarabe - Magdalena, 234 km
   7        Blanca Flor - Puerto Siles, second section, 110km

     Road No.9 has the further advantage that it passes relative-
ly near to Santa Ana de Yacuma, a major meat producing center
and currently the fourth largest town in Beni Department. It
is proposed that one of the feeder roads be built to a somewhat
hiqher standard, so that it effectively also serves as an access
spur to Santa Ana. Moreover, the purchase of a motori~ed pontoon
will be required to provide a crossing of the Mamor~ Rlver.

     It does not follow that    the whole, or indeed any, of the
above program is recommended    in the next 20 years. That
decision must wait until the    merits of roads in the Beni are
compared with those of other    roads.

     Road No. 11, Magdalena-San Ignacio - The main purpose of the
proposed 560 km long road is to serve possible mining ventures in
the Precambrian hills, which are believed to contain important
deposits of tin, tungsten, silver, gold, uranium, phosphorus and
other valuable minerals. Exploration of this huge area is still
in progress and the final results of the geological survey are
not expected until 1981. At present it is not certain that com-
mercial mining will be justified. There is no case for a road
until a decision has been taken to start such operations. If and
when the decision is made, a road will become immediately essen-
tial and its costs should be fully taken into account in the mak-
ing of the decision itself. If the mining potential is or real
value, the cost of the road should be relatively insignificant.

   Hence this road project, or part of it, could become a
project of top priority, and its length and precise location
would be determined by the prospective mining operations. But
equally, it could prove to be entirely unnecessary. The
position will doubtless become clear, one way or the other,
within the near future. The project cannot be recommended yet
but the long-term program for road construction should allow
for its possible inclusion at short notice.
      Roads Nos. 12 and 13 to San Mat!as - It is clear that beef
can be produced in the Pampas Ganaderasde San Mat!as at a cost
well below market prices and in large quantities. Assuming that
development ocurred fast enough, i.e. in 12 years, the penetra-
tion road could be justified by 85,000 hectares of intensive
cattle rearing. But the market in Brazil appears small and un-
reliable. The market through Buenos Aires is unlimited in size
but depends on the establishment of efficient processing plants
and transport to and down the Paraguay River.

        The geographical location of the various penetration roads
considered for eastern Santa Cruz is shown in Fugure 12-7. The
280 km long road, No. 12, which proceeds directly from San
l-1atl.as to San Ignacio, gives a journey distance between the two
points 55 km shorter than road No. 13, of which a part already
exists, leaving 195 km yet to be built to San Matias. Because
of the swamply terrain, however, it would be $b 168 million more
costly to build. To justify the more expensive road, traffic
savings (including savings in road maintenance costs) should
exceed $b 21.49 million a year. It is calculated that a traffic
volume of over 120 vehicles a day would be needed to justify the
extra cost of road No. 12. There is no prospect of this traffic
volume in the foreseeable future; therefore road No. 13 must be
preferred over road No. 12.
     Road No. 14, Tunas-San Jos~ de Chiquitos - The potential
soya production between San Jose and Santa Cruz is large. Only
a small part of the potential would need to be developed in
order to justify the 107 km long road. The product should be
readily marketable and is not very sensitive to price fluctua-
tions. Moreover, the black soils east of Tunas would permit a
second crop of cotton during the rainy season.

      However, the same products can also be grown west of Tunas,
although not quite as efficiently. Thus, it is considered more
useful to promote the construction of feeder roads off the exist-
ing road west of Tunas, before extending it eastwards across the
margin of the Izozog swamps.
      Road No.15, . QUitunquina-Puerto Su4rez - This road would
open up the Tucavaca valley, a large area of great agricultural
potential. Wheat and corn could be profitably produced and



                          -253-
                                                                    .,

transported via Santa Cruz for the domestic market, eliminating
the necessity to import these products. Sqya, citrus fruits,
rice and other crops could be highly profitable exports, given
efficient transport down the Paraguay River. The area nearer
Puerto Su~rez is potentially valuable for cattle, which
could also be profitably exported via the Paraguay River, given
a packing plant at the river port. There are also possibilities
of exporting timber. This area has the advantages of agricul-       .,
tural potential, large-scale, easy development and proximity
to a cheap export route.

      The scale of the Tucavaca development is such that it
will take several decades for the necessary settlers to migrate
to that area. Also, more practical experience is required
about the agricultural potential of the Tucavaca Valley and
its approaches, before the entire 366 km road from Quitunquina
to Puerto Suarez can be justified. As a first phase, it is
proposed to implement two sections of about 40 km each in
conjunction with a colonization scheme. The continuation of
these roads should then be moved ahead in accordan~e with the
success of the agricultural development. The initial roads
are recommended in the area west of Puerto Suarez (potential
for cattle raising) and in the area east of Robor~ which is
likely to have the best land for the cultivation of soya
and wheat.   They ,viII effectively be feeder roads to the exis-_
ting railroad which will remain the only complete transport
 facility on the Santa Cruz-Corumba axis. Much will depend on
the quality of rail services, and the later continuatlon of the
road in this corridor may not be pressing if rail access proves
to be adequate for the needs of agricultural development.

      Road No. 16, Azurduy-Bermejo - This would be a long (501
km) and costly road, and a long section would have to be built
from Azurduy before a useful amount of land is opened up to
CUltivation. The area is capable of producing crops that are
difficult to produce anywhere farther north (this side of the
Equator) and which therefore command good prices. The cost of
transport and the perishability of the products dictate that
they should be processed and sold in canned or bottled form,
thus increasing greatly the value added. Good markets are seen
for olive oil and avocado butter in Europe and for jams, juices,
canned fruit wine and brandy in the domestic market and in the
other Andean Group countries. The estimated annual benefits
per hectare appear potentially very high, much higher than the
minimum required to justify the road. Because output needs to
be shipped by rail from Villazon or Villamontes, it would be
necessary to construct the road to Palos Blancos, a distance
of 251 km (see Figure 12-8).

                                         PENETRATION ROAD
                                                                                                                                                     FIGURE 12-8
Constraints on Development
      The construction of a road removes one fatal constraint
on development. In the right place, it creates an opportunity
for people to come and work and sell their output at a profit.
The profit motive is a powerful force in Bolivia as elsewhere,as
has been amply deronstrated in Santa Cruz and the Beni. But there
are still obstacles. The majority of potential migrants are
to be found in the Altiplano and Valleys, where they are rooted
in a strong culture and, in some parts at least, live in a moder-
ate climate. Most of the penetration roads lie far away in
hot, flat country where the way of life could be very different.

     Nevertheless, since 1950 over a million peasants have
moved to the equally different environment of the city.
Evidently the break can be made, but it will be made much
more easily with government support in the form of publicity,
travel assistance,colonization and other schemes to help
provide housing, services and welfare facilities. And, other
things being equal, the roads lying closest to the Altiplano
and with the most agreeable climate will find it easier to
attract migrants.
     Sup~y of Migrants - It is calculated that in order to
achieve ~e potential development of all the proposed
penetration roads, omitting Nos. 5, 7, 11 and 12 as of no.
interest in the near future, about 261,000 migrants. would be
needed of which 120,000 would be in the Tucavaca valley where
the type of agriculture would be labor-intensive. Cattle areas
use far less labor, and only 26,000 migrants would be required
in the Beni.
     A study of migration between 1950 and 1976 showed that
1.3 million people left rural areas but the great majority
went to the cities, to some degree those of neighboring coun-
tries. Only 65,000 peasants moved to rural areas, principally
in western Santa Cruz, the Beni and North Yungas. It is
considered improbable that more than 200,000 migrants could
be attracted to areas of new rural development in the next
20 years. This places a major constraint on the prospects
of penetration roads, particularly in the Tucavaca v~lley.
     Supply of Capital - The amount of capital required is
relatively modest because the areas studied do not need irri-
gation or other costly works. Forest clearance is generally
needed but this could often be profitable in itself. Private
investment is needed in plantations, livestock, barns and
fences, but the envisaged methods of production do not require
a large amount of machinery. The Azurduy-Bermejo road requires
considerable investment in processing plant. The problem,
however, is not so much in the amount of capital needed as
in arranging a practicable mechanism for making it available
to the farmers and entrepreneurs that need it.

Evaluation of Potential Penetration Roads

     In concluding the study of penetration roads, the final
aim was to assess the probability of achieving the required
level of benefits on each candidate road or a part of it.
Since the roads are in competition with each other, it was
necessary to compare their prospects. There was no purpose
in including roads where there was no prospect of profitable
development (Nos.S and 11), and for other roads where develop-     ·1

ment is limited by the size of market it was assumed that only
a part of the road would be built. Road No.12 was excluded
in favor of the alternative No. 13.
     Th€ method of evaluation was a pOints system, and Appen-
dix 12A describes this in detail. Points were scored,
normally in the range from 1 to 10, in respect of the follow-
ing ten criteria:

     •   Level of benefits needed, in pesos per hectare, given
         the expected area of development;

     •   Estimated profitability, in pesos per hectare (weighted
         by crop); this was scored from 1 to 15;

     •   Price variability; volatility of market price increases
         the risk and discourages development; the historic
         variability of prices was calculated, and an index,
         weighted by crop, calculated for each road;

     •   Price prospects, a measure of the prospects for inter-
         national market prices, using World Bank forecasts;

     •   Market size, judged broadly in terms of the number of
         hectares that could be developed in order to satisfy
         the market;

     •   Labor intensiveness; in view of the shortage of labor,
         points were scored in favor of developments that needed
         relatively little labor;

     •   Capital intensiveness; points were also scored against
         developments that needed much capital;

     •   Climate, scored from 1 to 5;

     •   Isolation, a measure of distance from the five nearest
         cities;

     •   Distance from Altiplano and Valleys.

     Weighting of Criteria - Given the ten evaluation criteria
described above, it would be unreasonable to weight them all
equally. All of them contribute to the objective of assessing
the probability that each penetration road will achieve the
minimum required development to justify itself. But some are
more important than others and must be given greater weight.

                          -256-
The choice of weighting is largely a matter of judgement;
the following weights were chosen:


                     CRITERIA                      WEIGHT

      (1) Level of benefits needed                   2.0
      (2) Estimated level of profitability (1)       1.2
      (3) Price variability                          1.0
      (4) Price prospects                            1.5
      (5) Market size                                1.5
      (6) Labor intensiveness                        0.7
      (7) Capital intensiveness                      0.4
      (8) Climate (1)                                1.0
      (9) Isolation                                  0.4
     (10) Distance from Altiplano and Valleys        0.3
                                                    10.0

     (1)   Profitability was given a maximum score of 15,
           instead of the normal 10; therefore its true
           weighting is 1.8. Conversely climate, with a
           maximum score of 5, has a true weighting of 0.5.
     Network Links - A final factor taken into account was
the possible value of some of the roads as links in the
national network, serving through traffic. The 1989 model
projections showed that roads Nos. 8 and 9, joining Guayara-
mer!n to Trinidad, would attract flows of 40 to SO vehicles
a day, excluding international traffic. The other roads
attracted very little.
Conclusions on Penetration Roads

     In the light of the above analysis it is considered that,
in a program of new penetration roads, top priority should be
given to roads 8 and 9 in the Beni (Guayaramerin-Puerto Siles
and San Javier-San Ramon) and to sections of road 15, opening
up the Tucavaca valley in eastern Santa Cruz. Roads No. 3
(Ixiamas-Tumupasa) and No. 1 (Ixiamas-Chiv~) and parts of No.
4 (Riberalta-Humaita) also appear well worthwhile. At much
lower priority, short sections could be built from Santa Rosa
towards Riberalta (No.6) and from San Ramon to Magdalena
(No. 10).
     It is worth pointing out that, apart from the basic pro-
gram of new penetration roads, the departmental Development
Corporations, other local entities and private organizations
will (and should) continue the construction of new roads with
funds outside the basic transport investment budget. The
detailed decisions on developmental roads should be made at
the local level where the greatest knowledge exists on char-
acteristics and potentials of the zones to be opened up. The
penetration roads discussed in this chapter contribute not
only to agricultural development, but also to national inte-

     The estimation of feeder road requirements is based roughly on
estimates of the feasible area of development by 1999. The princi-
pal constraint is the number of migrants (assumed to be 200,000).
This greatly limits the feasible development of the Tucavaca valley
and, to a lesser extent, the Tarija area.

     The whole program includes 2,453 km of new road, of which 573
km are of gravel, the rest of earth. The cost of the whole program
is estimated at nearly $b 4,200 million but this could not be com-
pleted until the 1990s.

                                   -258-
      It has been commented by SNC that construction of the
Santa Rosa-Riberalta road has been taking place at amazingly
low cost -- $b 16 million pesos has so far been spent on 150
kms. No information has been received on the quality of the
work, but it is agreed that this project can be added to the
program specified above, on condition that construction can
be continued at the same low cost. A sum of $b 22 million
pesos (1977) should be added to the above program for this
project. (270 km), evenly divided between the periods 1981-1983
and 1984-1986.

     Flexibility - The impact of a penetration road is diffi-
cult to predict. Many judgments and assumptions have had to
be made, and time will probably show some of the conclusions
to be faulty. Whatever program is adopted, therefore, flexi-
bility should be preserved to enable the program to be changed
in response to the evolving situation.

      In particular there is the possibility of mineral develop-
ment in the Brazilian Shield or in Potos1 department. This
could create an urgent and unquestionable need for new pene-
tration roads such as No. 11 (Magdalena-San Ignacio, or part
thereof) or others near Uyuni in southwestern Bolivia.

     Supporting Action - None of the penetration roads is
likely to achieve its intended impact unless other supporting
action is taken. This Study cannot advise on colonization,
agricultural reform or marketing, but some action must be
taken to stimulate migration if there is to be rapid develop-
ment. None of the proposed roads will be sufficient in
itself to attract a rapid flow of migrants. The need for
housing, schools, electricity, water, etc. must be attended
to.  If farmers are not given the means to sell their output,
there cannot be any development.

      Most of the roads are intended to promote production for
export. Marketing organizations must be established to
purchase the produce from the farmers, to ship it and sell it
in foreign markets. The new export trades envisaged depend
vi tally on the river routes, through the Amazon and the P,late
Rivers, both of which are now so poorly provided, both
physically and commercially, that they are barely used.
Proposals for their improvements are discussed in Chapter
15.      They are vital for the success of the penetration
roads Nos. 4, 8 and 15.

     Similarly, road No.3 (Ixiamas-Tumupasa) depends largely
on the San Buenaventura development, and all the cattle roads
depend on a radical modernization and reorganization of the
meat trade and methods of cattle rearing.



                         -259-
     The recommendations for penetration roads assume that
these necessary supporting actions will be taken.  If not,
the roads may have little impact and the money spent on them
will be wasted.

La Paz - Trinidad Link

     The road between La Paz and Trinidad is 631 kID long and
passes through some of the most difficult terrain in the country.
Typical travel time in the dry season is 27 hours, excluding stops
and river crossings, giving an average travel speed of 23 km/
hour. The first 100 km out of La Paz pass through the extremely
steep valleys of the Yungas, where construction costs are
exceptionally high. After passing through a further 250 kID
of mountainous terrain, the road reaches the flat lowlands
and crosses large swamps and numerous rivers for about 280
km before it arrives at Trinidad. This part of the road
becomes impassable for 3 to 4 months a year during the wet
season.

     Projects - Some major improvements have been in progress
since 1977 and will undoubtedly start generating new traffic
and activity in the area before the new projects, now to be
considered, could come into effect. There are four new projects,
which are illustrated in Figure 12-9, as follows:

       (i)   Santa B&rbara-Bella Vista:  this project considers
             the reconstruction and paving of the section, \"lhich
             is currently of gravel surface and poor construction
             standard. The length would be reduced from 111.-5 km
             to 99 km.  1977 cost: $b 2,900 million.

      (ii)   San Borja-San Ignacio de Moxos:  this project should
             be considered in two parts. First, the existing
             earth road of 140 km would be graded and gravelled
             at a cost of $b 131 million. Secondly, it would
             have bridge and culvert improvements to eliminate
             flooding and thus turn it into an all-year road.
             The cost of this part is $b 108 million.

    (iii)    San Ignacio de Moxos-Trinidad:  this would involve
             the same staged construction as the previous project.
             The cost of this 88 km long section is estimated at
             $b 41 million fo~ the first stage and $b 71 million
             for the second.

     (iv)    Mamore River Crossing:  this project considers the
             possible improvements to the crossing of the Mamor€
             River, just west of Trinidad. Costs depend upon
             the nature of the improvement, for which several
             alternatives are available.

     Evaluation of Santa B~rbara-Bella Vista Highway - Traffic
volumes were derived from existing count data and from the estima-
tions of generated traffic made in an earlier Study by De Leuw
Cather, Canada Ltd. (DELCANDA) (1). Benefits in 1989 were cal-
culated as savings in vehicle operating costs, savings in the
cost of meat transport through use of refrigerated trucks rather
than air and benefits of increased agricultural production in
the Beni. The latter were also derived from the DELCANDA Study.
Taking into account a slight rise in road maintenance costs due
to increased traffic, 1989 benefits total $b 210.5 million com-
pared with a 1989 construction cost of $b 3,500 million. Hence
a first year rate of return of only 6.0 percent can be calculated.
The details of this evaluation are set out in Appendix 12B.
      Thus, the project as currently designed cannot be justified
by 1989. However, it is considered that the pr03ect is overde-
signed for the rather low traffic volumes expected to use it. The
current plan envisages a relatively high-standard road, consider-
ing the difficulty of the terrain, with a maximum gradient of 7
percent and a minimum radius of 75 meters. These design criteria
make it necessary that about 80 percent of the road would have to
follow an entirely new alignment. It is strongly recommended that
the design for this project be re-assessed making maximum u~e of
the existing alignment with the objective of reducing costs by 50
to 70 percent. On this basis, construction could be justified by
the late 1980s. $b 1,250 million is included in the investment
program for this project.

       It is noted in Appendix l2B that the costs of this project
may be overestimated due to too much weight being put on the costs
of the La Paz-Cotapa~a contract. Hence, the task of reducing the
costs of this project to the levels necessary for economic justi-
fication in the 1980s might not be quite so formidable as indicated
here.

      Evaluation of San Borja-Trinidad - This route, considered
in two separate sections on either side of San Ignacio de Moxos,
is currently being improved gradually. On forecast traffic
volumes, the first project for each section (gravelling and grad-
~ng) appears to be feasible, as indicated below.

      The first part of the project from San Borja to San Ig-         .,
nacio is not feasible on its own, but .it can be argued that it
contributes to the traffic between San Ignacio de Moxos and
Trinidad, and that the two projects merit joint treatment. In
addition, improvement of the road can be expected to generate
development benefits, but these are very hard to quantify.
      One must also consider the second part of the project, name-
ly the upgrading to all-year standard of the road between San Bor-
ja and Trinidad. This adds $b 179 million to the investment cost.
The benefit of this part of the p~oject is to make trips possible
which would otherwise not be possible during 3 to 4 months of the
year. If one assumes that the daily number of trips during the
wet season would then be the same as during the dry, the number
of trips thus generates in 1989 would be as follows.

      If the m~n~mum acceptable rate of return is 8 percent, the
annual benefits fr9m the investment of $b 179 million should be
not less than $b 14.3 million. This amounts to $b 457 per trip,
counting separately the trips on the two parts of the road. One
must consider whether the users of this road would be willing to
pay, on average, this amount of money, additional to DAeir operat-
ing costs, in order to make these trips. It seems unlikely.
      On the other hand, it migbt be argued that the closure of
this road for a large part of each year is seriously impeding the
growth of Trinidad and the development of the Beni, and that traf-
fic volumes would be considerably higher than here suggested if
all-year connection with La Paz was assured. There is probably
some validity in this argument, in which case the benefits of these
projects have been underestimated.
      It is therefore recommended that spot improvements to this
road are continued with a program of new culverts and bridges,
with the objective of gradually reducing the periods of wet· sea-
son interruption until they can be eliminated entirely. Addi-
tional thought should also be given -- and experiments made --
concerning the use of a light seal road surface in this region
where the aggregates needed for a gravel surface are relatively
expensive.   $b 297 million is included in the investment program
for this project.

     Mamor~ River Crossing - The Mamor~ River must be crossed
to reach Trinidad both from La Paz and also on the proposed
new road from Cochabarnba. The river varies greatly from
season to season in width and also undergoes frequent changes
of course. Three alternatives were examined for crossing this
river:
     •   Construction of a bridge
     •   Use of a ferry boat
     •   Use of motorized pontoons.
     Because of the great variation in width and position of
the river, the Development Corporation of the Beni -department
has estimated that a 6 km long bridge would be required.
This bridge would cost approximately $b 1,200 million to build,
thus for an eight percent first year rate of return, a benefit
of $b 96 million is needed. At an estimated 132 vehicles a
day in 1989, the saving per vehicle would have to be $b 1,990
which is far more than the global costs of providing the
river crossing by other methods, examined below.
     An alternative to the bridge is a 320-ton ferry boat
costing $b 12 million. The 1989 annual operating costs
are estimated' at $b 3.4 million to which must be added the
costs of vehicle delay of $b 7.8 million. An additional
expenditure in this case would be the construction of suitable
berthing facilities on each side of the river.
     To remove the need for these facilities, the use of
motorized pontoons was considered. Two of these pontoons
would be required, each capable of carrying six large trucks
and costing $b 1.5 million each. The cost of vehicle delays
would be unaltered, but the annual running costs would be
reduced to $b 2.8 million. The average cost per vehicle
crossing would be about $b 240.
     The system used at present is that trucks unload freight
into a barge which is then reloaded into other trucks on
the far side of the river. The estimated annual oost of these loading
operations, and consequent vehicle delays, is $b 14.4 million
and that of operating the barges is $b 2.2 million giving "a
total of $b 16.6 million.
     Therefore, it is concluded that the best course of action
is to purchase two motorized pontoons for $b 3 million, giving
a benefit of $b 6   million in 1989 over the current system.
In fact the pontoons become economically viable at a volume
of about 20 vehicles a day and so should be instituted in the
near future.

Cochabamba - Trinidad Road                                         d



     A major deficiency in the road network is the lack of a       Q

connection between Cochabamba and Trinidad. The area lying
between these two departmental capitals is one of the most
uninhabited and unknown in the country; in fact the boundary
between the two departments remains undefined. At present
there is a road from Cochabamba to Eteramazama, a distance
of 180 km, from which point it is proposed to construct a
link to San Ignacio de Moxos on the Trinidad-San Borja road.
The distance would be 272 km.
     The proposal consists of two separate projects: Etera-
mazama-R!o Secur~, 132 km, and San Ignacio-R!o Secur~, 140 km.
The combined cost is estimated at $b 1,116 million, including
the cost of bridges of about $b 440 million, if completed
in 1989. The road would be gravel surfaced and 8 meters wide.
The location of the route is shown in Figure 12-9 (see earlier).

     Traffic Predictions - Freight traffic currently moving
between Cochabamba ana Trinidad takes the road to Puerto
Villarroel-and continues by boat down the Ichilo-Mamor~ .. It
is expected that much of       this traffic would transfer
to the new road, which would be much faster though not very
different in cost.
     The average transport costs used in the analysis for the
two routes are shown in Appendix l2C for the main origin-
destination movements contributing traffic to the new road.
About one half of them show a cost saving of up to 22 percent
from the new route, but for the others the old route is
cheaper.
     Utilizing the same diversion curves as were produced for
road-rail competition, the model produced traffic predictions
for the new route and for the old road-plus-river route. The
predicted volume of goods traffic on the new road was 188,000
tons per year in 1989, in 28,750 trucks of different sizes.
     Evaluation - The evaluation of a project which introduces
a new mode in competition with an existing mode is complex.
The method of evaluation is explained in Appendix 3H.    The
benefits to traffic transferring to the new road were estimated




                         -264-
at $b 46.7 million for agricultural products and $b 92.6
million for non-agricultural products. Goods traffic generated
by the new road was valued at $b 2.5 million for agricultural
products and $b 5.3 million for non-agricultural products.
     The additional maintenance costs of the new road were esti-
mated at $b 6.7 million per year in 1989. Hence the benefits from
goods traffic alone gave a single-rate of return of 12.6
percent on the investment of $b 1,116 million. Assuming a
project life of 20 years and a construction period of 4 years,
the project net present value would be $b 200 million at 12 per-
cent discount rate.
     Thus this road seems to be a~ excellent prospect for an
all-weather connection to Trinidad, and also opening up the
relatively unknown area between the two cities. The rate of
return obtained indicates that this road would become viable
towards the end of the decade with the construction start date
probably depending on budget limitations.
The Central Beni Corridor
     The Central Beni Corridor is the name given to the set
of transport links between Santa Cruz, Trinidad and Guayara-
mer!n. The dominant transport modes in the corridor at
present are the Mamor~ River for freight and air for passengers,
but other modes are beginning to appear. The road from Santa
Cruz to Trinidad is a committed project expected to be
completed by 1982. The road north of Trinidad to San Ram6n,
with a branch to Santa Ana, is also under construction, though
not with high priority. Earlier in this chapter, the road
to Guayaramer!n from Puerto Siles, which is already linked
to San Ram6n, was recommended as a priority development road.
Thus a basic road could be completed within the next decade
linking Santa Cruz, Trinidad, Santa Ana and Guayaramer!n.
     A railroad is also being built from Santa Cruz to the R!o
Grande, the extension of which to Trinidad is a project for
evaluation in this Study. Finally, a petroleum product
pipeline has been proposed to supply Trinidad from Santa Cruz.
     Although the river is facing increasing competition, there
are several projects to improve its facilities, which are now
very primitive. There are projects to improve port facilities
at Puerto Villarroel, Trinidad and Guayaramer!n and to construct
port facilities at the rail terminus on the R!o Grande. A canal
is proposed to give Trinidad year-round access by boat from the
River Mamor~ and there is an important river-cleaning project to
clear the Mamor~ of obstructions between Puerto Villarroel and
Guayaramer!n.




                            -265-
     Each project is discussed below and a summary of the eval-
uations is given in Table 12-3. Project locations are shown in
Figure 12-9 (see earlier).

     Product Pipeline from Santa Cruz to Trinidad - The
proposed pipeline is 440 km long and estimated to cost $b
516 million in 1~89. Projected volumes are about 40,000 tons
per year by 1989 rising to nearly 100,000 tons by 1999, of
which about half are for Trinidad with the rest destined for
the Ribera1ta-Guayaramer!n region. The alternative route for
these products is by rail as far as R!o Grande and then by
river and road. Estimated benefits were only one percent
of investment cost in 1989, so the project cannot be recommended
for the next decade, nor , at projected growth rates, for the
decade after. This conclusion would be reinforced were the
rail line to be completed to Trinidad.
     Rio Grande to Trinidad Rail Line - This is a 149 km project
costing just over 1,000 million pesos to provide the final
link of the rail line from Santa Cruz to Trinidad. A throughput
of 110,000 tons was forecast for this line for 1989,rising to
nearly 300,000 tons by 1999. The alternatives to therai1 line
are the Santa Cruz-Trinidad road, and the Mamor~ River via the
committed paved road to Chimor~.
     Benefits forecast for 1989 are very low and do not offset
fixed costs of operations and maintenance. By 1999 though,
benefits could be greater than fixed costs and a first year
rate of return for that year was calculated of 2.6 percent.
Details of the evaluation are given in Appendix 12E.
     In conventional terms, this evaluation demonstrates that
the project is not viable within the next twenty years, and
this is not surprising for a project which is comparatively
expensive to construct but which generates such small flows.
     However, conventional terms of economic justification may
not be entirely applicable, because there is the strong
probability of financing from Argentina for this project on
very favorable terms. If loan agreements established for earlier
phases of the project are followed, a possible loan would
involve interest charges of 3 percent per year and an amorti-
zation rate of 5 percent per year, both payments starting
after the project is completed.                          .

     It can be demonstrated, for example, that at a constant
rate of inflation of 5 percent per year, and with an opportunity
rate on capital of 12 percent, the rate of return required to

justify a project with such loan conditions is reduced, from
the point of view of Bolivia, to 5.0 percent. If dollar
inflation is assumed to be 15 percent per year, the rate of
return required reduces to only 2.9 percent.
     Such arguments, though, are a little academic. A loan
for this project will presumably not be negotiated until the
current extension of the rail line to the R!o Grande is
completed, perhaps in 1985. Inflation rates are notoriously
difficult to predict and it is impossible now to say what
they might be in five years time, let alone how they might
vary over the following twenty years. In any event, it is
impossible to realistically predict inflation rates which
would make this project viable on the basis of benefits
calculated by this Study.
     There remains the possibility that benefits have been
underestimated. In particular, development benefits have been
ignored, but this has been for good reasons. The line under
construction to the R!o Grande passes through largely
unexplored territory which may well have potential for
development which the rail line now under construction may
tap. In contrast, much of the section north of R!o Grande,
through which the new project will pass, is already accessible
by road from Trinidad and it is difficult to see how much
more the railroad can contribute to the exploitation of this
region. The development potential of the railroad should first
be proved south of the Rlo Grande,before attributing such
benefits to the section between the Rlo Grande and Trinidad.

      The volumes predicted on the project are not negligible
in Bolivian railroad terms, and yet measured benefits indicate
that the project will not be viable -for at least the next ten
years and probably not for the next twenty. Despite the
possibility of a cheap loan from Argentina, this project is
not recommended for the foreseeable future. In any event, it
is firmly recommended that construction beyond the R!o Grande
does not proceed without a detailed feasibility study.
     It is acknowledged that Argentina has been very consis-
tent in their financing of Bolivian railroad development. It
was they who made possible the construction of the Yacuiba -
to Santa Cruz line, and the line to Trinidad can be seen as
an extension to that project. The reason stated for Argentin-
ian interest in this line is a desire to connect Argentina
with the Amazon basin river system. If this is the reason for
Argentina's persistence in advancing this project, the object-
ive will have been achieved when the section currently under
construction reaches the Rio Grande. Therefore, it is suggested




                         -268-
that the Bolivian government negotiate with Argentina to trans-
fer the funds for the Trinidad railroad to projects more bene-··
ficial to Bolivia. For example, the rehabilitation of the
Santa Cruz-Yacuiba rail line (although not proved to be fully eco-
nomically viable in the 1980s - - see Chapter 13) might be a bet-
ter project for Argentinian financing and would take up half of
the funds otherwise required for the new railroad.

     The Ichilo-Mamor~ River Pro'ects - Increasing competition
by road and rai in t e Centra Beni Corridor means that river
volumes are unlikely to increase significantly as the Beni
develops, and in some parts will actually decline.
     The decline is most likely to be felt in the upper reaches
of the river between Puerto Villarroel and Trinidad. The rail
line now under construction from Yapacan! to R!o Grande is
expected to draw off much of the traffic between Puerto Villa-
rroel and R!o Grande, and the road being built from Santa Cruz
to Trinidad will also have its effect, so that river volumes
could fall to about half today's levels. If the rail line
is completed to Trinidad, the effect of halving current river
volumes will be felt throughout this section (this rail project
is not recommended by the Study).

     North of Trinidad, competition from the proposed Trinidad-
Guayaramer!n road link would keep volumes at today's levels but
this could change dramatically if meat exports via Guayaramer!n
become a reality. It could be expected that live cattle would
be sent down-stream by boat from the areas near the river and
this could double volumes on this section of the river by 1999.
     In the light of these figures, the various river projects
are reviewed below.
     River Ports - Projects to improve existing river ports
were considered for Puerto Villarroel, Trinidad and Guaya-
ramer!n, and a new port was considered at the terminus of the
rail line under construction to R!o Grande.
     A design was studied capable of handling 100,000 tons
per year. It included a river quay 100 meters long, a paved
area and a transit shed. Mechanical handling equipment was
envisaged including fork lift trucks and mobile cranes. One
of the functions of the transit shed would be to disengage
the loading and unloading activities of trucks and boats with
the object of reducing waiting time for both. The cost of
such a port would be nearly 50 million pesos.




                         -269-
                                                                   '1




     Unfortunately, the estimated benefits of time savings for
boats and trucks do not offset the additional costs of running
such a port. While labor is abundant and cheap, it does not pay
to install such a comparatively sophisticated facility. Also,      "
with increasing competition from other modes, the type of cargo
likely to remain on the river will make less demands on a
breakbulk port. Live cattle, aggregates and petroleum products
are all easily transferred between boat and river bank, although
movement of the latter two products is greatly aided by quite
simple mechanical aids. It is concluded that th~ remaining
breakbulk cargoes· are best handled by manual labor, as at
present.
     Other doubts must be raised by the instability of the
river bank, especially at Trinidad and further south. Past
experience has shown that a fixed port would be in danger
of damage, or even total loss, due to floods and river bank
subsidence.
     Some minor investments could be justified: for example,
a bulldozer to help reshape the access paths to the river
bank from time to time, a small mobile crane to handle
particularly awkward loads and some mobile conveyor belts
for loading and unloading gravel. Such equipment could cost
between half a million and one million pesos per port. A sum
of $b 6 million is included in the investment program for the
four po.rts listed at the beginning of this Section.

     Canal to Trinidad - Trinidad can be reached by boat
when the river is high but for half the year boats have to
discharge and receive cargo on the River Mamor~ at Puerto
Varador, some 14 km from Trinidad. A canal has therefore
been proposed to give all-year access.
     Such a canal would be expensive. In the dry season, the
level of the Mamor~ drops to 7 meters below high water level
and it is estimated that excavation for a canal would have
to be at least 7 meters deep and would cost about $b 300
million.
     It is estimated that benefits in 1989, measured as the
savings over alternative road transport costs, including
transfers, and the difference in maintenance costs between the
canal and the road, would amount to much less than one percent
of the estimated project costs, and so the project is not
recommended.




                         -270-
      River Cleaning - With help from the Belgian Government,
some preliminary work has been done on this project. The
objective is to remove embedded tree ~runks and semi-dams
 (essentially sand bars formed around a collection of
embedded trees) in order to reduce delays and hazards to
navigation.   It has been estimated that with a suitably
equipped boat, it would take three years to clean the 492 km
from Puerto Villarroel to Trinidad and another two years to
clean the 845 km from Trinidad to Guayaramer!n (which has less
obstructions).

     Cost estimates for an equipped boat are vague. A figure
often quoted is $b 30 million for a roetal hulled boat from
Belgium, including equipment. Other sources maintain
that a wooden boat built on the Mamore using local materials,
labor and techniqu~s would be adequate to take all the
necessary equipment, which would still have to be imported.
Cost estimates for the locally built boat are not available,
butare expected to be much less than for the imported
alternative.

     Benefits would be derived from two sources. One is the.
saving in boat and crew time due to faster navigation.   It is
estimated that nearly 2,000 boat-days could be saved per year
between Puerto Villarroel and Trinidad, with a further 2,500
boat-days saved in the section from Trinidad to Guayaramer!n,
at today's volumes. A second source of benefit is the saving
in boat losses, which are currently estiroated at about $b
500,000 per year.

     Appendix 12D sets out the details of the evaluation of
this project.  If the cost of boat with equipment is $b 30
million, the project, if started in 1981, would have an inter-
nal rate of return of 10.3 percent. If the cost could be
reduced by one third, as seems likely with a locally built
hull, the internal rate of return would increase to nearly 14
percent. The benefits are much higher in the section north
of Trinidad and it is recommended that this section of the
river be cleared first. A sum of $b 20 million pesos is allowed
in the investment program for equipment.

RAIL TRANSPORT
CHAPTER 13

RAIL· TRANSPORT
     The historical role of the railroads has been to link
Bolivia with its neighboring countries, and in particular with
the'ports of the Pacific and the Atlantic. The rail system
has been in development for the past hundred years and the
process still continues, with the line from Santa Cruz to the
Rto Grande, south of Trinidad, currently under construction.
The most obvious gap is the lack of a connection between the
eastern and western systems within Bolivia. Proposals for
such a connection are among the projects examined in this chap-
ter.
     Fortunately, the entire rail system has been constructed
to a consistent one-meter gauge, and all the connections with
neighboring countries, except that with Peru via Lake Titicaca,
also use this gauge. However, construction standards are low,
alignments are poor, bridges and drainage structures are in-
adequate in places and the track has been laid without ballast.
Therefore, in addition to projects to extend the rail system,
there are also schemes to rehabilitate existing lines, continu-
ing work already started with World Bank assistance.
     This chapter reviews the Study's forecasts of rail freight
traffic and presents the evaluation of the rail projects, includ-
ing railroad rehabilitation. The future of the railroads as
a passenger carrier and the need for new equipment in the next
ten years are also examined. Finally, railroad operations and
the organization and management of the National Railroad Company
(Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles - ENFE) are discussed.

Projections of Rail Freight Demand
     Rail is associated primarily with transport between Bolivia
and abroad and accounts for a large share of this traffic. In
1977, rail carried 81 percent of all imports and 58 percent of
all exports 1 in total 970,000 (1) tons of freight. In contrast,
the rail share of domestic traffic is low. Only 258,000 tons of
freight were carried in 1977 which represents less than 2 percent
of all internal freight movements, although accounting for about
6 percent of all ton-kilometers. The share of ton-kilometers
reflects the increased competitiveness of rail over longer haul

(1) Based on ENFE statistics and referring to the volume of these
   movements moving within Bolivia. In fact,some of these move-
   ments moved externally by other modes,e.g. about 42,000 tons
   of imports which arrived by Lake Titicaca and ~ transf~
   to rail.
                           -273-
distances. Domestic freight currently accounts for only twenty
percent of all rail freight movements.
     Table 13-1 presents past traffic and the Study's rail
freight forecasts for 1989 and 1999. Trends and forecasts in          'I

ton-kilometers are presented graphically in Figure 13-1 and the
allocation of flows by line are shown in Figure 13-2, contrast-
ing current and forecast movements.       .
     Foreign trade movements are expected to increase steadily
following past trends in the growth of this traffic. The rail in-
terconnection (2) is not expected to change the tonnage of for-
eign trade (although international transit traffic will be strongly
affected) but it is expected to change the routes chosen, mainly
due to increased use of the Pacific' ports by products originating
or destinating in the east of the country. Although the overall
effect would be to decrease distances to and from ocean ports,
haul lengths within Bolivia would increase, leading to the fore-
cast increase in ton-kilometers shown in the table.
      It is domestic traffic which, under certain assumptions,
is forecast to increase substantially, following a recent down-
ward trend. With low tariffs, and with a rail interconnection,
domestic traffic (measured in ton-kilometers) is forecast to
increase nearly forty times between 1979 and 1999. Although this
predicted rate of increase appears unrealistically high, the
total domestic tonnage forecast by 1999 is not so very great.
A total of 3,340 million ton-kilometers on a system of over
4,000 kID (including the interconnection) gives an average density
of less than one million tons per year, and this should not
be regarded as unattainable. Current domestic volumes are very
small, and this is why the forecasts appear so large. Neverthe-        ..
less, the factors behind the forecast increase are worth discus-
sing.
     There are principally three assumptions which influenced
the forecast growth in domestic traffic. The first is the
forecast traffic of products from Mut6n to Santa Cruz, which
could reach 567,000 tons by 1989, generating 364 million ton-
kilometers. Without this traffic, it is estimated that domestic
rail freight would decline to only about half of current volumes,
under eXisting tariffs. The second assumption is the construc-
tion of the rail interconnection from Cochabamba to Santa Cruz,
which would not only open up a new corridor for rail goods trans-
port but would also, because of its situation on the'main trans-
port axis of the country, permit an increase in the average
length of rail haul and therefore in ton-kilometers carried.
The third assumption is the low tariff policy (discussed in
detail in Chapter 17).

     How realistic are these forecasts? The increase in traf-
fic due to the development of Mutan can be regarded as realistic,
and, similarly, the forecasts accurately reflect the increased
competitiveness of rail which would be brought about by the         "
rail interconnection. However, the forecast effects of lower
tariffs are less certain.
      The mechanism used in the transport model to allocate
traffic betwen modes is described in detail in Appendix 3F.
The allocation procedure is based on the relative transport
costs by each mode but it also takes into account user prefe-
rences. In general, given similar costs between modes, users
have tended to prefer road transport, although the degree of
preference depends on the commodity to be transported. No
criticism of rail operations is implied or intended by these
remarks. User preferences simply reflect the fact that rail
transport, in general, is more complex, slower and less conve-      '\
nient than road transport for certain types of shipment, and
that users are sometimes prepared to pay the higher costs of
road in order to avoid these disadvantages. It is a worldwide
phenomenon and not confined to Bolivia.
      The effect of the low rail tariffs would be to drastically
change the relationship between road and rail costs so that
many more users would switch to rail. The important question
is, have user preferences been measured accurately enough so
that confidence can be placed in model forecasts assuming a
radical change in relative costs between modes? It is evident
that a large increase in rail traffic would take place, if the
railroads are ready to meet the demand, but it has to be
accepted that the magnitude of the increase is very difficult       .,
to predict accurately. The increase could be low if users
stubbornly stick to road transport. On the other hand, the
increase could be higher if, as ENFE claims, demand for rail
was supressed in 1977 due to lack of equipment, resulting in
the study over-estimating the preference for road transport.
     Despite the uncertainty, it is the recommendation of the
study that a lower tariff policy be implemented for some
classes of traffic, and the rationale for this recommendation
is discussed in Chapter 17. The recommended tariff level is
not quite as low as the lowest policy tested. Hence the 1989
traffic is not quite so high, showing a five and a half times
increase in domestic traffic from 1979, compared with the
seven times increase forecast with the lowest tariff policy.
The effects of the new policy could be far reaching, leading
to rail becoming a more influential transport mode for internal
as well as for external transport. The implementation of
such a policy would have to be very carefully planned and
monitored.

The Rail rnterconnection between the Andean and Eastern Systems
     The two rail systems of Bolivia are quite separate with
the only possible connection at present involving a detour
through Argentina. The Andean System is located on the 4,000
meter high Altiplano with two branch lines extending into the
Eastern Cordillera to Cochabamba and to Potos! and Sucre. The
Eastern System is located entirely in .the lowlands connecting
the city of Santa Cruz with Brazil and Argentina,and also with
northern Santa Cruz department.
     An interconnection between the two systems within Bolivia
has long been sought by successive governments, and five pos-
sible routes have been examined by' this Study, based on past
proposals. Some construction work has already been under-
taken including a 216 km line east of Cochabamba to Aiquile,
a 78 km line east of Sucre to Tarabuco with basic engineering
structures completed for a further 61 km to Zudanez,and a 40
km line from Boyuibe to Cuevo. However, no work has been done
on any of these lines in the past 25 years, and only cochabamba-
Aiquile is still in use. The proposed lines, and work already
completed, are shown in Figure 13-3.
     The main obstacle to completing an interconnection is the
difficult terrain separating the two systems, resulting in high
construction costs. The estimated costs of the five possible
alternatives are as follows:

                     LINE                     ~ ESTIMA'lED MINIMUM COST .
-----------------~~------------ ~                  (iiiilliOns of 1977 pesos}
Aiquile-Santa Cruz (via Mataral)               391             9,478
Tarabuco-Santa Cruz (via Zudafiez and Mataral) 472             9,040
Tarabuco-Boyuibe (via zudaii.ez and cueva}     363             7,608

(l) Approximate estimate -- less reliable than others quoted.
     Since the entire transport budget for all modes of trans-
port for the next ten years is not likely to be more than 34,000
million pesos (see Chapter 8), the building of a rail inter-
connection would absorb a large part of available funding.

     Previous Studies and Routes Chosen'f'or An'alysis - The link
from Sucre to Boyuihe was studied in the 1940s with the pos-
sibility that Argentina might finance the construction. On the
basis of this work, the short links from Boyuibeto Cuevo, and
from Sucre to Tarabuco and (in part) toZudanezwere constructed,
but no work has been done since 1955.

     Of more relevance today is a detailed engineering study
completed in 1977 by the Brazilian firm Sondotecnicawith
Brazilian financing. Several alternative alignments were exa-
mined for a single track of one-meter gauge from Cochabamba to
santa Cruz. The alignment recommended by the Brazilian study
links Aiquile with Santa Cruz via Mataral and includes a branch
line from Mataral to Vallegrande. Costs developed by the
Brazilian study have provided the basis for cost estimates not
only on this alignment, but also on other routes through similar
terrains. Although the Brazilian study recommended that the
project go ahead, it calculated an internal rate of return of
only 6.5 percent for an investment estimated then at 10,400
million pesos.
     A study is planned for the link between Sucre and Mataral
(assuming the Sondotecnica alignment from Mataral to Santa Cruz).
No study has yet been undertaken or is planned of the link from
Balcarce to El Palmar or of the northern alignment via Villa
Tunari. The latter route would branch off the recently built
rail line at Yapacan1, pass through generally flat terrain
until Villa Tunari and then climb steeply to Cochabamba. Despite
the high construction and operating costs in this last section,
this alignment deserves fuller study.
     It seems probable that the most likely alignment of a rail      t

interconnection would be on, or near, the alignment chosen by
Sondotecnica, basically because this is on the main transport
axis of the country and would provide the most direct link
between the three largest cities, La Paz, Cochabamba, and
santa Cruz. Hence this alignment was chosen as the principal
link for testing with the transport model. Also included in
the model test was the link from Sucre to Mataral. The two
other possible interconnections (excluding the northern align-
ment via Villa Tunari) were evaluated, but it was concluded
that they are not feasible. This is discussed later in this
chapter.
     Cost Assumptions - Sondotecnica produced detailed construct-
ion cost estimates at 1976 prices. These figures were adjusted
to 1977 values, and were also used to estimate the cost of the
Sucre-Mataral line. ENFE have reviewed these construction cost
estimates and conclude that they could be reduced substantially.
Thus, alternative cost estimates are available which are
presented below.

     Fixed operating costs (excluding maintenance) were estimated
for 1977 at 116,500 pesos per km for the Andean System and
107,500 pesos per km for the Eastern System. For the inter-
connections, averages of 113,000 pesos per km (1977) and
135,500 pesos per km (1989) are assumed.
      Railroad maintenance costs are presented in Appendix 13A.
Assuming a properly ballasted track in good condition, the
follow1ng maintenance costs can be assumed:
                           22,000 + 0.021 T (1977) pesos per km
                           23,500 + 0.023 T (1989) pesos per km
where T       =   tons per year.

     Forecast Traffic - Almost all the benefits associated with
the interconnection are expected to accrue to freight traffic.
Forecasts were made of normal internal traffic (traffic divert-
ing from other modes}, generated internal traffic (traffic
brought aBout by the stimulus of the interconnection), foreign
trade traffic to and from Bolivia and international transit'
traffic. These estimates are presented below, assuming that
the two interconnections are built:                  .

International Transit Traffic-
  High Estimate                    392,000            925,000

     It is noted that some international transit traffic
currently exists in the Cochabamba-Santa Cruz corridor, making
use of road transport between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, and
rail for the rest of the journey. In 1979, 6,901 tons moved
between Peru and Brazil, and 6,341 tons between Chile and Brazil,
using this service. The products were mainly metals (see
Chapter 9).
     If the link from Sucre to Mataral is not built, the inter-
national traffic would be unaffected. For 1989 and 1999
respectively, the normal internal traffic would drop to 873,000
and 2,300,000 tons, and the generated traffic to 429,000 and
1,192,000 tons.            .
     Calculation of Benefits - Benefits to internal traffic
were estimated using the evaluation procedure described in
Appendix 3H. Total benefits to this traffic were calculated
to be as follows (in millions of 1977 pesos):

    YEAR    COCHABAMBA-SANTA CRUZ ONLY          BOTH INTERCONNECTIONS
    1989                 374                            442

                          -280-
     The cost saving to external traffic by using the rail in-
terconnection instead of road is 494 pesos per ton. It was
assumed that mostot the traffic woUld gain the full benefit
of this cost saving but that, on average, the forecast traffic
would gain only three quarters of this benefit. Thus benefits
to external traffic were estimated as 130 million pesos for
1989 and 213 million pesos for 1999.
     Benefits to transit traffic accruing to Bolivia were
calculated as the revenues from tariffs that could be charged
from one border to the other, less the marginal costs of
transporting the goods.
     Marginal costs were estimated as follows:
     Marginal operating cost = 0.21 pesos per t-km (see Chapter
                                          5, Figure 5-2)
     Marginal maintenance cost = 0.0135 pesos per t-km (see
                                          Appendix 13A)
     Average distance Peru/Chile to Brazil = 1,800 km
     Hence marginal cost = 400 pesos per ton.
     Guidance on likely revenue was taken from the tariffs
currently charged on this route, which now requires transfer
to truck for the section between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz:
this is about 2,000 pesos per ton. It was assumed that this
figure, in 1980 pesos, might represent a possible tariff for
this traffic for 1989, but measured in 1977 pesos. Two
alternative assumptions were then made:
     (i)   That the tariff would have to be substantially reduced
           to obtain the increased transit flow through Bolivia.
    (ii)   That the tariff could be increased with the inter-
           connection, since the service level could be so much
           improved.
     On this basis a low and a high tariff were chosen at 1,200
pesos and 2,400 pesos per ton, giving benefits of 800 and 2,000
pesos per ton, respectively. Hence total benefit to transit
traffic can be estimated as follows:
                                1989          1999
                              (millions of 1977 pesos)

                                                                              .f

     These represent considerable ranges of possible benefits
in each year and it is clear that transit traffic benefits are
the crucial element in a possible justification of the inter-
connection.
     Savings in variable maintenance costs on the roads were
also considered but they were very small. The additional
fixed costs of rail maintenance (as specified above) were
significant, however.
     Evaluat'ionof the Interconnection - It is clear that two
interconnections, linking Santa Cruz to both Cochabamba and
Sucre, could not be justified. Of the two, the Cochabamba-
Santa Cruz connection has clear advantages, being likely to
carryover three times as much traffic. Additional benefits
with having both interconnections would amount to only about
70 million pesos in 1989, while the additional cost would be
at least 4,000 million pesos for construction alone. Allowing
a five-year construction period, this would give a first year
rate of return (FYRR) in 1989 of under two percent. Hence it
is concluded that the Sucre-Mataral line cannot be justified
in the foreseeable future. The remainder of the evaluation
concentrated on the Cochabamba line.
     Evaluation of theCochabamba-Aiquile-Santa Cruz Inter-
connection - For both costs and benefits, a range of values
was estimated, reflecting the uncertainties involved in such
a project. These values are summarized belqw:

     In calculating the first year rate of return (FYRR) assump-
tions are required about the length of time for construction
and the discount rate to be used. Values of 5 years and'8
percent and of 10 years and 12 percent were assumed for an
optimistic and a pessimistic case respectively. FYRRs for the
optimistic and the pessimistic case respectively, are 8.6 per-
cent and 2.6 percent for 1989, and 20.8 percent and 5.7 per-
cent for 1999. The most optimistic case makes the following
assumptions:



                              -282-
     (i)   Construction costs will be as low as ENFE estimated.
    (ii)   The construction period will be five years.
   (iii)   A discount rate of 8 percent is applicable.
    (iv)   International transit volumes will reach nearly 400,000
             tons per year by 1989 and over 900,000 tons per year
             by 1999.
     (v)   A tariff of 2,400 pesos per ton can be charged for
             international transit traffic with a rail intercon-
             nection.
    (vi)   Lower domestic tariffs will lead to a large increase
             in rail freight traffic.
     If all these optimistic assumptions could be fulfilled,
the rail interconnection from Cochabamba to Santa Cruz would
be justified for construction to start in 1984 and operations
in 1989. However, in view of the competition for the scarce
investment resources by other transport projects, it must be
concluded that an 8 percent rate of return is too low for
project viability and that 12 percent must be taken as the
m1n1mum. In this case, the earliest date when construction
could be justified is 1988 (the earliest year when it could
achieve a First Year Rate of Return greater than 12 percent),
with operations starting in 1993. On this assumption the
project would have an IRR of 16 percent.
     The pessimistic case presents quite a different picture.
The rates of return are very low and would not justify the
project, even by 1999.
     Conclusions on the Rail Interconnection - The economic
evaluation of this very important project demonstrates that
under the most optimistic assumptions of construction time,
construction cost, traffic and revenues, the interconnection
could be justified for the early 1990s with construction start-
ing in 1988. It would be unlikely, though, for all these
assumptions to combine so favorably, and it is therefore con-
cluded that construction of the interconnection probably will
not be feasible until the ~990's.
     Two factors could ohange this conclusion. The first is
if a detailed study of the northern alignment from Cochabamba
to Yapacant showed substantially lower' constrUction costs than
for the alignment currently considered via Aiquile and Mata-
ral. Although the estimated construction cost of this alterna-
tive (shown earlier) is very similar to the estimates for
other alignments, it was based on approximate data and could
be very much lower. A one to two month investigation by
railroad engineers should be sufficient to judge whether this
alternative is worth pursuing further. Secondly, the viability




                           -283-
                                                                    'I




of the interconnection depends heavily on the benefits accruing
to Bolivia from international transit traffic.. Further study
may reveal that even the optimistic assumptions made by the
Study are low, or that revenues per ton could be higher .. It
is therefore recommended that these two factors are studied
in greater depth to see whether construction could, in fact
be justified to commence in the 1980s ..                            -,
     It is accepted that other aspects may influence the deci-
sion of government, such as the need for regional integration,
or extreme interest in the project by neighboring countries.
It must be recognized, though, that a very large expenditure
is being contemplated which could amount to at least one third
of all expenditure on transport in the next ten years and
account for between five and ten percent of all public invest-
ment in that period. Building the rail interconnection would
surely divert money from other transport projects and would
probably divert spending from other sectors of the economy.
     A decision to implement this project cannot be taken           "
lightly. Hitherto, no economic justification of the project
has been made, although many people have advocated it.. It is
now established that a potential does exist, although some
doubts remain. It is recommended that the additional studies        '!

are made of the northern alignment and of the potential for
international transit traffic, either one of which could
result in a change in priorities, before any further commit-        'I
ments are made on this project. The propos~d National Transport
Center (see Chapter 19) could assist in these studies.
     It is also recommended that the recently introduced bi-
modal system for handling international transit traffic, using
road transport between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz and rail for
the rest of the journey, should be encouraged. This is basical-
ly an organizational and marketing problem for ENFE ..
Evaluation of Other Rail Projects

for new rail lines were proposed for evaluation. Projects           II

     This section deals with the remaining projects, which are:
     112   -   Improvements   to   the Oruro-Cochabamba line
     105   -   Construction   of   Zudafiez-Cuevo
     108   -   Construction   of   Balcarce-Tarija
     109   -   Construction   of   Tarija- El Palmar
     110   -   Construction   of   La Paz-Rurrenabaque.
     With the exception of the improvements proposed on the
Oruro-Cochabamba line, all these rail projects are extremely
expensive and would attract little traffic. Making the most
generous assumption about the volume of traffic which would
transfer to rail and which would be generated by the new line,
assessments were made of the likely benefits, and these are
summarized in Table 13-2. In two cases, benefits barely meet
or fall short of fixed costs of operations, let alone covering
any part of amortizing capital expenditures. In only one case
does the FYRR exceed one percent. It is therefore recommended
that none of these projects be considered for construction.
     The proposed improvements on the Oruro-Cochabamba line
are discussed below:
     Oruro-Cochabamba Line - This is a 204 kID branch line
leaving the main Viacha-Oruro line just north of Oruro at San
Pedro. It passes through difficult terrain, and some sections
are unstable and subject to earth slides. Interruptions are
common in the wet season with an average 58-day suspension of
services each year between 1975 and 1979.
     In 1979-80, the Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) made a study of ,this line and evaluated three projects
to alleviate the problems in the affected zones. The three
projects are illustrated in Figure 13-4 and are summarized
below.
                                                    ESTIMATED a:sr
                                                 (millions of 1979 pesos)
1. Construct tunnel from kID 48 to km 57.65                236
2. Relocate track from kID 103 to kID 109.4                247
3. Raise track level from kID 112.5 to kID 116.5           124
     The second two projects were recommended by JICA, but the
tunnel project did not prove to be feasible. The evaluations
are examined here and commented on in the l~ght of the Study
traffic forecast for 1989.

     Tunnel Project - The tunnel would be about 1.5 kIn long
and involve a further 1.75 kIn of new track. Savings are
estimated by JICAat $b2.35 million (1979) and comprise
savings in maintenance and running costs due to the reduction
in length of 6.4 kIn and the elimination of a steep grade. In
terms' of values estimated by this Study, both benefits appear
to be overstated. Since the benefits estimated by JICA are
only one percent of the total costs, it can be confirmed that
this project is not feasible.
     Track Reloc a't ion and Track Raising - These two projects,
totalling 10.4 kiii, were evaluated together by JICA. The
benefits were estimated for forecast 1984 traffic volumes
(196,000 tons) on the assumption that 46 days suspension of
service per year could be avoided by the new alignments. The
benefits estimated by JICA are as follows:        .
                                           ANNUAL BENEFITS

     On the basis of these benefits, JICA estimated an initial
internal rate of return (IRR) of 10 percent. Sensitivity
analyses, varying the extent of interruption each year,
produced a range of IRRs of between 7.44 and 10.67 percent.
However, the first year rate of return (FYRR) in 1984 was only
8 percent and, on the basis of JICA figures, would not rise
to the minimum required by this Study (12 percent) until 1993.
     Savings to passenger traffic were estimated by JICA as the
avoidance of sales loss, both by wayside inhabitants to train
passengers and by peddlers using the trains to sell goods to
wayside inhabitants. The benefit to the project of maintaining
these sales is small and have been maintained as estimated by
aICA. However, it should be noted that JICA made no allowance
for the temporary suspension of sales to be made up by increased
selling afterwards.
     Calculations of the freight transport savings appear to
have been overcounted. The total volume of traffic affected by
46 days of suspension has been calculated and each ton of traf-
fic is assumed to be affected by the enti.re delay. Since the
total annual interruption is made up of a number of short breaks
in service, a more realistic figure would be about 3 or 4 days
on average. This would reduce the benefit calculated by a
factor of at least 10.

     The annual cost of repairing \iamage in the affected sections
was derived from ENFE estimates' and can be assumed to be reliable.
Costs, in real terins, are said to be increasing at 6 percent per
year. The savings in maintenance costs appear, if anything, to
be slightly understated.                                                                 ,j

      The 1989 project costs are estimated to total $b 496
million. In the most optimistic case of high freight volumes
associated with the low recommended tariffs, a first year rate
of return of only 5 percent is calculated ,compared with 12 per-
cent required for feasibility. It has been suggested that the
costs of track repairs each season in the absence of this pro-
ject could be much higher, but they would have to rise to
nearly three times the assumed value (which itself is higher
than current costs) to make the project worthwhile. For higher
volumes of traffic, which would be associated with the rail
interconnection (not recommended for opening within the next ten
years), the effect of traffic disruptions would be more extensive
and the project could become worthwhile. At this stage, it is
not recommended.
Analysis of Existing Lines
     It was commented earlier that the original construction
standards of the railroads were low so that, as a consequence,                   ,'
much of the track today is in an unsatisfactory state. This
results in poor operating conditions and hence high operating
and track maintenance costs.                    "




                             -288-                                               !   r
     In 1979, ENFEcompleted a study of maintenance costs and
concluded that at current levels of maintenanc.e, which are
quite costly, the track is gradual'ly deteriorating. That is
to say, costs of maintenance are high, because of the poor
state of the track, but costs should be yet higher to prevent
fUrther deterioration. This is a serious situation and calls
for positive action.
     The basic choice is between raising track maintenance to
the required levels, or completing a rehabilitation of the line,
which would have the effect of reducing track maintenance costs.
The important elements to consider are the annual operating
and maintenance costs before and after rehabilitation, the cost
of the rehabilitation work and, very importantly, the volumes
of traffic using each line, both now and in the future. Rail
volumes are low in Bolivia with no line exceeding 500,000 tons
per year, and some lines are experiencing a decline in traffic.
Although rehabilitation will always reduce maintenance and
operating costs, the cheapest solution orllightly used lines
may well be not to rehabilitate but simply to spend larger
sums on annual maintenance. For the very lightly used lines,
especially when volumes are declining, the best solution may
be to close the line entirely.     .
     Six basic options were identified for evaluation:
     1.   Maintain track in present condition
     2.   Rehabilitate track
     3.   Revise track (a less thorough operation than rehabilit~n)
     4.   Re-align and rehabilitate track
     5.   Close line immediately
     6.   operate the line over a period of time with minimal
          maintenance and with a gradually decreasing service
          level, until the line is phased out completely.
     In general,the outcome of these policies can be summarized
as follows. Policy 1 will be characterized by high maintenance
and operating costs. If the line has already been rehabilitated,
these costs will be correspondingly lower. Policies 2-4 will
involve an initial cost but will. thereafter be characterized
by lower maintenance and operating costs. Policies 5 and 6 will
eliminate all rail costs, either immediately or after a run-down
period, and will transfer traffic to other modes.
     Logically, it is desirable to consider first whether lines
are worth keeping open: this is done in the remainder of this
section. Then,· for those lines that are worth keeping open,
the subsequent section considers rehabilitation and maintenance
policies.

     Rail Line Closures - The theoretical possibility of
closure was considered for all line.s, but a preliminary analy-
sis showed that benefits justified the retention of almo~ all
of them.
                                                                     'f

     The preliminary analysis considered the value of each l.i,ne
for external traffic only, in all cases assuming no rail inter-
connection. In each case, the alternative costs by truck
transport and by rail were compared over routes within Bolivia.
Truck costs were calculated for the recommended road network,
(see Chapter 10). The savings in cost by using rail transport
were then compared with total rail fixed costs, in all cases
assuming the highest level of fixed maintenance costs for an
unrehabilitated track.
     For the Eastern System, each of the main lines was considered
separately. For the Andean System, which is more complex, a
basic system was defined linking La Paz, Viacha, Oruro, Uyuni
and Avaroa (formerly Ollag~e}, and this was evaluated. Having
established the viability of the basic system, other links
were treated as branch lines to the basic system.
                                                                         Ii


     The results of this rather conservative analysis are set
out in Table 13-3. In almost all cases, the savings in
variable operating costs for external traffic using rail exceed
the fixed costs of rail operation. For Oruro-Cochabarnba,
savings by rail cover only 75 percent of the fixed costs, and
for Villaz6n-Uyuni 85 percent. However, it can be reasonably
assumed in these two cases that internal traffic savings make
up the difference.                                   .
                                                                     '.
     On the lines Viacha-Guaqui, Potosi-Sucre and Cochabamba-        .   "
Aiguile, benefits to rail are either very low or negative,
and certainly do not cover fixed costs. In the case of Viacha-
Guaqui, the future depends very much on the possibilities of
linking with the Peruvian system at Desaguadero (see Chapter
15) and therefore a decision on closure' for this line is not
recommended until the position on the construction of Puno-
Desaguadero becomes clearer. Sucre-Potos! and Cochabamba-
Aiquile are discussed in more detail below •
   . Potos!-Sucre Li:ne - This is a 175 kIn line, linking the
capitals of Potosi and Chqqtiisaca departments.
     Fixed costs of operation in 1977 were just under 19 million
pesos and it is estimated that these would rise to 22 million
pesos in 1989 (in 1977 pesos} at current levels of maintenance,
and to 42 million pesos if a higher level of track maintenance
were adopted to prevent track deterioration. Revision of the
line (see later for definition} would reduce fixed costs to
17.1 million pesos in 1989, but would require an initial out-
lay of at least 172(3} million pesos.

     Benefits of keeping the line open were estimated for both
internal and external traffic. These benefits vary greatly           II
depending on whether or not the Potos!-Sucreroad is paved.
They are summarized below:

     If the line is to be maintained to the standard suggested
                                                                      "
by ENFE and if the potosi-Sucre road is not paved, the fixed
costs of operations by 1989 will exceed the likely benefits.
If the line is operated with current levels of maintenance,
benefits would exceed fixed costs, but the line will eventually
become too dangerous to operate under these conditions. If
the line is revised at a cost of 172 million pesos, benefits
would again exceed fixed costs but the benefits give a single-
year rate of return of only 6 percent on the investment in
revision. In all cases, if the road between Potosi and Sucre
is paved, the line will no longer be viable. It can be com-
mented that this Study is recommending paving of about two
thirds of this road in the 1980s.
     Benefits were estimated on the assumption that traffic
volumes will increase greatly over today's volumes due to the
introduction of a new tariff policy. Recent traffic is sum-
marized in Table 13-4 together with the forecast made by the
Study for 1989. Freight traffic has halved over the past two
years. In contrast,' the Study estimates based on lower tariffs
are over eight times the 1979 freight volume, and yet barely
warrant keeping the line open. Passenger traffic also drop-
ped by one third between 1977 and 1979, and although volumes
have probably increased during 1980(following the introduction
of new express train services), increased revenues are unlikely
to have offset the fixed costs of this line. An analysis of
ENFE revenues for 1979 indicates a loss on the line of about
18 million pesos.

      It is concluded that the line is probably no longer viable,
although reduced tariffs may induce a recovery. It 1.s recom-       "
mended that the line be continued in oper:ationat the present
maintenance levels and that the effects of freight tariff           i'
reductions be carefully monitored. When the point of track
deterioration is reached that the line would have to be either      "
closed or rehabilitated, the results of the new tariff policy
should be assessed to see whether a better case can be made
fCDr keeping the line open.. If not, the line should then be        l'
closed. In any event, if the line is closed due to major
damage by earth movement, it should not be reopened.
     As a footnote to this analysis, it is commented that the
line does have considerable tourist appeal. It is one of the
highest railroads in the world, passes through spectacular
mountain scenery and links two of the historic centers of
Bolivia. Properly marketed, a special service for tourists
could be profitable and contribute to the costs of keeping the
line open.                                              .

          1979           24,493         11,665


     Even with the recommended low tariffs, only 12,000 tons
of freight were forecast to use the line in 1989. Fixed costs
were estimated at 16 million pesos in 1977 and these would
rise to an estimated 44 million pesos in 1989 if the higher
standards of maintenance were applied, sufficient to keep the
line continuously in operation. It is estimated that in 1979,
the line made an operating loss of nearly ~7 million pesos.
      This line, which serves only a lightly populated region
with one small mine (Chaguaranil, could only be viable in the
event of the rail system interconnection being built, a project
which is not recommended by this Study for completion within the
next 10 years. However, in order to serve as a link on the rail
interconnection, this line would have to be completely rehabili-
tated, but it is unlikely to be required for this purpose before
the mid 1990's. This indicates that maintenance should be left
at today's levels until operations are no longer possible, but
that after operations are closed, the track should be left in
place pending a decision on the interconnection.

      A trackre!iabilitation program was st'arted' in 1976 with'
assistance from the .World Barik'. So far , 1n thr'.eephases,
433 Jan of rehaoilitation have been completed, ,evenly divided
between tIieEastern and Andean system, and a further 272 kIn
are progranuned for .completion.oy the 'end of 1981. Funds were
availaBle for 70.km to be completed in 1980, and completion of
the remainder depends on further availability of funds.
     When this program of work is completed, the Andean System
will be rehaBilitated between El Alto and Rio Mulato and three
sections of the5anta Cruz-Corumb4 line totalling 312 kIn will
Be rehaoilitated on the Eastern System.        .
     Plans are in preparation for a fourth phase of rehabilitation,
including a fUrther 780 kIn in the west and a further 382 kIn in
the east. The map in Figure 13-5 shows work so far achieved,
work progranuned and work tentatively planned.
     The work so far completed has been to a good standard, but
has fallen badly behind schedule. This has been attributed to
the difficulties in setting up ballast production, which is a
fundamental requirement of the rehabilitation work. Hence the
program is in financial. difficulties with most of the money
spent and much of the work remaining.
     This section looks at the economic return on rehabilitation
and makes some general recommendations about future work. Detail-
ed planning of the program is not dealt with, since this requires
a more intimate knowledge of the local conditions of each
section of the line. .
     Assumptions on Railroad Rehabilitation - A rehabilitation
project implies a partial reconstruction of the track requiring
substantial investment. The size of the investment is determined
by the extent of the rehabilitation work and a range exists be-
tween simple "reviSion" (see below} to a major realignment of
the track.                                          '
     The purpose of a rehaoilitation project is to reduce the
costs of track maintenance and train operations.. Also, by
improving the condition of the track, rehabilitation reduces the
risk of derailments and other accidents. It has been suggested
that without rehabilitation, rail lines would have to close down,
but this does not seem to be the prevailing view now.

     Rehabilitation, as considered in the analysis presented in
this section, specifically excludes projects designed to eliminate
service interruptions due to earth slides or flooding; these
                                                                           '••.
are treated separately on a case by case basis (see earlier
section on Oruro-Cochabamba and Chapter 15 for a discussion of
Taperas-Robor~}.
                                                                           ••
     In general, then, four classes of costs need to be identified
as follows:
        (i)   Costs of rehabilitation                                      ,..
       (ii)   Track maintenance costs, before and after rehabilitation
      (iii)   Operating costs, before and after rehabilitation
       (iv)   Costs of accidents caused by the bad state of the
               unrehabilitated track (but excluding costs of accidents
               due to earth slides or flooding).                           .1


     Assumptions made on these costs are set out in detail in
Appendix 13A (4), and are briefly discussed below.
     Rehabili'ta'tion 'Schemes - Three types of rehabilitation
schemes were considered -- revision, reconstruction and re-
alignment:
         1.   Revision - A low grade rehabilitation employing, where
              possible, used materials from other rehabilitated lines ,_   oj
              Ballasting is not generally provided, except where
              corrections of altgnment are required. Where necessary,
              the track is re-Ieveled with selected sand placed under
              the sleepers. Switch points in stations are replaced         ,I

              to permit higher operating speeds for through trains.
              This is an operation particularly suitable for lightly
              used lines ..
         2.   Reconstruction - Essentially the type of work currently
              being performed by ENFE. Defective materials (partic-
              ularly sleepers and, if necessary, railsJare replaced,
              rails are welded into 40 m sections and the track is
              fully ballasted. Switch points in stations are also
              replaced to permit higher operating speeds by through
              trains.             '            ,                '

         3.   Re-alignment - A higher grade operation with the aim
              of eliminating tight curves to allow higher operating
              speeds. This is'done at the same time' as reconstruction
              of the track, and all costs given below for re-alignment
              reflect both operations. Re-alignment considered here
              refers exclusively to geometric' improvements and not
              to new line construction which is treated elsewhere on
              a case by case basis ..

     All three types of improvement produce a similar reduction
in maintenance costs. Re-alignmentallows a greater reduction
in operating costs through higher speeds. Revision, while pro"":'
ducing the same operating and maintenance benefits as reconstruc-
tion, has a shortei lif~.
    The estimated lives for each operation, in terms of
cumulative freight tons, are reported below:

     Costs vary according to the state of the sleepers, and are
detailed in Appendix 13A. The following costs are examples
which apply for tracks where 30 percent of sleepers need
replacing. They do not include rail replacement, which would
have to be undertaken whether or not the line is rehabilitated.

     Estimated costs of rehabilitation for each section of the
line are shown in Table 13-5. Costs are shown for 1985, the
average year for the period under consideration, and were obtained
by factoring Appendix 13A values by 1.14.
     Benefits from Rehabilitation - The main benefit from
rehabilitation is the reduction obtained in track maintenance
costs. Current maintenance is insufficient to prevent deterio-
ration of the track and ENFE has supplied estimates of how
much would need to be spent to prevent further deterioration
of unrehabilited lines. Also, estimated costs are available
from ENFE for the maintenance of rehabilited lines. These
are sununarized below:

     Reductions in operating costs due to rehabilitation (taking
into account increased speeds, lower fuel consumption, less wear
and tear on equipment, etc.) are shown in Appendix 13A. In
general, such reductions are not very great, averaging 10 percent
for a revision or reconstruction and 15 to 20 percent for a re-
alignment.
     Accident costs, effectively the costs of dealing with minor
derailments, were estimated at 0.006 pesos per ton-km in 1979.
     Evaluation of Rehabilitation pro~ects - The three alternative
rehabilitation projects were evaluate for each line in the ENFE
system, excluding only those lines already rehabilitated. The
evaluation was undertaken with all values for costs and benefits
adjusted to 1985 values, representing average values for the
period under consideration. It was assumed in all cases that
maintenance costs of the unrehabilitated track would be at
the desirable level specified above. In no case did the alterna-
tive of re-alignment prove worthwhile and so this alternative
is dropped from further consideration.
      The details of the evaluation are shown in Appendix 13B
and the results are summarized in Table 13-6. The First Year
Rate of Return (FYRR) for revision and reconstruction are shown
for each line, assuming alternative years for the projects of
1980 and 1989, and assuming also two different possible growth
rates in traffic to ~989. Low growth signifies that the freight
tariff policy is unchanged while high growth assumes the growth
in freight traffic forecast by the Study under the recommended
low tariff PQlicy (see Chapter 17). In both cases for 1989, pas-
senger traffic is assumed to double from the 1979 volumes used
in' the 1980 evaluation. Several conclusions can be drawn from
these data.

                   RAIL REHABILITATION
,
     The main conclusion isthatrehabi.li.tation, as currently
carried out hy ENFE (teconstruction in Table. -13"';'61, is not
economically feasillle 'at the present time, if it is consi.dered
that a minimum 12 per:cerit F~ is required", On the other hand,
the cheaper and loweistandard revisi:on is'feasihlein 1.980
in two cases' ~- Rio Mulato-Uyuni and Oruro-Co'chabamba --
and closely approaches feasihility on many other .sections. This
conclusion, that revision is thehetter project in almost all
cases, presents, the paradox that it should he undertaken usi);lg
materials from prevwus" reconstructions, wherepossihle.
Clearly, if revision only is contemplated, such used materials
will not he available. Therefore, reconstruction must he often
considered, even wliere revision has proved to he the better
project.
     This situation is not very much different in 1.989. With
low traffic growth, only Santa Cruz-Corumb! is economically
feasible for reconstruction, and with high traffic growth, just
three more lines can be added; La Paz-El Alto, Rio Mulato-Uyuni
and Oruro-Cochabamba. In contrast, revision can be justified" for
almost every line by 1989 when considering high traffic growth.
     It can also be concluded that rehabilitation is, in general,
easier to justify on mountain lines, even with comparatively low
traffic volumes. This conclusion is contrary to the philosophy
so far followed in the'rehabilitation program, which has placed
more importance on rehabilitating lines on the A1tip:1ano and in
the East.
     The reason why mountain lines achieve better results in
this evaluation lies in the nature of the benefits to be gained
hy rehabilitation. It is apparent that the major savings are
due to reductions in routine maintenance costs, and these savings
are very significant on the mountain lines. On the other hand,
benefits from reduced costs of train operations are comparatively
small.
     The savings in routine maintenance cost on mountain lines
are so great that rehabilitation of even the Potost-Sucre line
is justified. This analysis, of course, does not answer the
question of whether or not the line should be kept open. This
was answered earlier in the Chapter. It only affirms that if
the Sucre-Potosi line is to continue in operation, then it will
be cheaper to rehabilitate and spend less on annual maintenance
(but only if operations are continued for many yearsl. The
conclu5ions on this 1i.ne reaclied earlier are not invalidated by
tlieseresu1ts.

     Conc1us'ions' of Rehabilitation - The railroad rehabilitation
program does not appear to offer significant economic advantages
over the alternative of more intense routine maintenance, except
for lines in. mountain areas where the positive results of the
evaluation depend upon perhaps dubious assumptions. This is
not to say that the railroads should be abandoned. It was
demonstrated earlier that almost all of the railroad system is
viable for external traffic alone, even where maintenance costs
are raised from current levels to those necessary to prevent
track deterioration. The results of the rehabilitation evaluation
simply demonstrate that the high costs of rehabilitation are not
justified, or are only barely justified, by the reduction brought
about in operating and maintenance costs.
     However, much money has already been invested in rehabili-
tation -- in buying track equipment and materials, in obtaining
a good supply of ballast and transport for it, and in the
training of maintenance crews. If the costs of rehabilita-
tion supplied by ENFE contain an element of amortization of
previously acquired equipment, then the marginal costs of
continuing the rehabilitation program would be lower than
quoted, thus improving the economic return. Rehabilitation also
has the advantage that the lower maintenance needs after rehabili-
tation are less vulnerable to cut-backs in funds in times of
economic difficulty. Finally it is necessary to recognize that
the evaluation of rehabilitation presented here is based on
generalized costs and benefits. It is quite possible that more
detailed line by line studies could modify these conclusions
in particular cases.
     The Study therefore cautiously recorranends that rehabilitation
continue, but with the following provisions~
     (a)   Ways of reducing costs are found, with a view to
           approaching the standard of revision rather than
           reconstruction, employing used materials where
           appropriate.
     (b)   Benefits of rehabilitation in mountain areas are reviewed
           to see whether the priority accorded to the rehabilitation
           of lines in these areas is justified.
     (c)   Each line is evaluated in more detail, using specific
           knowledge of the improvements to be made and the
           benefits to be obtained, before inclusion in the
           rehabilitation program.




                             -302-
     (dl   The following priorities are observed:
           Andean System    - Mountain lines (depending upon the
                              results of the re-analysis of such
                              lines) •
                            - Al tiplano lines~ from Machacamarca to
                              Villaz6n.
           Eastern System   - Santa Cruz to Corumb4.
     (e)   When major renewal of track and ballast equipment
           becomes necessary, the economics of rehabilitation
           are reviewed again. An important factor to be
           considered in this review will be whether or not
           significant traffic growth has ocurred since the
           base year for this evaluation (1979). With little
           or no growth, rehabilitation would be hard to
           justify economically.
     Concerning priorities, it does not appear that the Viacha-
Charafia line is worth rehabilitating, although it is included
in the proposed ENFE phase 4 rehabilitation program.
     For investment planning purposes, and making the optimistic
assumption that traffic growth will be as predicted under a
new lower tariff policy, it is assumed that an additional
1,070 km of rehabilitation at a cost of apprOXimately $b 1,000
million (1977) will be justified in the next ten years, beyond
the rehabilitation committed in phase 3 of the rehabilitation
program.
     Whatever policy is followed on rehabilitation, it is recom-
mended that ENFE immediately upgrade their current maintenance
operation to the "desirable" levels quoted earlier, to avoid
further track deter~oration. It is estimated that an additional
expenditure of 220 million pesos (19771 will be required in the
period 1981-1990 above current maintenance costs, but that by
the end of the decade, the reduced costs on rehabilitated lines
will offset the additional maintenance costs on the remaining
lines.
The Machacamarca-Unc1a Railroad
     This 105 km railroad is considered separately from the
rest of the rail system since it is the only section not ad-
ministered by ENFE, being instead operated by the National Min-
ing Company (COMIBOL). The corridor containing the line is
shown in Figure 13-6.



                              -303-
     The line is in very poor condition with light rails, no
ballasting (in common with most of .the Bolivian railroads} and
low levels of routine maintenance. Equipment is elderly and
since spare parts are no longer available, they have to be
manufactured in the COMIBOLworkshops .. These latter are poor-
ly equipped.
     The line is also very lightly used. In 1977, the major
flow of approaching one million tons per year took place on
what amounts to a siding off the main track, linking the mine
of Siglo xx with the mineral processing plant at Catavi, a
distance of about 9 km. This is effectively an interplant
movement and as such deserves to be fully under the control of
COMIBOL. Movements of processed minerals from Catavi for ~­
port are sent by truck, but currently amount to no more than
45 tons per day.
     other mineral movements take place between Huanuni and
Machacamarca (30 kID), but the quantity is unknown, although
probably less than 30,000 tons per year. About 6,500 tons of
general cargo consisting mainly of inputs to the Huanuni and
Siglo XX mines, and with an average haul length of 80 km, to-
gether with about 3,000 passengers per year with an average
trip length of 30 km, also use the line.
     Apart from the short Siglo XX to Catavi branch line, it
seems strange that this line should be operated by COMIBOL.
It is likely that both equipment and track maintenance pro-
blems could be substantially reduced were ENFE to take con-
trol, and a better utilization of the line could be obtained
if it were properly integrated into the ENFE system. However,
a more fundamental question than ownership is whether or not
the line is worth continuing in operation.
       Fixed costs of operation, including very low maintenance,
  were estimated at $b 14.9 million in 1977. If maintenance
  levels were increased to prevent further track deterioration,
  fixed costs would rise to $b 30 million by 1989. Rail mar-
  ginal costs are lower than road operating costs but even if
. all the traffic in the corridor (estimated at 315,000 tons
  between Machacamarca and Huanuni and 227,000 tons between
  Huanuni and Uncia in 1989) were to move by rail, the savings
  in operating costs over using road would amount to only $b 23
  million per year i.e. less than the fixed costs of rail
  operations.

      If the l~ne were to be rehabilitated to the level of re-
 vision (see above), fixed operating costs would drop to about
 $b 15 million. Thus the savings over using road would exceed
 fixed costs by $b 8~i11ion in 1989. However, this would only
 show a 6 percent first year return on the inves'troent cost of
 revision, estimated at $b 138 millions.
      This is a very conservative analysis. Revision costs would
 be likely to be higher than assumed due to the very poor state
 of the track, and it extremely unlikely that all traffic would
 switch to rail as assumed in the analysis. Despite these
 assumptions, which clearly favor the rail case, the line is
 shown not to be viable economically. Hence it is concluded
 that operations can no longer be justified and the study recom-
 mends closure of the main Machacamarca-Unc!a line. The opera-
 tion between Sig10 XX and Catavi is a COMIBOL interp1ant opera-

       It has been suggested that due to the energy cr1S1S and
  the consequent rise in price of hydrocarbon fuels, serious con-
  sideration should be given to the electrification of the Boli-
  vian railroad system, thus substituting domestic hydro-electric
  power for imported diesel fuel. The Study examined this sug-
, gestion but concluded that electrification could not be jus-
  tified in the foreseeable future.
      Two assumptions each were made on the cost of electricity
 and the cost of diesel fuel. The electricity costs were deri-
 ved from a range of industrial tariffs and the two diesel fuel
 cost assumed: 1} the continuation of the 1980 cost of 4 pesos
 per liter and 2) a rise in cost to 30 pesos per liter. The
 1989 capital costs of electrification were estimated at
 $b 2.1 million per km for the Altiplano and Eastern Lines and
 $b 3.0 million per km in the mountains.
      The volumes of traffic required to justify electrification
 were then calculated for different regions of the country with
 the following results:              '

      Under the most optimistic assumptions of the relative change
in diesel and electricity costs, some of the busier lines could'
possibly be approaching the volumes required to justify electrifi-
cation by 1989. Certainly, at todays volumes of traffic and
relative costs, electrification cannot be justified.
      It is highly improbable that electrification could be jus-
tified within the next ten years and justification is considered
unlikely within the next twenty years. Of course, if diesel
fuel costs rise even faster than assumed here, or if traffic
increases at a greater rate than predicted by the study, elec-
trification would be worth investigating further.
Rail Passen'ger Tra'nsport
      In 1977, the railroad carried only about 3 percent of
non-urban passenger transport and these services made a loss.
The question is therefore raised whether it might not be better
to abandon these services, allowing the railroads to concentrate
on the transport of freight, where rail can be competitive.
This section discusses these issues, taking into account the
large increase in rail passenger travel in 1980.
      Passenger Traffic and Revenues - The growth of rail pas-
senger traffic in the fifteen years since the formation of ENFE
is shown in Figure 13-7. Overall growth was moderate up to
1974 and was entirely due to traffic on the new lines in the
east. Growth then generally accelerated until 1979, when
interruptions on the Santa Cruz-Corumb~ and Oruro-Cochabamba
lines brought about a decline in traffic. In 1980, though,
a very sharp increase in traffic was observed. The projections
in Figure 13-7 are based on nine months of operations. Overall
growth from 1965 to 1974 averaged under 3 percent per year,
while from 1974 to 1980, it is expected to have averaged over        '",

12 percent per year.
      The sudden rise in traffic in 1980 is most notable on the
Andean System and has been attributed to two factors. One is
the introduction of three new express train services: La Paz-
Cochabarnba, La Paz-Sucre and La Paz-Villaz6n. These trains use
recently acquired Fiat coaches, and service times are said to be
similar to ferrobuses. In fact, they have largely taken over
from ferrobus services, as shown in Figure 13:"'8 and this has
                                                                     ..
been explained by the poor availability of ferrobuses due to
lack of spare parts. Secondly, bus passenger fares, both
interprovincial and interdepartmental, have gone up by about
70 percent over the last three years, while train fares on the
Andean System have risen on average only 20 percent.

      The 1980 increase in traffic on the Eas.tern System is in
line with trends before thelo~g interruption in service in
1979.

      Passen'ger Revenues - Table, '13-7 sets out details of pas-
senger traffic and revenues by type of service 'for each part
of the ENFE system, for the years ~977-~979 and with an estimate
for 1980 (based on nine months data).
      It is evident that very different commercial policies are
being followed in the Andean and Eastern System. Revenues per
passenger-kilometer rose 30 percent on average on the Eastern
System during 1977-1980, which breaks down to a 26 percent rise
in train revenues and a 46 percent rise in ferrobus revenues
(both per passenger-kilometer). Most of the rise occurred
between 1979 and 1980.
      On the Andean System, revenue per passenger-kilometer has
risen by 20 percent on average, but this is due almost,entirely
to the change in mix of passengers. Local train revenues per
passenger-kilometer rose only 5 percent and ferrobus revenues
by 12 percent over the period. It is the new express train
services, priced at about 10 percent below ferrobuses, which
have caused the increase in traffic and revenues. If ferro-
buses and express train services are considered jointly, the
rise in revenues per passenger-kilometer since 1977 has been
only 3 percent. Therefore, making allowances for the change in
passenger mix on the Andean System, it can be concluded that
revenue levels per passenger-kilometer have increased by only
3 to 5 percent in the past three years.
      1977 Passenger Costs - petailed cost data were available
only for 1977 and tbese are presented in Table 13-8. It is
apparent r.hat income did not cover the costs of passenger
services in 1977, although variable costs, which represent
about 30 percent of the total, were covered with a little
to spare.
      Ferrobus services were the least unprofitable, covering
their variable costs and about half their attributed fixed '
costs. They carried about 30 percent of the total rail pas-
senger traffic. In contrast, train services, which carried 70
percent of rail passenger traffic, cost 50 percent more per pas-
senger-kilometer than' did the ferrobuses but brought in 30 per-
cent less revenue per passenger-kilometer. Revenue did not
cover variable operating costs and amounted to only 30 percent
of total costs. Autocarril services covered only 11 percent
of their operating costs, but accounted for less than two per-
cent of total rail passenger services. In total, rail pas-
senger traffic in 1977 accounted for 31 percent of ENFE's opera-
ting costs, but contributed only 12 percent of the income.

      The extent to which fixe:i costs should be attributed to
 passenger traffic can be argued. In the analysis provided
 by ENFE, all fixed costs were allocated to either" passenger
 or freight, whereas in reality, many of the costs are joint
 that is to say, they would not be avoided unless both freight
 and passenger services were abandoned. Inspection of the
 data indicated that only about half of the fixed costs in the
 preceding table would be avoided in the absence of passenger
 services. The conclusion still remains that passenger services
 were not profitable in ~977, even though variable costs were
 covered.
      Viabilit of CUrrent Passen er Services - Detailed data
 were not avalla Ie on passenger costs for   80, but it was
 possible to make estimates based on overall ENFE costs published
 for 1977 and 1979. These are as follows:                                "

     Total costs rose 47 percent, comprising 50 percent in
the Andean and 42 percent in the Eastern systems. Costs of
operation appeared to go up less, but care is needed in inter-
preting the items of "other" costs which have risen substantially.
These consist mainly of food subsidies to staff in lieu of
salary adjustments, and should therefore be allocated among the
other three items. If this is done on a pro rata basis, operat-         '.
ing costs rose 43 percent in the period overallI 36 percent in
the Andean and 60 percent in the Eastern system. Total traffic          ••
units (ton-kilometers plus passenger-kilometers) rose slightly
on the Eastern and fell slightly on the Andean system. Taking
this into account, unit cost factor increases for variable
costs from 1977-80 can be estimated at 1.5 and 1.6 for the
Andean and Eastern systems, respectively.


                                                                        .

     Comparing these cost increase factors with revenues per
passenger-kilometer, the following conclusion can be drawn.

     Eastern System revenues have risen substantially and it
can be expected that they largely cover variable costs. This
must be true for ferrobus services where revenues were double
variable costs in 1977, and whose revenues per passenger-
kilometer increased by 50 percent in the period.

     On the Andean System, the conclusion is quite different.
It was estimated that revenues per passenqer-kilometer have
risen only 3 to 5 percent while operating costs have probably
risen nearly 50 percent. Much depends on the operating costs
of the new express trains.  It is concluded that they must be
at least as costly as ferrobuses, and perhaps even more so
since the trains are rather short in some cases.  Since reven-
ues barely covered variable costs in 1977, it seems unlikely
that the Andean System passenger services are covering their
variable costs now.

     Prospects for Interurban Train Services - Interurban
rail services operate on the Andean System between La Paz,
Oruro, Cochabamba, Potosi and Sucre. Table 13-9 compares
the   services offered in 1977 with those provided by bus and
air.

     Rail volumes in 1977 were low, accounting for just over
10 percent of the total number of passengers on these routes.
Bus transport clearly dominated but air was also important
in certain corridors. The one route where rail competed
strongly was that between La Paz, Oruro and Cochabamb~ the
volumes on which account for 80 percent of the total of all
rail passenger travel shown in the table.

     In general, ferrobus services were faster than road but
tariffs were about 60 percent higher. Air, of course, was
much faster but tariffs were 2 to 3 times those of rail.
Despite the higher tariffs, air carried 60 percent more pas-
sengers than rail between La Paz and Cochabamba.

     The situation has been changed somewhat by the introduction
of the new express train services in 1980. Preliminary estimates
by ENFE indicate the following changes in numbers of passengers:

     These are significant increases from the point of view
of ENFE and are probably due partly to the greater comfort
and capacity of the new coaches used on the express services,
and partly to the virtual equalization of tariffs between bus
and rail.

     Although ENFE have now captured a significant share of
the interurban passenger market, it is believed that they will
have difficulty in maintaining their position. On the main
route from La Paz to Cochabamba, buses are now handicapped by
the poor road between Oruro and Cochabamba, but by the mid-
1980s, a new paved road(now under construction) will be in
service. Much of the Oruro-Cochabamba rail traffic, which is
now at about half the road volume, can then be expected to
switch to road. For confirmation of this view, one needs only
to look at the La Paz-Oruro corridor which has now had a paved
road for over ten years, and where rail carries less than one
percent of the passenger traffic.

     Paving of a number of roads is. being recommended by this
study in order to reduce vehicle operating costs. As road
paving extends, so rail services will tend to become less
competitive.  It is not only buses that will provide competition
in the future, but the private car, which at present is
scarcely used for interurban travel, will become increasingly
popular.
     It is difficult to see how intra-urban passenger services
can be made competitive. With single, narrow gauge track and
difficult alignments through the mountains, the superior type
of passenger services which are attracting business in Europe
and Japan cannot be offered in Bolivia. Moreover, as rail
freight traffic builds up, as projected by this Study, it will
become less easy to operate passenger services effectively on
the same track.

     It is concluded, therefore, that in the face of increasing
competition and from road transport and growing pressure from
rail freight services, the rail passenger services operated on
the Andean System are likely to decline, despite the rise in
traffic in 1980.
     Prospects for Services to Remote Areas - There are some
lines where the alternative road transport is extremely poor
or non-existent, and these are shown in Table 13-10, together
with passenger volumes over the past three years. The lines
are:
        •   Uyuni-Atocha
        •   Atocha-Villaz6n
        •   Oruro-Cochabamba
        •   Cochabamba-Aiquile
        •   Potos1-Sucre
        •   Santa Cruz-Corumba.

     Although Oruro-Cochabamba and Potosi-Sucre both have parallel
main roads, they are some distance away in different valleys,
and several communities along the railroads have poor road
access.

     It is the local train and, to a lesser extent, the auto-
carril services that really provide the access to these remote
areas; the ferrobuses merely pass through.   On some lines,
particularly Uyuni-Villaz6n,trains also provide a through
service for international traffic.

      Statistics for international traffic are difficult to dis-
entangle fram those for internal traffic.   This is because
ENFE statistics are based on ticket sales and do not distinguish
between international passengers and passengers travelling to
and from the border towns. Making allowance for international
traffic, however, the volumes of local traffic on these lines
in 1979 were estimated as follows:


                          NUMBER OF PASSENGERS
                         Per Year       Per Day

Uyuni-Atocha-Villaz6n    120,000          330
Oruro-Cochabamba         170,000          470
Cochabamba-Aiquile        37,000          100
Potosi-Sucre              37,000          100
Santa Cruz-Corumba       101,000          280


     In the cases of Uyuni-Atocha-Villazon, Oruro-Cochabamba
and Santa Cruz-Corumba, the volumes are quite high and abandon-
ment of service would clearly have an impact on the com-
munities served by the railroad.  In the cases of Cochabamba-
Aiquile and Potosi-Sucre, volumes are much lower and, although
these routes would be affected by the withdrawal of services,
it must be questioned whether the cost of keeping the line
open simply to provide these passenger services is justified.
It would amount to an annual subsidy per passenger trip of over
1,000 pesos. These two lines are recommended for eventual
closure, as discussed earlier in this chapter.

     Local passenger train services are heavily subsidized.
It is estimated that only about one quarter to, at the most,
one half of the transport provided by train and autocarril
services can be classified as essential to otherwise isolated
regions, and about half of these are for transport on the Santa
Cruz-Corumba line.   It is doubted whether the degree of subsidy
provided to other rail passengers, which must have risen
substantially over the past three years# can really be justified.

                                                                   •

     Conclusions on Rail Passenger Services - Passenger services
on the Eastern System appear to be operating satisfactorily.
Although fares have risen substantially over the past three
years, travel continues to increase, largely because there is
little road competition. The    rrobus services are almost
certainly more than covering their variable operating costs, and
a social case can be stated for a degree of subsidy to the local   '.
services, since no other means of transport exists. As long as
increasing costs can continue to be offset by fare increases,
there seems no reason why these services should not continue.

     On the Andean System, rail passenger operations are less
satisfactory. They almost certainly do not cover variable
operating costs, neither on the new interurban express train
services nor the local services. By charging low tariffs, rail
has managed to capture an increasing share of the rail passenger
market but these tactics are probably not in the interest of
the country as a whole.

     Despite the recent growth in traffic on the Andean inter-
urban services, the future for this type of rail passenger
traffic is not good.  Increasing competition from road is likely
to reduce rail traffic, and increasing pressure will be put on
the rail system by the growth in freight traffic, which will
make it more difficult to provide attractive passenger services.

     However, the new passenger coaches have been purchased and
placed in service and the Study accepts that these services
should continue.  Revenues should at least cover variable
operating costs, although not necessarily the depreciation of
the new coaches since it is not envisaged that they will ever
need replacement, and fares should immediately be increased to
do so. Certainly, no further purchases of rolling stock for         "
this type of service can be justified.

     Concerning local train services on the Andean System,
these too run at a loss although only a part of these services
are to genuinely isolated regions with no other transport
access. It is recommended that fares be immediately raised
to cover the variable cost of these services.

      In the longer term, it is questionable whether the costs
of providing rail passenger services on the Andean System can
continue to be justified. Assuming that only half of the
 fixed costs allocated to rail passenger services are truly
avoidable, the sum of 100 million pesos was paid in 1977 to
provide these services for revenues of only 56 million pesos.
Costs have risen considerably since then and it can be assumed
that the deficit is greater now. Much could be done with these
 funds to improve road access to currently isolated areas, which
is where rail services currently fill a genuine need, and this
deserves fuller study.

     A useful project for the proposed National Transport Center
recommended in Chapter 19 would be to study these isolated
areas in more detail and to evaluate a program for providing
road access. This would take into account the cost savings
possible from a suspension of rail passenger services in these
areas.

Rail Equipment Requirements

     This section analyzes the needs for rail transport equip-
ment which would be required to carry potential traffic forecast
for the 1989 committed rail system, consisting of the current
rail system with the addition of the new line from Yapacan!
to R!o Grande but without the rail interconnection. This ana-
lysis takes into account the need to replace old equipment as
well as purchase new stock.

      In planning infrastructure requirements, it is necessary
to evaluate each item of investment against the benefits which
it could be expected to generate. However, there is no need
to justify each individual investment in rail equipment since
the operating costs used in the model included equipment costs.
In other words, if traffic is allocated to rail as the most
efficient mode, then the equipment needed to carry it is justi-
fied.

     Locomotives for Freight Services - The calculation of loco-
motive requirements for freight services is set out in Table
13-11. The first stage of the calculation was to determine
the number of trains per week required, by dividing the tonnage
flow on the section in the heavier direction by the carrying
capacity of each train. This was usually rounded to an exact
number of trains per day. Using this, with the round trip
distance and the number of locomotives per train, the total
locomotive-kilometers per year were calculated. These totals
were then divided by 100,000 which represents a desirable
average annual number of kilometers for each operational loco-
motive, and is close to the figure ENFE achieved in 1979. The
number of locomotives per train was determined by allowing
800 tons of gross trailing weight per locomotive on most lines
and 500 tons on the very mountainous lines.  It was assumed
that locomotives would not be dedicated to a particular service
but that the total fleet would be available for all types of
rail service performed. The number of locomotives arrived at
by those calculations was 73.

     Wagon Requirements - The calculation of wagon requirements
for freight service is set out in Table 13-12. The annual ton-
nages by each commodity for internal and external movements were
divided by the average load per wagon to produce the number of
annual loads per commodity.  The average loads per wagon were
derived from ENFE's performance in 1977 allowing some improve-
ment for more modern wagons; overall the increase in average
load was about 35 percent.

     The number of annual loads was then divided by the average
number of loads per wagon per year, calculated on the basis of
an 8-day average turnround for internal movements and 12 days
for external movements. This is slightly better than ENFE
achieves at the moment but should be possible with improved
wagon control and loading techniques.

     The number of wagons required was then increased by an out-
of-service factor of 7 percent, which should be attainable with
newer equipment. The above calculations produced a total wagon
requirement in 1989 of 3,122.

     Passenger Equipment - No further purchase of ferrobuses or
passenger cars are envisaged in the next ten years.  The number
of locomotives needed to haul passenger trains has been taken
to remain constant at the 1977 levelof 12; these locomotives
are of course interchangeable with those used for freight
operations.

     Other Services - To handle the freight movements forecast
it will be necessary to establish or improve marshalling faci-
lities at the major interchange points of Viacha, Oruro, Rio
Mulato and Uyuni, and also to increase the freight handling
facilities at such places as Cochabamba, Potosi and Santa Cruz.
These will require the provision of shunting engines to sup-
plement the work of the main-line locomotives, and these engines
will have to be purchased as demand grows.

     Summary of Rail Equipment Needs - The above calculation shows
that, to achieve the traffic levels forecast, EN FE will require
about 85 operational locomotives and 3,122 rail wagons by 1989.
ENFE has at present 53 locomotives, of which however only about
36 are operational. Thus a further 49 will be required which
will cost about $b 640 million. The total stock of rail wagons
in 1979 is 2,353, but of these 1,214 were built before 1950 and
most will probably have to be replaced during the next decade.
Assuming that ENFE's internal services continue to account for
400 extra wagons and that interchange with other railroads
balances, there will be a requirement for 2,383 new wagons at
a cost of $b 1,660 million.

Railroad Operations

     The quality of railroad operations is of fundamental
importance. The process of sending goods by rail involves many
more steps than road transport, both for the user and for the
operator. Therefore improvements in efficiency at the various
stages of rail transport -- receipt of goods, wagon loading,
train formation and dispatching, wagon marshalling, wagon un-
loading and delivery of goods -- can make the service provided
much more attractive. Similarly, acCumulations of inefficient
operations at each of these points result in long transit times,
causing users to seek other means of transport more under their
own control, even if more expensive.

     Improvements in efficiency also have the great advantage
of being cheap to implement, although this is not to say that
they are easy. This is why the consultants Sofrerail were
employed by ENFE, on the advice of the World Bank, to study
the ways in which ENFE operation can be improved. Over the
course of several years, several reports have been completed
by Sofrerail and recommendations made and implemented on the
following subjects:

          •   Organization of work in stations
          •   Maintenance of fixed facilities
          •   Maintenance of rolling stock
          •   Commercial policies
          •   Staff productivity
          •   Staff training.
      Recent Performance of ENFE - Statistics are now available
covering the 1979 operations of ENFE and it is interesting to
compare these with targets set by the World Bank in 1977, in
the Third Railroad Project Report.   Table 13-13 shows targets
set for 1977 and 1979, and the actual performance of ENFE in
1979.

     These expectations have evidently not been attained, and
scarcely any of the targets have been met, the exceptions
being availability of freight cars, the load per wagon and
daily ton-kilometers per wagon.

     Other statistics can also be quoted which show the same
story. Availability of ferrobuses and autocarriles fell from
70 percent and 58 percent respectively in 1975 to 50 percent
and 53 percent in 1979. The net cargo per train fell slightly
from 196 tons in 1975 to 193 tons in 1979 although reaching a
peak of 258 tons in 1977.

     While most indicators of performance have shown a down-
ward trend, the number of employees has increased, contrary
to intentions stated by ENFE. Employment levels are now
higher than in 1973, when a program of staff reduction was
started.

     A detailed assessrrent of the reasons for EN FE 's recent poor
performance has not been made as part of this Study, but an
immediate review is very necessary. From discussions with
officials, the following points appear to be important.

     Equipment maintenance has been poor, resulting in low
availability rates, for a number of reasons.  In particular,
spare parts have not been available when required as a result
of inadequate planning for parts requirements, and also as a
result of inadequate financing.  Employee productivity has
also been low, partly due to a lack of technical training and
partly a result of continuing employment of over-aged staff
on strenuous manual work. It is believed that better incentives
to employees, coupled with more accurate measures of the per-
formance of the different workshops and teams, would have a
beneficial effect. Also, the program of employee redundancies,
which has faltered recently, should be renewed.

     It is also suggested that there are still too many work-
shops, although some progress has been made in rationalizing
the services provided.  Too many repair places may result in
the inadequate staffing,~pping and supervision of each,
with consequent lack of overall efficiency.

     It is also claimed that service to customers has been
poor, with inadequate information about train dispatches and
progress of cargoes through the system. Certainly low availa-
bility rates for equipment have not helped, but a more vigorous
commercial policy, and more attention to the customers needs,
is required.

Organization and Management of ENFE

     The organization of ENFE is currently as set out in
Figure 13-9.  The central offices are located in La Paz,
although there are important offices in Oruro and Cochabamba.
The central organization is responsible for operating the
Andean rail system but the Eastern system, which is not physic-
ally linked with the Andean system within Bolivia, is operated
independently by a separate management located in Santa Cruz.

     The changes in rail operations recommended by this Study
would place a severe load on the organization of ENFE.   In
particular, the implementation of a new tariff policy would
require very careful planning to ensure that the pace of
implementation is matched by the ability to encourage and
accept new freight traffic expected to be brought about by
the change.

                              -323-
     Similarly, the phasing out of some passenger train services
would require careful coordination with other transport improve-
ments to ensure that currently isolated communities have continuity
of transport links.  In this latter case, it is suggested that
the proposed National Transport Center could plan a most useful
role in supervising the necessary coordination between modes.

      As far as the task of establishing and implementing a new
commercial policy is concerned, there is a definite need to
put greater emphasis on this aspect. As will be discussed in
Chapter 17, a flexible tariff policy is proposed, with the aim
of attracting traffic with a comparatively high demand elasticity.
This will probably require a substantial strengthening of ENFE's
commercial department as well as the Ministry of Transport's
General Directorate of Railroads.   It is very much in the govern-
ment's interest that this work be carried out not just from the
point of view of ENFE, but with the general public interest in
mind. A strong monitoring function by the Ministry is particu-
larly important if some subsidy is required to pay for selected
low-tariff services.

     Changes are also recommended in the basic structure of the
ENFE organization.  In general terms, it is recommended that
certain of the overall aspects of railroad administration and
planning should be more completely centralized, probably in La
Paz, while other operational aspects whould be decentralized
and put under the control of regional centers. The function
of a central organization would be as follows:

     •   Preparation of overall budgets
     •   Major purchases, such as equipment
     •   Financial organization
     •   Legal organization
     •   Commercial policies
     •   Tariff studies
     •   Overall planning
     •   Establishment of standards and monitoring of performance.

     The implementation of policies decided by the central
administration should be the responsibility of district offices,      'It
each responsible to a regional office (Eastern and Andean). The
locations of district offices and their dependencies would have
to be studied carefully but probably a reduction in the number
of ENFE offices and workshops would be desirable.

     The statistics provided by ENFE each year are very complete,
but more needs to be done to set standards and to monitor             '"
performance so that ~esses and failures of the system are
identified rapidly and corrected. The responsibility to monitor

offices. The overall review of trends and the setting of
standards should be the responsibility of the central planning
division.

     It is commented that ENFE could attach mOIe importance
to economic evaluation and planning. Evaluations that are now
carried out are generally made by consultants, recent examples
being the evaluation of the rail interconnection by the
Brazilian firm Sondotecnica and the evalu-ation of the iml:->rove-
ments to the Oru ro-Cochabamba and the Santa'.Cruz-Corumb~ lines
by JICA. However, no economic evaluations were made of the
Yapacani-Rio Grdnde line now under construction at a cost of
$b 550 million (1977).

     The ability to conduct economic studies, or at least to
assess the studies made by others, is fundamental to a planning
department. Such an ability is not evident in the present ENFE
organization and it is strongly recommended that attention is
paid to this. A group gevo~ed to econom~c studi~s shou19 ~e
formed within the p1ann1n~ aepartment, e1ther uS1ng qua11f1ed
economists already working with ENFE or, if necessary, by
hiring the necessary ex~ertise. Tasks for this grou~ would
include evaluation of rehabilitation projects and the further
studies recommenaed on the rail system interconnection.

Conclusions on Rail Transport

     Major changes are recommended in railroad operations. They
must be seen in the context of a new tari    policy (discussed
in Chapter 17) ,which could have a dramatic impact on the volume
of domestic freight carried by rail.

     It is recommended that ENFE raise tariffs on rail passenger
services on the Andean System and, in the long term, possibly
withdraw from passenger services on this network.  If a withdra\va1
policy is adopted it should be phased over a number of years
and coordinated closely with the development of alternative
transport services where necessary.

     The Study concludes that an interconnection linking the
two rail systems between Cochabamba and Santa Cruz cannot be
justified in the 1980s. However, further studies are recommen-
ded on two aspects. A more northerly alignment via Chimore
and Yapacani should be evaluated to see whether construction
costs could be significantly reduced. Of more importance is
an investigation of the likely volumes of transit traffic
between Peru, Chile and Brazil, and the tariffs which could be
charged. Without any doubt, this is the crucial element, for


                           -325-
without the revenues from transit traffic, the rail inter-
connection could not be justified economically.
      Two new sections of rail line are recommended, one from
Mutun to Motacucito on the Santa Cruz-Corumb~ line and anoth-
er from Guaqui to Desaguadero.   This latter line should be
built only when the Peruvian line from Puno to Desaguadero is
nearing completion.   The rebuilding of the damaged section of
the Santa Cruz-Corumb~ line can be justified, but with a more
modest scheme than previously proposed {see Chapter 15 for
discuss~on}.   Major rebuilding and realignment in the diffi-
cult parts of the Oruro-Cochabamba line does not appear
justified at the present time.

     No other rail projects were found to be feasible inclu-
ding the line from RlO Grande to Trinidad (see Chapter 12        't'
for discussion).  In the latter case, even the prospect of
a cheap loan from Argentina was not sufficient to make up for
the lack of benefits associated with this project.
                                                                 '.
      It was concluded that although the rail rehabilitation
program does not appear to provide a high economic return,
work should proceed using the equipment already acquired and
making use of the trained crews. General levels of track
maintenance should be raised on unrehabilitated lines.

     The disappointing results of the rehabilitation analysis
should not be interpreted to mean that rail services are         'It
generally uneconomic. They simply reflect that the low volumes
on the Bolivian rail system do not warrant substantial invest-
ment in track, and that less money would be spent overall with
higher maintenance of unrehabilitated track.

     Electrification of the railroad systems was examined but
rejected, certainly for the next ten years.
                                                                  ..
     Three lines were identified where closure should be con-
sidered. These are Cochabamba-Aiquile, Machacamarca-Uncia
(currently operated by COMIBOL) and possibly Potosl-Sucre.
The rest of the system is well worth keeping for external
freight traffic alone, and the high volumes of domestic
freight forecast by the Study reinforce this conclusion.




                                                                 ••
                         -326-
     Much stress has been laid by the railroad authorities on
the need for new investment in rail, and particular importance
has been given to the need for a railroad interconnection be-
tween the Eastern and Andean system. It is agreed that this
would have substantial operating benefits, but not, in the
view of the study, sufficient to warrant the immediate commit-
ment of very large sums of public money -- over one third of
all public funds available for transport over the next ten years,
or about 8 percent of all public investment.                      .
     The high freight forecast by the Study indicates the poten-
tially bright future for the railroad. But it is only a potential.
To realize it, a new tariff policy will have to be established
and the quality of rail operations will have to be imp~Qved.

AIR TRANSPORT
CHAPTER 14

AIR TRANSPORT
     As has been described elsewhere in the Report, air
transport plays an extremely important role within the
Bolivian transport sector. Internally, many small communities
have no contact with the rest of the country except by
means of air. Given the high costs of road construction
and the generally sparse population in the outlying regions
of the country, air service will continue to provide for some
time the most economic means of integration and communication
in the remote regions. External air services also provide
vital access for this landlocked country.  In this chapter
the most critical areas of the sector are analyzed and
recommendations made for the future development of air
transport in the next decade.

Analysis of Future Air Passenger Service Patterns

     The possible future pattern of air passenger services,
which is central to the evaluation of the passenger sector,
was analyzed using a two-phase model. The first part of the
model is a simple regression procedure which predicts inter-
zonal passenger movements on the basis of the total gross
domestic product in the zones of origin and destination, the
cost of the flight and the difference in time between surface
public transport and air travel (these had been found to be
the most significant variables). The second phase of the
process includes an adjustment for flight frequency which in
other studies has been found to be a significant factor in
generating demand, until a level of seven flights a day
between cities in each direction is reached. The simple
model tends to underestimate trips between zone pairs with
high flight frequency and overestimate trips between zones
with poor frequency.   When the adjustment for frequency was
made, a much better result was achieved for the base-year
situation. The basic patterns of service tested are shown in
Figures 14-1 and 14-2.

     The model was then applied to a number of alternative
service patterns for the years 1989 and 1999, assuming that
aircraft types operating in the future will be similar to
those presently in service in terms of capacity and operating
cost (whereby allowance is made for increases in fuel cost).
Three different scenarios were tested: a greatly expanded
service by regular airlines reaching many more small communities
with scheduled flights, a continuation of the present pattern
of service (with slight expansion), and a move to different


                         -329-
                                                                  "
patterns of operation with jet service operating to a
number of key airports (at present served by F-27s) which
are the focus of feeder services.  In all tests, a load factor
of 60 percent was required for the service to continue:
this was altered to 50 percent and 70 percent to examine
the sensitivity of the service to this factor.

     The basic conclusion arising from the analysis is that
there is little scope for a major increase in scheduled air
service to the remote regions of the country: there is
insufficient predicted growth in either population or income
to provide the volumes required to support such services.
However, the flight pattern which extends jet service to a
number of regional centers proved to be viable, and desirable
in view of the lower operating costs of jet service and the
present lower than optimum utilization of the aircraft fleet.
This service pattern has certain implications for the airport
infrastructure requirements which receive further consideration
later in this chapter when the national airport plan is
discussed. A possible basic service pattern is shown in
Figure 14-3.

Evaluation of Non-regular Air Services

     An important part of the air sector is "non-regular" air
transport, described briefly in Chapter 4. These are privately
operated air services whose main task is to transport meat from
the remote northern cattle regions, in particular Beni Depart-
                                                                  '.
ment, to the markets of the Altiplano and valleys; principally
La Paz, Cochaba~ba, Oruro, Potos! and the mining centers.
Supplies to the remote regions are carried as backhaul, and
some passengers are also carried. These services exist mainly
because there is no surface access, except by river, and air
transport offers the cheapest way of transporting meat. Use
of air transport also means that refrigeration is not requiredJ
and thus cattle slaughtering facilities can be simple and
cheap.

     Characteristics of the Non-regular Air Services - There
are about 25 operators who between them in 1977 operated some
50 aircraft with a total of 12,000 flying hours and carrying
some 33,000 tons of cargo. Half of this total was performed
by the Curtiss C-46; the next most used planes were the Convair
440 and the Douglas C-54. Disregarding some very infrequently
used aircraft, the average operating time per aircraft in 1977
was 600 hours.
                                                                  '.
     The age of the aircraft used on non-regular services
(mostly between 25 and 40 years old), the primitive air strips,
mainly of earth surface and poor maintenance of both aircraft
and airstrips, has resulted in a poor accident record (see
Appendix 4E).

                                          A POSSIBLE 1989 LAB SERVICE PATTERN
                                                                                                                                     FIGURE 14-3
     Poor maintenance of aircraft prevails, partly because of
lack of government control but also because of the lack of
properly trained mechanics. Probably more important than both
of these factors, however, is the financial disincentive to
good maintenance. The price of meat in the market is kept
low by government and consequently the operators attempt to
reduce costs in every conceivable way. A concession by
government to the real economic difficulties of the operators
is a fuel subsidy.

     Insurance premiums are   high, mainly due to the poor
accident record.  Irregular   practices also occur, such as
declaring an aircraft to be   a total loss for insurance claims,
but then rehabilitating the   plane and returning it to service.

     The non-regular air services are undeniably operating in
marginal economic conditions. They survive principally because
there is no other feasible way of bringing meat out of the Beni.
Also, the owners of these companies are either cattle raisers
or, more often, the pilots themselves and the operation
of these services is almost a way of life. The income for
pilots is good and the mixture of independence and good pay,
counterbala~c~d by comparatively high risk, clearly appeals
to some lndlvlduals.

     The Future of Non-regular Air Services - Non-regular air
services currently operate in the absence of competitive land
transport to the remote regions, but this is changing fast.
Roads from both Santa Cruz and La Paz are being built to
Trinidad, the capital of Beni. New roads from Cochabamba to
Trinidad, and from Trinidad to Guayaramer!n, are also
recommended by this Study for the 1980s (see Chapter 12). If
the Study's recommendations are followed, 1989 should see all
the main meat producing centers of the north connected to the
markets by road. Road transport is then expected to be
considerably cheaper, even taking into account the costs of
refrigerated trucks. For example, it is estimated that the
cost from San Borja would be about 0.7 pesos per kilo by
refrigerated trucks compared with about 3.70 pesos per kilo
by air (1977 economic costs). Clearly, even if the estimate
of road costs were increased considerably, there would be no
change in the basic conclusions.

     It is concluded that the advent of all-year-round road
access between the Beni and the consuming centers will lead to
a rationalization of the meat trade based on road transport.
Cattle raising centers can be expected to concentrate around
the new road links with modern facilities for cattle slaughter-
ing and meat freezing.  These developments can be expected to
encourage the smaller farmers to merge operations with others.
Those based in remote areas and still dependent on the non-
regular services will find it hard to survive the competition
and the non-regular services can be expected to decline.

     Immedia te Actj_on on Non-regular Air Services - Although
the long term future is not secure, there is still an important
role to be played by these services over the next ten years;
perhaps longer if road development proceeds at a slower pace
than recommended by the Study.

     Complete modernization of the non-regular fleet by
replacing old aircraft with new or second hand turbo-props or
jets, is not feasible.  Suitable aircraft, such as the DHC-7
Buffalo DHC-SD or the HS 748, cost between five and eight
million dollars new and could not be competitive for the
current scale of operations. Few second hand aircraft would
be suitable, the most likely candidates being the F-27,
the CV 580, the Y8-]1 and the HS 748, which provide similar
capacity to the existing fleet.  However, the condition of
many of the runways in the Beni preclude the use of the F-27
and CV 580, which have problems with landing gear and gravel
kick-up into the engines. The YS-ll was only produced in small
quantities and availability is restricted.  The HS 748
which was successfully but temporarily operated in Bolivia some
years ago, is in great demand and the second hand price on the
world market is in the region of 1.2 million dollars. Operators
would find it difficult to bear suoh cost at present tariff
levels.  Therefore, it appears that the sector cannot contemplate
major fleet replacement with modern aircraft at the present time.

     In fact, there is no good reason why operators should not
continue to use most of the veteran aircraft currently in
service, with the possible exceptions of the very old C-46
and C-47s.  They are not inherently dangerous, provided they
are properly maintained, despite the poor accident record; on
the contrary, they are remarkably rugged and can operate from
poor landing strips with less problems than the more sophisticated
modern planes. Since these aircraft were built in large quan-
tities, spare parts are comparatively easily and cheaply
available through cannibalization, and this situation should
continue for the next 5 to 10 years.

     The current poor safety record is of concern and the
following actions are recommended:

       i)   Government should impose maintenance standards and
            ensure that these are adhered to through a system        "1

            of regular inspection.

                 This is perhaps easier said than done. At
            present, there is a lack of trained personnel to
            serve either as mechanics or as inspectors, and
            it must be a high government priority to set up
            adequate training facilities to correct this.




                           -332-
                       It can also be noted that stiffer air safety
                   requiremer.ts could lead to the phasing out of some
                   of the aircraft tYPEe currently in use ---
                   particularly the C-46 and C-47. An early regulation
                   to be introduced could be a ban on the import of
                   further aircraft of these types for operations,
                   permission only being granted for cannibalization
                   purposes.

             ii)   Reaarding flight practices, the installation of
                   non-directional beacons in Coroico and Caranavi,
                   and a VOR (1) in San Borja, combined with mandatory
                   flight procedures, would considerably facilitate
                   the present perilous crossing of the Cordillera
                   to La Paz and reduce the likelihood of accidents.
                   This is p~rt of the Air Navigation and Coron~nication
                   Equipment Plan which is discussed later in the
                   Chapter.
            iii)   Fundamental to the present problems of the sector
                   are the low tariffs and also the organizational
                   structure of the sector, with many small operators
                   without the capacity to raise the necessary capital
                   for modern aircraft. A revision of the tariff
                   structure and system of licensing to reduce the
                   number of operators could improve the situation
...                although growing competition from road transport
                   will probably undermine any major effort to
                   reorganize the sector.

                         Closely linked with the problem of tariffs is
                   the question of meat prices.    The non-regular air
                   services depend upon the profits from meat trade,
                   and yet meat prices are held low in the market
                   place by government. To some extent, the government
                   compensates operators by granting a fuel subsidy but
                   this is not altogether a satisfactory solution in
                   the long run, because i t tends to distort the
                   allocation of resources.    To a large extent, this
                   problem is bound up with the general strategy of
                   government to combat inflation and the simple
                   solution of just raising meat prices to an adequate
                   level is probably not acceptable.    In any case,
                   with the current lack of government control over the
                   non-regular air services, the result of a meat price
                   rise would probably be an increase in aircraft
                   operators profits, with no discernable change in
                   air safety standards (unless the rise in meat

     Conclusion on Non-regular Air Transport - There are no
easy solutions to the problems of the non-regular air services.
Government should impose more stringent controls on safety and
maintenance, but better training of maintenance and inspection
personnel is required to make such controls fully effective.
Implementation of the Air Navigation Plan should also improve
safety records. With more effective controls over this sector,
the government must also recognize the financial problems of
the operators and find a more lasting solution to the inter-        '"
connected problems of non-regular tariffs and market meat
prices than the current fuel subsidy. This, however, must
be part of the overall government strategy on the economy.
     In the long run, the non-regular services are likely to
decline with the improvement of road access to the northern
cattle raising regions. Therefore, major investments should
not be encouraged in this sector, and all investments
connected with air safety should be part of the overall need
to strengthen government control of the quality of aviation
services in Bolivia.


The Role of Air Taxis and Air Services to Small Communities
     As a result of the existence of large areas of the country
with little or no transport access by any other mode,
air plays an important part in promoting national integration.
The large numbers of widely distributed small communities makes
the provision of regular services to much of the country an
uneconomic proposition. In order to provide needed accessibility,
the government subsidizes services by LAB to the remote air-
ports in northern Beni, and encourages service by the military
airline TAM to isolated communities. In addition, there are
large numbers of air taxis operating mainly out of Santa Cruz
and Trinidad, with tariffs regulated by the central government.
      There has been substantial growth in the area of general
aviation in Bolivia in recent years; in 1971 there were 80 planes
registered; 180 in 1975; and an estimated 329 in 1980. Of
these, only some 10 percent are actually registered with the
DGTTA (2) as air taxis: in fact it is estimated by the Study that
this type of service is provi,ded by about 300 aircraft, i. e.
nearly 90 percent of the fleet. Of these 300 aircraft, about
180 are used for private purposes as well and 120 are devoted to
air taxi work.

       Government intervention in this sector should be restrict-
ed to control of safety and regulation of tariffs.    Improved
safety measures of two types are required:    one relating to
the aircraft and the other to the pilot. The present
maintenance schedules are adequate but the inspection system
needs more stringent. enforcement. The" airworthiness certif icate"
should be subject to annual review and the permission to
operate made dependent upon proof of adequate insurance coverage.
'l'he critical change that needs to be made in the regulation of
the sector is a much clearer distinction between those air-
craft which operate purely -privately and those which supply
a commercial passenger service. For the latter, much more
stringent regulations need to be applied, particularly with
respect to the licensing of pilots and provision of both
theoretical and practical flying time before being granted a
Commercial Pilot's License. All pilot licenses should be
subject to a stringent annual medical test.

     Regarding the current tariff levels, on the basis of an
analysis of operating costs carried out by the DGTTA, it would
appear that they are a little low.  However,the supply of
service argues the opposite, although as has been pointed out,
many operators provide air taxi service as an occasional
occupation, the main use of the aircraft being private.

      The question has been raised as to whether air taxi
services should be replaced in some areas by regular scheduled
services, or conversely whether the subsidized services of
LAB/TAM should be replaced by subsidized air taxis.   The
conclusion with regard to both possibilities is that neither
would be economically beneficial: the volumes carried by air
taxis at present are too low on individual routes to make
a regular scheduled service viable.   Similarly the volumes
carried by the scheduled services on present routes, although
well below the operating aircraft's capacity, are considerably
above the volumes that could be more economically carried by
air taxi.

     There is, however, a possible role for an intermediate
aircraft (such as the 20-seat Twin Otter) operating on routes
in the north and east of the country over the next two decades.
Such a service should be operated either by LAB or by an
independent airline with clearly coordinated schedules specific-
ally designed to feed the main routes.  It is recommended that
a detailed feasibility study be carried out of this type of
service. At present there is no aircraft offering capacity be-
tween the five-seat air taxi and the 36-seat F-27.

     The role of the air taxi is liable to decrease in relative
importance in the 1990s, as more road connections are made to
the remoter communities.  The long distances, however, indicat.e
there always will be substantial demands for this type of service.

Existing Airports and Improvements Proposed by AASANA

      Bolivia has over 600 airfields and landing strips through-
out the cC'tiIitry, ranging from earth strips subject to frequent
closure in t.hE' j'Cdr,y ~eason, to the international airports of
LaPaz, Cocnabamba and Santa Cruz. Six airports have paved
run"lRyS (t.h€ three international airports plus Tarija, Sucre
and Trinidad), and of these two are fully equipped for
instrument landings (La Paz and Santa Cruz). The present status
of the country's most important airports is shown in Table 14-1.

     Thirty three of the airports are ad:ministered by AASANA (3)       ,.
through managers of four districts, which are based on the major
traffic generating cities of La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and
Trinidad. The locations of those airports are shown in
Figure 14-4. The airports are classified by AASANA by the
aircraft most likely to use them -- allowable aircraft types
and present runway characteristics are indicated for each
airport in Table 14-1.

     The need for a National Airport Plan to direct and phase
the future development of the airport system is self evident
AASANA has proposed such a plan which envisages four levels of
commercial airports, defined as follows:

      First Level      Airports with paved runways capable of
                       accommodating at least a Boeing 727-200.

      Second Level -   Airports with gravel runways capable of
                       accommodating a Boeing 727-100.

      Third Level      Airports with gravel runways capable of
                       accommodating a Douglas DC 6B or a Hercules
                       C130.

      Fourth Level -   Airports with gravel runways capable of
                       accommodating an F27, and a Hercules C130
                       for special operations with load restrictions.

      Table 14-2 shows how AASANA proposed (4)to classify the thir-
ty-three airports under its jurisdiction. Nine level-one airports
are proposed which include the existing paved airports plus
Cobija, Puerto Suarez and Riberalta. Four level-two airports
are proposed at San Borja, Yacuiba, San Ignacio de Velasco and
Guayaramerln. These thirteen airports would be the centers for
future LAB jet operations.   Santa Ana, Potosl and Oruro would
make up level three and all other airfields would comprise level
four.

                                 -338-
          AASANA has proposed an investment plan for the next
    ten years based on the requirements to upgrade all the airports
    classified in levels one to three together with improvements to
    13 airports of the fourth level. The AASANA proposals are
    summarized in Table 14-3. The total cost of the AASANA plan
    would be over $b 10,000 million (1977) which would take up one
    third of the maximum budget available for transport investments
    in all modes over the next ten years, excluding additional
    investments required in new aircraft and the Air Navigation
    Plan.   It was concluded that such levels of investment in
    air transport could not be justified at the present time and,
    following the airport evaluations reported later in this
    chapter, a more modest plan is proposed.

         Before discussing the evaluations of individual airport
    improvements, some comment needs to be made on the status of
    the projects included in the World Bank Aviation project of
    1977. AASANA was to receive funds to assist with:

          (i)    the design and construction of two new domestic
                 airports (Riberalta and San Borja) and major
                 improvements at two others (Santa Ana and Tarija);
                 Santa Ana would have a sand asphalt sealed runway
                 while the other three would have asphaltic concrete
"                runways;

         (ii)    the provision of Navigational Aids and Communication
                 equipment at the project airports and a new country-
                 wide "Navaid and Communications" system;

        ( iii)   the provision of general maintenance equipment for
                 AASANA and special runway maintenance equipment for
                 Santa Ana airport;

         (iv)    the provision of technical assistance and staff
                 training for AASANAi and

          (v)    the provision of final design for the construction
                 of a new runway, apron and taxiways for Cochabamba
                 Airport (Jorge Wilsterman).

         By late 1980, only the paving of the runway at Tarija,
    the design studies for the new airports and for the improve-
    ments at Cochabamba, purchase of maintenance equipment, and
    part of the technical assistance program had been carried out.
    With regard to the individual project evaluations themselves,
    Table 14-4 shows the forecast of traffic volumes and costs
    made at the time of the World Bank loan, and later revised costs
    and observed traffic volumes. From these data it is clear
    that the projects should be re-evaluated.

      In addition, the extension to the runways at Cochabamba
 ($b 90 million) and La Paz  ($b 220 million) are said to be of
an emergency nature, and require immediate attention. Plans
have also been prepared for a new runway and terminal at
Cochabamba costing $b 1,400 million, although this project is not
contemplated for immediate construction. Hence, projects in
preparation or construction, together with urgent improvements,
total about $b 4,800 million. Of this, work has al,ready started
on pr9jects worth $b 2,120 million.   This represents a much more
intensive program of air infrastructure investment than
recently (an average of $b 80 million per year for the period
1973-1979). In view of the stringent limits on funds for
transport investment (see Chapter 18).   These projects were
reviewed by the Study to see whether the level and pace of
investment could be modified.

                               -342-
     Reassessment of Current Air Projects ~ The Navigation and
Communication Equipment Plan is strongly supported by the Study
and it is agreed that the works at Tarija and Trinidad should
be completed.  It is also agreed that the new airport at
Santa Cruz (Viru Viru) has been justified for urban planning
reasons, beyond the scope of this Study to inves gate.
Finally, the improvements at Potosi are designed to alleviate
conditions at what is currently a poor airport for such a
comparatively large (77,000 population) and isolated city,
and are accepted by the Study (these improvements are in any
case to be financed by local funds).

      There is also a strong committment on three of the other
airports listed. At Cobija, much work has been completed on
a new runway and further work is programmed for this year.
However, in order to even out the flow of investments in air
infrastructure, the majority of the work to complete this
airport has been scheduled for the period 1984-1986 in the
Investment Program. The World Bank is committed to part-
financing of Riberalta and in order to qualify for these funds,
this project should start soon.   It has been scheduled to be
com~lp.ted in the period 1984-1986.  Work has started at Puerto
SQarez~with Brazilian funds, and this is scheduled to be
completed in the next three years.

     The new runway and terminal at Cochabamba has been justi-
fied mainly on safety grounds -- the existing runway is badly
located with respect to both the surrounding hills and the city.
The funds for this project are included in the Investment Program
for the last period of the 1980's (85 percent of the project).

     There is some doubt about whether the runway repairs at
Santa Cruz (El Trompillo) are required and it is recommended
that this is re-examined further.  If really necessary, funds
must be taken from AASANA general funds.

     The sums allocated to Tarija are necessary to complete
the World Bank project. Further improvements could be allowed
in the last period, at the expense of postponing other projects

     Work at La Paz is postponed until the last part of the
decade. Although there are some restrictions in operations, it
is not clear whether additional runway length would solve the
problem, due to limits in wheel speeds.   It is in any case
recommended that a detailed evaluation of the La Paz project
is made before committments are made.

     The project at Guayaramerln is not considered necessary
with committment to Riberalta. Finally, it is recommended that
the projects at San Borja and Santa Ana de Yacuma are re-
examined. This is discussed in the following sections.

Evaluations of Major Airport Improvements                               ,~




     At the time that the Study conducted the evaluation of
airports, the main interest was in improving airports to
level-two (gravel runways to accommodate Boeing 727-100
passenger jets). Seven airports were investigated, as follows:


               •   Riberalta
                                                                        '.
               •   Guayaramerfn
               •   San Borja
               •   Yacuiba                                              '"

               •   San Ignacio de Velasco

               •   Santa Ana de Yacuma

               •   Concepci6n

     It was concluded that a level-two project as proposed by
AASANA (see Table 14-3) could be justified either for Riber-
alta or Guayaramerfn, but nowhere else. Therefore a lower level
of design with much reduced construction costs, but still suit-
able for a Boeing 727-100, was examined for each of these air-
ports.  The costs are as follows.:

With these costs, construction at Yacuiba could be justified in
1984, and possibly at San Borja in 1987.


     These results are not particularly satisfactory since they
indicate that little investment could be justified in airports
for the next ten years, apart 'from what is already committed.
This did not seem appropriate in view of the poor state of
airports in the remote regions of the country. Therefore, the
airports were reassessed to determine what improvements could be
made to the existing runway and facilities to allow adequate
operations. An airport rehabilitation plan is presented in the
next section.

An Airport Rehabilitation and Maintenance Plan

     A major change in priorities is recommended for AASANA.
Apart from the six existing paved airports, there are twenty
seven airfields under the control of AASANA, most of which are
in very poor condition, and some of which are dangerous (San
Borja for example). LAB have two F28 65-seat jet aircraft
on order, due to arrive in mid-1981, with which they plan to
replace some of the existing F27 turboprop services. At present,
the only airports they can use are the six paved airports,
which are already served by Boeing 727 jets.

     Based on a recent survey, it is believed that sixteen of
these twenty seven airports can be rehabilitated to
satisfactory standards for approximately $b 250 million -
about the cost of completing Puerto Suarez.  $b 81 million
pesos is to rehabilitate existing runways at the following
six airports to permit F28 operations:

    •   Guayaramerin             •   Santa Ana de Yacuma
    •   Camiri
                                 •   Yacuiba
    •   San Borja
                                 •   San Ignacio de Velasco

A further $b 76 million is required to rehabilitate runways
at ten smaller airports for F27 operations as follows:


    •   Apolo                    •   Robor~

    •   Ascensi6n de Guarayos    •   San Joaquin
    •   Concepci6n               •   San Matias
    •   Maqdalena                •   Villamontes
                                              ,
    •   Reyes
                                 •   San Jose de Chiquitos


Finally, $b 92 million is required to provide small terminals
and lighting (mainly for the six F28 airports) at all these
airports.

     The costs assumed at each airport are shown in Table 14-5
The costs at Reyes and San Joaquin are for the completion of
new runways, making use of partly completed, but abandoned,
works.

     It is emphasized that the costs in Table 14-5 are estimates
only, based on conversations with knowledgeable people, and
that a more detailed engineering estimate must be prepared for
each location.  It is accepted also that more detailed analysis
may result in a rather different selection of projects, based
on the needs of the different communities and of the operators.

     It is recommended that priority is given to runway
improvements in the period 1981-1983, with the highest
priority given to the runways for F28s. Work on terminals
and lighting, plus remaining runway improvements, can
follow in the second investment period 1984-1986.

     Technical Feasibility - Probably, the main technical
query on this program is whether it is, in fact, feasible
to improve airfield runways on the existing alignment. The
most doubt concerns the runways at San Borja and Santa Ana de
Yacuma and there appears to be a considerable difference of
opinion on this matter. AASANA have officially stated that a
new runway is required at both locations, basically because
of problems with flooding in the wet season. However, in
1980 the AASANA engineering department cooperated in making
estimates of improvements to these two runways, which implies
acceptance that such improvements are possible. Also, a
recent survey indicates that sufficient improvement can be
made to allow all-year-round operations.

     In defence of the improvements recommended at these two
airports, it is said that the runway at San Borja does not
get flooded but only become soft in the wet season. The
proposal is to place a compacted gravel surface to strengthen
the runway, which is expensive as the nearest source of gravel
is at ~10 Yacumo, some 55 km away. At Santa Ana de Yacuma,
about 400 meters at each end of the 1,600 m runway can become
flooded in the wet season, and therefore the proposal is to
raise each end of the runway, and then to place compacted gravel.

     Economic Evaluation - No formal evaluation has been under-
taken of each project since little reliable data is available on
the current operating conditions at each airport.  In global terms
though, the following calculations can be set out, based on
current delays to LAB F27 operations:

      Attainable F27 operating hours       1,500 hours per year (1)
      Actual operating hours               1,150 hours per year
      Loss per aircraft per year             350
      Aircraft in LAB fleet                    6
      Block hour cost                  $b 8,540
      Loss per year                    $b 17.9 million

(1)   Based on achievable operations in conditions prevailing in
        Bolivia.

     Almost all this benefit is due to the runway improvements,
giving a rate of return of 11.4 percent on this investment
($b 157.1 million). This rate of return could be increased
if benefits to other aircraft (TAM, TAB, non-regular, private)
were taken into account. A significant part of the total con-
struction cost is associated with terminal buildings, generat-
ing quite different benefits which are not quantified here.



                          -347-
     Airport Maintenance - Parallel witb this upgrading and
rehabilitation work, it is recommended that an airport
maintenance plan be prepared with urgency. Current maintenance
outside the airports with paved runways is almost non-existent,
and it is for this reason that many airfields are in poor
condition.  In fact, the rehabilitation plan outlined above,
could rightly be described as a deferred maintenance operation.

     The World Bank Aviation Project of 1978 included
equipment for maintenance, in two parts:

    (i)   General equipment for maintaining gravel runways,
          intended to be rotated around the different AASANA
          airports.  It is said that this equipment is
          currently being used for light construction work,
          and that the planned maintenance program using this
          equipment has not yet been implemented.

   (ii)   Specialized equipment to maintain the sealed asphalt
          runway specified for Santa Ana. Although this
          runway has not been constructed, the maintenance
          equipment was purchased and is now kept at Trinidad
          airport.

      It is clear that more serious attention must be paid to
maintenance requirements than in the past.   In the Investment
Program the following sums have been allowed for each
airport type:

          Level   one     $b 3.3 million per airport per year
          Level   two        2.0
          Level   three      0.8
          Level   four       0.5

     Implementation - In order to prepare the rehabilitation plan
and a proper maintenance program, it is strongly recommended
that a special survey be undertaken with expert assistance.
It is thought that this could be a similar project, but on a
smaller scale, to the current World Bank financed Pilot
Maintenance Study for highways.

Recommended National Airport Plan

         This section brings together the results of the analyses,
and present recommendations for each airport.

         The Study generally agrees with the four levels of airport
proposed by AASANA, presented earlier in this chapter. However,
level three should be redefined to include airports for F28
operations (but the desirable runway lengths remain as defined
in Table 14-3). Also, projects for level-two airports (gravel
runways suitable for Boeing 727-100s) should be postponed until
the end of the 1980s.

                             -348-
         The allocation of airports to each category recommended
by the Study is rather different from that proposed by AASANA
a~d presented earlier in Table 14-2.  The study proposals are
summarized below, together with a descriptlon of the airport
levels:

Level One   - With paved runways suitable for Boeing 727-200 or
              heavier. Apart from the committed project
              Cobija, Riberalta and Puerto Suarez, there does
              not seem any good reason to add to the six
              airports already in this category: La Paz,
              Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Trinidad, Sucre and Tarija.
              Passenger demand is not sufficient to justify
              including more, and these nine airports (with the
              committed projects) provide sufficient alternatives
              to each other .

Level Two   - With gravel runways suitable for Boeing 727-100.
              These airports will serve to extend the main LAB
              jet services to the remote regions of the country
              and could eventually include Riberalta or Guayaramerin,
              Yacuiba and possible San Borja.
              These are not considered as priority projects
              compared with the Airport Rehabilitation Plan. There-
              fore the four airports just specified should be class-
              ed as level three for the immediate future.

Level Three- With gravel runways suitable for F28 passenger
             jets and Hercules C130 operations. They should
             include Guayaramerfn, Santa Ana de Yacuma, San
             Borja, San Ignacio de Velasco, Camiri, Yacuiba,
             Potosi and possibly Oruro.

Level Four - With gravel runways suitable for F27 and for special
             operations of the Hercules C130 (with limited loads).

     The recommendations for each airport are shown in Figure
14-5 and each airport is discussed individually below.
    La Paz - A master plan has been prepared for the existing
airport at El Alto which includes lengthening the runway 200
meters, extending the terminal and apron, building a taxiway
paralle: to the main runway and relocating the non-regular
opera~ions area.   Total costs are estimated at $b 590 million
(1971).   It is said that these improvements will relieve several
operating problems. An economic analysis is required of these
improvements to determine economic feasibility and priorities;
this applies specially to the parallel taxiway which AASANA
claim is required to relieve congestion at peak times.
For investment planning purposes, it is assumed that these
improvements can be justified, although national investment
restrictions will delay these improvements until late in the
1980s.

    The need for a new location for an airport is not apparent
and in any case must be preceeded by a detailed study.

    Cochabamba - The present runway (04/22) of 2,650 meters
has an effective operating length of only 2,000 meters which
is insufficient for safe B-727 operation at full load. An
extension of 500 meters has been proposed, which necessitates
diversion or piping of the Tamborada River. The estimated cost
of this project is $b 90 million (1977), including purchase of
the necessary land, drainage and lighting. The justification
of this project is on grounds of aircraft safety and is supported
by the Study.

    A much bigger project, said to be justified on grounds of
urban safety, is the construction of a new runway (13/31) and
terminal at Cochabamba estimated at $b 1,400 million (1977). (5).
Funding limits postpone this project until the late 1980s and
the size of investment would require funding from outside
AASANA. About 85 percent of this project has been included
in the investment program for the period 1987-1990.

    Santa Cruz - A new international airport is under construc-
tion at Viru Viru to replace the existing airport of E1 Trompi110.
An investment of $b 1,430 million (1977) is involved (of which
$b 140 million has already been spent) and the new airport will
become the focus of international op~rations in Bolivia. The
project has been justified on the grounds of urban environment
and safety and, as such, lies outside the scope of this Study.
Nonetheless, if, as appears to be the case, AASANA is to be
responsible for amortizing the cost of the investment, this
airport project may affect the amount of morley likely to be
available for other projects in the next decade. It is strongly
recommended that AASANA should not be responsible for this
financial burden. It is noted also that the 1977 World Bank
Aviation Project Loan specifically requires that AASANA should
not be responsible for financing Viru Viru if this prevents them
from complying with the financial covenants of the 1977 loan
agreement.  It would appear that this condition has been
ignored (see Chapter 17).

    In addition to Viru Viru, AASANA c1aims-that$b 25 million
are necessary to rehabilitate the runway of E1 Trompi110, which
is in the last three years of its useful life before Viru Viru
opens.  It seems suprising that such extensive repairs arp.
required (overlaying with 4 cm of asphalt) for such a short time,
and it is recommended that this be investigated further.    If
necessary, this work should be funded from the sum included in
the Investment Program for AASANA general costs.

(5)   The justification of this project is outside the scope of the
      Study so it was not evaluated.    It has been commented that
      were LAB to move their maintenance base from Cochabamba
      (perhaps to Viru Vj.ru) , then the new runway would not be
      required.

    Trinidad - Work has already started on improvements to
the runway    a cost of $b 70 million (1977). These are clearly
necessary since the poor state of the runway caused LAB to
suspend jet operations on some occasions in 1980.

    The AASANA proposal for a new airport to avoid flooding
and poor soil conditions at the current site must be preceeded
by a study; until then a new airport cannot be supported.

    Sucre - This is a new airport completed in 1977 with a
concrete paved runway. The suggestion that major new investments
are required already, including the possibility of
relocating the runway, is incredible. A much better case must
be made before even a study would be warranted.

    Tarija - It is estimated that $b 50 million are required
to finish the World Bank project for this airport and these
funds have been taken to be committed. Further investments
to extend the runway cannot be justified for commercial operations.

    Cobija - $b 90 million have already been spent at Cobija
on the base for a new runway.  It is accepted that the project
should be treated as committed, and completed for the estimated
$b 260 million.

    Riberalta - A design has been prepared for a new level one
airport, costing an estimated $b 427 million and this is taken
to be committed.

     Guayaramerfn - A new runway has been partly completed some
7 km from the present site, but work has now stopped because of
the wet season and also because of lack of funds.  It is
recommended that this work be discontinued and that resources be
concentrated in rehabilitating the existing airport for F28
operations for an estimated cost of $b 15 million.

    Yacuiba - Improvements are recommended to upgrade to a
level-three airport in the period 1981-1983 for F28 operations.
Investment costs are estimated to be low at $b 21 million, due
to the good layout of the existing airport and the proximity of
suitable gravel.  It is probable that, for little additional
cost, this airport could be upgraded to level-two, suitable for
Boeing 727-100 operations, but the need for this would depend
on the requirements of LAB.

    Santa Ana de Yacuma - Improvements estimated at about
$b 30 million are recommended to upgrade to level-three suitable
for F28s.  The main work would involve raising the level of each
end of the runway above flood levels, and placing a compacted
gravel surface.

    San Borja - Improvements to level-three are recommended on
the existing site, costing an estimated $b 35 million. The main
expense is associated with bringing gravel from Rio Yacuroo for
a new gravel surface on the runway.
                                                                          J
    San Ignacio de Velasco - Improvement to level-three is
recommended, at an estimated cost of $b 19 million.

    Camiri - Improvement to level three is recommended at an
estimated cost of $b 21 million.

    Oruro - The existing airport runway is restricted by urban
developments at one end and high tension cables at the other.
It is unlikely that paving the runway could be justified since
                                                                          J
major growth is not expected. More detailed studies are required
before either improvement or relocation could be justified and
such studies are recommended.

    Potosi - Work has already started on relevelling the
existing runway. Local funds of $b 50 million have been
allocated by CORDEPO to complete this work to permit F 28
operations.

    Puerto Suarez - A $b 250 million project funded by Brazil
has recently started and this is taken to be committed.

    Level-Four Airports - Estimates totalling $b 109 million
were presented earlier for works at ten level-tour airports
to improve F27 operations, they are as follows:                           It"~
                                                                          !IIi

    These airports were selected on the basis of the air model
passenger estimates (see earlier), population and regional
distribution.  It is accepted that a more detailed airport
plan prepared in accordance with the needs of the communities
and the operators, may lead to some changes in airport selection.

    Investment Plans - Funds for investment in transport
infrastructure are expected to be restricted in the early years
of the 1980s, partly because of the economic difficulties of
the country and partly because of commitments to many transport
projects made in the late 1970s which are now in construction
(see earlier).  In particular, Viru Viru Airport will require
substantial funds for the first three years of the 1980s which
must inevitably affect availability of funds for other air
projects.

    It is recommended that the highest priority be given to
the preparation and implementation of an airport rehabilitation
and maintenance plan, since this is expected to have the most
dramatic impact on airport accessibility and operational reliability.

    The investment program is set out in detail in Chapter 18,
but the priorities for airport investment are summarized below:

Analysis of Air Navigation and Communication Equipment Plan

    The very poor safety record exhibited by the air sector
in Bolivia, while largely attributable to the equipment and
maintenance practices of the non-regular and general aviation
operators, is also due to the grave lack of air navigation




                             -353-
                                                                    •
aids throughout the country. This lack also contributes to
poor schedule regularity and loss of flying time on the part
of the regular sector.

    The Bolivian Air Navigation and Communication Equipment
Plan was formally adopted by the Ministry of Transport, Commun-
ications and Civil Aeronautics in October 1977. Under the terms
of the World Bank loan referred to above, funds were provided
for the purchase and installation of new communications and
navigation aids for Bolivia's principal airports:   the Bank's
recommendations, supported by ICAO, formed the basis of the
Air Navigation Plan, drawn up by AASANA. As yet, however, none of
the equipment has been purchased or installed as a result of
administrative delays.   In the interim, costs have risen
substantially and AASANA has offered to be responsible for the
installation and maintenance of the navigational aids (NAVAIDS)
in order to reduce the cost of the program. A phased plan for
installation    urgently required, giving priority to the areas
of greatest need, in particular major airports with presently
inadequate landing aids.

         The conclusions and recommendations of the Study with
respect to the Air Navigation and Communication Equipment Plan
(summarized in Table 14-6) are as follows:

    (i)   The plan is adequate overall to achieve its purpose
          of providinq minimum desirable facilit s for 38
          airports. Il is essential that the plan is imple-
          mented withc~t further delay. Continual modifica-
          tion to the plan is probably contributing to the delay
          and it would be better if the plan is implemented
          as it stands with further modificaticu made afterwards.

   (ii)   Efforts should be made to reduce costs by using LAB
          equipment and crew to conduct the proving tests.

  (iii)   Priorities need to be established.   The following are
          the most critical areas:

          (a) At Cochabamba, where the pilots of passenger
              jets frequently align themselves during run-
              way approach on the city's street lights, new
              and dependable NDB's (Non-Directional Beacons)
              are required along with VASIS (Visual Approach
              Slope Indicator System).  It is not recommended
              that an ILS (Instrument Landing System) be
              installed due to topography and flight procedure
              contraints; beacons should be placed upon the
              surrounding peaks. The navigation plan should be
              modified accordingly.

                  should take priority. The NAVAIDS presently
                  installed at El Trompillo are not operational.
                  Priority should be given to putting this equip-
                  ment into service, pending the completion of
                  the new facility at Viru Viru. At that time         •
                  it is proposed to move this ILS installation
                  to the new Viru Viru airport so that both run-
                  way approaches will be provided with ILS instal-
                  lations. At present night landing and daylight
                  operations during conditions of low ceilings
                  and heavy rain are difficult except at La Paz.
                  Constraints due to night flights and poor
                  weather seriously affect aircraft utilization
                  and passenger convenience (LAB estimates a loss
                  of $b 7.5 million a year). The NAVAIDS program
                  should facilitate night services and poor
                  weather operations to Cochabamba and Santa Cruz.
                  It is desirable to provide for poor weather
                  operations at Trinidad and Tarija as well. Should
                  financing of the entire package prove difficult,
                  the NDB program should be given priority.

Evaluation of Plans for LAB

     As is the case with virtually all airlines in the world,
LAB has suffered from the general recession and major rises in
wages and fuel prices:  the present financial position of the
airline is gloomy. LAB's domestic operation must be classified
as a low-density, short-haul service in comparison with many
other nations. The service between the six major cities of La
Paz, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, Trinidad, Sucre and Tarija is
reasonably successful,with load factors averaging over 65 percent.

     The same cannot be said of the secondary route services
provided by F-27 prop-jet aircraft, many of which operate at a
loss, despite an average load factor of 67 percent. The reasons
for this are the lack of passenger density in the smaller com-
munities served, the related infrequency of scheduled service
by the prop-jet fleet (which serves most of these cities with
only two flights per week), and the high cost of operating these
aircraft from inadequate airfields. To these must be added the
artificially low tariffs which receive further discussion in
Chapter 17. There is also the problem of the non-daily
schedules of the F-27 which can at times deposit an unexpected
group of passengers on already fully-booked flights: this can
be alleviated by better ground and air communications allowing
for schedule and equipment adjustments when needed.




                              -356-
    The plans for LAB's internal service in the future, center
around the extension of jet service to local airports currently
served by F-27s; namely Yacuiba, Guayaramerfn, Riberalta, Santa
Ana de Yacuma, San Borja, Camiri and San Ignacio de Velasco,
linking in turn with improved feeder services. However,
jet aircraft are only cost effective if sufficient volumes
exist to achieve a reasonable load factor.  The projections of
the air model indicate that demand on these routes will reach
sufficient levels to justify jet service throughout the 1980s;
introduction of such service needs to be phased as demands grows.
Two 65 seat F28 jets are reported to be on order for delivery
mid-198l, to start these services.

    LAB needs to consider within the decade replacement·
aircraft for its existing jet fleet of Boeing 727s. As inter-
national demand grows it may become desirable to invest in larger
planes -- perhaps wide-bodied jets -- in order to compete with
other international operators. This is unlikely to be necessary
before 1985 at the earliest.

    A similar problem facing LAB in the more immediate future
is the replacement of its present prop-jet fleet of F-27s,
which are nearing the end of their life. The airline has an
investment of US $ 2.2 million in the fleet and would require
at least US $ 14 million for replacement aircraft. While the
present F-27s have high operating costs due to high maintenance
costs and down-time, the airline will not benefit significantly
from aircraft renewal since the savings in operating costs will
be offset by the debt service on the new investment. Nonetheless
there will be benefits to the users with improved aircraft
availability.

    The two F28 jets on order are effectively F-27 replacements
but whether further aircraft of this type are needed is open
to question.  It would probably be better to replace the re-
maining F-27 fleet with a modern turbo-prop such as the DASH-7.
Consideration should also be given to a mixed fleet (of, for
example, the 50-seat DASH-7 with the 20-seat Twin Otter)
to allow for scheduling flexibility and responsiveness to
fluctuations in demand. The ability of these aircraft to
operate from poor landing strips with minimal maintenance
requirements makes them ideal candidates for operation in
Bolivia.

    Turning to LAB's international services, the picture is
grim; the patronage of Miami and Lima services has declined
in the early months of 1980, leading to a reduction in
the frequency of flights to the United States. LAB has been
hampered in developing this traffic by its former lack of
membership in lATA (6) and a very limited network of offices
throughout the world.  International route systems can only

(6)   International Air Transport Association.

                          -357-
grow as the result of bilateral agreements; thus attention
needs to be given to determining the proper approaches t o .
expansion in this area. However, the present outlook for this
industry as a whole is unpromising and it is unlikely that
any major expansion of international service can take place in
the next five years. Any expansion that does occur needs to
be coordinated with a major effort on the part of the tourist
industry to stimulate interest in Bolivia. Of present visitors
to Bolivia, only a small percentage go beyond La Paz and Santa
Cruz to the cities of the interior. Significant growth of
tourist traffic also should benefit LAB's international service.
    LAB has very recently been admitted as a full member of
lATA. Achievement of this step should significantly increase
traffic on existing routes and bring other substantial benefits.
No major route expansion can be realistically envisaged in the
short term, but attention could be given to renegotiating the
existing agreements that limit operations (for example, LAB
cannot operate direct flights to the USA or elsewhere through
Lima). Purchase of aircraft should then be dependent on the
prospective growth in international passengers.
    The third area of LAB operations that requires comment
is the cargo service. While, as will be discussed in Chapter
15, it does not seem desirable for LAB to invest in a B747
aircraft given the uncertainty of international market .
prospects and the capital costs involved, nonetheless there
does seem scope for expansion of freight operation. At present
the airline operates one Boeing 707 exclusively for freight. The
present low market price of similar aircraft and the undoubted
growth in the world market for air freight would seem to
indicate that the purchase of a second aircraft and the
expansion of this service would be a worthwhile development.
     At present, international air freight transport is also
provided by the military organization TAB (Bolivian Air Transport)
which operates two Hercules freighters. These exist primarily
to supply the need of the military installations internally,
but,'are also available for charter. Thus they are competing with
LAB freight operations to some degree. However, the two should
be able to coexist -- LAB would provide scheduled freight service
(which would need to be combined with a vigorous marketing policy)
while TAB should restrict its operations to occasional exceptional
demands for bulk transport. On no account should TAB, with the
majority of its costs underwritten by the government, be
permitted to undercut LAB in competition for the same market.

The Potential for Air Mass Transit
    The large rises in fuel costs experienced in the last
decade have led to a revival of interest in the concept of
lighter-tahn-air transport, based upon the airship or dirigible.
The attraction of these craft lies in their much lower fuel
consumption (about 60 percent of that of fixed wing craft,
and 50 percent of that of helicopters) and their low requirement
for ground facilities (only short runways or no runways at all
are needed).

    There is potential for their future use in Bolivia in
transporting meat and perhaps timber from the more inaccessible
areas of the Beni to the markets in La Paz and elsewhere, and
also in longer-haul transport to international ports (Buenos
Aires, Manaus, Caracas, Santos). However, the state-of-the-art
regarding dirigibles is not far advanced. The developments that
have received most attention and are being applied commercially
are for the most part substitutes for helicopters or tethered
balloons, with some short-haul transport application. Dirigibles
are being used at present in logging, observation, off-shore
oil-rig operations, bridge building and similar tasks where
awkward heavy cargoes are involved. There at present seems
considerable doubt over the commercial prospects of the air-
ship for long-haul freight usage. The main problem is that,
because of their slow speeds, the airships are likely to be
only about half as productive as large freight aircraft, on
an annyal basis. As a result, the cost of capital plays a
very important part in overall operating costs, and it has
been estimated by the World Bank that the airship is truly
competitive only at distances of over 6,500 km.

     Only one company is actually making a commercial long-
haul freight dirigible at present. A contract has recently
been signed to supply a British freight operator with four
craft at a cost of US $ 9.5 million each.   It is claimed that
the craft, which cruise at 138 km/hour, have operating costs
slightly less than those of a Boeing 747 while offering 56
percent greater volume but a considerably reduced payload
 (58 tons).  It remains to be seen whether or not such
claims can be realized in practice.
    The conslusion of the Study regarding the use of lighter
than air transport in Bolivia is that the potential certainly
exists for use in the Beni for both short and long
haul services. The road network in the region is likely to
remain sparse for the next twenty years and the airship offers
a direct route with low variable operating costs. However,
the feasibility of the entire project depends upon the craft
being available at an economic cost. It is therefore recom-
mended that a detailed study be undertaken in about five years




                         -359-
(1985), when the situation regarding rhese craft should be
much clearer. With the current lack of construction,
maintenance and operational data, it is too early to draw firm
conclusions and make specific recommendations.

Conclusions and Recommendations on the Air Sector

    The air sector in Bolivia has played, and will continue
over the next twenty years to play, a very important role in           •
the development of the nation. After a period of neglect,
successive Governments have recognized the importance of the
sector and aided its growth through fiscal policies. However,
the sector as a whole is at a critical point at the present time;
both passenger services and freight transport are suffering
from unnecessarily high operating costs resulting from
inadequate infrastructure and equipment. The growth in general
avaition has raised a new problem of adequate control of
safety and regulation of air taxi operation. The quality of
service offered to passengers in other than main cities is not
good with frequent delays and cancellations through bad
weather or unserviceable runways.  The accident record of the sector
as a whole is poor.

    Financially the main passenger carrier LAB is currently
running at a loss, and the non-regular freight sector made up
of 25 operators is unable to finance its fleet replacement.
The institution responsible for the infrastructure of the
airport system, AASANA is in a similar position.

    In order to remedy the deficiencies of the existing
situation and provide a firm basis for the development of the sector
over the next two decades, the recommendations of the Study
are as follows:

         (i) The highest priority should be given to an
             airport rehabilitation and maintenance plan,
             which should probably be prepared with expert
             technical assistance. This could vastly improve
             operating conditions at about sixteen
             secondary airports.

        (ii) The Air Navigation and communication Equipment
             Plan should be implemented as soon as possible.
             Priority should be given to major airports and
             to the installation of NDB's (Non Directional
             Beacon).

       (iii) Better regulation of aircraft and safety standards
             is required in the non-regular sector.  To a
             large extent, this is a long term problem




                         -360-
        since proper inspection and training procedures
        must follow improvement in training facilities
        for inspectors as well as mechanics. The recently
        created Air Ministry regards this as a priority
        and this is strongly supported by the Study.

 (iv)   The structure and organization of the non-regular
        air sector would be helped by stricter licensing
        and revision to the tariff and fuel subsidy.  In
        the long run, though, the future of this part of the
        air sector is likely to be undermined by the
        development of the road system in the Beni.

  (v)   Greater control needs to be exercised over the
        licensing of airplanes and pilots providing
        air-taxi service.         .

 (vi)   Apart from the F28 passenger jets on order, LAB
        should consider replacing its F-27 fleet with
        aircraft of mixed size (Twin Otter/DASH-7). An
        expansion of scheduled freight operations should
        be pursued.

(vii)   Regarding lighter-than-air transport, further
        study is required in the mid-1980s to determine
        whether this mode can fulfill its potential role
        as a short and long haul transport carrier in
        Bolivia.

IMPROVEMENT TO
INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT LINKS
     Bolivia, as a landlocked country with a limited domestic
market, of necessity places great importance on her links to
the outside world. In this chapter, the nature of these links
is described, and a number of projects, designed to lower the
costs of reaching the world market, are evaluated.
     In order to carry out a reasonable analysis of the indi-
vidual projects, it was necessary to investigate the likely de-
velopment of Bolivia's fqreign trade over the next 20 years,
and the probable use of the transport links. The basic pro-
cedure that was followed is summarized below.
Transport Analysis of Foreign Trade
     For the purpose of determining future trade developments,
Bolivia was divided into 16 internal districts, and the rest of
the world into 15 external zones. Major trading partners of
Bolivia were allocated a zone each; other, less important coun-
tries were amalgamated for the purpose of the analysis. Then,
on the basis of historical experience, combined with knowledge
of likely development projects in the inter~al districts, trade
movements between Bolivia and the rest of the world were pro-
jected for each of 10 commodity groups. These projections were
reconciled with the overall forecasts of consumption and pro-
duction for the internal zones, as described in Chapter 7.
Particular account was taken of national intentions and various
interna tional agreements such as those of the Andean Pact. The re-
sulting foreign trade pattern is shown in Table 15-1. Overall,
the total of imports and exports is expected to more than double
by 1969 and to more than triple by 1999.

      The next step was to allocate these generalized flows to
 particular modes and corridors. Once again, historical ex~
perience. was the deciding factor in the distribution: detailed
 knowledge of foreign trade movements was obtained for 1977 from
 ENFE and INE data tapes and from the results of the roadside
 interview survey. A similar pattern was assumed to apply to the
 flows projected for 1989 and 1999, except where significant
changes in the infrastructure had been assumed. Thus in the
case of the 1989 Test Network which includes the rail intercon-
nection between Cochabamba and Santa Cru~ :(not recommended by
the Study in the 1980s), the distribution of flows is assumed to
change significanbly, as imports to and exports from the Santa
Cruz region will switch from the Atlantic ports to the nearer
Pacific ones. In all cases, flows were assumed to follow the
minimum cost route, unless extraneous factors of capacity or
policy overrode this criterion.

existr the impact of the rail interconnection can be seen in
equivalent tables in Appendix 9B. The use of the various modes
and the changes expected to take place in the distribution bet-
ween them have been discussed in Chapter 9.
Connections between Bolivia and Ocean Ports
     Apart from air transport, ports on the Atlantic and the
Pacific Oceans are used for Bolivia's foreign trade with na-
tions outside South America. In the base year, significant
volumes of cargo moved through the: following six ports: San-
tos in Brazil, Rosario and Buenos Aires in Argentina, Arica
and Antofagasta in Chile, and Matarani in Peru. In 1977 over
65 percent of Bolivia's exports passed through the Pacific
ports, and 55 percent of imports (by weight). Of the Pacific
ports,Matarani.. handled 22 percent of exports (mainly minerals)
and 14 percent of imports. The Chilean ports handled the re-
maining cargo, with Antofagasta being the most important with
25 percent of imports and over 36 percent of exports. 110 at
present handles little or no Bolivian cargo.
     The point of interest in this chapter, however, is not
the ports themselves, but Bolivia's connections to them. These
are shown in Figure 15-1 and Table 15-4 indicates the
distances of the existing links from major cities within Boli-
via to the important ports, by rail and road. At present the
great bulk of cargo moves by rail, partly for the reason that
no good road alternatives exist and partly due to the definite
advantages rail offers on such long hauls. The existing links
to each of the ports can be briefly described as follows:
     Santos - Since there 'is at present only very poor road access
from Santa Cruz to the Brazilian border, most Bolivian traffic to
and from Santos and other Brazilian cities uses the railroad.
There exists the potential for the operation of "piggy-back"
services between Santa Cruz and Corumb~ since road connections
in Brazil are mostly good, but at present this is not being
done (see later in this Chapter). The northern towns of
Cobija, Guayaramerln and Riberalta are directly connected to
the Brazillian road system, and there are some imports by truck
from Sao Paulo and Santos.
     Rosario and Buenos Aires - Road transport takes place
all the way from Bermejo and Tarija to these ports but is re-
latively costly. There are good rail connections th~~ugh
Villaz6n and Yacuiba, making rail the preferred mode of trans-
port to and from the Argentinian ports.

     Antofagasta - Access is almost impossible by road and
only about 260 km of the 1,214 krn frornL~.Paz are paved.
Good service is provided by the Antofagasta Railway which carries
nearly all the cargo moving through this port.
     Arica ~ Access is possible by both road and rail, although
only 160 kID of the 581 km road from La Paz are paved. The rail-
road service is poor, due to the poor state of the track
on both sides of the border, and also tGlaek of equip-
ment in the Chilean sector. The Chilean railroad restricts
movements of Bolivian imports to only 7,000 tons per month.
     Matarani - Again both road and rail connections exist with
this Peruvian port. Rail access at present involves a shipping
link on Lake Titicaca between Guaqui and Puno, where cargo trans-
fers to the Peruvian railroads. These are.unable to meet exist-
ing demand at present for lack of traction and rolling stock.
Road access is poor, involving a journey of 737 km over roads
which are, for the most part, in extremely poor condition. The
road access is further complicated by the large number of checks
and controls existing on this route, and restrictions on night
travel.
     llo - Only road access exists to this little used port,
but roads are in poor condition and are subject to interruption
in the rainy season. However, the route llo-La Paz is much
shorter than that from Matarani.
     There thus exists considerable potential for improving
Bolivia's access to the ocean ports. The individual projects
for improvement are now considered individually.


Use Of The Paraguay River

      The Paraguay River, which touches the Bolivian frontier in
the southeastern corner of the country at ,Puerto Busch is a
potentially important internati.onal route for goods tr~nsport ..
Figure 15-2 shows eXist~g and possible land connections with
the r~ver, and with the nearby iron ore mine of Mut6n.
      The Paraguay River offers-- the::':posSibillty of river trans-
port to Rosario, Buenos Aires or the Uruguayan deep-water port
of Nueva Palmira, for transshipment to ocean-gOing vessels, or
to the steel works at San Nicol§s in~Argentina. 'For traffic
originating in the east of Santa Cruz department, this route
wo~ld be considerably cheaper than the alternatives by road or
ra~l.   At present, the volume of Bolivian traffic using the
river is small, consisting of about 50,000 tons of Mut6n iron
ore per year, small quantities of timber for export, and some
limited import flows transferring to the railroad at Ladario.

     The prospect of large exports of iron and manganese from
Mut6n, and also of frozen meat and agricultural products from
                            -369-
                                                                       •

future developments in the Tucavaca valley and eastern Chiqui-         .,
tos Province, opens up the need for more efficient transport
facilities on the Paraguay River. At present the output from
Mutun is small, and the large area of agricultural potential
north of the railroad line is almost completely uninhabited
and inaccessible, but estimates of future annual exports from
the region are in excess of one million tons of either processed
iron pellets or unprocessed iron ore, as well as large quanti-
ties of agricultural produce including meat. Certainly the
production potential is there, given the necessary labor and
infrastructure, but markets must be found, and they can only
be abroad. An inexpensive and efficient transportation corri-
dor down the Paraguay River is important and probably essential
to the development of the whole area, for both iron and agri-
culture.

     The Paraguay River is already navigated to Corumb~ by
barge trains with capacities of up to 9,000 tons during high
water. In places dredging is desirable, with most of the
recorded locations with low water (48 out of 51} located in
tlie 900 Ian section down-stream. of Puerto Busch. The cost of
dredging these 900 km has been estimated at $b 860 million;
however, since the river is navigated by sizeable boats at
present, the need to dredge is not seen as a high priority
for tlielimited volumes envisaged in the immediate future.

     There are three ports currently available for Bolivia, but
all are located in Brazil: Corumb~, Ladario and Puerto Esperanza.
Puerto Su&rez, located in the C&ceres Lagoon in Bolivian territory,
is no longer usable due to lack of water. A simple landing facil-
ity exists at Puerto Busch which can be use~ to assist in loading
and unloading minerals, but there is no land access in times of high
water. Of the Brazilian ports, Ladario is the most attractive with
rail access, modern loading facilities and ample room for expansion.

     A New River Port in Eastern Bolivia - It has long been an
aim of Bolivia to construct a new port for the Paraguay River
within Bolivian territory. There are two obviouS locations to
ohoose from;  Puerto Busch and Quijarro. At once, three major
issues can be identified, all of which should influence the
final choice:

      (i)   Technical - C~n a port be built successfully at each
            location? The problem at Puerto Busch is possible
            flooding and the problem at Quijarro is the converse
            -- possible lack of water in some dry seasons.

     (ii)   Economic - Assuming a port can be built at either
            location, what are the comparative costs? Access to
            the ports by land must be taken into account and
            consideration must be given to both the initial
            capital costs, and the operating costs thereafter.

     (iii)   Political - This concerns the interpretation of, and
                        with, agreements, statements and princi-
             ples covering the use and regulation of international
             rivers (rivers passing through several countries).
             This matter could be complex in the case of Quijarro.

     The following summarizes the features of a new port at each
location:


     Puerto Busch - The side lies 245 km downriver from Quija-
rro, but it also 1 s 107 kID from the source of iron ore at
Mutun and 133 km from Motacucito, the point on the existing
rail line from Santa Cruz to Corumb~ from which all general
cargo would have to be transported. In times of high water,
this region is flooded to a depth of 2 to 3 me,ters, and flood
waters can extend as far north as the region of MutUn (San Ju~n).

     Land would have to be reclaimed for a port site, and a road
or railroad would have to be constructed from Mutun on a high
embankment. A road, being much wider than a single-track rail-
road, would be more costly to build and also imply much higher
operating costs that would be possible with unit trains for
iron ore.  In view of the high road costs involved, the evalua-
tion of a port site at Puerto Busch assumed the connection to be
by rail.

      Quij'arro - In order to locate a port at Quijarro, dredging
is needed along the Tamengo Channel which joins it to the
Paraguay River. A rail connection from Mutun to Motacucito
 (26 km) would also probably be required. An alternative pos-
sibility would be a conveyor system, but this would cost about
$b 500 million to install for the 44 km between Mutun and Qui-
jarro, and would not be economically feasible at the volumes
contemplated.     (A conveyor system would not be suitable for
Puerto Busch, because of the need to carry general cargo along
this link). A rail connection would also serve to carry minerals
from Mutun to Santa Cruz for domestic consumption. No special
facility would be needed for general cargo.

     A disadvantage of Quijarro is that traffic would have to
travel through Brazilian territory for most of the 245 km to
Puerto Busch. Also, navigation in this stretch of the river
is impeded by the narrow spans of the rail bridge at Puerto
Experanza, which makes it necessary for barge trains to break
apart and reassemble, an operation which is said to last four
hours (although a maximum of 24 hours has also been quoted).
There is also the structure of an overhead water supply at the
entrance to the Temengo Channel, but this does not seem to
be a major obstacle to navigation. Quijarro, being further up-
stream than Puerto Busch, and therefore with a greater river
distance, would require a larger river fleet, although this dis-
advantage is off-set by the additional rail equipment require-
ments for Puerto Busch. A disadvantage of Quijarro is the risk
of lack of water in the Tamengo 'Channel in periods of low water,
but whether this would be the case after dredging is uncertain.

                             -371-
     Conclusions on a Paraguay River Port - Given the severe
restrictions on investment in transport infrastructure (see
Chapter IS), construction of a new port on the Paraguay River
probably could not be contemplated for the volumes of Bolivian
traffic currently using the river. Although there is a great
potential for agricultural exports from eastern Santa Cruz
Department, they are unlikely to increase greatly over the
next few years, and can continue to use the Brazilian ports of               ,"
Corumb~ and Ladario.  The development which would maRe a Boli-
vian port both feasible and desirable would be large scale
exports of iron ore, or iron ore products, fron Mutun.  It is
therefore recommended that the selection and financing of a
port with the necessary land connnections should be considered
as part of a comprehensive Mutun project.

     It would be premature for the Study to make a judgment on
the technical, economic and political issues outlined above,
but the Study recommends that the following principles are
followed:

       (i)   '.i'hat a new ri-ver port in Bolivian territory shouLl be
             built only it it is needed for a major export
             project based on the iron ore resources at Mutun
              (although it could then be used for general foreign
             trade) ;
                                                                         ,   '.
      (iil   That financing for a port and the necessary land
             connections should be considered as an integral
             part of a Mutun export project;

     (iii)   That the port location be selected based on the
             needs of a Mutun export project, taking into account
             the risks associated with each alternative.

     For the purposes of the ten year investment program presen-
ted in Chapter 18, a river port investment is shown starting
in the mid-19S0s, excluding the additional costs for land reclam-
ation and rail connections required at Puerto Busch.

International Land Connections in Eastern Bolivia                        ,,

     At present, Bolivia's connections with the countries on her
eastern border are very limited. There is no road connection
from the interior to Brazil, the sole access being by railroad
from Santa Cruz to Corumb~. Connections with Paraguay consist
of a small number of poor earth roads. Links to Argentina are
of somewhat higher standard, with the rail connection to the
Argentinian system through Yacuiba, and a gravel road of low
quality in the same corridor.  The thinly populated nature of
the border regions means that they generate little transport
demand, the main movements coming from international traffic to
Brazil and Argentina. Rail offers the cheapest route to the
important export markets for the products of the Santa Cruz
region via the ports of Argentina and Brazil.

            A number of projects were considered, shown in Figure
"'.   15-3:  the improvements and paving of the Santa Cruz-Yacuiba
      road to Argentina, the gravelling of the main link to Paraguay
      through Fortin Villaz6n, the construction of a road through
      the Tucavaca Valley and between Tunas and San Jose de Chiquitos,
      eventually linking Santa Cruz to the border, and the rehabilita-
      tion of the railroads linking Santa Cruz with Corumb~ and Yacuiba.

            Santa Cruz ... Corumb8: Road ... This project has the nature
      of a development road, and as such received detailed treat ...
      ment in Chapter 12. It was concluded that, while the poten-
      tial for agricultural production in the region may be
       great, it must first be proven. Moreover, its realization
      depends on a substantial amount of migration to this very
      thinly populated region, a development which is expected to
      take several decades. As a result, only sho~t sections of
      the road can be recommended at this time, which leaves the
      railroad as the sole long-distance means of transport in
      tha t corridor.

           Santa Cruz-Corumb~ Railroad - This 651 km long line, in
      service since 1958, provides a vital link between Santa Cruz
      and Corumb~ in Brazil. It was, however, built to a relatively
      low standard and parts of it are now being rehabilitated.
      This was discussed in Chapter 13, where it was concluded that
      the entire line should be rehabilitated by 1990.


            In December 1978, following a period of extremely heavy
      rains, serious damage was caused to the line in the rrountainous
      section near Robor~,over a distance of 50 km. The line was out
      of operation for a period of nearly six months, while ENFE
      carried out emergency repairs at a cost of $b 25 million.
      In July 1979, a technical mission from the Japanese
      International Cooperation Agency (JICA) visited Bolivia and pre-
      pared a feasibility study (1) for the permanent restoration of
      the affected stretch of line, between Taperas and Robor~ Sta-
      tions, a distance of about 90 km~

           The JICA Study considered five alternative solutions to
      the problem of restoring the line, which are shown in Figure
      15-4. These ranged in cost from $b 607 million to $b 2,026
      million (1980 pesos), and in scope from a rehabilitation of the
      existing track to the construction of a new 106 km long line,
      bypassing the dangerous area. The most expensive alternative

            Report, Volume 1, JICA, February 1980.



                                    -373-
involved the construction of a 6.8 km long tunnel through Mt.
Chochis.  The initial conclusion of the JICA Study was that
two alternatives should be studied in depth. These were the
rehabilitation of the existing line, at a cost of $b 677
million (1980), and the construction of the bypass line at a
cost of $b 607 million (1980).  The benefits were assumed to
be the same in each case (the extra operating time required
by the long bypass line being offset by higher running speed).      ..~




Thus, in the final evaluation, the less costly solution, i.e.
a new 106 km long line between Taperas and Robore, produced
the highest rate of return and was thus recommended.

     The National Transport Study made some observations on the
methodology used in the justification of the detour line and
also considered the possibility of other, less costly solutions.
The rehabilitation alternative proposed by JICA would restore
the line to a much higher standard than that found elsewhere on
the system. A less ambitious rehabilitation scheme might cost
about 20 percent less than that suggested by JICA --that is to
say $b 560 million (1980) or $b 400 million (1977) -- and would
have the added advantage that, as a phased program of works, it
could be spread over a period of years.  It is recommended that
this posibility be given careful consideration before any firm
agreements are made regarding the railroad construction near
Robore.

     It was mentioned before that no connection exist in this
region, nor are recommended by this Study, between the Brazilian
and Bolivian highway systems.  It is kno~, however, that some
demand exists to transport goods of relatively high value by
truck from eastern Brazil to Santa Cruz and La Paz. To serve
this limited but important traffic, it is recommended that ENFE
introduce a regular piggy-back service between the Brazilian
border and Santa Cruz. The service need not be of any great
sophistication, requiring merely the addition of a few flat-bed
wagons to the present train formations, responding to actual
demand.  It should, however, be a daily service and as such would
be a valuable addition to the facilities available.

      Santa Cruz-Yacuiba Road - Particular care needs to be ta-
ken in evaluating a road investment in a corridor where another
mode (in this case rail) already exists with considerable un-
~sed capacity.    ~he justification in this case, for pav-
~ng or regravell~ng the roads between Santa Cruz and Yacuiba
is that there is already a substantial amount of traffic on '
this road, not travelling long distances, that does not find
the services offered by the rail line either convenient or .
economic to use. From the results of the roadside interview
survey on that road it was found that less than 10 percent of
th: tonnage passing through Ipat! had origins and destinations
su~table for transfer to rail and for Villamontes the figure

          was only 5 percent. Much of the traffic o~ this road,is a~­
          sociated with the largest town in the corr~dor, Camirl., wh~ch
          is larger than Yacuiba, Villamontes and Boyuibe together ~n
          terms of population,and this town is not.serv:d by the ra~l­
          road. Thus one might see the modes serv~ng d~fferent :ypes
          of traffic the rail providing vital service for long d~stance,
          especially' foreign traffic i t he road serving much more local
          movements, with little effective competition between them.
                The freight volume in the corridor in the committed net-
           work, where the road is not paved, is about 520,000 tons per
           year north of Camiri and 400,000 tons south of Camiri for in-
           ternal traffic. The rail share of this is about 210,000 tons
           per year north of Villamontes and 140,000 tons to the south.
           If the road were to be paved, as in the Test Network, the total
           tonnage in the corridor would rise by 25 percent of which a
           fifth would be diverted traffic and the remainder generated.
           The tonnage on rail would remain the same with the extra traf-
           fic going entirely onto the road. External traffic to and from
           Santa Cruz is allocated completely to rail in either case.

                Costs of betterment with paving (see Chapter 11 for defin-
           ition) in this corridor are relatively high -- about 40 percent
           higher than the costs shown in Table 11-7 of Chapter 11.
           Although betterment could be justified in the sections Santa
           Cruz-Abap6, severe budget restriction and other priorities lead
           to the recommendation that paving in this corridor should be
           postponed until the 1990s. Major gravelling is recommended
           instead (as described in Chapter 11) and this will substantially
           improve driving conditions in this corridor. Improvements should
           be phased based on individual feasibility studies, concentra-
           ting on improvements to help local traffic, rather than the
           completion of long sections of trunk road. These feasibility
           studies should take into account the role of the railroad in
           this corridor. The evaluations of this road are summarized by
           section in Table 15-5.

                The design for a new paved road recently prepared for this
           route is not recommended within the next ten years.


                Santa Cruz-Yacuiba Railroad - The bases for rail rehabili-
...   '    tation projects are discussed in Chapter 13. In the case of
           this line, with a length of 539 km and an estimated flow of
           399,000 tons in 1989, the cost of rehabilitation was estimated
           at $b 464 million. The benefits were calculated as $b 30.8
           million which give a rate of return of 6.6 percent in 1989
           which is not sufficient to justify the project in that year.
           Some sections could be worth rehabilitation, but these must be

           selected based on detailed surveys of the line.

                The Study did examine the possibility of a 45 kID rail
           siding to Camiri. Construction costs were estimated at about
           $b 300 million and fixed costs of operation and maintenance at

$b 6.9 million per year. Cost savings by rail for Carniri
traffic, otherwise transferring between road and rail at
Boyuibe (63 km away), would be about $b 140 per ton. Even if
all the forecast traffic to and from Carniri in 1989 (0.2
million tons) were to transfer to the new rail siding (which
would be most unlikely), benefits less rail fixed costs would
amount to only 6.5 percent of the investment cost in 1989.
Hence a rail siding to Camiri cannot be recommended in the
foreseeable future.
     Connection to Paraguay - The road: from Pefias, which lies
on the main route between Santa Cruz and Yacuiba, to Fortin
Villaz6n on the Paraguayan border (see Figure 15-3), is the
only surface link for long-distance traffic between Bolivia
and Paraguay. The road is 130 kID long, of poor earth construc-
tion and carries very little traffic. The proposal is to
gravel it at a cost of $b 18 million.

     There is no possibility of justifying this investment at
present-day traffic volumes, nor is the improvement likely to
generate a significant amount of traffic. The road is a long
way from any major generator, and has to be seen as a relatively
small link in the ~oad from Asunci6n to Santa Cruz and La Paz;
it also is part of a.branch of the Pan American Highway. For
this reason, the project may be justified if and when ~
of international traffic is stimulated.
     The approach to the evaluation of the road was therefore
to calculate the volume of traffic needed to give a 12 percent
rate of return on the investment. Using the standard operat-
ing and maintenance costs developed by the Study, it was
estimated that the minimum traffic volume should be about 50
vehicles a day. Whether this volume will be reached in the
foreseeable future depends largely on developments in Paraguay.
The 900 km long Trans-Chaco Highway from Asunci6n to Forttn
Villaz6n is now paved as far as Filadelfia, some 350 km from
the Bolivian border, and it is understood that Pa.raguay plans its
further extension. It is suggested that the road improvement
between Pefias and Fort!n Villaz6n coincide with the extension
of the Trans-Chaco Highway to the border.
The Guayaramer!n-Porto Velho-Belem Corridor
     Guayaramer!n marks the only practicable trade route out
of the entire north of Bolivia. The route proceeds through
Guajar~ Mirim, on the Brazilian side of the Mano~~ lUver to
Porto Velho and Manaus, and thence down the Amazon to the At-
lantic and beyond. The corridor is shown in Figure 15-5.



                           -377-
     The importance of the route is that it offers potentially,
if not actually, the cheapest means of exporting goods from the
northern half of the country to destinations in Europe and the
eastern United States, and equally of importing goods from
those places. Most important, it. ·provides a feasible outlet
for meat from the Beni and thus opens up the prospect of large,
highly profitable exports of beef to Europe.
     The distances from Guayaramerfn to the main ports of the
other continents are shorter than by other routes and are most-
ly by water, which is the cheapest form of transport. Obviously
the journey inside Bolivia is important and the cost depends on
the point of origin or destination w~thin the country. However,
Guayaramerfn again has the advantage of cheap water transport
on the Mamor~ River.
     At present the corridor is little used -- Guayaramerfn has
no road connection with the rest of the country apart from the
road to Riberalta. It is connected to Trinidad and Puerto Vi-
llarroel by the Mamor~ River but this serves effectively only
a small part of the Beni. Guayaramerfn is well located as a
trading center but it cannot expect to prosper until it is bet-
ter connected by road with the Beni generally and with the main
centers of economic activity.
     There are no port facilities, either at Guayaramerfn or
on the Brazilian side at Guajar& Mirim. Nor is there any real
case for them until traffic volumes increas'e or until containers
are introduced on the river, which is not foreseeable for a long
time. Bolivian traffic crosses the Mamor~ on trucks by vehicle
ferry which is operated free of charge by the Brazilians.


     From Guajar4 Mirim the corridor proceeds through Porto
Velho. There are two possible means of transport:' road and
river. The river, however, which becomes the Madeira after
the confluence of the Mamor~ and the Beni, is not navigable
until just above Porto Velho. Most of it lies in Brazil and
the Brazilians have no plans to make it navigable in the near
future.
     A railroad was built in 1911 to give Bolivia access to
the Amazon, but was closed down in 1969, due to lack of use.
A road was then built, empl~ying most of the railroad as its
foundation and using the same bridges. The railroad is now
beyond any possibility of restoration.

     The road, then, is the only possible means of surface
transport to Porto Velho. It is an earth road, wide, straight
and flat, but in bad condition. It takes approximately 12
hours to travel the 330 km between Guayaramer!n and Porto
Velho. However the local government of the Brazilian State
of Rondonia, in whose territory the road lies, has declared
its intention to pave the road in 1981. Truck journey times
should then diminish to about 6 hours.
     From Porto Velho it is possible to cross the Madera by
ferry and continue by road to Manaus, a further 800 km. The
road is weakly constructed and carries weight restrictions of
5.5 tons per axle. Alternatively freight can be transported
by river from Porto Velho, where there are two small ports,
one with no facilities, the other with a small floating quay
and two 1.5 ton cranes. There is no equipment for handling
containers~

      The Madera River is navigable from Porto Velho to the
Amazon at ~tacoatiara where boats may either transship or turn
upstream to Manaus, which is a well equipped port visited by
ocean-going ships, and transship there. However, since
Itacoatiara possesses few facilities and attracts few ships,
the normal practice is to use Manaus, despite the extra 400 km
round trip.
    Conclusions and Recommendations - The corridor lies mainly
in Brazil. Within Brazil the needs of Bolivia are:
        (i) A paved road from Guajar4 Mirim to Porto Velho;
            but as already stated, this is programmed for 1981,
       (ii)   Facilities for handling refrigerated containers
              at Porto Velho1 these are clearly not needed yet
              but there is little possibility of building up meat
              exports until they are available. This is a matter
              that calls for negotiation between the two govern-
              ments.

       Within Bolivia the needs of both exporters and importers
are:
       (iii) Better access to theMarnor~ at Puerto Villarroel
             and Trinidad by road from La Paz, Santa Cruz and
             Cochabamba, and by rail from Santa Cruz via the R!o
             Grande.




                             -379-
     (iv)      Better road access to Trinidad and Puerto Siles by
               road from surrounding cattle country, both actual
               and potential.

         (v)   Road access to Guayaramerfn from potential cattle
               country nearby, and from Trinidad. A road to Trini-
               dad wou'J.d~ of cours.e~ duplicate the Mamor~ River to
               some extent, but it would not compete on price. The
               need for the road is partly for agricultural products,
               partly for consignments needing faster delivery and,
               largely, for passenger traffic.     It is difficult to
               envisage the healthy development of Guayaramerin with-
               out road connection to the rest of the country; and
               equally it is difficult to believe in the development
               of the Beni without at least a rudimentary road net-
               work connecting town and country within the Beni it-
               self.

Projects'in Southern Bolivia and Northern Argentina

     These projects are concerned with the connections between
Tarija and Bermejo and northern Argentina and thus to the Argen-
tinian ports of Rosario and Buenos Aires. The projects are shown
in Figure 15-6 and consist of:

     •     Paving the road from Padcaya to Bermejo;
     •     Construction of a rail link from Bermejo to Or~n
             in Argentina;
     •     Improvement of the River Bermejo, or construction
             of alternative canals.

      Road Improvement Padcaya-Bermejo - The road from Tarija
to Padcaya is already paved, as is the Argentinian road from
Bermejo to the railhead at Or!n. This project considers the
paving of the intervening section which at the moment is a
159 km gravel road. The cost of new construction      estimated
at $b 910 million and the traffic is forecast to grow from 82
vehicles per day in 1977 to 243 in 1989.   (Betterment with
paving is not an appropriate project here due to the difficult
and unstable terrain). The net benefits for the new road
calculated for 1989 are $b 75.5 million giving a first year
rate of return of 8.3 percent. Thus the project cannot be
justified during the coming decade but will be in the early
1990s. However, it is recommended that a major gravelling
(see Chapter 11 for definitions) take place in the mid 1980s
at a cost of $b 48 million with a rate of return of 15.8 per-
cent.   It is possible that some paving could be justified of
short sections near the town of Padcaya and Bermejo, but this
would first need a detailed local survey of construction costs
and traffic.

construction cost of $b 200 million. It would link Bermejo to
Or4n and thus to the whole Argentinian rail system and would
probably attract much of the foreign trade traffic of both Ber-
mejo and Tarija. If all of the traffic estimated for those
two areas in 1989, about 137,000 tons, was assumed to use the
railroad,the net benefit would be $b 5.5 million, or a 2.8 per-
cent rate of return. This would rise to 4.5 percent by 1999.
Thus the railroad is not economically justified from Bolivia's
point of view in the foreseeable future, but should of course
be used if Argentina were to construct it.
     River and Canal Projects - These projects are again wholly
within Argentina. The Bermejo River is not at present naviga-
ble for the first 600 kID of its 720 kID course to the confluence
with the Paran4 River. Argentina is however considering several
schemes for the improvement of navigation in this area. Most
important for Bolivia would be a dam on the Berme[jl.o River at
Zanja del Tigre, largely for irrigation and hydroelectric rea-
sons, but which would also make navigation possible as far as
Bermejo. B~low this dam there are proposals for either the
dredging of the Bermejo River or the construction of a canal to
the Paran& River either at Corrientes or Santa F~.
     The Bolivian trade by itself could not hope to justify
these schemes, but if Argentina should go ahead with them, Bo-
livia should try to be involved, in particular, in connection
with the possibility of a system of locks to bypass the dam.

Land Connections to Peruvian Ports
     The projects in this corridor, shown in Figure 15-7, for
the most part involve substantial investment on the part of Peru,
along with a lesser amount from Bolivia to permit successful
operation. They share the basic aim of improving connections with
the Peruvian port of Matarani. The port of rIo is available at
preferential tariffs, but the reluctance of Conference vessels to
use this port, which lacks a breakwater and therefore is closed
to shipping for about 15 days per year, means that for the immediate
future Matarani will continue to be preferred by Bolivian clients.
As noted earlier, cargo currently travels to Matarani port either
over an extremely poor road or by a combination of road, rail and
lake. Therefore, a subset of projects defined as the Lake Titi-
caca corridor are considered first, consisting of:

     • Establish a rail roll on/roll off (RO-RO) facility and
       a bogie changing plant at Guaqu1i
     • Build a railroad link from Guaqui to Puno (175 km);
     • Pave the road from Guaqui to Juli (93 km).

     Improvements to Navigation on Lake Titicaca ... The present
facilities at the Bolivian port of Guaqui are primitive, re-
quiring considerable time in port for the loading and unload-
ing of goods. This may be one of the reasons for the remarka-
bly low use of rail on the Bolivian side, but truck tariffs
to Guaqui also appear to be below those of the present rail
service.
     An important project was defined involving the purchase
of a new rail wagon ferry boat, similar to that already provid-
ing service between Puno and Chaguaya. This could be combined
with new RO-RO rail facilities at Guaqui, to complement the
existing ones at Puno, and a plant to change the rail wagon
bogies between the Peruvian standard gauge and the Bolivian
narrow gauge. Provision of these facilities would permit con-
tinuous rail operation between Matarani and the Bolivian in-
terior. The main benefits would be decreased time in port
by the lake boats and a lower overall cost since port handling
costs would be much lower.
     The economic feasibility of this project is highly depen-
dent upon the volumes that may be expected to use the facility.             I>.


In the evaluation, it has been assumed initially that Bolivia's
policy regarding the use of seaports remains much the same as
at present in terms of percent of total imports/exports passing
through an individual port. Introduction of the new facilities
would doubtless bring about a certain shift of traffic to rail.
However, road would continue to offer certain advantages in
terms of service, especially important for high value products.
Construction of the rail interconnection Santa Cruz ... Cochabamba
would also affect the volumes passing through the corridor, as
would possible changes in the access, to Arica (discussed below).
For these reasons, the feasibility of the projects was evalua-
ted under a range of alternative volumes.
     The total cost of the projects was estimated at $b 140.
million. Future volumes are projected to range between 125,0.0.0.
and 163,0.0.0. tons in 1989, and 260.,0.0.0. and 355,0.0.0. tons in 1999.
     Railroad Puno-Guasui - This project is an alternative to
the preceding one, since it would obviously replace the need
for navigation between Guaqui and Puno. It is a long-standing
idea, which would link the Peruvian and Bolivian railroad sys-
tem. It involves construction of a 150. kID stretch from Puno
to Oesaguadero in Peru, and of 25 km in Bolivia between Oesa-
guadero and Guaqui. A rail wagon bogie changing plant would
also be" required. The total cost of the project is estimated

at $b 782 million in 1989, 76 percent of which would be invest-
ments in Peru. As with the lake evaluation, a range of volumes
was project~d for this project.
     Road Paving Guagui-Juli - This project envisages better-
ment with paving (see Chapter 11 for definitions): it would
involve some slight realignment and paving of a stretch of 23
km in Bolivia and similar work for a distance of 70 km in Peru,
to Juli. The road from Juli to Puno is already built to a
good standard with an asphalt surface. The total estimated
cost for this project is $b 160 million.  It is not though
likely that construction of this road will divert much traffic
from the overall rail/lake route since the route beyond Mata-
rani will remain in poor condition and long-distance import
traffic will probably continue to use the railroad. However it
is quite likely that Bolivian export freight at present travel-
ling to Guaqui by truck and then transferring to the lake, will
now continue all the way by truck to Puno, avoiding the costs
in time and port charges of using the lake. The volume of
traffic projected for 1989 is 265 vehicles per day and for 1999,
600 vehicles per day.

     Conclusions on the Lake Titicaca Corridor - The results of
the economic evaluation on traffic forecasts are presented in
Table 15-6, for the alt~rnatives described above.  It should
be noted that the volumes, and therefore the benefits calculated,
refer only to international traffic and that for any case in-
volving construction of the paved road there are benefits to
local traffic. These are estimated at $b 6.4 million for 1989
and $b 9.2 million for 1999.

     The only project to exceed 12 percent in 1989 is the pav-
ing of the Guaqui-Juli road, which it does under all circum-
stances investigated. By 1999 the RO-RO ferry, the railroad,
and the road and ferry combined also exceed 12 percent, but the
railroad has a marginal rate of return over the road of only
8 percent. The additional inclusion of the ferry in 1999 has
a marginal rate of return over road alone of 13.4 percent at
the high traffic forecast.
     Thus the recommendation for this corridor is that the 23 km
road from Guaqui to Desaguadero be paved in the mid 1980's (see
"Projects within Bolivia" below) and that negotiations be started
with Peru for the extension of the Puno-Juli road to Desaguadero
(70 km) at the same time.   It should be noted that the Guaqui-
Desaguad~ro road would also form part of the proposed road to 110
discussed below and that this could ultimately be the more impor-
tant route to Matarani.   If the high traffic forecast is attained,
then the provision of RO-RO facilities at Guaqui could also be
justified by the end of the 1990's.

      If the Peruvians complete their section of the Puno-Guaqui
railroad as far as Desaguadero as currently planned, then it
will be well worthwhile for Bolivia to complete the short 23 km
Guaqui-Desaguadero link.  It is recommended that a design study
for this project be undertaken immediately.

     Road Improvement Desaguadero-Ilo - A further road project
is the improvement of the road Desaguadero-Ilo. This project
is at present being studies by the Peruviansi the current esti-
mated cost is $b 2,200 million. Such an investment cost cannot
possibly be justified on current expectations of future traffic
in this corridor. However, an alternative project to improve
the existing surfaces but without paving at a cost of $b 550
million, has been proposed by the Junta of the Andean Pact,
which would permit all-year transport in this corridor.   This
would provide access not only to 110, but also from there by
paved road, to Matarani in the north and Arica in the south.
It is recommended that this revised plan should be given urgent
consideration, since it could form the main road route from
Bolivia to all the Pacific sea ports in Peru and Northern Chile.

     Projects Within Bolivia - There are two major projects in
the Peruvian corridor which are totally within Bolivia. These
are the paving of the Rio Seco-Guaqui-Desaguadero road (98 km)
and the rehabilitation of the Viacha-Guaqui railroad (65 km).

     The road is 98 km long and the cost of paving to betterment
standards (see Chapter 11) is estimated at $b 134 million, in-
cluding the cost of four bridges. The benefits to this project,
for an opening date of 1986, are estimated at $b 26.1 million
with a flow of 290 vehicles per day. This implies a 19.5 percent
first year rate of return and so it is recommended that the
project should go ahead. This road is discussed in more detail
in Appendix IIG.
     With regard to the rail rehabilitation, it is estimated
that this would cost $b 56 million. At the highest 1989
forecast tonnage, the benefit would be $b 5.6 million giving
a 10.0 percent rate of return. At the highest 1999 tonnage
the benefit would be $b 7.5 million giving a rate of return
of 13.4 percent. Thus the project is not justified by 1989,
but may possibly be by 1999 at the highest growth rate.

     Conclusions on Land Connections with Peruvian Ports - Thus
it is recommended that the road from Rio Seco to Desaguadero be
paved, and that support be given to the paving of Desaguadero to
Juli and the construction of the low-cost road to 110, both the
latter proiects being in Peru. The rail rehabilitati~n and the
RO-RO facilities at Guaqui should await further traff~c growth.
These conclusions are subject to the findings of the feasibility
studies required for each recommended project.


                          -385-
 Land Connections to Chilean Ports
        The projects in this region involve improving connections
to the most conveniently placed port for La Paz -- Arica --
which are shown in Figure 15-8. The other major Chilean ports
are Iquique and Antofagasta. The former handles little or no
Bolivian cargo nor are there specific plans for it to do so;
the latter is already adequately linked to Bolivia by the
existing railroad. The corridor to Arica is served by two
modes, road and rail: both operate under difficult conditions
<:,-t present. The railroad is in extremely poor condition
~n both the Chilean and Bolivian seators; the road connection
via Tambo Quemado cons~sts, for a quarter of its length, of
:ough earth roads impassable in the wet season, although there
~s an alternative route via Tacna in Peru.     In 1977 the foreign
trade in the Arica corridor totalled 138,000 tons of which
86,~00 tons were by:.rail, and to Antofagasta 391,000 tons
ent~rely by rail.


     Road Improvements - The road connectiQ~s to Arica evalua-
ted were an improvement to the road Patacamaya-Puerto Japones-
Carangas-Tambo Quemado (219 km) and also the improvement of a
link from Caracollo, near Oruro, to Carangas. This latter link
would allow more direct road access from Arica to much of the
country but would require a 100 meter bridge across the River
Desaguadero, which is already bridged on the alternative route
at Puerto Japones. Also the traffic in the corridor is forecast
to 08 only 180 vehicles per day in 1989, which is not enough
to justify improving more than one route, and so attention was
focused on the northern route from Patacamaya.

     The only improvement found to be justified by projected
traffic on the route was major gravelling. Costs were estimated
at $b 85 million for the 219 km and benefits at $b 10.2 million
in the year of opening (1987) giving an overall rate of return
of 12.0 percent. The evaluations are summarized in Table 15-7.
In addition, thirteen bridges totalling 290 meters and $b 36
million are recommended to cross the somewhat unstable river
beds, where vehicle losses are not infrequent.

     If the Arica railroad were to be closed, the
volumes in this corridor would substantially increase and pro-
jects would be justified earlier or at a higher level.

     For connections with Iquique and Antofagasta, two further
roads to the Chilean border were considered from Oruro to Pisiga
and from Uyuni to Avaroa at a cost of $b 60 million and $b 37
million respectively. Traffic volumes were extremely low.
Neither road can be recommended during the next twenty years.

     La Paz-Arica Railroad - In the peace treaty of 1904 fol-
lowing the War of the Pacific, Chile recognized Bolivian rights
of transit through Chilean territory, and in the same treaty
it was agreed to build the rail line now linking La Paz to Ari-
ca. Since then there have been numerous protocols and conven-
tions on the railroad, the latest of which being in 1968. The
de-facto situation at present is that Bolivia's imports on
this line are limited to 7,000 tons per month, but at a tariff
well below the cost of operation of the line. Two possibil~
ities were considered, firstly that the line be rehabilitated
and secondly that Bolivia take over operation of the line
to remove the import limit.

     The cost of rehabilitating the line (to the level of recon-
struction -- see Chapter 131 from Viacha to the Chilean border
at Visviri (near Charafia) was estimated at $b 164 million, but
it was concluded that rehabilitation could not be justified,
either now or eat projected 1989 t~affic volumes (see Chapter 13
for details). On the other hand, it was concluded that the line
was well worthwhile keeping in operation and that maintenance
standards should be raised to the "desirable" levels specified
by ENFE (see also Chapter 13).

     The current limit of 7,000 tons of imports per month
imposed by Chile is clearly restricting the use of Arica Port
and the Viacha-Arica railroad. One possibility, which Chile
is apparently prepared to discuss, is that Bolivia should take
over the entire line, both track maintenance and train opera-
tions. This would have the advantages of a single administra-
tion for the line. Although maintenance and operating costs
on the Chilean section are difficult to predict for an all-
Bolivian operation, it is expected that the line would be
economically viable.   If traffic volumes increased signifi-
cantly, and this could well be the case with the lifting of
tonnage restrictions and with an assured future, rehabilitation
could be worthwhile, even though not jus fied at present
traffic levels.   Indeed, Chile once planned to rehabilitate
their section of the line and much material for a rehabilita-
tion can be observed along the track. Thus rehabilitation
could possibly be justified at an early stage in the future
growth of the line.

     It is concluded, therefore, that this line is well worth
keeping in operation, and this comment applies to both the Viacha-
Charana and to the Charana-Arica sections. Rehabilitation is
not justified at current volumes, but could be if volumes grew.
Th   can only occur if the current tonnage restriction is removed.

     It is noted that the gravelling of the Patacamaya-Puerto
Japones-Tambo Quemado road would not undermine the railroad'oper-
ations. An alternative route to the railroad is highly desireable
from the national viewpoint, and forecast traffic volumes justify

improvements to the existing road by the reduction in vehicle
costs brought about.  Even with an improved rail operation, there
will always be some cargo for which the speed and convenience of
a truck will be overriding factors.  For the great bulk of
cargoes, however, the lower cost by rail will ensure the selec-
tion of that mode.

Use of Air Transport for Foreign Trade

     The potential for international air freight is of special
importance for Bolivia due to its landlocked situation. The
use of air for cargo movement has been increasing rapidly
in recent years throughout the world (over 10 percent growth per
annum since 1972 in tons carried) not the least in developing
countries:  it is noticeable that virtually all countries that
have shown large increases in exports of manufactures have also
had very rapid growth in air freight exports. These have for
the most part been in the area of labor intensive, relatively
high - value manufactured goods, although there has also been
considerable growth in recent years in the export of fruit,
vegetables and flowers to the United States and Europe from
Israel, Colombia and Kenya.

     In May 1979, the Boeing Company produced a feasibility
study for Bolivia, for the use of a Boeing 747-200 F which
concluded that net earnings would be over SUS 10 million per
year on a total investment of SUS 61 million. The only pro-
duct that Bolivia at present produces in any quantity of suf-
ficient value to justify the possible use of air freight is
tin. While the potential for agricultural export using air
exists, at present the production techniques and quality of
product are not of sufficent standaId to make an impact upon
the world market.

     In 1979, Bolivian production of tin was in the region
of 30,000 tons and this volume is not considered likely to
alter greatly in future years. The present value of tin on
the world market is around SUS 7.6 per pound, or approximately
SUS 15,500 per ton.  The change in transport costs involved
in switching the export of tin to air, assuming the tariffs
used in the Boeing Study, would be in the region of an eight-
fold increase: however, the additional cost would form a very
small percentage of product value. The benefits to be gained
from speed of delivery, and the ability to respond rapidly to
fluctuations in world demand, make it very likely that it
would be worthwhile exporting tin by air.

     However, in the forecasts of earnings made in the Boeing
Study, returns from the export of tin provided only 15 percent




                          -389-
of income. About 80 percent of earnings were derived from
the import, by air, of products from the United States and
Europe. Some 15,000 tons were assumed to be imported at high
tariffs (close to the existing rates), providing over $US 30
million income.  The total air freight imports for 1978 and 1979
were 9,424 tons and 9,049 tons of which LAB handled 6,696 tons
and 6,513 tons respectively. Thus, to achieve 15,000 tons,
the service would have to take all existing freight, including
that from LAB's Boeing 707, plus a· substantial increase.

     The viability of the entire operation therefore rests on
the probability of the import cargo forecast being realized.
While there is possibly a shortage of supply of air freight
services to Bolivia at present, it is difficult to believe
that the degree of diversion assumed in Boeing's study will
occur simply as a result of the inauguration of this service on
the part of LAB.  If, assuming the same tariff levels, only
half the diversion assumed takes place, and air imports from
Europe achieve only 80 percent of predicted levels, the net
profit of $US 10 million becomes a net loss of nearly SUS 5
million, assuming a 10 percent escalation in costs.

     The conclusion is therefore that this project cannot be
recommended until a more detailed study with more reliable data
has been carried out on the import volumes that are likely to
travel by air. On the available evidence it does not seem
worthwhile to conduct such a study in the near future.

Conclusions on International Transport Links
     Imports and exports combined are expected to more than
double by 1989 and more than triple by 1999, compared with the
base year 1977. Therefore, several improvements are recommended
to international transport links. The main foreign trade routes
are currently by rail since the road connections with neighboring
countries are either very poor or non-existent.
      It is recommended that a port is built on the Paraguay
River in order to export iron ore and pellets from Mutun as
well as agricultural products from eastern Santa Cruz depart-
ment.   It is recommended that the financing of a port be linked
to a Mutun export project, and that decisions on location, size,
timing and land connections be left to the authorities respon-
sible for the Mutun project.


     Rehabilitation of the Santa Cruz-Corumb~ railroad is recom-
mended, including reconstruction of the section Taperas-Robore
which was badly damaged by floods in early 1979. It is recommended
that this latter project, which would cost $b 400 million, is
phased over the next ten years, although with most expenditure
concentrated in the next six years. Only two 40 km sections of
the Santa Cruz-Corumb~ highway are recommended in order to start
exploiting the agricultural potential of the Tucavaca Valley.
                                                                     • ·1'
                            -390-
     It is recommended that the Santa Cruz-Yacuiba road is
subject to major gravelling at a cost of $b 273 million. Paving
to the standard of betterment (see Chapter 12) could be justi-
fied for sections of this road but funding is unlikely to be
available. Rehabilitation of the rail line in this corridor is
not generally recommended, although it could be worthwhile in
some sections.

     It is considered that the Guayaramerin-Porto Velho-Belen
corridor could be profitable exploited by Bolivia, particularly
for exporting cattle products from the Beni to Europe. Improve-
ments to this corridor, which lies mainly in Brazil, are program-
med, including paving of the Guajara Mirim-Porto Velho highway.
It is recommended that Bolivia negotiate with Brazil regarding
the provision of refrigerated container handling facilities at
Porto Velho.

     Several projects proposed in Northern Argentina could be
exploited by Bolivia if completed, including a rail line from
Oran to Bermejo and various canal and river projects. None
would be worth developing for Bolivian trade alone.

      In the Lake Titicaca corridor, construction of the Guaqui-
Desaguadero railroad is recommended at a cost of $b 186 million
timed to coincide with completion of the Puno-Desaguadero rail-
road in Peru. Paving qf the Rio Seco-Desaguadero road is
recommended to the standard of betterment at a cost of $b 134
million (with bridges) and encouragement should be given to
the Desaguadero-Ilo and Desaguadero-Puno highway project in
Peru.

     It is concluded that the Viacha-Arica railroad is worth
keeping in operation, but the low volumes of traffic (restricted
by Chile to 7,000 tons per month) do not justify rehabilitation
at the present time. Higher routine maintenance levels are
recommended. As a complementary project, major gravel-
ling and bridge building is recommended on the Patacamaya-Tarnbo
Quemado highway at a total cost of $b 121 million.

     On foreign trade by air, it is recommended that LAB expand
their international and freight services by the purchase of
an additional cargo Boeing 707. The proposal to purchase Boeing
747s for foreign trade is not recommended at the present time.

     All recommended projects should be the subject of feasi-
bility studies which should reconsider, where appropriate, the
question of modal competition.

ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS
    OF TRANSPORT
CHAPTER 16

ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS OF TRANSPORT
     In this section of the report, the organization of the
major transport modes is analyzed in order to establish the
adequacy of the existing regulations in achieving the trans-
port policy objectives as discussed previously. A number of
recommendations are made to improve the situation.

The Transport Sector as a Whole

     With the exception of the rail sector, which is discussed
in Chapter 13, the various transport modes display similar
characteristics in their organizational structure. Operation
is in the hand of numerous small enterprises, with the possible
intervention by the state as a controlling agent. Scheduled air
passenger transport is dominated by a single carrier resulting
from the technological and financial requirements of the mode
and the need to operate internationally. However, numerous
small operators have evolved to provide air cargo and air taxi
services.
     Overall responsibility of the direction of the transport
sector lies with the Ministry of Transport, Communications
and Civil Aeronautics (1), whose structure is shown in Figure
16-1. It is divided into eleven Directorates, two of which
concern themselves with non-transport matters (mail and tele-
phone). The Ministry also exercises control over autonomous
state agencies such as the National Road Service (SNC) and
the Railroad Company (ENFE).

      Financial Situation - As discussed in Chapter 6, the
financial conditions of the transport sector give reasons for
concern.   Road transport is in a difficult situation,partly
because of an oversupply of trucking capacity_   River trans-
port is confronted with similar excess of supply, which has
led to the voluntary restriction placed by operators on cargo
size.   In the air sector the national airline, LAB, faces a
serious deficit, and the airport administration ~~SANA is
unable to cover all its costs.


(1)   In October 1980, a new Aeronautics Ministry was created,
      which takes over from the Ministry of Transport the
      functions connected with air transport.




                          -393-
     Overall one may conclude that the serious situation has
come about partly as a result of a fundamental excess of supply
within the transport industry; also, tariffs have been kept at
the same level for many years (until 1979), while operating
costs were rising. The objective of this chapter is to present
the major problems of the modes and suggest mitigating measures
that should be implemented.

     Existing Regulations - Bolivia does not possess a General
Law for the transport sector which considers the regulatory
needs of each mode and controls competition. Nor is there a
law for each mode regulating operations and protecting the
rights of the users; existing legislation is patchy and lacks
an overall focus.

     General Law on Railroads - Passed in 1918, the general rail-
road law is an exception to the statement made above, although
it has little influence now.  Its original purpose was the
control of railroad construction in the boom years.   Today most
of its provisions are obsolete as a result of the major changes
that have taken place in the transport sector. From a legal
viewpoint, the law ought to be revised, eliminating outdated
sections and recognizing that, with one national railroad, there
is no possibility of competition. As a point of interest,
Article 78 of Chapter XII of the law extends its application to
road projects and the provision of any transport services, be
they by road, river or lake. Thus it is set out to be a general
regulation for the whole sector, recognizing the need for joint
legislation.  Regrettably, no action in this direction has been
taken since.

The Organizational structure of Road Transport

     The organization with overall responsibility for this
sector is the General Directorate of Road Transport (DGTA)of
the Ministry of Transport, which has the following main duties:

     (i)    To determine the national and international policy
            for the development of road transport;

    (ii)    To direct and regulate the provision of services and
            infrastructure within the sector;

   (iii)    To promote coordination with other modes;

    (i v)   To propose safety standards;

     (v)    To propose the tariff system;

    (vi)    To maintain a register of transport companies;

   (vii)    To coordinate with the National Transit Service (SNT),
            a police force under the Ministry of the Interior.

             At present, DGTA numbers only five persons, which is clearly
        inadequate to perform the tasks required of it.  In effect, it
        has become a peripheral force, and power lies mainly in the
        hands of the operators, consisting of two basic groups: the
        companies (including cooperatives) and the drivers' syndicates.

              The Syndicates - These represent operators, grouped accord-
        ing to the characteristics of their service, such as urban,
        interdepartmental, and interprovincial transport of passengers
        and freight.   The existing legislation gives the syndicates a
        virtual monopoly of services, with the sole exception of inter-
        national traffic and interdepartmental passenger traffic: to
        obtain an operating permit, one must be member of a syndicate.
        An important basic rule is that syndicate members may not own
        more than two vehicles.
             Syndicates are grouped in departmental Federations, under
        the overall control of the Bolivian Confederation of Drivers;
        Figure 16-2 shows the organizational structure.   In 1979, there
        were 130 professional syndicates, of which 44 concerned themselves
        with urban transport.  In principle, once the requirements of
        an individual syndicate have been complied with, entry is with-
... 1   out restriction.  In practice, the Federations regulate access
        according to a number of criteria, including the perceived state
        of the local market for transport services. However, such
        regulation is not based on reliable data, nor is there any
        coordination between groups.

             The monopoly enjoyed by the syndicates has given rise to
        a system of freight distribution among the members, which is
        similar to that of the French "Bureaux de Fret". Each depart-
        mental federation acts as a central collecting agency for goods
        produced in its region and distributes them among its members
        by a mutually agreed system, essentially based on a waiting
        list. Half of the available freight is reserved for drivers
        from other syndicates to be distributed in accordance with
        observed interdepartmental flows.  The basic aim of the system
        is to avoid competition and to provide backhauls for truckers
        from other departments.  However, it often occurs that
        trucks drive empty to other departments to collect return cargo,
        which is clearly ine icient.

             In the case of some major clients, faderations sign contracte
        for the exclusive provision of transport, dividing the business
        between their members as before. It is also possible for a
        client to contract an individual operator; in this case the
II'"    federation must be informed of the agreement.

     The Transport Companies - The technical definition of the
term company, in this context, excludes the owners of one or
two vehicles, restricting the term to the providers of inter-
national services (mostly freight) and interdepartmental pas-
senger service. A total of 40 companies provide interdepart-
mental passenger transport, but only 24 of these are registered
as required with the DGTA.  International passenger service
is provided by two companies, one Peruvian and the other a
Bolivian syndicate.  International freight transport is carried
out by 13 firms, 8 of which are cooperatives.

     Of particular importance in this sector are the Drivers'
Cooperatives created under the General Cooperatives Law, and
regulated by the National Cooperatives Institute (INALCO).
From the standpoint of the Ministry, these are treated as normal
companies.

     Documentation - In order to operate, two main documents
are required.  The Route Sheet (Hoja de Ruta) is stipulated by
the Traffic Code, and has to be presented as required along
the route and delivered at the destination.  It is used by the
road police as a control device, without, however, providing
the statistical information originally intended.

     The Operating Permit (Permiso de Operaci6n) is granted by
the DGTA upon request from the Federation or company, and
authorizes a particular vehicle for service.

The Regulation of Road Transport

     The legal dispositions regulating transport are described
and analyzed in Working Paper 127. The main regulations are
summarized in Appendix 16A. The principal legislation in this
sector is Supreme Decree 10715 of February 1, 1975, which is
based on the provisions of Ministerial Resolution 49/71 of
April 21, 1971 and the regulations dated December 5, 1972. It
establishes the basic rules which have determined operations
in recent years. The fundamental provisions are:

       (i)   Public road transport is under the jurisdiction of
             the Ministry of Transport;
      (ii)   The Ministry has the power of inspection and control
             of both public and private road transport;
     (iii)   The law establishes definitions of public and pri-
             vate services;
      (iv)   Operating licenses are issued by the Ministry of
             Transport;

             provincial passenger services and of interprovincial
             and interdepartmental freight services to drivers'
             syndicates, which have to be affiliated with the
             Bolivian Confederation of Drivers;
      (vi)   The operation of interdepartmental passenger and of
             international passenger and freight services may be
             authorized for syndicates or companies.

     Law Decree 11/48 of October 26, 1973 made the Route Sheet
compulsory. Other regulations charge the Ministry of Transport
with the control of vehicle imports, maximum permissible axle
weights and vehicle sizes, bilateral conventions on international
transport, ability to regulate tariffs, and various vehicle taxes.

     Analysis of the Existing System - As discussed in Chapter 2,
a strong case can be made for the State to intervene in the
organization of road transport. However, the question must be
asked whether the existing system in Bolivia is achieving its
aims, and whether it is operating efficiently. It is evident
that substantial improvements are possible, for a number of
reasons:

       (i)   A general transport policy is lacking upon which
             particular regulations could be based;
      (ii)   Existing laws are inadequate to deal with all the
             problems that arise in road transport;
     (iii)   In particular, there are no provisions to establish
             a system of own-account transport;
      (iv)   The Ministry of Transport lacks the power to promote
             new services or to modify the existing ones in the
             public interest;
       (v)   The definition and classification of services is
             incomplete;
      (vi)   The technical vehicle standards are regulated inade-
             quately;
     (vii)   There are no defined criteria to establish and
             revise tariffs;
    (viii)   There is no compulsory insurance covering passengers
             and cargo;
      (ix)   There is no system of regular vehicle inspection.




                           -397-
      Of particular importance is the keeping of a Register of
Transport Companies: the definition of bodies who must be
registered should be expanded to include all organizations
offering services, not simply those who call themselves compa-
nies.

     Turning to the actual operations, the overriding observation
is that the lack of an effective presence on the part ot the
Ministry of Transport (in the form of DGTA) has led to a
situation where control effectively lies in the hands of the
syndicates. These obviously act in their own interests, defend-
ing their effective monopoly and limiting their members to a
maximum of two vehicles.  The principal observations on the
road transport operations are as follows:

    (i) The frequent stops required to check Route Sheets, deal
        with local customs levies, etc. have a negative impact
        on productivity, especially in those cases where routes
        are closed at nigh~

   (ii) The Route Sheet is not used, as i t might be, to obtain
        statistical data on cargo and passenger flows;

  (iii) There is no effective vehicle inspection by the Ministry
        of Transport and no coordination with the National
        Transit Service to enforce existing regulations;

   (iv) The DGTA, mainly for lack of personnel, is failing to
        exercise its designated functions, such as controlling
        services, promoting new ones, establishing an insurance
        system and maintaining a register of firms;

    (v) There are no technical and economic requirements to
        become a trucker;

   (vi) Passenger transport services are of poor quality in many
        areas and often do not meet demand;

  (vii) Freight transport does not operate economically, with
        very low rates of vehicle utilization; with tariffs
        higher than would be necessary with more efficient operation,
        thus permitting inefficient operators to stay in busi-
        ness; and with restrictions on vehicle ownership which
        prevents the growth of larger firms and the resulting
        economies of scale.

     The overall effect of the existing monopoly in the freight
sector is to create imbalance between demand and supply in many
areas of the country and to raise freight tariffs to a level
higher than they need be.

-
              Alternatives Considered - A number of alternative courses
         of action have been evaluated, in order to achieve better regula-
         tions and a more efficient organizational structure of road
         transport. These range from a complete freedom of competition
         to complete government control, and also include the continuation
         of the present system.
              Regulation of operations should be defined within the
         framework of a Basic Law for Motor Transport which would estab-
         lish the appropriate dispositions needed for successful opera-
         tion of the sector. Such a law should cover the following
         aspects:
              •   The responsibilities of the Ministry of Transport;
....          •   Definition and classification of road transport services,
                  types of operators and their rights and obligations;
              •   Regulation of access to the road transport industry;
              •   Specification of vehicle characteristics for each type
                  of service;
              •   Register of firms and operating permits;
              •   System of approval and revision of tariffs;
              •   Insurance system;
              •   System of vehicle inspection with sanctions.
              Turning to the organizational structure of road transport,
         six alternatives have been analyzed:
              o   Minimum regulation of the sector.
              1   Continuation of the present system.
              2   Continuation of the present system, but with far greater interven-
                  tion by the Ministry of 'Iransport. The Ministry would becol:re ef-
                  fective in controlling access to the industry and would have the
                  power to impose the provision of services where necessary.

              3   Revocation of Supreme Decree 10715, abolishing the
                  privileged legal position of the road transport syndi-
                  cates.
              4   Creation of a National Transport Company, which would
                  then operate in competition with the syndicates.
              5   Nationalization of the entire road transport sector.

                                       -399-
     These six alternatives were evaluated according to a
rating system, whereby relative scores were given for the
following eight criteria:   (i) economic e iciency, (ii) ser-
vice quality, (iii) service to isolated communities, (iv)
avoidance of monopolistic behavior, (v) optimized use of avail-
able vehicles, (vi) consideration of syndicate pressures, (vii)
provision of employment, (viii) likelihood of strikes. The
evaluation, which is described in Working Paper 146, resulted
in the recommendation of Alternative 2 (to be possibly followed
by Alternative 3) as will be discussed in the next section.

    -Conclusions on Road Transport -   To bring about the
needed improvements, it is recommended to implement Alternative
2, at least initially. If it proves to be impossible to
obtain the desired results through this measure, serious
consideration should be given to the repeal of Supreme Decree
10715, defined above as Alternative 3.

     Thus,a major effort is required by the Ministry of Trans-
port to expand the capacity of DGTA so it can perform its
duties. Also,the existing legal provisions should be revised
and expanded to assure that entry to the road transport industry
and the registration of transport companies be effectively
controlled by DGTAi those dispositions of Ministerial Resolution
49/71, which are in contradiction with these objectives, should
be repealed.  In addition, an Interministerial Commission should
be set up to reconcile the responsibilities of the DGTA and the
National Transit Service, with specific reference to the
use of the Route Sheet, the vehicle inspection system, the
introduction of compulsory insurance, and removal of the present
road check points erected by various entities.

     It will take some time for DGTA to build up its capacity
to effectively control access to the road transport industry.
On the other hand, there are now far more trucks in the country
than needed to serve current demand, a situation which was not
prevented by the syndicates' own control of access to the
industry.  In view of this, it is recommended that the import
of trucks be prohibited at least during 1981 to avoid a further
uneconomic drain on the country's foreign reserves. By 1982,
DGTA should be in a position to perform the functions recom-
mended,whereupon the somewhat rigid import restrictions could
be lifted.

     In the long term, the legislation discussed above should
be integrated within a General Law of Transport to be developed
by the Ministry of Transport with the involvement of the Minis-
try of Interior.




                         -400-
     Vehicle Registration - The only national register at
present is that of the National Transit Service (SNT). Registration
is also required by municipalities when license plates are
issued. Figure 16-3 shows the registry forms in use; a detail-
ed discussion of the issues related to vehicle registration
is contained in Working Paper 127a.

     The National Transit Code states that "vehicles and legal
acts relating to them shall be noted in the Transit Register".
This contains data on:

     (i)   Characteristics of the vehicle;

    (ii)   Details of ownership, sales, and financial information;

   (iii)   Court orders limiting vehicle ownership;

    (iv)   Accidents.

     The register serves a useful purpose for the traffic
police in tracing thefts, accidents, etc. The register is main-
tained manually, by number of license plate; an alphabetical
listing is also kept. A major problem is the lack of knowledge
concerning vehicles taken out of service, which are not de-
registered.

     Another central register used to be maintained to facilitate
collection of vehicle tax.  This function has now been handed
over to the major municipalities.  Imported vehicles are regis-
tered only at the point of entry, with no central register.

     The Municipal Authorities of the departmental capitals
maintain a register of vehicles existing in their department.
The registers for La Paz and Santa Cruz are being computerized.

     The Ministry of Transport is required by law to maintain
a register of transport companies: this has been interpreted
to refer only to organizations registered as companies for tax
purposes, and thus contains only the operators of international,
and of interdepartmental passenger services.

     As a result of this dispersion of controls, it is virtually
impossible to arrive at a credible estimation of the existing
vehicle fleet in the nation.

     Table 16-1 shows the national vehicle fleet for 1978, as
used by the Ministry of Transport in their "Emergency Plan 1980"
Table 16-2 shows the estimation made by the National Tpansit Service
for 1979.   It indicates that the data for the departments of
Oruro, Beni, Pando and Tarija are incomplete. Thus, information

that is vital for the efficient operation of DGTA is unreliable;
also much of it is not included among data recorded by the
National Transit Service, such as:
     •     Capacity of trucks and buses
     •     Vehicle fleet by operator or transport company
     •     Operating permit associated with each vehicle.
     The recommendations relating to the question of vehicle
registration are as follows:

          (i)   The register kept by the National Transport Service
                should be computerized;
         (ii)   The necessary measures should be taken to improve
                the system of reporting by individual departments;
     (iii)      The National Transit Service should be notified of
                vehicles taken out of service:
         (iv)   Vehicles which have been imported illegally should
                be the object of a campaign for registration;
          (v)   The DGTA register of firms should include all trans-
                port enterprises with operating permits;
         (vi)   The DGTA must be given adequate personnel to carry
                out its functions.

Administration of Roads and its Financing

     The planning, construction, maintenance and administration
of roads in Bolivia are the responsibility of the National Road
Service (Servicio Nacional de Caminos - SNC) , an autonomous
body under the tutelage of the Ministry of Transport and Commun-
ications. SNC was established by Supreme Decree 6684 of
February 21, 1964; in 1979 over 5,000 persons were employed by
the organization.

     Figure 16-4 describes its internal organization, consisting
of nine major departments. Throughout the country there are 10
district offices responsible mainly for maintenance and improve-
ment of the network. These districts are divided in their turn
into subdistricts (residencias).

     Detailed design of major projects is usually carried out by
consultants under the supervision of SNC's Design Department.
This often follows economic feasibility studies which are usually
also carried out by consultants. Several of the roads currently
under construction or otherwise committed, such as La Paz-
Cotapata-Santa Barbara, Quillacollo-Confital-Caihuasi and Chimore-
Yapacanl, have been subject to such studies. The same applies
to several candidate projects discussed in this report, practi-
cally all of which had been found economically feasible; in many
cases, these earlier conclusions have not been confirmed by the

     Once the road designs are ready, SNC's Construction Depart-
ment prepares the specifications for construction and supervision
of works, as well as the related contract documents.  The bidding
process usually takes about one year.

     Analysis of Existing Organization - SNC faces a number of
problems relating to its internal organization:  there tends to
be a lack of coordination between departments, and there is a
certain duplication of the functions of Director and Deputy Dir-
ector.  For this reason a revised structure is proposed to
increase interdepartmental contact and relieve pressure from
the Deputy Director. Three new subdirectorates are proposed,
each of which would oversee the work of several departments.
They are as follows:

     •   Planning and Design Subdirectorate
     •   Construction and Maintenance Subdirectorate
     •   Administrative Subdirectorate

     The Construction and Maintenance Subdirectorate would con-
sist of the existing Departments of Maintenance, Equipment,
Bridges, Construction and Feeder Raods. The Finance and Admin-
istration Departments would come under the Administrative Sub-
directorate. The Planning and Design Subdirectorate would
include the existing Departments of Planning and Design and
would also incorporate the functions of the Economic Advisor.
In addition, it is suggested that consideration be given to the
creation of a Studies and Investigation Department, under the
same Subdirectorate. The aim of this new Department would be
to perform certain basic road research relevant to Bolivian
conditions, and to strengthen SNC's capability in conducting
or supervising economic feasibility studies.

     The coordination between central and district offices
requires revision as well. At present the system is highly
centralized with requests for vehicle spares, for example,
being channelled through the central office in La Paz with the
result that delays can become immense. For example, equipment
availability in the Beni was as low as 40 percent owing to lack
of spare parts. The District Chiefs find most of their time
taken up with administrative matters and have very limited
powers of independent action. Technical responsibility falls
largely upon the Deputy District Chiefs creating many of the
same problems experienced in the central organization.

     It is therefore recommended that the Districts be given
more power in financial matters, and that they be re-organized
in a similar fashion as the central office. Three subunits
are suggested for each district, dealing with (i) maintenance,
(ii) engineering and construction and (iii} administration.

     The Financial Base of SNC - The main source of funds is
the Central Treasury, complemented by external loans, and also
direct road user tolls.  The latter, paid by users of roads that
have permanent maintenance, are based on a rate of 0.02 pesos
per vehicle-kilometer.  In recent years however, as shown in
Table 16-3, the costs of collecting this tax have steadily in-
creased until they absorb nearly all the receipts.   Thus, the
net revenue from this source amounts to only 0.2 percent of
SNC's total income, presented in Chapter 6.   In consequence,
SNC is faced with two alternative courses of action:   either
the rate at which the tax is charged is raised significantly,
or the system is abandoned.  For reasons in addition to purely
financial arguments, such as the user costs in lost vehicle time
and the difficulty of controlling the collection of high tolls,
it is recommended that the present system be abandoned. An
alternative system of vehicle taxation is discussed in Chapter 17.

The Organization of the Air Sector

      Because of the international nature of its operations, the
air transport sector displays different characteristics from the
other modes regarding its organization and regulation.  Inter-
national standards apply equally to operations within the country
in many cases.  The basic legislation affecting air transport
is the following:

    (i)   Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation (1944) ,which
          established uniform standards for air transport opera-
          tions, jurisdiction and administration;

   (ii)   Creation in 1967 of the National     Airport Administration
           (Adrninistraci6n de Aeropuertos y   Servicios Auxiliares
          a la Navegaci6n A~rea - AASANA),     separating its func-
          tions from the national airline,     LAB;

  (iii)   Creation in 1972 of the National Aeronautics Council,
          reporting directly to the Presidency;

   (iv)   Creation in 1972 of the Subsecretariat of Civil Aero-
          nautics;

    (v)   Creation in 1974 of the General Directorate of Air
          Transport and Aerial Work;

   (vi)   Creation in 1978 of the General Directorate of Aero-
          nautical Training;

  (vii)   Creation in 1980 of a new Aeronautics Ministry, taking
          over from the Ministry of Transport all functions re-
          lated to Civil Aviation.

      The regulations of major concern are (i) the Chicago
Convention which governs Lloyd A~reo Boliviano's international
traffic and operations at the international airports of La Paz,
Santa Cruz and Cochabamba, and (ii) the Aeronautics Code which
combines the relevant legislation in the sector with general
policy statements and international agreements.

      Analysis of Air Sector Organization - Figure 16-5 depicts
the overall organization of air transport, prior to the creation
of a new Aeronautics Ministry in October 1980. The National
Aeronautics Council is the supreme body in the sector with
broadly defined responsibilities.  These include:

     (i)   Advising the Supreme Government and the central adminis-
           tration on aviation activities;

    (ii)   Coordinating the country's human and financial resources
           in the aeronautics field, and providing coordination be-
           tween the civilian and military sectors;

   (iii)   Controlling and executing the national aviation policy;

    (iv)   Judging all aspects of aviation projects and other
           activities of general interest to national aeronautics.

      Within the Ministry of Transport, control of the air trans-
port sector lay with the Subsecretary for Civil Aeronautics,
who supervised three General Directorates: (a) Civil Aeronautics,
(b) Air Transport and Aerial Work, and (c) Aeronautical Training.

      AASANA - The National Airport Administration is an opera-
tionally autonomous organization, responsible for the construction,
maintenance and operation of airports, as well as the provision
of communications and meteorological services needed for air
navigation. At present the organization lacks sufficient resources
to adequately perform all its tasks, such as the adequate super-
vision of consultants, by whom much detail design work is done.

      Air Transfort Services - The national airline (Lloyd A~reo
Boliviano - LAB , which is 98-percent State owned, is the princi-
pal passenger carrier. It provides links between all major popu-
lation centers, and to some isolated areas. I't is also develop-
ing an important international operation. The structure of its
internal organization appears adequate.

      Transportes A~reos Militares (TAM) has the double function
of providing logistical support to the army units throughout the
country and also serving isolated communities not reached by
LAB or any other transport mcde.however, TAM also operates sane of
the same trunk routes as LAB, an activity which can be considered

to contribute to LAB's financial problems. TAM is not required
to pay airport fees directly to AASANA, and in addition sometimes
uses military airfields for its passenger services. Moreover, a
different insurance schedule is applied to TAM operations.

        Non-scheduled air freight services, both domestic and inter-
national, are offered by another Armed Forces organization, Trans-
portes Aereos Bolivianos (TAB).   In addition, domestic services are
provided by 25 companies dedicated to freight transport, principally
meat from the Beni. These are grouped in the Association of Private
Air Transport Firms (ADEPTA) to defend their common interests re-
garding such items as tariffs and taxes. Approximately 140 opera-
tors of air taxis are grouped into regional organizations.

       Conclusions on Air Transport Organization - The recent
creation of the Aeronautics Ministry will most likely affect the
powers and duties of the National Aeronautics Council. It appears
desirable that the forthcoming administrative changes include the
formation of a consultative council with representation from all
the entities interested in air transport, such as AASANA, LAB, TAM,
ADEPTA, and the Directorates of Civil Aeronautics and of Air
Transport and Aerial Works. This council would be consulted
before any new operating permits are issued, or before major
investments by the State enterprises are approved.

       The technical capabilities of AASANA need to be strengthened,
mainly by keeping and attracting competent staff through higher
salaries.  In the meantime, more construction and installation
supervision should be subcontracted to consultants where appropri-
ate, as it is apparent that AASANA's capabilities in this sphere
are limited.

       TAM should be required to make the same payments as LAB for
its commercial operations, at least in those areas where there is
direct competition between the two airlines. Also it should not be
allowed to compete directly with LAB at greatly subsidized tariffs.

Organizational Structure of Water Transport

       The land-locked situation of Bolivia and the physical pecul-
iarities of the several waterways that are not connected with each
other mean that each area requires specific treatment. The organ-
ization of water transport is discussed in Working Paper 147, and
the analysis is summarized in the following paragraphs. The current
legislation on water transport is summarized in Appendix l6B and is
discussed below.

       Current Legislation - Supreme Decrees 12683 to 12685, passed
on July 18, 1975, establish the basic navigation policy. As shown
in Figure 16-6, the Bolivian Navy (FNB) is in overall charge of
navigation through the General Directorate of Port Captaincies (DGCP).


                           -409-
                                                                    ,

However, commercial water transport is regulated by the General
Directorate of the Merchant Marine (DGMM), an organ within the
Ministry of Transport. To complement this the FNB is empowered
to operate services to isolated regions without seeking commer-
cial gain.  DGMM must approve petrol movements by FNB as well
as routes, frequencies, tlming and tariffs of regular cargo
services.  It is also responsible for planning port construction.
                                                                    il
     The FNB, on the other hand, is responsible for the national
register of boats, inspection of vessels and navigational
controls, lights, etc.

     Anal sis of Water Transport Re ulations - There is a clear
imbalance in the regulatory powers grante to the DGMM and the
FNB which is revealed in the Navigation Law, which devotes 127
articles to the responsibilities of the FNB and only one to
those of the DGMM. The only real power lying with the DGMM
is the approval of tariffs, but in practice the data required
for its calculations, such as movement statistics and regis-
tration of vessels, rest with the Navy.  The other responsibil-
ities given to the DGMM are impractical, such as the authorizat-
ion of foreign boats to carry coastal traffic.

     Organization of structure of River Transport - The most
important internal river system is that of the Ichilo-Mamor~
which has two operators' associations:  the Association of
River Operators, and the Transporters Association of the Beni,
which is an off-shoot of the former organization.

      Both associations operate boats of 150-200 ton capacity.
Other operators, not organized in any form, use smaller boats.
As with the road syndicates, one of the aims of the organizations
is to avoid competition -- as a countermeasure to the low level
of demand for river transport, they have imposed a limit of
150 tons per shipment, which is clearly inefficient from a purely
economic viewpoint.

     The Bolivian Navy appears to be running a commercial
operation carrying petroleum products. For this purpose it
owns four tanker vessels with a capacity of 250,000 liters each.

      Organization of Lake Transport -  Lake transport between
Puno and Bolivian ports is operateQ by the Railroads of Southern
Peru.   The port of Guaqui is operated by ENFE, with AADAA
controlling the warehousing. The zone is under the overall
control of the Captaincy of the Bolivian Navy, who authorizes
movements of shipping and controls navigation of the lake.

     Organization of Maritime Transport - Bolivia possesses an
expanding shipping line, LINABOL, which operates in association
with foreign companies. The use of the Chilean, Brazilian and
Argentinian ports and the access to them, are the subject of
several bilateral conventions. It is one of the functions of
DGMM to oversee all these commercial activities.

              A Ports Commission has also been created as a high level
         advisory body, presided over by the Subsecretary for Foreign
         Relations.  It was made up of public and private entities with
         an interest in ocean traffic. However, it lacked a permanent
         structure and has not operated for several years.

              Conclusions on Water Transport Organization - The overall
         conclusion is that an unacceptable degree of conflict exists

         is therefore recornrnended(2):



                  (i)   Abolition of the DGMM, transferring its respon-
                        sibilities to the FNB;

         Conclusions on Organizational Aspects of Transport

              The main observation is the need for a more active parti-
         cipation by the Ministry of Transport in the regulation of road
         transport. The financial situation of all modes is serious, with
         the level of economic activity failing to generate sufficient
         transport demand to meet the supply in both infrastructure and
         services.  In general, the level of regulation is insufficient,
         with strong operators' organizations acting in their own interests
,~- .!
         and apparently often to the users' detriment.


                The resulting recommendations for each mode are as follows:

              Road Transport - Regulation of road transport is weak and
         poorly implemented, basically because of lack of resources on
         the part of the crucial bodies. To remedy the situation, the
         following is recommended:


          (2)   On January 8, 1981, Supreme Decrees 17918 and 17919 esta-
                blished a new Sub secretariat of Maritime, River and Lake
                Interests. A commission was subsequently formed to define
                the functions of this new Sub secretariat which is under
                the control of the Ministry of Defense. The Study's
                recommendations were slightly modified to take account of
                the new development.

  . (i)   Restructure the General Directorate of Road Transport
          (DGTA) of the Ministry of Transport, increasing its
          resources and creating regional offices;

  (ii)    Form interministerial commission including represent-
          atives of DGTA and National Transit Service (SNT) ,
          to establish procedures on subjects of common interest     •

          removal of toll stations on highways;

 (iii)    Where in the public interest, DGTA to impose the
          prov1s1on of truck transport if not sufficiently
          furnished by the syndicates;

  (iv)    DGTA to impose minimum safety and service levels on
          buses and passenger services;

   (v)    DGTA to determine a rational tariff system related
          to real operating costs, with a system for updating
          as required;

  (vi)    DGTA to draw up a register of transport companies,
          operating permits and commercial vehicles, with annual
          revision;

 (vii)    DGTA to be charged with issuing operating permits;
          as a first step, it should clearly define the criteria
          for granting access to the profession;

(viii)    DGTA to determine the number and type of permits that
          should be issued annually on the basis of a level of
          observed demand for services;

  (ix)    As interim solution,no permits are to be issued in
          1981 for the importation of road transport vehicles;

          contained on the Route Sheet;

  (xi)    Establish an efficient vehicle inspection system with
          adequate sanctions to ensure compliance;

 (xii)    Abolish the Transito system, except on specific roads
          where tolls are appropriate (such as the Autopista),
          replacing lost revenues through indirect taxation
          of users;

     Many of the above recommendations aim at controlling the
monopolistic tendencies inherent in the current structure of
the road transport industry, as discussed earlier in this chap-
ter.  If the suggested measures do not bring about the desired
results by 1983, the repeal is recommended of those parts of
Supreme Decree 10715 which limit road transport to syndicate
members affiliated with the Bolivian Confederation of Drivers;
at the same time, competition should be gradually introduced
by granting operating permits to independent drivers, coopera-
tives and companies.

     Air Transport - In the reorganization of this sector which
is likely to follow the recent creation of an Aeronautics Minis-
try, a consultative council should be formed which combines
representatives of government, airport administration and air
transport operators. The National Airport Administration (AASANA)
should be strengthened and TAM's commercial operations should be
brought onto the same base as those of LAB.

     Water Trans~rt - The main conclusion is that the organizatior
and control of t~ water sector has not been clearly defined in th~
past. However, government has now taken steps to correct this
situation with the formation in early 1981 of the new Subsecre-
tariat of 1'1aritime, River and Lake interests under the Ministry
of Defense.   In addition, the Study recommends that the administra-
tion of the ports of the northern river system should be delegated
to the departmental level.

  FUTURE TARIFF POLICY
AND FINANCIAL PROSPECTS
CHAPTER 17

FUTURE TARIFF
POLICY AND FINANCIAL PROSPECTS
     A description of current or recent tariffs was given in
Chapter 5 and an account of the financial position of the
transport industry in Chapter 6. Now, having studied the
future development of the economy and the transport system,
it is desirable to consider the financial outlook for the
industry and its component parts, and to examine the related
question of tariff policy. The complex issue of tariff
policy will be discussed first, to establish certain objectives
and principles. Then the financial and economic implications
will be considered of the possibilities and advantages
to modify the existing transport tariffs.

Objectives of Tariff Policy
     Tariffs serve three purposes. First, they are a means
whereby producers may recover their production costs and make
a profit. Secondly, since profit is the difference between
tariffs and costs, they are an incentive to maximize
productivity, especially if they are determined by competition
between producers. Thirdly, they are the mechanism whereby
consumers exercise their purchasing power and thus dictate the
allocation of scarce resources between different products and
services. If this latter mechanism is to induce an optimal
allocation of resources, i.e. one which maximizes the
satisfaction of consumers' wants, subject to the distribution
of purchasing power and certain other conditions, the price
of a product must equal or bear a close relationship to the
opportunity cost of the resources consumed as a consequence
of the purchase of that product. This raises a difficult
question: what is the relevant cost, and hence the "efficient"
price, of the product? But the important point to recognize
is that the efficient price is not necessarily the one that
will achieve the other tariff objectives of recovering
production costs and encouraging productivity. There may be
a conflict between economic efficiency and financial self-
sufficiency.
     In many sectors of the economy this problem does not
arise: the average cost of production is easily calculated
and satisfies all three objectives. But the transport sector
is more complex, for three reasons. First, the structure of
transport costs is itself complex; transport infrastructure



                         -41
is very long-lasting, indivisible and costlYi once it has
been built it often possesses more capacity than is needed
and costs very little to use.  Secondly, transport is a
servicei it cannot be stored and it has to be produced when
and where it is wanted. This greatly exacerbates the problem
of surplus capacity because, even to provide for a small amount
of traffic, an extensive infrastructure is necessary, which
lies underutilized all or most of the time. Thirdly, there
are technical difficulties in charging users directly for the
use of roads, which not only makes it difficult to implement
an efficient tariff policy on the roads but also has important
effects on other modes in competition with the roads.

     The consequence of these special characteristics of the
transport sector is that the opportunity cost of producing
transport services varies greatly.  It rises far above
average cost when there is congestion and fal~far below
average cost when the volume of traffic is below the capacity
of the system.  In Bolivia the latter situation is almost
universal.

     Transport tariffs consist naturally of two parts: a
tariff for the vehicle, be it train, plane, bus or boat, and
a tariff for the infrastructure, i.e. the track, airport,
road, port, etc. The problems of vehicle tariffs are very
different from those of infrastructure tariffs. A few
paragraphs of explanation may be helpful.

     Vehicle Tariffs - There is relatively little difficulty
in determining efficient tariffs for vehicles in interurban
service. On the roads and rivers, where all public services
are provided by private operators, there is the possibility
of leaving the operators free to set their own tariffs.
Government intervention is only necessary if there is
positive evidence that freedom from control is failing, or
would fail, to achieve the objectives of tariffs. The main
reasons for this are:

      (i)      Monopoly. If one or a group of operators are able
               to impose excessively high tariffs and prevent other
               operators from entering the industry and charging
               less, there is a case for breaking the monopoly or,
               failing that, controlling prices.

    C:i,.th)   Excessive competition. \-ihen there is competition
               in the transport industry, operators usually object
               that there is too much competition and that they
               cannot make a reasonable profit.   This may be true
               if new operators enter the industry without a proper
               knowledge of the costs or the demand, and drive down




                             -416-
           load factors and possibly tariffs. Such a situation
           is not likely to last, but it may last long enough
           to justify intervention. But intervention could be
           limited to control of entry; it need not include
           tariffs.

   (iii)   Social reasons. Government may wish to help certain
           classes of the population or certain communities by
           giving them cheap transport services. This may be
           achieved by tariff control and a compensating subsidy
           to the operators.

     These general remarks may apply to all modes of transport.
Railroad operations are, of course, a State monopoly, as are
most internal air passenger services. But other transport
services, by air, road and river, are in the hands of small
private operators, though not always in effective competition.
Each mode will be considered separately later.

      Infrastructure Tariffs - The big tariff issues concern
the infrastructure. The basic problem is simple: once a
roac, railroad or airport has been built, no matter what it
cost or why it was built, the resource cost of using it is
small until such time as the volume of traffic begins to
impose pressure on the capacity of the infrastructure, causing
delays, which are costly and can mount sharply. Until these
capacity limits begin to push up system costs, there is a
disadvantage in charging traffic more for using the infra-
structure than the real costs of operation and wear-and-tear
attributable to its use; the disadvantage is simply that a
higher charge discourages use of the system, whose potential
benefits are therefore lost to those who would have been
willing to pay the lower tariff.

     But if the lower tariff -- i.e. the efficient price
is charged, there is also a disadvantage insofar as the full
costs of building and maintaining the infrastructure are not
recovered. Other sources of finance must be found, which may
undermine the incentive effect of the profit motive.
Alternative sources of finance may also carry disadvantages.
The ideal source might be the general sales tax, or a value-
added tax, but there may be political difficulties in raising
it.

     The solution to the problem could lie anywhere between
a minimum tariff policy, setting all tariffs equal to
marginal cost, and a full cost-covering policy, but even
within the latter policy it would be possible to charge low
 (marginal cost) tariffs for some services and higher tariffs
(above average cost) for others. The best solution is that




                          -417-
combination of tariffs and other sources of income which           •
minimizes the sum of the economic losses caused by inefficient
prices and the disadvantages caused by the use of other
sources of income.                                                 •
     This sort of solution calls for a knowledge of marginal
costs and demand elasticities, neither of which are easy to
estimate; it also calls for judgment of the consequences of
raising income from sources other than tariffs.  In particular
it is necessary to consider the effects of a tariff policy for
one mode of transport on other modes.

The General Approach

     Before looking at each mode separately, it is desirable
to determine a general approach to the overall tariff
situation.  Bolivia presents an extreme picture, repeatedly
seen in this Study, of an underutilized transport system.
Roads and railroads are often very costly to build, because
of the terrain; yet where they have been built they are
almost invariably little used. The busiest roads outside
towns carry only about 800 vehicles a day and the bu est
railroad lines only six to eight trains a day. The busiest
airports receive three or four planes an hour during the day,
most of which are small private planes.

     For this reason there is an obvious attraction in
charging tariffs that cover only the marginal maintenance and
operating costs attirbutable to the traffic, in order to place
no unnecessary discouragement on the growth of traffic and on
the economic activity that it reflects. But it does not
always follow that low tariffs will lead to more traffic.   It
is necessary to consider separately each class of traffic,
i.e. each commodity and each origin-destination movement,
and to judge the elasticity of demand with respect to the
tariff level. When demand is highly inelastic, there is
no case for charging low tariffs; on the contrary it may be
reasonable to charge tariffs above average cost in order to
help offset the deficit on other, low-tariff traffic.

     It is proposed therefore that a main aim of tariff policy
should be to charge low tar~ffs for infrastructure where this
might encourage traffic, but on no account should the tariff
be less than the marginal costs attributable to the traffic.
With roads, rivers and airports the responsibility for
infrastructure is quite separate from that for transport ser-
vices and the question of charging for the infrastructure arises
automatically, but with the railroads the same body, ENFE,
is responsible for both infrastructure and services, and
there is no separate charge for the infrastructure.  It is




                          -418-
desirable that rail infrastructure be sep~r~tely costed (as
it   ) and that rail tariffs be clearly d1v1ded, for the
benefit of management, into an infrastructure component and
a service component. This makes it easier to devise ~ ,
rational tariff policy for the railroads and also fac111tates
coordination of road and rail policies.
     This approach to infrastructure tariff~ could lead to
deficits, although this is not the ex~e7tat10n ~f the study,
except possibly for airports.  ~f def1c1ts a:e 1ncurre~, though,
they must be met in a way that 1S less dama~1ng.than h1gher
tariffs.  It may be assumed that some contr1but10n fro~     ,
Treasury funds would be forthcoming because su 7 h c~ntr1butlons
are already being given. But additional contr1b~t70ns should
be sought within the transport sector, ,on the gU1d1ng
principle that their impact on product10n and trade should be
minimal.

     Another important principle concerns the coordination
of competing modes.  It is desirable that, where there is a
choice between two modes, the difference in their tariffs
should equal the difference in their marginal costs, so that
whatever policy is adopted, the difference in marginal costs
exercises its influence on modal choice.

 Railroad Tariffs

     The biggest conflict between economic efficiency and
financial sel sufficiency arises with ENFE. This is because
marginal operating costs are typically only 25 to 35 percent
of total costs. The low level of marginal costs is due
largely to the fact that all lines, stations and other
facilities are operating far below their capacity. Much
rolling stock, particularly for passenger traffic, is also
underutilized. Consequently additional traffic can be
accommodated anywhere on the system at a relatively small
addition to ENFE's costs. But if all tariffs were set equal
to marginal cost there would be little or no revenue to cover
fixed costs.

     If, on the other hand, tariffs are set equal to average
costs which, however they are defined, are three or four
times as high as marginal costs, some traffic will move by
road instead of rail, even though the resource costs of so
doing are much higher, and other traffic will fail to appear
because the higher tariffs will render the trade unprofitable.
This cannot be in the national interest.

     The attractions of a "low-tariff" policy, i.e. a policy
whereby some tariffs are deliberately set below average cost,
are particularly strong in Bolivia because of the great need




                          -419-
to stimulate the development of natural resources and to
promote the required migration of population. The growth          •
of manufacturing is also highly dependent on cheap transport
to widen the domestic market and thus obtain economies of
scale.  But a low-tariff policy carries with it the need to
secure alternative sources of finance and to ensure financial
discipline in the railroad management.

     Alternative Sources of Finance - In order to cover the
deficits caused by a low-tariff policy, additional income
may be sought both within the organization and from the
government.  The principal possibility within the organization
is to charge higher tariffs to traffic that is insensitive to
the tariff level, in order to subsidize the low-tariff traffic.
Another method used in some countries is for the railroad
company to make profits from other activities such as catering,
retail shops, hotels, tourism and property investment in order
to help finance its railroad activities.  In all these cases
the railroad company is in effect using its monopoly power
to extract abnormal profits with which to finance its
unremunerative operations.  This would seem to be an
innocuous solution to the problem.

     Government finance normally comes from general taxation
and it is difficult to be sure just what is the marginal
source of such funds.  Is it income tax, corporation tax,
value-added tax, customs duties or what? In principle, the
ideal source of funds to finance a subsidy is probably the
value-added tax or a sales tax.  It can be shown theoretically
that, if tariffs are equated to marginal cost and are financed
by a small, proportional increase in all taxes, consumer
satisfaction -- in its conventional meaning -- will be higher
than if all tariffs are equated to average cost. The sales
tax in Bolivia stands currently at 8 percent on certain goods
and services and raised $b 503 million in 1979.


     In practice, estimates presented later in this chapter
demonstrate that ENFE coul~ be self-financing using the princi-
ple of cross-subsidation discussed"in the first paragraph of
this section, so that additional government finance would not
be required.

     Financial Discipline - It is widely observed that the need
to recover costs exercises a powerful discipline on the
managment of an enterprise, although this does not always apply
to enterprises that enjoy a monopoly.  It is argued that
subsidies remove this discipline and encourage waste and weak
management.  But this argument depends on the way in which
the subsidy is given.  If subsidies are "open-ended", either
explicitly or implicitly, they may have this effect.  If
they are given in the form of payments for services rendered
or as infrastructure grants, they need not have any adverse
effect.

     It is therefore recommended that, if subsidies are given
to ENFE, they should be in the form of a bonus per ton carried
of specific goods on specific routes, and similarly for
passengers; or, if desirable, they should be grants for
specific capital improvements. There should be no change in
the policy goal that ENFE should earn sufficient revenue to
cover current expenditure including the servicing of capital.

     It is important, of course, that subsidies, if they are
given, be given in a way that is proof against abuse either
by the customers of the railroad company or by the company
itself.

     Demand Elasticities - There are clearly strong arguments
for and against a low-tariff policy. A practical approach
to the question is to restrict the offer of low tariffs to
that part of the traffic where there is most to be gained,
i.e. to those commodity movements where low tariffs might
bring a substantial volume of new traffic to the railroads,
either by diversion from the roads or by generated trade.
It is therefore necessary to consider the demand elasticities
with respect to rail tariffs of all relevant commodity
movements.

      A complete study of demand elasticities would require
data that are not available to the Study; it is a task for
the marketing department of ENFE. All that can be attempted
here is a broad preliminary analysis. The objective is two-
fold:   to identify traffic that is highly elastic and which
therefore merits low tariffs, and also to identify highly
inelastic traffic which could be subjected to higher tariffs
to help finance the former.

     Demand elasticity is related to the length of journey:
the longer the journey on land the more lik~ly is it to be
made by rail.  The ratio of value to volume is also relevant:
high-value traffic is less likely to be lost to the country
-- it may be lost to the railroads -- by an increase in
tariffs, and vice versa. The type of commodity is also
relevant: heavy bulk cargo is likely to be strongly attached
to the railroads and not easily lost by an increase in
tariffs. For these and other reasons it is desirable to
consider the traffic in great detail, but as a preliminary
analysis, it was divided into ten commodity groups and the
main corridors of movement.

     It is particularly important to distinguish international
and domestic traffic. About 80 percent of rail freight traffic
in 1977 was international and was confined to five frontier
crossings - Avaroa, Charana, Quijarro, Yacuiba and Villaz6n.

Table 17-1 shows the imports and exports in 1977 through these
five points, divided into ten commodity groups. An analysis
was made to determine the volume of imports and exports
originating or terminating outside South America. About 47
percent of imports and 76 percent of exports were in this           ;,
intercontinental category, the great majority using the ports
of Antofagasta (via Avaroa) and Arica (via Char ana). All this
intercontinental traffic is likely to be insensitive to rail
tariffs. The remaining traffic through Avaroa and Charana
mostly uses the two ports for shipment from Argentina, Vene-
zuela and other South American countries. Only 12 percent
of this traffic is with Chile and that part with Antofagasta
has no road alternative. In effect all traffic through Avaroa
and Charana can be regarded as strongly attached to the
railroad.
                                                                     '.
     Similarly all traffic through Quijarro is captive to the
railroad since there is no road; also, distances are long.
Most of the traffic consists of imports from Brazil, largely
manufactures from Sao Paulo but including agricultural produce
from nearer areas.

     Traffic through Yacuiba and Villaz6n consists largely of
foodstuffs traded with Argentina, both imports and exports.
This traffic could be sensitive to rail tariffs. Most of
the remaining, non-food traffic is presumably with Buenos
Aires and strongly attached to the railroad.

     It would appear then that the great majority of ENFE's
international traffic faces little or no competition from the
roads. The cost of rail transport within Bolivia is generally
only a small part of the total cost of the goods being
transported. Hence there is no reason to expect that lower
tariffs would lead to a significant increase in this traffic,
except possibly on the line to Guaqui, nor that higher tariffs
would provoke a serious loss of traffic. There may be some
exceptions but the conclusion must be valid for the great
majority of ENFE's international traffic. When freight rates
were raised in January 1975, by 120 percent on food and 68
percent on other commodities, the volume of traffic increased
and the previous year's operating loss of $b 93 million was
turned into a profit of $b 67 million.  In July 1978 freight
rates were raised again by 15.9 percent. Traffic fell slightly
in 1979 but recovered in 1980. These facts confirm that
international freight demand is generally inelastic.

     This is an important conclusion because it raises the
possibility of increasing tariffs on external traffic in order
to subsidize internal traffic. A special test made on the
computer model threw light on the demand elasticities of
internal traffic.  These elasticities were calculated for each
of the twelve principal freight-carrying lines and are summarized
in Table 17-2.

(1)    The elasticity of demand is the power to which the ratio
       of costs, in situation A over situation B, is raised to
       give the ratio of flows in situation B over situation A.

        In mathematical terms:
                           e
                    c
            q   =   (CT)

       where, q     =   Flow in situation A
              q'    =   Flow in situation B
              c     =   Cost in situation A
              c'    =   Cost in situation B
              e     =   Elasticity of demand.

     The test was made with 1989 socio-economic data and the
1989 Test Network. The estimated elasticities were derived
from diversion curves over a wide range of tariffs and proved
quite high, with an overall average of 1.31. The conclusion
is that lower tariffs could generate a substantial volume of
traffic in all groups.

     Passenger Fares - For some years ENFE has adopted a
low-tariff policy for passengers.  In general, passenger
demand is believed to be relatively elastic and, with growing
competition from buses and aircraft, is likely to become
increasingly so.

     Passengers form a small part of ENFE's operation and
contribute little towards fixed costs. Although the volume
of passenger traffic continues to rise, there are doubts
about the long-term prospects of rail passenger transport on
the Andean System, as discussed in Chapter 13. For the time
being, the low-tariff policy should be continued, with tariffs
little higher than long-run marginal costs. Probably,
passenger fares on the Andean System should be revised, as
it is doubtful whether they are covering variable operating
costs at the present time.

     ENFE's Financial Position - In Chapter 6 it was shown
that in 1979 ENFE was in a poor financial position. There
was a modest deficit on current operations, the precise amount
being unknown, and an overall deficit of about $b 250 million
after inclusion of interest and taxation. Outstanding debts
amounted to $b 3,180 million, to be repaid over 40 years.

     The future prospects of the railroads, however, contain
some favorable points. Traffic is growing and is forecast
to continue to do so. The cost structure of the rail system
is made up of low variable costs and relatively high fixed
costs so that any growth in freight traffic produces a large
contribution to net revenue (this is not so with passenger
traffic because fares barely cover variable costs). Further-
more it was shown that most of ENFE's current freight traffic
is insensitive to tariff levels, so the deficit could in
principle be eliminated by a simple increase in tariffs, as
it was in 1975.

     Projections of ENFE's freight operating costs and
revenues in 1989 were made, in 1977 pesos, using the committed
network, i.e. excluding the proposed interconnection. Two
computer projections were made, one with a continuation of
current tariffs, the other with a low-tariff policy in which
tariffs on all internal traffic were approximately equal to
1989 variable costs but below this level for some lightly uti-
lized lines.  Tariffs on external traffic were maintained at
present levels (1977) for both calculations. The results are
shown in Appendix l7A for each line and are summarized for the


                          -425-
whole system in Table 17-3. They show a profit in each case,
of $b 391 million with high tariffs and $b 205 million with
low tarif     But the volume of internal traffic increases
nearly threefold as a result of the low tariffs.

     This is an extreme case of low-tariff policy and is not
recommended.  With rather higher tariffs on both internal and
external traffic, profits could approach the levels calculated
assuming current (high) tariffs.

      In order to quanti  this, a further computer test was
made combining the recommended transport system with what
was termed a "medium" tariff policy, in which rail internal
tariffs were set at 1.5 times variable cost. The rail results
for this medium policy are also shown in Table 17-3, assuming
external tariffs to remain at present (1977) levels. The
result of such a policy would be approximately a doubling in
internal traffic (compared with current tariffs), and in
profits, to mid-way between the results for the low and the
high tariff policy. The increase over low tariff policy
profits occurs entirely on the Andean System.  If it was
felt important to raise total profits to the high tariff
policy levels, this could be brought about by an increase in
external tariffs of about 12.5 percent, combined with the
medium tariff policy for domestic traffic (with perhaps even
the low domestic tariff policy on the Eastern System). A
tariff structure in this range would be an appropriate
starting point for ENFE in the work of formulating a new
commercial policy.

     Conclusion - At present, ENFE tariffs are related to
estimates of average total cost. These estimates include
substantial, arbitrary allocations of fixed costs. Tariff-
fixing takes account of size of load, distance, loadability
of cargo and dangerous cargoes.   Discounts may be made in
order to secure traffic in the face of competition. The
general goal of tariff policy is stated to be "the interest
of the companyll but the interpretation of this goal has not
been made clear.   In any event ENFE is currently reviewing
its tariff policy. The time may be opportune, therefore,
to offer suggestions on this subject.

     The reason why this chapter has placed so much emphasis
on the importance of marginal cost in the determination of
tariffs is that there is a possible conflict of interest
between the community and the railroad company.  It is in
the public interest that tariffs should reflect marginal
cost, when demand is sensitive to the tariff leveli i t is
not necessarily in ENFE's interest. But what is ENFE's
interest, other than to serve the public interest? ENFE is
not a profit maximizing body but it is expected to cover its
costs.  Its task, as a public corporation, is to serve the
public but at the same time to be financially self-sufficient.
A low-tariff policy does not help ENFE to achieve financial
self-sufficiency and may therefore be resisted by ENFE
management.

     There is thus a political problem, which is common in
public enterprises.  It is the government's responsibility
to ensure that the tariff policy of a ~tate-owned industry
is both in the public interest and consistent with the
financial obligations of the industry.

     It is recommended that ENFE's tariff policy for freight
should move toward lower rates for internal traffic where this
can be expected to attract a substantial volume of new traffic,
taking a long-term view of the prospects. The rates should
not go lower than long-run marginal costs, but that leaves
room for large reductions. Rates should be reduced in steps
and should not be allowed to generate a greater demand than
can be met with the available rolling stock; but of course
the fleet should be expanded as fast as possible to meet the
demand.

     These tariff reductions would naturally reduce the
contribution of existing traffic to the recovery of fixed
costs. New traffic will, by definition, cover its marginal
variable costs (which will generally be close to average
variable costs) and may also contribute towards fixed costs,
if the tariff is higher than marginal costs.

     On the basis of estimates presented in Table 17-3, revenues
would be higher under the mediuw tariff policy when compared
with the current (high) tariff policy.   If revenues were to
fall, though, two methods are proposed for meeting the losses.
First, tariffs could be raised on those classes of external
traffic that appear most inelastic.    It is assumed that full-
cost tariffs would normally be charged.    Increases above full
cost should be concentrated on imports and in particular
on consumer goods of relatively high value. The advantage of thif
cross-subsia~zation approach 1S that it maintains intact the
principle of financial self-sufficiency. But if government aid
is required, an alternative is proposed which is a bonus on spe-
cific commodities and routes where lower tariffs are desirable.
The bonus should be a specific payment for each ton carried in
excess of a stated volume, i.e. the bonus should.be paid on the
marginal traffic only, in order to give maximum incentive to ENFE
to attract such traffic.

Road User Charges

     If the choice between different modes is to be soundly
based on a comparison of opportunity costs, the tariffs
charged for their use must all be computed on the same
principles. Since this is technically impossible for private
transport, i.e. private cars, trucks and aircraft, there
arises an insoluble problem in obtaining a rational balance
between public and private transport. But this problem is of
little consequence in Bolivia, particularly outside the cities,
because there are few people with private vehicles.

     The main goals of tariff policy on the roads are the same
as on the railroads except that the question of financial
self-sufficiency does not arise, because there is no corporate
                             -428-
body like ENFE charged with the responsibility of running the
road system as a commercial operation. Since vehicle owners
pay their own operating costs which, unlike those of the
railroads, are normally far higher than the relevant infra-
structure costs, and pass them on to their customers, the
problem of road user charges resolves into two quite separate
issues:   first, the taxation of vehicles as a charge for using
the roads, and secondly, the question of controlling the tariffs
charged by bus and truck operators.

     Vehicle Taxation - It is economically desirable that
vehicles should be charged directly for the costs they impose
on the co~munity when they use the roads (i.e. the marginal
costs) but it is impossible in practice to know with any
precision what these costs are, or to charge directly for them.
Road charging systems therefore have to be very rough and
ready. Nevertheless, it is important that road users be
forced, by means of appropriate taxes, to give due weight to
the considerable costs they cause when they use the roads.

     What are these costs? They are of three kinds. First,
the vehicle damages the road, which has to be repaired.
Secondly, with growth of traffic, there comes a point when
it is cheaper to upgrade the road, in order to reduce
maintenance costs, than to continue with it as it is; hence
there is a cost of minor improvement. Thirdly, with further
growth of traffic, the capacity of the road comes under
pressure, giving rise to costs in the form of either congestion
or major construction to provide more capacity.


     The marginal cost of using the roads therefore consists,
in Bolivia, of the cost of road maintenance associated with a
marginal increase in traffic of a given kind, plus the cost
of road improvements attributable to a marginal increase in
traffic.  In practice this can best be estimated by taking
the variable road maintenance costs (i.e. those dependent on
the volume of traffic) and a normal level of expenditure on
road improvement, and allocating this sum among the types of
traffic using the roads.   Between 1977 and 1979 these
expenditures were estimated as follows:

                                   ROAD EXPENDITURES IN MILLIONS
                                         OF CURRENT PESOS
                                    1977        1978        1979
                             (1)
      Variable Maintenance              58        67          83
      Improvement                      332       344         387

                                       390       411         470

(1)   Following experience in the United Kingdom, it is
      assumed that a quarter of road maintenance costs are
      variable with the volume of traffic. Fixed maintenance
      costs will be discussed later.

                               -429-
     Further sums of $b 602 million in 1977, $b 919 million
in 1978 and $b 841 million in 1979 were spent on new roads.        •
If it could be assumed that these new roads were true additions
and not simply improvements to the existing network, then
the figures given above ($b 390 million, $b 411 million and
$b 470 million) would be the costs that should have been
charged to road users in 1977, 1978 and 1979.

     It was shown in Table 6-2 that road users paid $b 309
million in 1977, $b 392 million in 1978 and about $b 590 million
in 1979.  It might be said therefore, that overall the charges
were in reasonable balance, in aggregate.  However, the validity
of the above assumption on new road construction will be
reexamined later in this chapter. First, the question will be
discussed, how road user costs were distributed between
different classes of vehicle.

     The taxes paid with regard to vehicles are customs duty,
annual tax, fuel tax and taxes on oil, tires and spare parts.
Table 17-4 gives estimates of the average payments made in
1977 and 1979 by the six vehicle types used in the Study.
Since customs duty is paid only once during the lifetime of
the vehicle it has been divided by the average life of the
vehicle in years.

     By far the largest tax in 1977 was the customs duty on
vehicles.  It should be understood that in the table this
item has been treated as an annual charge spread over the life
of the vehicle, using the 1977 or 1979 prices. Moreover, a
large proportion of vehicles enter the country without paying
customs duty, both legally and illegally. One cannot therefore
expect to reconcile these figures with the annual tax receipts
by government.

     In 1979, average road user charges rose with inflation
but fuel prices and taxes remained the same until the end of
the year when very large increases were introduced, more than
doubling the tax on gasoline and quadrupling that on diesel.
These changes will transform the magnitude and composition of
road user charges in 1980.

     Apart from the magnitude of vehicle taxation, there is
the question of the type of tax. As a charge for using the
road, the tax should be related as closely as possible to the
incidence of road use. Fuel tax is thus good for this purpose;
annual tax and, still more, customs duties are not efficient
taxes for private vehicles but may be quite efficient for
public vehicles where they enter into the tariffs charged for
the use of vehicles.  This will be discussed later.

      Road Maintenance Costs - As stated above, the marginal
costs caused by the use of road vehicles consist of two
parts:   the direct damage they cause to the road, which has
to be repaired, and the investment in road improvement
attributable to the growing volume of traffic.

     It has been found that the damage done to unpaved roads
is about the same per vehicle-kilometer for all classes of
vehicle, and the cost in Bolivia is estimated at 0.20 pesos
on earth roads and 0.16 pesos on gravel roads. On paved
roads the damage is related to the number of equivalent
axles, the average cost being estimated at 0.024 pesos per
equivalent axle per vehicle-kilometer. Equivalent axle
values are estimated typically as follows:
                            NUMBER OF
     VEHICLE   CLASS     EQUIVALENT AXLES     COST PER VEH-KM

     7.3-9.4 tons                0.73              .018

      9.5-11.3 tons              1.66              .040

     13.7 +     tons             5.00              .120


     Data are available showing the amount of travel on paved,
gravel and earth roads in 1977, by vehicle type. Applying the
above unit costs, the total damage costs imposed by each class
of vehicle can be calculated, as in Table 17-5. Dividing by
the number of vehicles in each class, one obtains the average
cost attributable to each vehicle. Unfortunately data on the
vehicle population are extremely poor and the figures used are
crude estimates based on incomplete data.

      Road Improvement Costs - Road improvements are justified
by the savings in operating costs received by the vehicles
using the road.   These savings are greater, per vehicle-km,
for some vehicles than others. They tend to occur in the
following proportions, taking the savings to a jeep as equal
to 1:

       NOTE: These estimates give a total variable maintenance cost of $b 60.6 million in 1979
             which is less than the $b 83 million estimated earlier from the expenditure figures.
             Of course there is no reason why expenditure in anyone year should equal the cost
             of damage done to the roads. Other possible explanations are that the kilometrage
             figures are underestimated, because data on local traffic is very weak, or that the
             percentage of maintenance expenditure classed as variable with traffic has been
             overestimated.

     Adding together the costs attributable to variable road
maintenance and road improvement, one can compare the marginal
cost per vehicle with the total tax paid in 1979, as follows:

     It must be repeated that the figures for tax per vehicle
only apply to those vehicles paying full tax. A large number
of vehicles, possibly more than half, do not pay customs duties
or annual tax. The direct taxes are those related directly to
use of the vehicle, i.e. taxes on fuel, oil, tires and spare
parts, and may be compared with the direct costs caused by
using the roads. The comparison suggests that the large trucks
pay substantially less than their costs while other vehicles
pay appreciably more.

     Other Costs of the Road System - The variable costs of
the road system, to which the discussion has so far been
confined, comprise only about one third of the total costs.
Fixed maintenance costs account for about 15 percent and new
construction a little over 50 percent. These costs have to
be covered.   It is normal in a growing economy, particularly
where road transport is in an early stage of development,
that a part of these costs, especially construction costs,
is borne by the whole community as an investment for posterity.
But it is also normal that some of these costs, and especially
the fixed costs of road maintenance, are borne by road users.
There is, however, no accepted way of determining just how
big this contribution should be. Roads, if properly maintained,
will last indefinitely and will benefit many future generations.
The division of their capital cost between present road users
and the State is a matter for political decision. There is
certainly a case for charging road users for the fixed costs
of maintenance and also for the construction costs of those
new highways which reduce travel costs in the corridors already
served by roads. As was discussed in previous chapters, most
new road investment recommended for the 1980s will in fact be
for major improvement schemes which will reduce operating costs
for road users.

     These expenditures were not charged to road users in
recent years. Although the fuel tax increases of late 1979
have gone some way towards covering them, this may have been
more than offset by the reduction in customs duties decreed
in October 1980. The current road user tax situation is unclear
and requires further analysis in the light of the recent changes.
However, in the previously discussed period 1977-1979, users
paid only 30 to 40 percent of all road expenditures, if i t is
accepted that only true development road investments should
be paid from other sources.  It therefore appears that substantial
increases in road user taxation are warranted.

     The payment by road users of these additional costs is
best obtained through indirect taxes that have the minimum
deterrent effect on the use of the roads, particularly their
use for productive purposes. Purchase tax or customs duties
on private vehicles (both cars and trucks) can be recommended
for this role, and annual taxes on private vehicles are also
unlikely to produce adverse economic effects.  Taxes on buses,
though socially less desirable, are similarly unlikely to affect
economic development.

     The current transito toll system is not considered a
useful mean of charging for road use.  In Chapter 6, it was
seen that less than one percent of the income required for
highway financing came from these tolls, which in any case




                         -435-
                                                                         ,.
barely covered the costs of collection. Of course, tolls                 ,.
could be raised, but this would immediately increase problems
of control and accounting, very much so if Transito tolls
were to provide a significant source of income. Moreover,
with increases in traffic, the Transito system will become
a significant source of delay and an impediment to free
travel.  It is therefore recommended that the system be
abolished (see also Chapter 16).   It is suggested in Chapter
11 and Appendix llA that the trans ito stations could be
converted to vehicle weigh stations, to enforce vehicle
axle loading laws.
     Test of Possible Taxation Policy - A possible road user
taxation policy was postulated, and tax revenues for the period
1981-1990 were compared with the costs of highway investment
and maintenance for the recommended Investment Plan for that
period. The tax rates were used as inputs to the calculation
of road tariffs in the 1989 Recommended Network Test which
provided the traffic flows used in the final evaluations.
     It was found that tax income in the period would be quite
close to total highways costs with the following tax rates.

                                                         1977 TAX
Fuel Tax         rising to 20 percent by 1990     -36 percent(subsidy)
Lubricant Tax.   rising to 20 percent by 1990     - 6 percent(subsidy)
Tire Tax         15 percent                       about 10 percent
Vehicle Tax      Medium Bus: 20 percent           21 percent
                 Large Bus:  25 percent           11 percent
                 Small Truck:20 percent           15 percent
                 Medium Truck: 25percent          14 percent
                 Large Truck:30 percent           12 percent

     Vehicle tax includes tax on spare parts. Whi    jeeps
would be subject to taxation, it was assumed that this would
be a part of light vehicle taxation, revenues from which would
more likely be assigned to urban transport investment.

     The final result is as follows   (all in 1977 pesos):

     Tax Revenue 1981-1990 -   Tires:       $b   2,364 million
                           -   Fuel:             8,208

    Highway Investment less Penetration Roads: $b 18,536


                         -436-
    (The penetration road program is the only part of the road
investment program concerned with opening up new regions rather
than improving existing routes.  Hence, investment totals are
shown with and without these routes).

     Clearly, a more sophisticated policy is required than
outlined here.  For example, there is scope to vary taxes
within the heavy vehicle group in order to encourage tandem
rear-axle trucks, which do less damage to the road. Also, it
may not be desirable to penalize renewal of worn-out tires by
such a tire tax as postulated in these calculations.  However,
the general feasibility of a set of taxes to cover highway
investment costs is clearly demonstrated by this exercise.

     Conclusions on Vehicle Taxation - In relation to the
situation prevailing from 1977 to 1979, the overall revenues
from road user taxation should be increased substantially.
The one class of vehicle that appears particularly under taxed
is large trucks, which are paying little more than half their
marginal costs, whereas the tax on medium trucks is about three
times their marginal costs.  Small trucks are also paying over
three times their marginal costs. There is no reason to
criticize the relative level or form of taxation on jeeps,
automobiles and buses.

     It is therefore recommended that customs duties and
annual taxes should be substantially increased on large trucks,
to become effective following the moratorium recommended in
Chapter 16 on all imports of commercial vehicles. An appropriate
scale of new taxes needs to be worked out for different truck
sizes, with significantly lower rates for vehicles with tandem
axles due to their lesser impact on pavement deterioration.

     In addition to the proposed general increase, these
recommendations amount to a restructuring of the scale of
taxes on trucks so that the scale is much more heavily weighted
against large trucks and less heavily against small and
medium trucks.  In short, large trucks are giving rise to
higher costs of road maintenance and improvement than they are
paying for, and the opposite is true for small and medium trucks.
While the advantages of large trucks are not in dispute, the
present scales of taxation appear to over-encourage their
use to an extent that is not in the economic interest of the
country.

                                                                     •
     Tariffs for Road Transport - The economics of intercity
road transport, for both passengers and goods, lead naturally
to an industry composed of many small operators. This tendency
is found everywhere. ~~ere the volume of demand for their
services is high enough to support more than one or two
operators, a state of competition tends to arise because,
if operators try to collude to charge excessive tariffs, it
is easy for other operators to enter the market and undercut
the aspiring monopolists. One common complaint is that the
entry of too many operators tends to lead to excessively low
                                                                     •
tariffs and low load factors, rendering the business unprofitable.
This situation, if true, clearly cannot last; supply is bound
to find a level where profits, even if low, are acceptable.
This regime has the advantage of ensuring customers cheap
transport and a highly competitive service.

     In Bolivia these tendencies are found, as in other
countries, but the force of competition is suppressed by law.
Truck operators are not permitted to expand their fleets, which
must severely repress the spirit of enterprise in the industry.
Operators not only form syndicates but are forced by law to do
so, since an operator can only work within a syndicate. Local
monopolies are thus created by law.   In order to contain the
natural tendency of the syndicates to charge excessive tariffs,
control on tariff levels is imposed by the central government.

     This system of organization has serious disadvantages.
It imposes a sharing out of work between members, thus
reducing the incentive to give good service, and it leads
to various inefficiencies resulting from State supervision
of tariffs.   Truck operations can be quite complex and,
because the short-run marginal costs of operating a truck
are considerably below average costs, the operator may
sometimes be keen to carry freight cheaply in order to
increase vehicle utilization and thus reduce his average
costs and increase his profits. At other times, for various
reasons, he may not be willing to work unless a relatively
high tariff is paid. A system of free tariff negotiation,
based on competition, offers advantages to both operator and
customer. Tariff control eliminates these advantages because
it imposes a rigidity and excessive uniformity of tariffs on
the industry.




                          -438-
     Given a system of syndicates, however, control must be
exercised over maximum tariffs -- and the syndicates will
 frequently ensure that the maximum is also the minimum.
The State is faced with the continuing problem of determining
what these tariffs should be. This is a difficult task. The
only way of trying to do it is to examine the records of
annual costs and revenues of a sample of operators. Given
the very s~all scale of the operations, their records will not
be accurate: the authorities will never know the true
profits being made.  In any event, given rigid tariff
controls, some movements will be more profitable than others
and the favored members of the syndicate will tend to get
the most profitable traffic, so that a rigid set of tariffs
will lead to higher profits for some than for others,
regardless of their efficiency.

     These difficulties are greatly exacerbated in times of
high inflation. There is no way in which tariff control can
possibly be efficient. Inevitably the industry will fluctuate
violently between highly profitable periods, immediately after
a tariff increase, and unprofitable, or less profitable, in
periods immediately before the next increase.

     Conclusions on Road Tariffs - If it is impossible for
the government authorities to know the true state of profits
in the localized transport industries, both trucks and buses,
it is certainly impossible for the Study team too, even if
there were resources to make a thorough, nationwide
investigation.  It would be entirely spurious for the Study
to suggest that tariffs are currently too high or too low,
either generally or in particular parts of the country.  It
must be realized that the costs and revenues vary considerably
from one area to another.

     Some recoromendations, however, can be made on tariff
policy, if not on the levels of tariffs.   In Chapter 16 it
was proposed that modifications in the regulatory system
should be made with a view to the possible abolition of
the syndicates' monopoly power. This would permit a freer
tariff policy. As a move in this direction it is proposed
that a system of fork tariffs be introduced, i.e. a system
where maximum and ~inimum tariffs are set. Syndicates
should be prohibited from interfering with members' tariffs
provided they do not deviate from the permitted range.
This range may vary in extent from one route to another.
As and when a state of healthy competition is attained in
particular areas, the range of the fork may be widened
until eventually it becomes irrelevant.




                          -439-
                                                                   •

     For as long as monopoly exists, however, tariff controls
are indispensable. With inflation, a regular review of
tariffs should be made, based on the submitted accounts of
the local operators or a sample of them.   As roads are
improved, i t is imperative that the lower operating costs
resulting therefrom be reflected in lower tariffs; otherwise
the benefits of the improvements will not be passed on to
consumers and the road's developmental potential will not be
realized.

     With buses, although the same principles apply, less
flexibility in tariffs is possible since published fares
must be available to passengers.   This does not mean,
however, that some freedom should not be given to operators
to fix their tariffs and to introduce discount schemes and
surcharges if they wish.   If there is no competition,
maximum fares must be set.   If there is competition, a range
of tariffs should be permitted, allowing operators to offer
different levels of service with correspondingly different
tariffs if they so wish, thus providing passengers with more
choice.

Air Transport Charges

     As described in Chapter 5, the charges of the National
Airport Administration (AASANA) are in the form of landing
fees, air navigation charges, aircraft parking charges and
passenger airport taxes.  It is desirable that these tariffs
be based on the same principles as advocated above for
rail and road tariffs. With airports, however, the marginal
costs of accommodating air traffic tend to be much higher,
relative to average costs, than with railroads and roads.
This is because a comparatively small volume of traffic, in
terms of passengers and freight tons, is needed before
expenditure is required for improvements to the runway, to
accommodate larger planes, and for airport buildings,
navigational aids, maintenance facilities, etc.  An examination
of AASANA's records shows that the four busiest airports out
of 33 in all, account for 72 percent of the costs and handle
89 percent of passengers and 78 percent of freight.

     There is little economic case, therefore, except at the
smallest airports, for a tariff policy that fails to recover
costs of operation, maintenance and routine improvements.
At the very small airports, of minimum capacity, temporary
subsidies may be desirable while traffic is building up to
a level sufficient to support full-cost tariffs.  In particular,
airports serving development areas merit temporary subsidies
to permit tariffs to be set at a level which will eventually
be self-financing when sufficient development has occurred;



                          -440-
and in these cases the airport might be expanded beyond
minimum capacity while still receiving subsidy.

     Airports that may justify economic subsidies of this
kind include Riberalta, Puerto Su~rez, Apolo, Robore;
and an airport in the San Joaquin region. There is also a
clear case for social subsidies at certain airports. This
is obviously a political decision. Candidates for such
subsidies might include Cobija, Guayaramerin, San Matias,
Ixiamas, Santa Ana de Yacuma, San Borja, San Iqnacio de
Velasco and Ascensi6n de Guarayos. When an airport
has passed the stage of being a development project
there is no good reason why further investment should be
committed before it is commercially justified.

     In Chapter 6, AASANA's financial position was shown to
be highly unsatisfactory.  In 1978, income fell short of
operating costs by 15 percent and there was no contribution
to depreciation and interest.  It seems probable that some
of AASANA's past investment was premature and/or that tariff
levels have been too low.

     In approaching AASANA's financial problem, one fact is
of dominant importance: charges to AASANA comprise only 6
percent of LAB operating costs and probably less of those
of long-distance foreign air services USing Bolivian
airports. An increase of one third in AASANA's charges
would amount to only 2 percent of airline operating costs.
It is clear that AASANA could thus become financially viable
without any difficulty.

     It should also be pointed out that airports possess a
unique opportunity to make large supplementary profits on
services to passengers. Their passengers comprise the highest
income groups, including many foreigners, and while waiting in
the airport they are a captive market for the sale of food,
drink, souvenirs, duty-free articles, reading matter and other
articles, all at inflated prices. Further profits are obtain-
able from car parks, car rental companies and other services.

     There is absolutely no good reason why AASANA should not
cover its normal operating costs and service the capital
costs for routine, small-scale investments. Large projects,
however, such as the new Viru Viru airport, cannot be
expected to be paid from general AASANA revenues. Assistance
from other financial sources is also needed for economic and
social subsidies to small airports, as mentioned above.




                         -441-
                                                                    •
                                   - It is recommended that
a sma                                Riberalta, Puerto
Suarez, Apolo and Robor~ be assigned economic development
grants in order to reduce airport charges. The government           •
may also wish to give social subsidies towards the cost of
maintaining small airports in remote parts of the country.
These subsidies, as well as the costs related to the Viru
Viru project, should properly be paid to AASANA from Treasury
funds.  Still, it seems that a general increase in airport
charges is also required to put the organization into a
position of financial viability.

     Before raising its charges, it is desirable that AASANA
should attempt to identify the costs associated with different
classes of aircraft. A statistical analysis was made to
determine the runway costs, a      t servicing costs, air
navigation costs, passenger and    ight handling costs and
administration costs attributable to different classes of
aircraft. This is reported in Appendix 5D and also Working
Paper 35b. A thorough analysis     this kind should be
carried out by AASANA and used as a basis for its various
charges. At present, foreign aircraft and passengers are
being charged heavily, and this might be justified by the
high costs of handling them, or a political decision to
discriminate against foreign traffic. But it is desirable
that the actual costs occasioned by this and other types
of traffic should be known as accurately as possible.

     Lloyd Aereo Boliviano - Tariff policy for LAB presents
few theoretical problems. There is no infrastructure and not
much competition on domestic routes. The normal goal should
be that each route should cover its total costs. This means
that the total annual cost of operating the route, including
depreciation and interest payments, should be divided by the
expected number of passengers.  If there are peaking problems,
special fares could be introduced to even the flow of passengers,
and special discount schemes could be devised to attract new
passengers in order to raise load factors.

     Exceptions must be made for certain routes serving
development areas or remote communities, as already
mentioned in connection with airports. The case for
subsidizing services to development areas is strong because
in Bolivia these areas may never develop at all without
reasonably frequent services at normal tariffs and these
can only be provided by means of subsidy until the traffic
volume has built up sufficiently to cover the cost of the
service. It should be emphasized that these subsidies are
needed to provide good frequencies, not subnormal tariffs.




                          -442-
           The case for subsidizing social routes is again a
      political one, but from an economic viewpoint, it is relevant
      to compare the cost (and benefit) of a subsidized air service
      with that of a new road.  There can be little doub~ that,
      for passenger traffic, a subsidized air service to cobija,
      Riberalta and San Matias as examples, would be more benefi-
      cial and less costly than a road, which, on account of the
 ..   distance, would be rarely used.  The effect on goods traffic
      would be different, of course, and it is necessary to con-
      sider whether roads to these outlying places would in fact
      generate a significant amount of goods traffic.

           Leaving aside these special development and social routes,
      the remaining domestic routes call for rationalization of
      tariffs and a general increase. LAB has said that over the
      years numerous tariffs have been modified for special reasons,
      giving rise to a somewhat inconsistent pattern of tariffs
      today.  There is a need to review and revise the costing
      of each route to ensure the appropriate allocation of costs
      among the forecast passengers using the route.
..,        Secondly, as shown in Chapter 6, LAB failed by 12
      percent to cover its costs in 1979.;. sipce the!) fuel and other
      costs have risen substantially. An increase in fares to re-
      medy this situation was made in early 1981, bllt this \rias the
      first increase since 1973. No details were available in time
      for analysis by the Study. As a general rule, future tariffs
      should be kept in closer relationship witti costs than has
      been done in the past.

           Conclusions and Recommendations

           The following summarizes the findings and recommendations
      of the Study with regard to tariff policy.

           General Approach - The main aim of tariff policy in
      Bolivia should be to charge low tariffs for infrastructure
      where this might encourage traffic, but on no account should
      the tariff be less than the marginal costs attributable to
      the traffic. Where demand is highly inelastic, it is reasonable
      to charge tariffs above average costs in order to offset the
      deficit on other, low tariff traffic.

           To ensure coordination between competing modes, the
      difference in their tariffs should equal the difference in
      their marginal costs, thereby exercising an appropriate
      influence on modal choice.

           Railroad Tariffs - A lower tariff policy, charging
      somewhere between marginal costs and the currently charged
      average costs is recommended in order to encourage fuller
      use of the railroad system. Higher tariffs should be imposed
      on traffic insensitive to the tariff level (principally
      international traffic), in order to subsidize low tariff
      traffic (principally domestic traffic).

                                -443-
     The policy goal of ENFE earning sufficient revenues to
cover current expenditures, including the servicing of capital,
should continue. Estimates by the Study indicate that this
should still be possible, even with lower tariffs for some
domestic traffic.  If it does become necessary to provide sub-
sidies, they should be in the form of a bonus per ton carried
of specific goods on specific routes, and similarly for passen-
gers; or as grants for specific capital improvements.

     To carry out this tariff policy, the marketing department
of ENFE should make a complete study of demand elasticities of
all relevant commodity movements. Using the findings of this
study, ENFE should reduce tariffs for internal traffic in steps
expanding the fleet as necessary as soon as demands begin to
approach the capacity of available rolling stock.

     Road User Charges - These include the taxation of vehicles
as a charge for using the roads. Marginal costs of road use in
Bolivia consist of variable road maintenance and improvements
associated with marginal increases in traffic. Comparisons of
the level of direct taxes on vehicles (fuel, oil, tires,
spare parts) with marginal costs of road use by vehicle class
using 1979 values indicate that large buses and trucks pay
substantially less than their costs, while small and medium
trucks pay appreciably more.

     However, these marginal (variable) costs are less than
one third of total road system infrastructure costs; fixed
maintenance costs account for about 15 percent and new construct-
ion over 50 percent.  If it is accepted that present road users
should pay for full maintenance costs and the construction
costs of new highways which reduce travel costs in corridors
already served by roads, substantial increases in road user
taxation are warranted, particularly for large trucks and
also for both small and large buses. The payment of these
additional costs by road users, with minimum deterrent effect
on road use, should be achieved by increases in purchase tax
or custom duties. The current TrAnsito toll system is considered
as unsuitable for the collection of road charges, and it is
recommended that it should be abolished.

     Tariffs for Road Transport - This focuses on the question
of controlling tariffs charged by bus and truck operators.   In
Bolivia, truck operators are not permitted to expand their
fleets and by law must join syndicates. To control the tendency
of syndicates to charge excessive tariffs, the central government
controls tariff levels. This system eliminates free tariff
negotiation based on competition, and imposes an undesirable
rigidity and excessive uniformity of tariffs.




                          -444-
     Modifications in the regulatory system are proposed (see
Chapter 16) to reduce the syndicates' monopoly power, thereby
permitting a freer tariff policy. A system of fork tariffs,
i.e. a system where maximum and minimum tariffs are set, should
be introduced. When a state of healthy competition is attained,
the range of the fork may be widened until eventually it becomes
irrelevant.

     As roads are improved, the lower operating costs must be
reflected in lower tariffs so that the benefits will be passed
on to consumers and full developmental potentials realized.

     While the same principles apply to buses, published fares
reflecting maximum rates must be available to passengers.
Where there is competition, a range of tariffs should be
permitted, facilitating development of different levels of
service and thereby providing passengers with more choice.

     Air Transport Charges - Marginal costs of accomodating
air traffic tend to be much higher, relative to average costs,
than with railroads and roads. A comparatively small volume of
traffic, in terms of passengers and freight tons, requires
improvements to the runway, airport buildings, navigational
aids, maintenance facilities, etc. Therefore, tariffs should
recover costs of operation, maintenance and routine improvements,
except at very small airports where temporary subsidies may be
desirable until traffic growth is sufficient to cover full-
cost tariffs.   Such subsidies should be provided at
Riberalta, Puerto Suarez, Apolo, Robor~ and an airport in
the San Joaquin region.

     Where airports provide the only access to a region, social
subsidies are in order. Candidates for such subsidies include
Cobija, Guayaramerin, San Matias, Ixiamas, Santa Ana de Yacuma,
San Borja, San Ignacio de Velasco, Ascensi6n de Guarayos and
Fortin Ravelo.

     An increase of one third in AASANA's charges would amount
to only 2 percent of airline operating costs. AASANA charges
should cover normal operating costs and service capital costs
for routine small-scale investments. A general increase in
airport charges to generate the necessary revenues is needed
and is recommended. The increased charges should be based on
a thorough analysis of runway, aircraft servicing, air naVigation,
passenger and freight handling and administration costs
attributable to different classes of aircraft. Large projects,
such as the new Viru Viru airport, and economic and social
subsidies should come from government treasury funds.

     Lloyd A€reo Boliviano - Each route should meet its total
annual costs including operations, depreciation and interest
payments.  Special fares should be introduced to even out
passenger flow during peak periods, and discount fares used to
raise load factors.  LAB indicates historic tariff adjustments
have resulted in some inconsistencies; the revised full-cost
rate structure should reflect the appropriate allocation of
costs among forecast passengers using each route.

      Subsidies for certain routes serving development areas
or remote communities should be designed to increase frequency
of- service; they should not reflect subnormal tariffs.

     With continuing increases in fuel and other costs, a
flexible tariff policy is recommended to keep costs and 'tariffs
in close relationship.

INVESTMENT PROGRAM

        INVESTMENT PROGRAM
             The purpose of this chapter is to bring together all the
        recommendations on investment in infrastructure and equipment
        made in earlier chapters, notably Chapters 11 to 15, and
        present an investment program for the period 1981 to 1990. An
        outline plan for the 1990s is also discussed. The reasoning
        behind the recommendations are not repeated here:  for these
        details, it is necessary to consult the appropriate chapter.

             The recommendations on investment were developed within
        the framework of a likely budget for transport investment in
        the next decade. This aspect is reviewed first, and then
        the recommended investment program is presented by mode. A
        more detailed listing of recommended projects is included in
        Chapter 20.
             All costs are quoted in 1977 pesos when $ US 1 = $b20.
        Due to inflation, the value of the peso has declined so
        that approximately $b 1 (1977) = $b 1.6 (1981). Also, the
        exchange rate has changed so that in 1981,  $ US 1 = $b 25.
        Investment Budgets

             A discussion was presented in Chapter 8 of the rationale
        for defining a budgetary framework, within which to formulate
        an investment program.   It was argued that funds are not
., ,    unlimited and that the sums likely to be available for future
        investment can be predicted, based on past trends and the
        likely future growth of the economy.   It was also argued that
        the share of total investment to be allocated to transport
        could also be estimated based on past trends, and that a
        transport study (as opposed to a study of total investment for
        all sectors) could not reasonably exceed the estimates so made,
        even if worthwhile projects were found.   The transport budget
        so derived includes funding from foreign loans and, since there
        are li.mits to the number of such loans that the country can
~- -~
        safely contract, the possibility of special loans for particu-
        lar transport projects could not be taken as an argument for
        increasing the transport budget. Chapter 8 concluded by pre-
        senting a high and low estimate of the sums likely to be avail-
        able for inter-urban transport investment in the period 1981
        to 1990, assuming that the transport sector would receive 30
        percen~ and 20 percent respectively of total public invest-
        ment funds.

     A certain amount of investment in transport is already
committed -- that is to say, financing is assured and, in most
cases, construction is underway. These commitments restrict
the amounts available for additional expenditure, particularly
in the early period. Committed investments total nearly
$b 13,000 million, of which over $b 6,600 million are
committed for the period 1981-1983. The committed investments
are summarized in Table 18-1.

     The major committed expenditures are for new road projects
which account for nearly half the total commitment. The first
phase of the USAID feeder road program is also taken as
committed (although USAID is currently suspended). Routine
(basic) road maintenance is taken as committed, although the
Study evaluated projects to increase spending on this 1tem.
The committed highway investments are specified in more detail
in Appendix l8A. Other important projects, committing relatively
large sums, are the new airports at Santa Cruz (Viru Viru)
Cobija, Riberalta and Puerto Suarez, the railroad from
Yapacani to RIo Grande and the railroad rehabilitation program
(Phase III).
     These committed sums are compared below with the total
transport budgets estimated previously. A medium budget is
also considered, and the budgets have been allocated to three
periods within the decade.

     The committed sums represent a very large proportion of
the low budget, exceeding the sums available for the first
period and reaching 92 percent of the low budget for the first
and second periods combined. Clearly, an investment program
based on the low budget would be very restricted, particularly
in the first six years.

     Enough projects were justified which would, when combined
with committed projects, account for the sums available under
the high budget. This implies that transport sector investment
could account for 30 percent of all public investment in the next
ten years. Therefore, the basic investment program presented in
this chapter assumes that the high budget will be available.
However, in the discussions of the investment program for each
mode, priorities are indicated in the event that only the
medium, or even the low, budget is available.

     Before discussing the investment program by mode, two
further points are discussed: the treatment of maintenance costs
                                                                          •
and the treatment of Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB) investments in
new aircraft.

Treatment of Maintenance Costs - In the analysis of past transport
investments, and therefore also in the proposed Investment Program,
the total expenditures of SNC are included under Highway Transport,
since all SNC activities are concerned with either investment in
maintenance or investment in infrastructure. These two items
are competing for the same investment funds and it is a specific
requirement of the study to examine the balance between them.

     In the case of air, rail and water transport, much of the
costs of the entities (ENFE, AASANA, etc.) are concerned with
operations of services. Maintenance activities are included
in operations and are somewhat difficult to disentangle in a
completely satisfactory manner.  The costs of operations, and
therefore of maintenance, are not included in the analysis of
past investments.  In projecting investment by these modes, though,
the funds for additional maintenance (necessary to raise
maintenance standards) have been included in the program, since
this requires diversion of funds from infrastructure investment.

      Treatment of LAB Aircrg.ft Investments - Investments in new
aircratt for LAB have been e;{c1uded from the Investment Program,
since such investments can usually be financed commercially
 (that is to say, without aid from international development
agencies) on the basis of projected revenues, and are therefore
treated quite differently from other government investments.
It is noted that in 1978, heavy investment by LAB in new passenger
jets, caused total transport investments to reach an unprecedented
35 percent of public investments, compared with about 30 percent
if LAB aircraft were excluded.
Railroad Investment Program
     The recommended railroad investment program is shown in
Table 18-2. As previously mentioned, three of the items are
considered committed.   These are the rail line from Yapacanl
to Rl0 Grande, now under construction and expected to be
finished in 1985, the track rehabilitation program for 1981
to 1983, a design study for Motacucito-Mutun-Puerto Busch and
general ENFE expanditure for stations, freight yards and
marshalling facilities.   This last item has been increased for
the last part of the decade, when freight traffic is expected
to build up.

     The largest item of additional investment recommended by
the Study is the acquisition of new eqUipment to carry the
forecast increase in freight.  To some extent, these purchases
will depend on the rate of increase ,in freight traffic. However,
it is essential that demand be anticipated adequately, so that
lack of rail equipment does not discourage this growth.

     The second major item is investment in track rehabilitation,
which is recommended by the Study to continue at about the current
pace. The investments for 1981 to 1983 include the completion
of the current program, and the funds for the remainder of the
decade will finance a further 1,070 km. Associated with this is
a sum for increased track maintenance which is recommended for
unrehabilitated lines.   This is in addition to current maintenance r
included in normal ENFE operating costs (not considered here).

     Reconstruction is needed of that part of the Santa Cruz-
Corumba line near Robore which was badly damaged by floods in
January 1979. This is recommended as a program of improvements on
the existing alignment, which can be phased over the entire
period 1981 to 1990, but with most of the expenditure in the
first six years 1981-1986.

      Investment in two new lines are tentatively recommended;
one from Mutun to Motacucito (near Quijarro), the timing of
which depends upon the build-up in production at Mutun; and
one from Guaqui to Desaguadero, which depends upon the Peruvians
completing the line from Puno to Desaguadero. For the latter
project, a design study is recommended immediately.                     ..
     On the basis of the analyses conducted in this Study, the
rail interconnection is not recommended for the 1980s, although
it could possibly be justified economically for the early 1990s.
However, further studies are recommended of the potential for
transit traffic and of a possibly lower cost alignment via
Villa Tunari.  If these further studies demonstrate the economic
feasibility of this project at an earlier date, then the rail
interconnection could be brought forward, perhaps into the late
1980s.  It must be recognized, though, that this is an extremely
expensive project, and to build even one third of the
interconnection in the late 1980s would cost about $b 4,000
million pesos.  This would mean that other projects totalling
an equivalent cost would have to be postponed.

     A design study for the interconnection is included in the
investment program at a cost of $b 200 million for the late
1980s. It is possible that this could be a gift from Brazil,
in whi~h case, these funds could be assigned to the actual
construction of this project (albeit a small contribution).

     In the event of budget limitations, priority should be
given to increased track maintenance and purchases of new
equipment.  The very severe low budget would require the
postponements of most of the fourth phase of the rehabilitation
program, part of the Taperas-Robore reconstruction and all new
construction to the 1990s. The medium budget would permit about
two-thirds of the fourth phase of the rehabilitation program
and most of the Taperas-Robore project in the 1980s, but new
projects would still have to be postponed to the 1990s.

Highway   Inve~tment   Program
     The details of the recommended highway investment program
are shown in Table 18-3, and the recommendations on new or
improved roads are illustrated in Figure 18-1.

   A large part of the Highway Investment Program is for
already committed highway projects, which total $b 7,500
million in the first six years out of a total highway expenditure
of about $b 12,000 million. The major committed projects are
for paved roads between Oruro and Cochabamba, between Chimore
and Yapacanf (opening up a new route between Cochabamba and
Santa Cruz) and from La Paz into the Yungas.  Important
committed projects for unpaved roads include two highways to
Trinidad from Santa Cruz and from La Paz. There are also
other committments to continued highway maintenance.  Highway
commitments are presented in more detail in Appendix 18A.

   New roads recommended by the Study include Las Carreras -
Iscayachi ,(59 km -- gravel) for 1981-1986 and Machacamarca-
Challapata (96 km -- paved)for 1984-1986. The final link in
the Cochabamba-Trinidad road from Eteramazama to San Ignacio
de MOxos (272 km -- gravel) is recommended for 1987-1990.
It is also recommended that the proposed Santa Barbara-Bella
Vista and San Borja-Trinidad roads be redesigned using lower
design standards to reduce estimated costs. On this basis,
they can be justified for the 1980s and are thus included
in the investment program, allowing $b 300 million for San
Borja-Trinidad (228 km) to be spent throughout the period
1981-1990 and $b 1,250 million for Santa Barbara-Bella Vista
(99 km) in 1987-1990.

    New penetration roads and associated feeder roads are also
recommended in northern and eastern Bolivia, totalling
1,610 km.  The two major routes recommended are Trinidad-
Guayaramerfn and Rurrenabaque-Ixiamas-Chive-Cobija.   It is
recommended that these roads be built to keep pace with the
development of the region opened up, and priorities are
given in Chapter 12.                                '

   Improvements are also ,recommended to some 5,000 km of
the existing road system. Of highest priority are
rehabilitation and overlaying of 820 km of existing paved
highways which have been allowed to deteriorate badly, and
much of this work should be carried out in the first three
to six years. Major gravelling of 3,642 km of unpaved road
is also recommended, which includes provision of adequate
drainage and a good gravel surface. Betterment is recommended
for 632 km of higher volume unpaved roads. This is defined
as improvement on the existing alignment and includes widening
to 7 meters, better drainage, improvement of severe curves
and provision of a 6-meter pavement.

         A program of bridge building is recommended in addition
     to the bridges required for the new highway projects specifically
     listed in Table 18-3. Over 100 additional bridges are
     recommended, of which one third are replacements for existing
     inadequate bridges.   In addition, a bridge over the Rio Grande
."   at Puerto Banegas near Santa Cruz is recommended for the period
     1987-1990.

        The investment plan includes an allowance to continue
     work on existing feeder roads at about the same pace as at
     present.

        A large increase in road maintenance expenditure (in
     addition to paved road overlaying and rehabilitation) is
     recommended, with a gradual build up to the higher recommended
     levels during the first three to six years, under the supervision
     of the Pilot Maintenance Study (which started March 1981).
     Linked with the plans for improvements to existing paved roads
     and for better road maintenance, is a program for enforcement
     of vehicle axle loading regulations.

         In the event of stricter budget limitations, it is
     recommended that priority be given to paved road rehabilitation
     and overlaying, to the upgrading of road maintenance and to the
     axle load enforcement program. With the very restrictive low
     budget, much of the program for new penetration and feeder
     roads, as well as three major projects for the last period --
     Santa Barbara-Bella Vista, Eteramazama-San Ignacio and the
     Rio Grande bridge -- would have to be postponed until the 1990s.
     All other programs would be delayed and could not be completed
     as set out in the program presented.   In total, only about half
     the program for new projects could be completed with the low
     budget.

        With the medium budget, the projects Santa Barbara-Bella
     Vista and Eteramazama-San Ignacio, together with about one
     third of the program for new penetration and feeder roads,
     would have to be postponed until the 1990s. The rest of the
     proqram CQuld be completed in the 1980s, although much would
     be delayed until later in the decade than programmed under
     the high budget.

     Air Investment Program

        The recommended investment program is shown in Table 18-4.
     The largest single expenditure is for completing the new
     airport at Santa Cruz (Viru Viru), which is committed.
     Also committed are the new airports at Cobija, Riberalta,
     and Puerto Suarez and improvements at Potosi, Tarija and
     Trinidad. The most important committed project, from the
     point of view of improving aviation throughout the country,
     is the Air Navigation and Communications Equipment Plan.

...          ROAD CONSTRUCTION IN THE BENI
II"
                      (SANTA CRUZ-TRINIDAD)

."
   The most important new project is for an airport
rehabilitation plan, designed to improve conditions at
sixteen small airports for F-28 jet and F-27 turboprop
operations.

   At Cochabamba, two projects are included. The first is
a runway extension in the first period, recommended for safety
reasons.  In the last period, a large sum is tentatively included
for the construction of a new runway and terminal at the existing
airport, which may be required for safety reasons.  However,
this latter project should only proceed following a
definite decision to postpone the proposed relocation of
Cochabamba Airport to Santa Lucia for at least twenty years ~ (1).

   The projects at La Paz and Potosi are to make substantial
improvements to the existing airports.  Proposals to relocate
either of these airports would have to be subject to detailed
feasibility studies.

   In the event of budget restrictions, priorities should
be given to the Airport Rehabilitation Plan and to improved
maintenance.  Under the low budget, the new runway and
terminal at Cochabamba and part of the improvements at La Paz,
would have to be postponed until the 1990s. Under the medium
budget, only the Cochabamba project would have to be postponed.
In both cases, the remaining new projects would be delayed to
later in the decade then programmed for the high budget.

Water Transport Investment Program

   Details of the recommended investment program are given
in Table 18-5. There are no committed projects.

   The main project is for a port on the Paraguay River. An
initial development is included in the period 1984-1986 and an
extension in the period 1987-1990. The timing of the different
stages of this project depends upon the rate of development of
a Mutun based iron ore or iron pellet export project. Funds
are also allocated for the purchase of river barges in the
last period. The location of the Paraguay River port has yet
to be decided.  Investments are shown for the port investment
only, and do not include the additional costs of the rail link
from Mutun to Puerto Busch or for land reclamation, both
required for the Puerto Busch alternative.

   The remaining projects for water transport are for the
purchase of boats and equipment for clearing obstructions in the
Ichilo-Mamore river system, and for the purchase of equipment
for four small ports on this river system.

   Under the low budget, the second stage of the Paraguay River
Port and the related barge purchases, would have to be postponed
until the 1990s. Under the medium budget, no changes would be
necessary to the water transport program.

Summary of the Recommended 1981-1990 Investment Program

   Table 18-6 summarizes the recommended 1981-1990 investment
program and compares with the estimated low, medium and high
budgets for transport investment. Total recommended
expenditure on transport investment is $b 33,631 million in the
ten years 1981-1990, approximately the total estimated to be
available under the high budget. This would imply that trans-
port obtains 30 percent of the funds estimated to be available
for public investment in this period.  It is perhaps unlikely
that such a high sum will be available and so project priorities
have been indicated in the preceeding pages in the event that
only the medium or even the low budgets will be available.
   Some projects in the later period are dependent on special
factors, such as the rate of development of Mutun, the need
to build another runway at Cochabamba airport and on
whether the Peruvians complete the Puno-Desaguadero railroad.
Therefore, there is some flexibility in the last period. The
main problems are likely to be felt in the first two periods
when the high budget for transport is definitely desirable.

   Of the total program, the largest share is for highways
which would account for 63 percent of total spending, similiar
to the 64 percent average of non LAB transport investments
for the past seven years. Of the highway share, over 40 percent
is already committed. About 17 percent of investments are
allocated to rail, which is considerably le&s than the 29 percent
average for ENFE and COMIXTA for the past seven years.
The share of alr lnfrastructure investments doubles from 7
percent in the past seven years to 15 percent. Water transport,
which previously accounted for almost no investment, takes
5 percent of the total.

Transport Projects for the 1990s

    It is not possible, nor very desirable, to be specific
in recommending projects for a period starting in ten years
time. There are so many uncertainties on such matters as the
general growth of the economy, the likelihood of discovering
new resources (particularly of minerals and hydrocarbons)
and the pace of development of transport infrastructure in
the 1980s. Also, changes in the world outside may have a
strong influence on the development of Bolivia, but are
impossible to predict with any certainty.   It is possible,
though, to indicate in general terms transport projects which
could become necessary in the 1990s, if the country continues
to develop on the lines set out in this report. That is the
object of this section.

   Budget Restraints - The economic situation in the 1990s
is likely to be easier that is expected for the 1980s and
consequently, more funds should be available for investment.
Estimates were presented in Chapter 8 of possible non,..,.urban
transport budgets, which range from a pessimistic estimate
of $b 28,500 million to an optimistic estimate of $b 75,800
million (expressed in 1977 pesos). Thus at least as much
money should be available in 1990s as is expected in the
1980s, with the probability that there will be very much more.
At this stage, projects can be identified which would cost
a total of about $b 53,000 million to implement, and so it
is not thought that budget limitations will be very stringent
in the 199 Os.

   Railroads - The major contents of a railroad   investm~nt
program for the 1990s are outlined below:



             ITEM                       COST
                                      ($b millions)
  Rail Interconnection                  11,400
  (Cochabamba-Santa Cruz)
  Track Rehabilitation                  2,000
  Rail Equipment                        5,000
  General                               1,600

  Total                                20,000



   The major investment would be in the rail interconnection.
It is emphasized that this is not a recommendation of the Study.
since more studies need to be completed, particularly on
international transit traffic.  However, an optimistic view
can be taken that the likely volumes of traffic, and revenues
therefrom, will be sufficient to iustify this line.  It is
also noted that further studies of this project may result
in an economic justification for the late 1980s. However,
financial restrictions would probably make it difficult to
complete much of the project in the 1980s, and the bulk of
expenditure would almost certainly occur in the 1990s.

   Although track rehabilitation does not appear to be well
justified at current traffic volumes, the situation would be
quite different if raii freight volumes grow as predicted by
the Study.  Therefore,' it is assumed that rehabilitation of
the remainder of the rail system will be necessary
in the 1990s. Similarly, the item for equipment requirements
has been based on freight traffic forecasts by the Study.




                        -461-
   Highways - The major items of a possible highway investment
program for the 19905 are shown below:



            ITEM                     LENGTH        COST
                                      (km)     ($b million)
Betterment                            3,600        9,400
Overlaying existing pavements         2,500        2,500
Major gravelling                      2,500        1,500
New penetration and, f2!eder roads    1,500        2,000
Existing feeder roads                              1,500
Bridges                              10,000 (1)    1,600
Road maintenance (Additional to                    5,000
                         current)
Total                                             23,500

(1)     Length in meters



   This investment program implies a large increase in the
length of paved roads, more than doubling the length of road
expected to be paved by 1989, which itself represents almost
a doubling of the paved system today. By the end of the 1990s,
it can be expected that the main roads from La Paz to Bermejo,
Santa Cruz to Yacuiba and Potosi to Epizana will be completely
paved.  It is also suggested that the gravel roads to Trinidad,
currently under construction or recommended by the Study, could
also be paved, as well as the road from Trinidad to Guayaramerin,
and Riberalta. This would produce a dramatic change in the
accessibility of these remote regions compared with today.

   Two obvious gaps in the paved road system envisaged for
the year 2000 would be the link from Tarija to Villamontes
and the Uncia-Sucre-Ipati road.  In both cases, construction
costs would be very high due to the difficult terrain, and
forecast traffic volumes (made assuming that the roads would
be paved) do not warrant more investments than the major
gravelling recommended for the 1980s, apa~t from a section
of betterment from Sucre to Padilla. Clearly though, this
cannot be a final decision and the potential for these two
routes must be re-examined nearer the time. A factor which
could influence the decision on Uncia-Sucre-Ipati would be
international interest in completing the Pan-American highway,
of which this road forms a part.




                            -462-
    The 1,500 km of penetration and feeder roads would complete
the priority system shown in Chapter 12, and also the link
Nacebe-Humait~ (in Pando).   Other penetration roads could be
built, but much depends on the success of migration and rural
development schemes associated with these roads.   It is
recommended that the success of schemes undertaken in the
1980s should be carefully monitored, before committing further
investment.

   The road maintenance program for the 1980s is assumed
to continue.  It is expected that all paved r.oads in place
in the late 1980s will require overlaying at some time
in the 1990s.

   Air Transport -  The major elements of a possible
investment program for the air sector are as follows:


             ITEM                ESTIMATED COST
                                   ($b rnillion)

   New Airports                       6,000

   LAB and AASANA general             1,500

   Total                              7,500


     Most of the identified costs refer to new airport construc-
tion, including runway paving at San Ignacio de Velasco, Yacuiba,
San Borja and Santa Ana de Yacuma, and for possible airport re-
location for Cochabamba, La Paz, Oruro, Trinidad and Potosi. Air-
port relocation would generally be justifie'd on urban planning
grounds rather than on any lack of capacity or other problems
at the airports themselves.  The exception is Potosi where re-
location could be required for safety reasons.

     If relocation of Cochabamba airport does prove to be neces-
sary, then the recommendation for the 1980s to build a new run-
way and terminal at the existing site should not go ahead. There-
fore the alternatives for Cochabamba must be thoroughly evaluated
before commitments are made to the 1980s investments.

     Water Transport - The major elements of an investment pro-
gram for water transport are shown below:


                     ITEM                          COST
                                               ($b million)

           Paraguay River Port (third stage)         300
           River Fleet                             1,500
           Lake Titicaca RO-RO Facility              200

           Total                                   2,000
                              -463-
                                                                   •
     The third stage of the Paraguay River Port and the river
fleet -- barges to take iron ore -- will depend on the rate
                                                                   .
of expansion at Mutun. The last item, RO-RO facilities on Lake
Titicaca at Guaqui, will depend on whether or not the Peruvians
extend their railroad from Puno to Desaguadero.  If they do,
then clearly the new lake facility will not be required.

     Summary of Possible Investments in the JQQOs - The table
below summarizes the possible investments for the 1990s by mode:

                       ($b million)

                                                                   ·t
       Water               2,000                4
                                                                   •
       Total              53,000              100



     In addition to these investments, it may also be worth-
while to extend the YPFB petroleum products pj_peline system
from Villamontes to Tarija in the 1990s, at an estimated cost
of $b 650 million for a 4-inch line.

     Under such a program, the expenditure on all modes would
increase from the 1980s. A change from previous patterns of
investment would be the large switch from high\'lays to rail,
broug~t about mainly by the inclusion of the rail interconnec-
tion in this program. Possibly more could be required for
highways to develop more penetration roads. For example, the
development of penetration roads and associated feeder roads
to open up the potentially rich agricultural area of the Tuca...
vaca valley would cost an additional 900 million pesos, and
completion of all the penetration roads evaluated in Chapter
12 would cost $b 6,000 million beyond the $b 2,500 million
included in the investment plan for the 1980s, and the $b 2,000
million included in the outline plan for tha ID90s.    Imple-
mentation of more penetration and feeder road projects than
so far recommended or suggested, should depend on the success
of the recommended schemes in spurring economic development
in their areas of influence.

     Figure 18-2 summarizes the main features of the transport
system which could be in place by the year 2000.

      CHAPTER 19

      FUTURE TRANSPORT PLANNING
           Together with several short-term recommendations on
      transport policy, the principal product of this Study has been
      the definition of an investment program for the transport
      sector. This program reflects basic assumptions regarding the
      country's economic development, a most complex matter which
      cannot be predicted with certainty. The likelihood exists,
      therefore, that some of the analyses and conclusions will
      have to be updated in the light of unforeseen developments or
      decisions.
           The need for review of plans is by no means unique to
      Bolivia, but is a general feature of medium and long-term
      transport planning. Thus, planning must be seen not only as
      the development of an initial action program, but also as a
      continuous activity of providing the facts and figures
      required by those who have to make the country's decisions.
      Use of Comprehensive Transport Planning
           The decision makers face a difficult task, particularly
      with regard to transport investment. There are five competing
      modes, each with an organization demanding from central
      government its share, and maybe more, of the country's scarce
      financial resources. It was mentioned before that for road
      and rail alone, projects suggested in the past would cost
      about five times as much as Bolivia can afford to spend in
      the next ten years on transport investments. Similarly, the
      nine departments have differing views how these resources
      should be distributed among the regions. While such pressure
      on government is natural, it is important to ensure that
      investment decisions are made in the interest of the country
      as a whole, rather than just responding to the pressures of
..
"     a particular transport mode or geographical ~egion.
           The methods employed in comprehensive transport planning
      address this very question. Projects of all modes are
      analyzed together, using the same criteria of economic
      evaluation. A transport model of the type used in this Study
      predicts future flows embracing all relevant transport
      services and thereby assessing the competitive position of
      each mode in each particular corridor throughout the country.

     In contrast, a standard feasibility study usually centers
on only one mode in one particular corridor and tends to
justify the transport investment it investigates. The comparison
of several such studies, to determine which of the examined
projects deserves the highest priority, is normally difficult       ,
because of the differences in the methods and criteria
employed. This does not mean that detailed feasibility studies
of transport infrastructure projects are wasted efforts; they
are often required to investigate details of the function and
the planned construction of the transport facility, after the
overall priorities are established, and before construction
plans are prepared.                                                 '.
     Establishing the overall priorities in a scientific manner
will benefit the economy as a whole. Especially in a country       "11

with a large foreign debt and a limited investment budget, it
is vital that these investments be made wisely, generating
benefits which will make later investments possible, and thereby
aiding the country's development.
     It is sometimes stated that any transport investment would
be useful, and that the country should therefore move ahead
with building roads, railroads and airports without wasting
time and money on studies. Nothing is further from the truth;
this report demonstrates how many bad investments might be
made, thereby preventing more useful projects from being built.
A glaring example of past misinvestment is the railroad
construction to the Yungas: new investments were made as late
as the 1950s, and only a decade later the rail line was
abandoned for lack of use.
     Apart from providing the data to make sound investment
deciSions, comprehensive transport planning can also benefit
other aspects of transport policy, both national and inter-
national. The establishment and updating of a data base on
transport costs, flows and other characteristics related to
the movement of goods and persons is required for any govern-
ment agency that must negotiate with transport operators about
tariffs, or with foreign governments about transit rights,
improved transport connections or possible credits for
investment projects.
     It was mentioned before that comprehensive transport
planning is a continuing process. The present Study has
launched this process, and it is important that the momeritum
of scientific transport planning be maintained. The remainder
of this chapter deals with this subject.

      Planning for Transport in Bolivia
           Great economic benefits can be derived from a relatively
      small investment in an advisory group engaged in comprehensive
      transport planning. In the past, this function had been
      assigned to the Directorate of Planning and Coordination
      (DPC) in the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Civil
      Aeronautics. Partly as a consequence of many staff changes
      and partly because of the day-to-day demands made on its
01'
      senior professionals by other sections in the Ministry of
      Transport, the Directorate of Planning and Coordination has
      been less effective than was envisaged at its creation. Its
      actual functions are limited largely to the establishment of
      annual budgets, the registry of construction companies and
      the keeping of some basic statistics, without however
      providing much analysis. To remedy this absence of effective
"'"   planning and coordination between the various transport modes,
      this Study now proposes the creation of a new National
      Transport Center (CNT) to take over the function of long-
      term planning from DPC. Before discussing the possible
      activities of the proposed Center, the planning functions of
      other entities are reviewed, including those of DPC.
           Directorate of Planning and Coordination - Created in
      1970, DPC was assigned a mixture of tasks, ranging from long-
      term transport planning to short-term budget programming for
      the Ministry of Transport. Among the other functions are
      those to keep a variety of statistics and a registry of
      construction companies, to monitor the implementation of
      transport projects, to coordinate between the various transport
      modes and to advise on transport matters to be included in
      international agreements.
           At present, DPC consists of 17 employees, of whom 5 are
      university graduates. The two top positions of DPC are filled
      by officials who also have other responsibilities within the
      Ministry and who therefore can spend only part of their
      effort in directing the directorate. Moreover, DPC has in
      recent years lost several of its professional staff. Some
      of these transferred in 1978 to the counterpart team of the
      National Transport Study, which then effectively took over
      DPC's function of long-term transport planning.
           It is now recommended that the functions of DPC be
      directed more to the short-term planning needs of the Ministry
      of Transport and that long-term planning be left to the
      proposed National Transport Center (CNT).
           The proposed organization for DPC is shown in Figure
      19-1; its staff would amount to 19 employees including the
      Director.

     The suggested functions are described below:

     • Elaborate the annual operating budgets for the
       transport and communications sector and make the
       necessary adjustments or updates to the medium and
       long term financial plans, based on the criteria and
       priorities recommended by the National Transport Center.

     • Present the annual budgets to government for approval
       and perform the necessary administrative procedures to
       put them into force.

     • Draft the texts for regulations, legal dispositions
       or policy measures proposed by CNT.

    • Monitor the implementation of the plans, programs and
      policies approved for the transport sector.

    • Propose the revision or modifications of international
      agreements regarding transport, or the signing of new
      ones.

     • Coordinate the participation of the transport and
       communications sector in meetings concerning integration
       or international aspects.

    • Process statistics relative to transport and communi-
      cations; issue and distribute bulletins.

    • Keep a register of the construction companies that will
      allow, in a reliable manner, their technical and economic
      certification.

     Planning Departments of the Transport A encies - The
autonomous state transport compan1es an ent1t1es, such as
SNC, ENFE or LAB, have their own planning departments.  It is
important that their functions be set within an overall
framework of planning responsibilities. The assignment of
responsibilities must be clearly defined, not only to avoid
the duplication of effort among the various agencies, but also
to ensure that no gaps exist in the planning process.

     The functions suggested for the planning departments of
autonomous transport entities are as follows:

     •   Maintain an inventory of all candidate projects of
         the transport mode being considered, ranging from
         conceptual ideas to those which are in the
         implementation phase.

          National Railroad Company - ENFE's planning department
     has been created through Company Disposition No. 18/57 in
     compliance with Article 9 of the Law for the National
     Planning System, approved by Supreme Decree No. 11848 of
     October 3, 1974. It has the following functions:

          •   Conduct research on the supply and demand of railroad

     •   Elaborate and keep up-to-date the inventory of ENFE's
         projects, evaluate them periodically and establish
                                                                  '.

     •   Assist in the elaboration of ENFE's budget.

     •   Provide the necessary standards and criteria to guide
         and coordinate the preparation of statistics.

     •   Guide and coordinate the studies on operating costs
         and tariffs.

    •    Guide and coordinate the studies on general aspects
         of the national economy.

    •    Program the technical assistance for the company.

    •    Establish and maintain a data file on the national
         economy.

     The National Transport Center - Experience shows that the
establishment of DPC as a mere Ministry Directorate was an
inadequate solution to medium and long-term transport planning.
It is therefore proposed to create a new autonomous entity
under the Ministry of Transport and Communications to perform
this function.

     The main purpose of this entity, which could be named
"National Transport Center" (CNT) , would be to give
scientifically derived advice to the decision levels. Among
CNT's specific functions, the following can be mentioned:

     •   Provide technical coordination on transport priorities
         between the Ministry of Transport, the recently
         created Aeronautics Ministry, and the Subsecretariat
         of Maritime, River and Lake interests, established in
         January 1981 under the Ministry of Defense.

     •   Prepare a timetable for the implementation of this
         Study's recommendations regarding investments and
         regulatory measures.

     It,is thought at this stage that, at least initially,
the Natlonal Transport Center would have a relatively small
staff, consisting of about ten professionals plus supporting
personnel, selected from this Study's counterpart team. The
functions to be performed would be in line with the organization
chart shown in Figure 19-2, although CNT's staff would have
to be flexible and have the capability to perform several
functions within the center.

Phase II of National Transport Study

     The initial two years of the continuing transport planning
activities have already been laid down in the Project Document
signed by the Bolivian Government and the United Nations
Development Programme. Defined as Phase II of the National
Transport Study, the work will be conducted primarily by
Bolivian professionals, with the technical participation of
two expatriates, an engineer and an economist. The initial
activities of this group will be centered around the
implementation of the recommendations contained in this report.
This is likely to require additional analyses to answer
questions related to particular Study recommendations, tasks
whichare very similar to the updating of the Study's findings,
mentioned before.

     It is proposed that the work defined under Phase II of
the Project Document be already conducted within the framework
of the National Transport Center (CNT). At the time of writing
this report, the size of CNT and the professional capabilities
of its members have not yet been decided, and it is therefore
not possible to define a detailed work program for 1981 and
1982. The next section describes those tasks that must be
achieved during this time, while the section thereafter
outlines certain additional activities which would be beneficial
to the country but which may have to be abandoned or postponed
depending on the work capacity that will be given to CNT.

     Principal Tasks - The most important initial activity of
CNT concerns the lmplementation of the recommendations
summarized in Chapter 20 of this report. With regard to
proposed infrastructure improvements, numerous documents
have to be prepared and decisions made before the first
bulldozer starts work. Thus, upon approval of this Study's
recommendations, CNT should set up -- in coordination with the
relevant Government Agencies -- detailed timetables for the
implementation of each project. These would consider the           'i '


following:
   •   Additional feasibility study where required
   •   Approval of recommendations made in that study
   •   Financing plan for project
   •   Preparation of final designs and construction
       specifications
   •   Review and approval of documents for construction
       contract
   •   Letting of construction contract
   •   Construction
   •   Definition and letting of other associated contracts.

           Associated with this task is the clear assignment of
      res onsibilities connected with the above ste~s.  These
      would be established based on guidelines rece~ved from th~
      Minister of Transport, and CNT woul~ act as ov~rall coord~na~or,
      monitoring the progress of pro~e~t ~mplementat~on and prepar~ng
      brief monthly reports to the M~n~ster.
           Where further feasibility studies are re~uir~d, the Terms
      of Reference would be prepared in close coord~nat~on ~etween
      CNT and the relevant government agencies •. As appropr~ate,
      CNT would also monitor progress and techn~cal content of
      these studies.  In certain cases, CNT could be called upon by
      government to prepare small studies themselves.
           Among the recommended infrastructure projects, at least
      the following will require more detailed studies before final
b     design plans are prepared:

           •   Rail interconnection Santa Cruz-Cochabamba
           •   Rail line Motacucito-Mut6n
           •   Rail line Guaqui-De~aguader6
           •   Rail passenger services to zones not otherwise served

.'         •
           •
               by ground transport
               Port on the Paraguay River
               New airports at La Paz and Cochabamba, to be considered

..         •
           •
               as urban planning projects
               High-grade gravel surfaces for selected airports
               Road Santa Barbara-Bella Vista
           •   Pilot project of road betterment with paving and
               associated analyses.


           Depending on their urgency, the Terms of Reference for
      these studies should be prepared, or reviewed where they
      already exist, either in the first or second year of Phase II.
      On those projects for which the preparation of construction
      documents can proceed, CNT should periodically review the
      basis for their justification. Should there be a major
      departure from the assumptions inherent in Phase I of the Study,
      any project could still be stopped or postponed before its
      construction is fully committed.

           With regard to the Study~s recommendations on tariff and
      regulatory policies, CNT should also prepare a timetable for
      their implementation, and then monitor its fulfillment.  Very
      importantly, it should develop an action program to gradually
      change ENFE's tariffs as recommended in Chapter 17. In addition,
      it should follow up on the reorganization and strengthening
      recommended for the Ministry of Transport's Direcci6n General
      de Transporte Automotor.  It should also review progress
to.
      achieved in the procedural improvements recommended for the
      vehicle register, maintained by the Servicio Nacional de Transito.

     Another important function of CNT, during Phase II and
                                                                 '.
beyond, will be to give continuing advice to the Minister of
Transport.  To some degree, this can be achieved in the
preparation of monthly reports, but in addition such advice
may have to be given on an ad-hoc basis. The knowledge of
transport matters acquired by CNT's team during Phase I of
the Study makes them specially qualified for this function.
As a complement, further analyses -- including applications
of the transport model -- may be required during Phase II
to respond to particular problems.                               •
     Additional Tasks - Any of the activities outlined earlier
for CNT could logically be included in the Terms of Reference
for Phase II. However, these must be weighed against
CNT's initial staffing with a view that they do not exceed
its capacity; in any case the principal tasks defined in the
preceding paragraphs must receive priority.

     With the transport model, Bolivia has now a useful tool
to assess the transport implication of new planning policies.
Thus, CNT could make a valuable contribution to the Ministry
of Planning and other government entities in their overall
economic planning for the country.

     CNT could also give advice on data collection procedures,
with a view of creating a regularly updated data bank for
the transport sector, in coordination with the National
Statistics Institute (INE) and the Directorate of Planning
and Coordination of the Ministry of Transport. The transport
data collected during Phase I should be regularly updated,
which requires a particular effort in the case of road
transport because of its dispersed nature.  In addition to
SNC's traffic counting program and the recommended updating
of the vehicle register, it is proposed to conduct at least
every two years a sample roadside interview survey to monitor
trends in vehicle loadings, cargo carried, trip lengths,
and origin-destination patterns. While these surveys might
best be under the direction of SNC, their design should be
closely coordinated with CNT.

      Integration with Other Studies - The United Nations
Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL), in response to
a resolution passed at its April 1979 conference, has set up
a project to improve transport conditions of South America's
two landlocked countries, Bolivia and Paraguay.   This project
will commence in early 1981 and will be staffed, for its
Bolivian operation, by one expatriate transport economist and
several local counterparts. Some arrangements have already
been made to organize CEPAL's project within the framework
of CNT which would, in fact, provide the local counterpart
team.

         It can be expected that other transport projects may be
    funded by international organizations. Normally, these
    stipulate a local counterpart team; it is proposed that this
    be integrated with CNT, similar to the project on landlocked
    countries. Very preliminary discussions in this direction
    have already taken place, concerning a study of the inter-
    national transport corridors in the Amazon basin, sponsored
    by the Institute for Latin American Integration (INTAL).

         Reports - It was already proposed in this section that
    CNT prepare monthly reports (in Spanish) to the Minister of
    Transport, advising him on the progress achieved with the
•   implementation of this Study's recommendations. As
    appropriate, these reports should make specific proposals on
    how to deal with delays and other problems that are certain
    to occur.

          In addition, more elaborate reports should be prepared
    every six months, also describing progress achieved and
    problems encountered with tne implementation of the Study's
    recommendations. These reports would be published in both
    English and Spanish and would be distributed to the appropriate
    government agencies as well as the World Bank and the United
    Nations Development Programme.

          The first of these reports should -- besides reporting
    on implementation progress -- contain a detailed work
    program for the remainder of Phase II. Morever, it should
    contain the timetables for the implementation of the Study's
    recommendations, as discussed earlier in this section.

         In Phase I, about 60 working   papers were published to
    document technical details of the   Study. Many further working
    papers exist in draft form, while   outlines have been prepared
    for others still. It is proposed    that CNT continue publishing
    these working papers during Phase   II at a rate which is
    commensurate with its staffing.

    Future Use of the Transport Model

         An important product of this Study has been the develop-
    ment of a computerized transport model together with a group
    of staff trained in its use. This model is capable of a wide
    variety of uses during the coming years.

         In the first instance, there is the use of the model as
    it stands. This could be required for a range of reasons
    involving changes of socio-economic data or transport plans.
    For example, the Study has assumed that the Mut~n iron works
    will be operational by 1989. If it should become clear in
    the future that this is notso,~would also affect the related



                             -475-
                                                                  •

developments in Santa Cruz and Cochabamba, then it could be
useful to use the model to estimate the impact on transport
flows.

     Indeed, monitoring of trends in population, GDP and goods
production over the next few years may show that the Study's
forecasts have been overly optimistic or pessimistic.   This
again would require the use of the model. For reasons of
time, the model has only been run completely for the most
likely 1999 development pattern, and i t would add greatly
to the knowledge of future transport if i t could also be run
for the other two patterns.

     With respect to transport plans, i t is certain that ideas
will be proposed in the near future, possibly as a result of
this report, for new transport facilities, which will require
evaluation. An example here could be an alignment for the
rail interconnection radically different from those tested by
the Study.   The use of the model in the manner described
above could prevent the misallocation of resources which might
result froID following a fixed plan based on assumptions that
are no longer valid.

     A second possibility is that the methodology developed
could be applied in different ways.  Thus regional models
could be built to provide more detailed information on smaller
areas of the country. The basic form of the model would
probably be unchanged but the number of zones in the region
would be increased and more network links included. The
results would show more accurately local flows on links
and provide information on links not currently included in
the main transport networks.

     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
••
        This Report is the result of two years of detailed study
     of the Bolivian transport system and of its ability to respond
     to the transport demands of the next twenty years.  The overall
     conclusion concerning the policy that should be pursued to the
     best advantage of the country as a whole, is that efforts should
..   be directed not so much towards massive investment in new infra-
     structure but towards improving and increasing the use of the
     facilities that already exist.  Bolivia possesses a substantial
     amount of infrastructure, but as has been demonstrated, the level
     of utilization, almost everywhere, is very low. This is as true
     of the roads as of the railroads, and similarly the airport sys-
     tem could support a far greater level of movements without
     encountering capacity constraints.

        Thus the recommendations contained within the body of the
     Report have been aimed at encouraging higher levels of use of
     existing investments.  Encouragement takes three forms --
     through a rationalized and coordinated set of tariffs, through
     removal of organizational obstacles which impede development,
     and through investment in infrastructure. This last is devoted
     principally to an upgrading of the present facilities, although
     some additional links are considered, mainly in the as yet
     underdeveloped regions of the country.

        In order that the investment plan proposed by the study
     should be realistic, account has to be taken of the money that
     is likely to be available to the transport sector during the
     1980s and 1990s. To this end, past budget allocations have been
     analyzed and it has been shown that transport has accounted for
     between 20 and 30 percent of overall spending in recent years.
     The recommended investments, therefore, have been selected to
     correspond to a range of possible future budgets from a "low" of
     20 percent of overall spending, to a "high" of 30 percent, during
     the 1980s.  In the 1990s the economy as a whole is expected to
     grow considerably, and the budget constraint is of less importance.

        It is against this background of limited investment potential
     in the 1980s, and a general policy objective of increasing the
     use of existing infrastructure, that the main conclusions and
     recommendations of the Study are now presented.

Future Tariff Policy

   Given the underutilization of current infrastructure, there
is an obvious attraction in charging tariffs that cover only
marginal transport costs, in order to place no unnecessary dis-
couragement on the growth of traffic and on the economic activity
that this reflects.  It is proposed therefore that a main aim of
tariff policy should be to charge low tariffs where this might
encourage traffic. On no account, however, should the tariff
be less than the marginal costs attributable to the traffic. This
approach could lead to deficits on infrastructure costs on roads,
railroads and perhaps airports, but it is recommended that these
be met in a way more benefictal to the economy than high trans-       '.
port t.ariffs.
   At present, ENFE freight tari s are related to estimates of
average total cost, including substantial arbitrary allocations       ';11

of fixed costs.  It is recommended that ENFE's tariff policy for
freight should move towards lower rates for domestic traffic
where this can be expected to attract a substantial volume of
new traffic in the long term. The rates should not fall below
long-run marginal costs and should be reduced in stages as ENFE's
capability to handle the traffic increases. Two methods are
proposed for meeting any shortfall in revenue: (i) tariffs should
be raised on inelastic traffic, notably external, and, if this
cross-subsidization is not sufficient, (ii) a bonus should be paid
by government for each ton over a stated minimum volume for a
particular commodity and route.

   For rail passenger traffic it is thought that the current
tariffs do not in all cases cover the marginal cost of the
traffic.  It is recommended that in these cases they should be
raised so as to do so.

   Road freight traffic, is at present in the hands of truckers'
syndicates, and under the circumstances, a government-fixed
tariff is essential.  It has been proposed that modifications to      '.
the regulations be made to control better the syndicates' power
and to permit a freer tariff policy_ The policy recommended is
that of forked tariffs, i.e. a system of maximum and minimum
tariffs between which operators may set their tariffs.

   With buses, the same principles apply, although   less
flexibility in tariffs is possible since published   fares must
be available to passengers.  However, some freedom   should be
given to operators to fix their own tariffs and to   introduce dis-
count schemes and surcharges if they wish.

   For airports, the marginal costs of accommodating traffic
tend to be much higher relative to average costs than with
railroads and roads.  Thus there is little economic case for a
tariff policy which fails to recover costs of operations,
maintenance and routine improvements, and    is recommended

                        -478-
      that AASANA raise its charges to do so. Exceptions would be
      made for airports in development areas, airports where social
      subsidies are justified, and major new airports such as Viru Viru.

         The normal goal for LAB, which has no infrastructure and
      not much competition on internal routes, should be that each
      route should cover its total cost.   As LAB did not cover its
      costs in 1979, this would imply a general increase in fares.
      Exceptions could be made on some routes for developmental or
      social reasons.

'"    Transport Infrastructure

         The recommendations on    transport infrastructure (beyond what
      is already committed) are    listed below by mode, giving, where
      appropriate, the scale of    the project and the recommended timing
      and cost.   The Investment   Plan as a whole is discussed in
      Chapter 18.

           It is emphasized that all these recommendations are subject
      to the findings of detailed feasibility studies, which should
      include analyses of costs, benefits and modal competition for
      each individual project.

         Rai~roads   - Four projects are recommended as follows:

         4. Track rehabilitation 1,070       1984-1990      1 2 000


          The first project depends on the speed with which the Mutun
       iron production expands, and the second project depends on when
      the Peruvian line from Puno to Desaguadero is completed. A
      design study is recommended for Guaqui-Desaguadero immediately.
      A study is also recommended of the rail system interconnection
      towards the end of the 1980s.

         Although the rail interconnection is not recommended for the
      1980s on the basis of the evaluations made by this Study, it is
      recommended that further investigations Cl.re conducted -- of a
      more northerly alignment via Villa Tunari, and of the potential
      for transit traffic.   If these studies prove favorable, the
      priority for the interconnection can be advanced.

     Road Maintenance and Organization of SNC

         The Study has confirmed the findings of the 1978 World Bank
    mission, that ro~d maintenance standards need to be substantially
    upgraded.

         On paved roads, patching should be intensified from current
    negligible levels and routine surface dressing introduced. For
    gravel roads, better graded gravel should be used, together
    with watering and compacting techniques. With these improvements,
    frequency of grading on gravel roads could be reduced from current
    levels. On the other hand, more intensive grading and spot
    gravelling is required on earth roads.

         It is assumed that this basic policy will be introduced over
    the next four years under the ~uoervision of the pilot Maintenance
    Study '$tarted March 1981). It is also e~pected that more detailed
    analyses during the pilot Maintenance Study will lead to changes
    in the details of the program for specific regions.

         Regarding organization, it is recommended that SNC's
    central office be reorganized to promote interdepartmental
    contact and better managerial control. Three new subdirectorates
    are proposed, each of which would oversee the work of several
    departments. They are as follows:

        •      Planning and Design Subdirectorate
        •      Construction and Maintenance Subdirectorate
        •      Administrative Subdirectorate

                                -485-
     The Construction and Maintenance Subdirectorate would consist
of the existing departments of Maintenance, Equipment, Bridges,       ••
Construction and Feeder Roads.  The Finance and Administration
Departments would come under the Administrative Subdirectorate.
     The Planning and Design Subdirectorate would include the
existing Departments of Planning and Design and would also
incorporate the functions of the Economic Advisor.   In addition,
it is suggested that consideration be given to the creation of
a Studies and Investigation Department, under the same sub-
directorate. The aim of this new department would be to perform
certain 'basic road research relevant to Bolivian conditions,
and to strengthen SNC's capability in conducting or supervising
economic feasibility studies.

Organization of Road Transport

     It is apparent that the present organizational structure
of the road transport industry has led to the concentration of
power in the hands of the operators syndicates. This in turn
has contributed to an even distribution of service throughout
the country and a generally inefficient utilization of the
truck fleet.

      It is recommended that government presence in this sector
be strengthened by reinforcing the General Directorate of ~ad
Transport (DGTA) of the Ministry of Transport, through an increase
in its manpower and the creation of regional offices. The DGTA,
and not the synidicates should be responsible for determining
the number of operating permits to be issued annually, on the
basis of observed demand for service.   If insufficient service
is provided in a particular area, the DGTA should impose its
provision in the public interest. As an interim measure in the
reorganization of the sector it is recommended that no further
road transport vehicles should be permitted to be imported during
1981.

     The SNC and Transito toll system now costs as much to operate
as it procures in revenues, while imposing costly delays on road
users.  It is recommended that it be abolished except on some
specific roads (such as the La Paz autopista).   It is recommended
that revenues for road improvement and maintenance be obtained
from revised fuel and tire taxes and higher import duties.

     More emphas   should be placed on the enforcement of axle load
limits. It appears possible that some transito stations could be
converted into permanent weighing stations; tH~se would be supple-
mented by spot checks throughout the road system, using movable
scales.

     There is a lack of reliable data concerning the size and
nature of the vehicle fleet in the country. The present register
maintained by SNT should be computerized and regular reporting
and updating procedures introduced.  Insurance should be made
compulsory for cargo and passengers carried on public services;
consideration should be given to the introduction of compulsory
third-party insurance for all vehicles circulating on public
roads.




                          -487-
Rail Transport
                                                                        '"
     The main recommendation on rail is that a major change is          •
made in tariff policy in order to make rail transport more
attractive for domestic freight.  Tariffs for most domestic
traffic should be set somewhere between marginal costs and the
currently used average costs.  Tariffs for external traffic,
and for similarly inelastic domestic traffic, can be continued
at current levels, or even raised slightly. Exact tariff levels
will depend upon more detailed studies by ENFE1s costing department.

     It is expected that the tariff policy change will result
in a large increase in freight movements.  This will require
new equipment and, above all, adequate planning to ensure that
equipment purchases and commercial policy are harmonized.
                                                                        OJ


     It is recommended that track rehabilitation benefits be
re-examined for the mountain lines, and that rehabilitation
priorities suggested in this report be revised accordingly. It
is also recommended that levels of track maintenance for unre-
habilitated lines be raised to the levels considered "desirable"
by ENFE, in order to prevent further track deterioration.

     Further studies are recommended of the rail interconnection.
In particular, potential international transit traffic, and the
likely revenues they would generate must be identified more se-
curely.  It is also recommended that a more northerly alignment
via Chimore to Yapacanf be investigated.

     It is recommended that a rail "piggy-back" service be started
                                                                       '.

Brazil.

     Fare levels   on the Andean passenger services should be
assessed and if,
revenues are not

                   covering variable operating costs, then fares
                   immediately.
                                                                       '.
     It is recommended that both the Cochabamba-Aiquile and the
Potosf-Sucre lines be considered for closure.  In the latter case,     ..
closure may be avoided if the new tariff policy results in a
large increase in freight traffic and if the considerable tourist
appeal of this line could be profitably exploited.

     Improvements in operation are required, and it is recommend-
ed that a detailed review be made of the causes of the rather
unsatisfactory performance of the past three years, particularly
with regard to equipment maintenance and availability.

     Better integration of the Andean and Eastern systems is
recommended at the management level.  Some functions relating to
overall policy should be more centralized, while other aspects
which have to do with day-to-day operation and commercial ex-
ploitation could be usefully decentralized.

     Air Transport

'.        There are three major recommendations in the Air Sector. The
     first is that the much delayed Air Navigation and Communication
     Equipment Plan (a committed project) is implemented immediately,
     without further adjustments.     The second is that an Airport-
     Rehabilitation plan is initiated, concentrating on sixteen of
     the smaller airports, to permit operations by F28 passenger jets
     and F27 passenger turboprops. Related to the latter, it is
     recommended that levels of infrastructure maintenance are
     raised at. all AASANA airports .

••        The other main recommendations concerning the air sector
     relate to improvements in current operational practices.
     Within the non-regular air sector, it is most important that major
     improvements be made in current maintenance procedures.  The
     financial state of non-regular airliae~~does not permit replace-
     ment of the fleet, but with better maintenance the extremely poor
     accident record of the sector should be substantially improved.
     An expanded inspection system on the part of the DGAC is needed
     to enforce the maintenance standards. but this also implies
     increased training facilities, for both inspectors and mechanics.
     It is also recommended that a review is made of tariff levels, and
     of the licensing of non-regular operators.

          In the general aviation sector, it is recommended that much
     stricter control be exercised over the operation of air taxis.
     The present practice where private operators offer occasional
     commercial servlces must be eliminated -- anyone offering such a
     service should be registered as a commerical operator and both
     the plane and the pilot subjected to more rigorous tests of
     "airworthiness". Enforcement should be through the issuing of
     licenses to operate, subject to annual renewal.

          LAB's plans to extend jet service to a number of new
     communities is endorsed.   However, the major effort needs to be
     devoted not to the development of new routes, but to the improve-
     ment of service on existing routes, particularly those designated
     as secondary.   It is recommended that when LAB selects candidate
     aircraft to replace the ageing F27 fleet, serious consideration
     be given to the Dash-7 plane, in addition to the two F28 passenger
     jets on order, as well as to the possibility of introducing a
     mixed fleet by including a smaller plane (such as the Twin-Otter).
     This would give greater operational flexibility and permit economic
     operation on ~ew routes for which a 50-seat aircraft would be too
     large.  It is recommended that LAB study the expansion of its
     scheduled freight operations with the purchase of a second B-707
     cargo aircraft.

     AASANA's financial position is such that it cannot meet the       ...
financial burden imposed upon it by major airport investments
such as those at Viru Viru, Cobija, Riberalta,)Puerto Suarez
and the proposed new terminal and runway at Cochabamba.  It is
strongly recommended that AASANA should not be made responsible
for such investments.

River Transport

     Apart from air, river currently provides the only means
of access to large parts of northern Bolivia.  Roads are now
being built to several of these zones, and trucks are starting
to carry some of the goods previously transported on the river.
At the same time, however, more people are moving in, generating
economic activity which in turn increases overall transport
                                                                      ..
demand.  Therefore, the demands for river transport in northern
Bolivia are expected to remain relatively stable.

     On the other hand, substantial growth is anticipated in
the two external river corridors that could be used to export
some of Bolivia's production. One of these is the Paraguay
River in the east, the other the Madera River in the north;
both of these are only accessible through ports located in
Brazil.

     The Madera river port of Porto Velho is separated from
Bolivia by a long stretch of rapids, but can be reached over
a 330 km road which will be paved in the near future.  The
long-term export potential from northern Bolivia is very promising,
including meat in refrigerated containers.  It is suggested
that in negotiations with Brazil, Bolivia give attention to
the improvement of port facilities at Porto Velho and to their
use for Bolivian cargo.
     On the paraguay River, current mineral exports from Mutun
have to pass through the Brazilian port of Corumba. As an
initial step to put this transport, which as a strong growth
potential, into Bolivian hands, it is recommended to build a          ..
port in Bolivian territory. In the selection of a Paraguay River
Port site, it is recommended that the following principles are
followed:

     (i) A new river port in Bolivian territory should be built
         only if it is needed for a major export project based
         on the iron ore resources at Mutun (although it could
         then be used for general foreign trade);

    (ii) That fjnancing for a port and the necessary land con-
         nections should be considered as an integral part of a
         Mutun export project;

   (iii) That the port location be selected based on the needs of
         a Mutun export project.


                          -490-
At the same time as building a port, arrangements should be made
to build up a river fleet to serve the demands generated by the
exports from Mutufi.

     On the Mamore river system, fallen and embedded tree trunks
cause delay and danger to navigation.  It is recommended that a
project be initiated to remove these obstructions, first in the
section from Trinidad to Guayaramerin, then in the section from
Puerto Villarroel to Trinidad. Once the railroad currently under
construction north of Yapacani reaches the Rio Grande, simple
port facilities should be provided at that location to permit
the transfer of goods between river barge and rail.  It is also
recommended that some equipment is provided at the Ports of
Villarroel, Trinidad and Guayaramerin to aid maintenance of
the river bank, and cargo transfer operations.

     With regard to the administration and maintenance of river
ports in the Amazon basin, it is recommended that this responsi-
bility be given to the local development oorponations. These would
then provide the equipment (such as bulldozers) as needed to
maintain the ports and make possible small-scale improvements.
They would also furnish -- where appropriate -- simple loading
devices such as conveyor belts. All other government responsi-
bilities concerning river transport should be transferred to
the Bolivian Navy, including those currently assigned to the
Ministry of Transport's General Directorate of the Merchant
Marine.

Pipelines

      If an agreement is reached about the sale of natural gas
to Brazil, this will automatically imply the construction of
a major gas pipeline from the Santa Cruz area to the eastern
border.   Similarly, the building of further gas pipelines for
the internal market will depend more on YPFB's distribution
strategy than on transport considerations.

     Oil pipelines, on the other hand, especially those used for
the transport of refined petroleum products, compete directly
with other transport modes.  However, the existing network is
already quite extensive, and the evaluation revealed no need
for additional product pipelines until the 1990s.

Transport Investment Plan 1981-2000

     The object of the investment plan is to bring together
the projects for each mode into a program for the whole country
within the estimated budget limits. The projects which make up
the plan have been listed in earlier sections of this chapter.
The expenditures and budgets for each period considered, which
were discussed in detail in Chapter 18, are summarized in
Table 20-1.

     The recommendations follow the high budget, but it is
recognized that these sums are unlikely to be available.
Therefore, recommendations are made in Chapter 18 on project
priorities in case only the low or med~um budgets apply.

Access to Foreign Markets

     Further substantial expansion of agricultural production in
Bolivia requires new markets if it is to be worthwhile.  These
can only be 0utside the frontier, either in adjoining countries
or further afield, such as the United States and Europe.  Trans-
port costs playa critical role in the profitability of such
production.  For this reason it makes good sense for Bolivia to
develop first those areas of potential production which are close
to cheap export routes.  The most promising routes are undoubtedly
the northern corridor through Guayaramer!n-Porto Velho to Manaus
and Belem, and the Paraguay River.

     Successful exploitation of these routes depends on close
cooperation with Brazil through whose territory the traffic
would have to passi  this is to be taken into account in future
negotiation with that country.

     Similar bi-lateral talks are recommended over the Peruvian
cODridor: priority should be given to obtaining Peruvian agree-
ment regarding the paving of the road from Juli to Desaquadero.
Much could be done to improve the flow of traffic in this corridor
if agreement could be reached with Peru to reduce the number of
checks and control points presently imposed on Bolivian trucks
using this route.  It is recommended that this be pursued as a
prime objective.

     Similarly, if transit traffic is to be encouraged, steps
should be taken to reduce the burden of paperwork at present
involved in passing such traffic through Bolivia.

      Regarding improvements to existing links to ocean ports
that do not require infrastructure investment, it is recommended
that a rail "piggy-back" service be instituted on the Santa Cruz-
Corumba line. The service, which need not be elaborate, merely
requiring the addition of a few flat-bed wagons to existing
trains, should increase traffic in this corridor at minimal
cost.

Future Lons-term Transport Planning

     The recommendations contained in this report are the result
of considerable analytical effort by a comparatively large team
of Bolivian and foreign professionals.  Following a detailed
study of the national economy and of its potential for develop-
ment, a global view was taken of the en~ire transport sector to

                                                                        '

establish the priorities within it. This comprehensive approach
and the use of objective criteria of economic evaluation -- now
provides the basis for decisions on transport policy and invest-
ment, which are in the interest of the county as a whole rather
than merely responding to sectoral or regional pressures.
                                                                            til

     However, the presently formulated transport plan will require
updating in the future, as unforeseen developments take place or
as the Nation's priorities change. Transport planning is a
continuing process which has been launched in Bolivia with this
Study. To reap the full benefit from the investment made in it,
the~oontinuing transport planning process must now be firmly
established.

     To achieve this, the creation of a National Transport
Center has been proposed, as an autonomous agency under the
Ministry of Transport.  Its staff would be made up from members
of this Study's counterpart team who have now acquired knowledge
of the comprehensive transport planning science.  It would be           ,.
unfortunate indeed if this accumulated knowledge were dispersed and
thereby, at least partly, lost to the country.

     This has been the experience with the Ministry of Transport's
Directorate of Planning and Coordination, which was formed on the
recommendations of a previous comprehensive transport study. One of
its principal functions was to perform medium and long-term trans-      'II
port planning, but this has not been achieved in reality. Partly
this may have been due to the pressures of day-to-day problems in-
side the Ministry, that needed immediate solution, thus diverting
attention from the seemingly less urgent issue of long-term planning.
Another reason may have been the difficulty to attract and keep the
sufficient qualified staff needed for the Directorate to perform
the planning functions assigned to it. Learning from this past
experience, the National Transport Center is now proposed as
an autonomous agency.
     The principal task of the Center would be to provide tech-         "
nical coordination in the planning of transport priorities both
with regard to possible investments and changes in regulatory
measures.  It would ensure that an adequate up-to-date base of
transport data be kept and would update the findings of this Study,
as required. These activities would provide the Center with the
backround to give, on a continuing basis, ad-hoc advice to the
Minister of Transport.

     The first two years of continuing transport planning have
already been defined as Phase II of this Study.  Emphasis should
now be placed on implementing the recommendations contained in
                                                                        '.

Transport Center as an effective advisory group, will depend
on the quality of the future decisions that will be made in
the transport sector. Wisely made decisions will help to
generate economic gains and thus spur development.  The nation
will be the beneficiary.

Most Urgent Needs

     Undoubtedly the most pressing need is the immediate
creation, as an autonomous body, of the National Transport
Center based upon the counterpart staff of this Study.   without
such a body, the accumulated knowledge and experience of the
existing team will be lost, and the vital long-term transport
planning process, initiated by this Study, will fail to material-
ize.

     Regarding the individual modes, the most urgent requirement
in the rail sector is raising of the standards of track mainten-
ance to the recommended levels. Work should also begin with
priority on the improvements to the Robore~Taperas section of
the Santa Cruz-Corumba line.  Slightly longer-term priorities
are the initiation of studies of potential transit traffic,
to examine the justification of the rail interconnection.   In
organization, the strengthening of the ENFE Commercial Depart-
ment is urgent in order to implement the recommended tariff
policy.

     In the organization of the road sector the most urgent
need is for a strengthening of the powers and resources of the
General Directorate of Road Transport (DGTA) and the banning of
truck imports in 1981. Regarding actual road construction and
maintenance, highest priority should be given to the upgrading
of maintenance standards and practice.  The rehabilitation of
existing paved roads should take precedence over other opera-
tions.

     In the area of water transport the most urgent need is
for the initiation of detailed engineering studies ·of a new ,
port on the River Paraguay and the associated link to the Mutun
complex.

      The air sector has two urgent projects that should take
precendence over all others for this mode.   The first is the
implementation of the Air Navigation and Communication Equip-
ment Plan, which requires the earliest possible purchase and
installation of the equipment funded under the 1978 world Bank
loan.   The second is the initiation of an Airport Rehabilita-
tion and Maintenance Plan.   It is suggested that this project
might be the subject of special study, similar in scope, but
smaller in scale, to the World Bank pilot Maintenance Study for
highways.   Also, the extension of the runway at Cochabamba
Airport is a priority project on safety grounds.
