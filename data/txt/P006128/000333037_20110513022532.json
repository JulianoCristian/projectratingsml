Large, potentially productive regions\n            remain unexploited, partly because access to them is\n            impossible or very difficult. Where ways of communication do\n            exist, they have often been built to a low standard with the\n            result that transport costs are relatively high. This study\n            aims to resolve the problem by identifying those transport\n            investments which are likely to be of greatest benefit to\n            the Bolivian economy. It also examines the organizational\n            and financial aspects of transport. The resulting'\n            proposals, together with the suggested investment program,\n            offer a new transport strategy recommended for the\n            1980's. The government, for reasons beyond the scope of\n            this technical study, may opt for certain solutions not\n            recommended in this report. However, the study's\n            analyses will still be useful in quantifying the economic\n            costs of those solutions."}, "docdt": "1981-07-01T16:50:05Z"}
