                  ROADSIDE INTERVIEW SURVEYS

     This major survey exercise was undertaken to collect data
on the characteristics of light-vehicle, truck and bus movements
over the national road systero. The lack of coroprehensive road
data within Bolivia made this survey essential for the identifi-
cation of person travel and goods movements, and for the building
of trip matrices.
     It was anticipated that there would be substantial
differences in travel characteristics between the wet and dry
seasons, and thus a two-season origin-destination survey was
planned. Survey locations were kept constant for both survey
campaigns with the exception of various locations in the Beni
Department where roads are generally impassable during the wet
season.
     In general, interviews were conducted for both directions
of traffic on all roads on the outskirts of each Department
capital, thus intercepting all traffic entering and leaving
the major population centers of Bolivia. In addition, inter-
views were made at other important points in the road system.
Survey station locations are presented in Figure 3-1 of the
main Final Report Volume.
     The wet-season surveys took place from February 20 to March
27, 1979, and most of the dry-season surveys from June 5 to 25.
In the Beni Department, the surveys were organized between
July 19 and August 4. In most cases, three days of interviews
were taken at each site during each survey season. Each day of
interviewing consisted of two eight-hour shifts, generally
extending from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM; at a few stations, full 24-
hour interviews were conducted. In addition to the period of
interview, a-hour manual classified vehicle counts were made at
most stations from 10:00 PM to 6:00 ~M during the dry season.
     This part of the Appendix presents the forms used in the
survey and, for each location, the survey dates and number of
valid interviews obtained. This is followed by the summary
tables compiled during the development of expansion factors.
More details on the roadside interview surveys can be found in
Working Papers 1, 2, 14, 14a and 15.

              COLLECTION OF OTHER TRANSPORT DATA


     To complement the roadside origin-destination surveys and
provide similar information for all other modes of transporta-
tion, extensive data collection efforts were undertaken of rail-
road, air, pipeline, river and road transport facilities. These
efforts included a physical inventory, traffic characteristics,
usage volumes and trends, tariffs, operating and maintenance
costs, and capital expenditure.
Railroad Transport
     All available statistical data and reports were compiled
and analyzed. In addition, field reconnaissance was undertaken
of the railroad network, rolling stock and workshops. Numerous
meetings were held with staff of the National Railroad Company
(Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles - ENFE), to facilitate data
collection and to keep abreast of their current work program and
planning efforts. Considerable time was spent in obtaining,
analyzing and summarizing information in the following areas:
          e   Inventory of the Rail Network
          •   Operating Procedures
          •   Current Traffic Volumes
          e   Current Rolling Stock
          e   Rehabilitation Program
          e   Other Rail Projects
          e   Design Standards and Construction Techniques
          •   Organization and Management
          •   Finances and Operating Costs.
        Principal findings on the railroad system inVentories
are highlighted in Working Paper 27. In addition to the general
data collection regarding rail transport, a computer analysis
was made of several data tapes received from ENFE. Also, exten-
sive research was perfomed to estimate the economic costs of
this mode; this is described in Working Paper 32.
     Analysis of Computer Tapes - In 1977, ENFE began to store
their movement records on computer tapes, which proved to be
an ideal data source for this Study. Such tapes were available
for 1977 freight and 1978 passenger movements on the Andean
system, as well as for freight movements on the Oriental system
during the first half of 1978. From this source, and from addi-
tional statistics, it was possible to construct complete origin/
destination matrices for passenger and freight transport, in
the latter case by type of commodity. Rail tariff matrices
were also derived from this source, as detailed in Working Paper
17.
                            -20-
     The rail passenger matrices indicated a total of 1.34 mil-
lion passengers in 1977 as compared to 1.29 million in the year-
ly railroad statistics prepared by ENFE. The derived freight
matrix totalled 1,208,130 tons in 1977, corresponding very I
closely to the 1,211,000 tons figure published by ENFE (see Tables
3B-1 and 3B-2).
Highway Inventory
     In 1978, the National Highway Service (Servicio Nacional
de Caminos - SNC) had prepared a road inventory of the districts
of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. During the course of the
Study SNC extended this ~nventory to the rest of the country.
The complete inventory was available in mid-1980. An example of
the SNC road inventory form is shown in Figure 3B-1.
     To check and complement this work, two other surveys were
included in this Study's work program. The first was a check
on the accuracy of the existing SNC inventory. The second sur-
vey was a windshield survey of the roads included in the trans-
port model road network, to collect data for transport modelling
purposes. The latter survey was mostly conducted by professional
Study personnel, coordinating field reconnaissance trips with
this collection of basic highway data.
     Check of SNC Inventory - The Terms of Reference of the Na-
tional Transport Study required that the road inventory data col-
lected by SNC be verified on a sample basis. As SNC's survey
teams were completing their work in the four southern districts,
they were visited by members of the Study team to observe their
modus operandi. Moreover, available inventory data were checked
in the field, not only in the southern districts, but also in
those of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz which had been sur-
veyed in 1978 (see Figure 3B-2). Table 3B-~ indicates that
about 6 percent of the roads covered by SNC were checked by the
Study.
     The results of the inventory check were described in Work-
ing Paper 5. In general, it was concluded that the data compiled
by SNC could be regarded as reliable.
     Windshield Survey - This survey was primarily conducted
to provide travel time data needed to oode the pzesent highway network.
It was also useful in providing supplemental data for the trans-
port model. The form used is presented as Figure 3B-3.
Categories for vertical alignment, horizontal alignment and
topography match those used by SNC in their inventory.

     A particular effort was made to obtain passenger and freight
origin/destination data, to be used in the development of an air
transport model. Detailed data were obtained from the two prin-
cipal domestic airlines, Lloyd A~reo Boliviano (LAB) and Trans-
portes A~reos Militares (TAM). Moreover, the Directorate of Air
Transport and Aerial Work of the Ministry of Transport supplied
similar data for 20 of the non-regular air transport companies,
providing cargo services between principal cities and remote re-
gions of the country. The data were coded, punched on cards and
edited by computer to remove errors. Tabulations were subsequent-
ly produced, and passenger and freight matrices built.
     Survey of Non-regular Airlines - In addition to the above,
a special survey was organized to obtain data on transport costs
and operating characteristics of non-regular airlines. Informa-
tion was obtained on the following major items:
     (a)     Current operating fleet,
     (b)     Ground operations,
     (c)     Transport patterns,
     Cd)     Expenditures, and
     (e)     Tariffs.
     Each airline was visited twice, first to deliver the question-
naire and to explain the purpose of the survey, and then to pick
up the completed questionnaire and to discuss the answers. The
seven larger companies, representing well over half of all air-
planes in this category, proved to be very cooperative. Many of
the smaller companies, mostly owning a single airplane each, had
difficulty in complying with the survey's requests.
Waterway Transport
     Waterway transport is of great importance to Bolivia's re-
mote areas in the north and northeast. Extensive data collection
efforts, including field reconnaissance and discussions with boat
operators and regulatory agencies were carried out. They included:
    •      Inventory of Water Transport Network
    e      Inventory of Ports
    •      Analysis of Operating Procedures
    •      Inventory of Vessels
    •      Role of Bolivian Navy
    •      Organization and Labor Aspects.

     Data on River Transport Patterns - The Bolivian Navy re-
ceives monthly reports from the major ports on the Ichilo-Mamor~
and Beni rivers, including information on transport flows. In
an extensive analysis of the relevant files, these data were
transferred onto coding forms, and subsequently punched on cards
and processed by computer.
     In general, information was obtained in this way on or1g1ns
and destinations of each commodity shipped. Moreover, the data
include the weight of each shipment as well as the month in which
the movement took place.
Pipeline Transport
     The extent and characterisitcs of all pipelines were deter-
mined along with type of product carried (crude oil, gas or re-
fined petroleum products), amount transported, capital and trans-
port costs, product demand and consumption. Pertinent data were
obtained principally from the National Oil Company (Yacimientos
Petrol!feros Fiscales Bolivianos - YPFB).

                SOCIO-ECONOMIC DATA COLLECTION

     Although the collection of socio-economic data was
constrained by the lack of information in many areas and the
discrepancies in statistics furnished by different government
agencies on the same subject, much valuable information was
obtained from a variety of sources. One principal data source
were reports and other documents prepared by the Central Bank
and various Government ministries. To complement this,
structured interviews were conducted with numerous public
agencies, private firms, and representatives of the agricul-
tural sector. Moreover, the National Statistics Institute
(Instituto Nacional de Estad!sticas - INE) provided several
magnetic tapes containing data of relevance to this Study.
Corporations of Regional Development
     Under the auspices of the Ministry of Planning and
Coordination, an important meeting of the Regional Development
Corporations took place in Cobija in February, 1979. Taking
advantage of this meeting, a representative of the Study team
was sent to explain the objectives of the Study and to seek
their cooperation, particularly in regard to providing
information that would be requested of them.
     A number of questionnaires and accompanying instruction
leaflets were distributed to the respective presidents of the
departmental corporations. The questionnaires addressed the
following subjects:
     •   Agricultural production
     e   Livestock production
     e   Mining and oil production
     •   Manufacturing production
     •   Future development plans.
     The design of each questionnaire was to satisfy the data
needs of the Study. The questionnaires on existing agricul-
tural and livestock production related, on the level of
province, to products, area cultivated in hectares or number
of heads (respectively), tonnages produced, location, and
distribution of goods produced. The mining and oil production
questionnaire related to province, establishment, location,
type of mineral, gross output and comments. The manufacturing
production questionnaire related to type of industry, location,
principal product, annual production (physical units of production,
units used and equivalent in tons), and distribution of the
goods produced.

     Three teams, each consisting of a professional and an
assistant, visited the Development Corporations to collect
this information. The task was initiated on March 19 and
completed on April 2, 1979. In general, the information was
successfully collected from the Development Corporations in
the nine Departments. However, further work was required to
crystallize the details of the respective analyses concerning
regional prospects and future plans.                        .
Central Government Agencies and State Enterprises
     Overall, 20 agencies and public enterprises were selected,
and special letters and questionnaires were prepared for them.
To insure maximum benefit from these contacts, the content of
these inquiries did not only concern socio-economic topics but
also questions concerning transport characteristics. These
letters and questionnaires, special to each agency, were sent
to the following:
      1.   Ministry of Industry and Commerce
      2.   Ministry of Rural Affairs and Agriculture                "
      3.   Ministry of Mining and Metallurgy
      4.   National Enterprise of Smelters (ENAF)
      5.   Bolivian Geological Service (GEOBOL)
      6.   Mining Corporation of Bolivia (COMIBOL)

     In addition, two private agencies were contacted in a
similar manner:
      1.   National Chamber of Mining
      2.   National Chamber of Flour Mills.
     Information was received from all the agencies, although
follow-up interviews were required in a number of instances.

Private Companies Engaged in Manufacturing
     Similar to the other socio-economic surveys, a questionnaire
was developed to obtain data on type and amount of production,
type and amounts of inputs and distribution of goods produced.
In addition, questions were included concerning the transport
modes used, the truck fleet owned by the company, warehousing
facilities, and whether the company has railroad sidings.
     A sample of firms was defined for this survey with the
objective of covering each industrial branch, and particularly
the major generators of transport demand. In total, 88
companies were selected, and an interviewer from the Study team
visited the managers of these companies in order to fill out
the questionnaires. As shown in Table 3C-1, well over half
were companies in the food and drink industry.
Collection of Agricultural Data
     Since the 1950 census on population and agriculture, only
some departmental sampling surveys have been carried out
regarding the agricultural sector. Data from the 1950 census,
the first one carried out in this century, are not up to date,
largely due to the Agrarian Reform of 1953, which had vast
implications on land ownership and exploitation. In addition,
considerable internal migration has taken place to previously
undeveloped regions. Since this Study required this information
on a detailed analysis zone basis for the entire country, the
lack of statistical data was an area of major concern.
     In order to remedy this, assistance was solicited from the
office of Economic and Statistical Studies of the Ministry of
Agriculture. This office indicated that they were in a position
to provide the data, but would require a long period of time and
a large amount of money for the elaboration of these data, which
had been derived from a sample based on the 1950 Census.

     In the face of this situation, the assistance of the
Bolivian Institute of Agricultural Technology (IBTA) and of
the Agricultural Extension Department was requested. The latter
promised the assistance of the provincial extension agents on
the survey. In this regard, it is important to note that the
extension agents, who previously were mainly university-trained
agronomists, are now generally technicians.
     The Survey - The survey forms consisted of an eight-page
questionnaire, shown in Figures 3C-1 to 3C-8, complemented by
a brochure explaining the survey procedures. Based on an
initial visit to Santa Cruz, the questionnaires were revised
in some areas and a month's time was scheduled for filling in
the survey forms, after their distribution to the extension
agents.                                            .

         AGRICULTURAL SURVEY
W£U,. S-utL .,.J .A~.h~ C8 )
     Evaluation of Survey - The completed forms were received
over a two-month period. During this time, supplemental
information was requested from the Ministry's Office of
Economic and Statistical Studies. The data obtained from the
latter were not complete.
     In order to determine whether the provincial information
provided was accurate, a comparison between these data and
information received from the Regional Development Corporations
was made. Another comparison was made with available depart-
mental data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, assuming
the summed production of the provinces would be similar to the
data by Department.
     With these statistical data and other information avail-
able through various agencies such as the Development
Corporations, the Interamerican Institute of Agricultural
Sciences (IICA), and the universities, estimates were developed
of agricultural production and consumption by analysis zone.
Details of the agricultural data survey are contained in
Working Paper 11.
Analysis of Census Tapes
     In order to allocate production and consumption of goods
to the Study's analysis zones, data were required on
economically active population by category and zone.
     Although these data had been collected in the National
Census of 1976, they were not completely published. It was
therefore necessary for the Study to derive these figures
independently. The source for the derivation was a set of
six computer tapes provided by the National Statistics
Institute (INE). The procedure used is discussed in Working
Paper 16.
     Method of Anal~sis - There were about 1,760 files on
the tapes correspon ing to the census units defined by INE.
These consisted of either whole cantons or parts of cantons.
The first task in the analysis was, therefore, to define which
localities were contained in which analysis zones. The
computer program to analyze the files and the table relating
census units to analysis zones have been included in Working
Paper 16.
     Results of the Analysis - The results of the analysis
are summarized in Table 3C-2. For three of the four
Departments of which INE have published results (Chuquisaca,
Cochabamba and Santa Cruz), agreement between these results
and INE's published data was exact. For the Department of
La Paz there were small differences between the two sets of

results as shown in Table 3C-3. Despite careful checking of
the results derived from the tape, no explanation of these
discrepancies has come to light. The detailed distribution
of economically active population is shown in Table 3C-4.
Analysis of Foreign Trade Tapes
      The source for this analysis was another set of three
computer files provided by INE. One file contained data on
mineral exports, another on all other exports and a third on
all imports. For the purpose of this analysis, ten commodity
groups were used. They are shown in Table 3C-5 and are defined
in terms of the Study's commodity classes, defined in Appendix
3E.
     Exports - The tonnages derived from the INE export files
are shown in Table 3C-5 by commodity group and Table 3C-6 by
country of destination. The figures quoted are in gross tons.
As the files gave province of origin, it was usually possible
to determine the analysis zone from which the product came,
for inclusion in the matrices. In cases where a province
was split into more than one zone, the origins were split
either based on local knowledge of production or based on
population ratios. In cases where the file gave only
department of origin, the origins were estimated on the basis
of known origins of that commodity in that department.
     Imports - The tonnages derived from the INE import files
are shown in Table 3C-5 by co~modity group and in Table 3C-6
by country of origin. Although two files were provided
covering these data, one proved unreadable and the second
incomplete. It was estimated that about 2,950 tons were
missing from the second file, all in co~modity group 10: these
are not included in the tables.
     The file did not contain data on province of destination
but only the customs disctrict of destination. Therefore, the
imports were allocated to the main town in each customs
district. On the other hand, information on point of entry
was available.

                DEFINITION OF ANALYSIS ZONES

     An internal and an external zone plan have been prepared
which form the basis of the Study analysis system.
Internal Zone Plan
     Seventy-seven zones have been defined based on the
administrative areas of "provincias" and "departamentos".
The administrative boundaries shown in Figure 3D-1, were
adhered to where possible to simplify the analysis of census
data on total population and economically active population.
For this reason, when splitting a province between two zones,
the dividing line was made to conform to canton boundaries.
Only 14 provinces out of a total of 99 were sub-divided be-
tween more than one zone.
     The following guidelines, as set out in the body of the
Final Report, were observed in defining zones:
     (a)   The zones should be relatively homogeneous in
           respect to the current production patterns and
           future development prospects.
     (b)   They should contain sufficient population and
           productive capacity to generate and attract
           significant volumes of goods and person traffic.
     (c)   Zone boundaries should follow the borders of the
           administrative units on the basis of which
           statistics of population, employment and produc-
           tion are maintained.
     (d)   Zone boundaries should conform to natural local
           trading, agricultural or industrial areas.
     (e)   The total zone system should reasonably reflect
           the significant variations in the configuration
           of the country's transport system and actual
           traffic flows over the system.
     In allocating provinces to zones, including amalgamation
or sub-division when necessary, the following additional
detailed considerations were kept in mind:




                          -45-
     (a)   A zone must not contain two separated areas with
           no means of land communication between them.
     (b)   Areas with significantly different levels of
           access to transport modes should be in separate
           zones.
     (c)   A zone should not be too big or the centroid will
           not be representative of the activity in the zone.
     (d)   A single zone should not contain two major parallel
           corridors of transport.
     The resulting configuration of analysis zones is shown
in Figure ,30-2. A complete list of zones showing division by
department, province and canton is included in Table 30-1.
External Zone Plan
     Two sets of external zones have been defined. The first
set of 32 zones (78-108) were selected for the tabulation of
Roadside Interview Oata and Railroad data and also for the
initial analysis of foreign trade movements. Zones were
defined to encompass major external trade routes, with sepa-
rate zones for each major part serving Bolivia. These zones
are listed in Table 30-2 and the zones in South and Central
America are also illustrated in Figure 30-3.
      It became evident during the analysis of foreign trade
that available statistics for foreign countries could not
be subdivided by geographical region within the country.
Also, for the model analyses, there was no value in specify-

and omitting ports was defined. These zones, and their
relationships to the previously defined external zones, is
shown in Table 30-3.

modelling, it was necessary to define commodity classifications.
A total of 39 classes were defined for the computer model and
these are shown in Table 3E-l together with their relationships
with other commodity classes described below.
     In developing the commodity classes for computer modelling,
tabulations were produced from the roadside interview data and
from the computerized rail data supplied by ENFE. As these
tabulations were of an exploratory nature, 69 commodity classes
were defined which are shown in Table 3E-2.
     The socio-economic analysis of production and transport
demand used initially 56 commodity groups related to availability
of statistics and relative volumes of production. These groups
were based on the original 69 survey commodity classes described
above.
     Finally, a limited number of commodity classes were required
for analysis of foreign trade movements and these are related to
the basic system in Table 3E-l.

                       INTRODUCTION



     This appendix describes the computer transport models
developed by the Study to forecast movements of passengers
and goods.  Figure 3F-l shows the modeling work in the context
of the overall study work flow.

     There are two basic subdivisions to the transport model:
freight models and passenger models. The more complex of
these are the freight models which are illustrated in Figure
3F-2. The ordering and linkage of all the models is described
below.

     Freight Network Model - This uses the network data and
the transport costs and times to compute minimum zone-to-zone
routes, and also the parameter matrices of cost and time
associated with these routes.

     The network data consist of a description of the transport
facilities being considered, i.e. the infrastructure and the
characteristics of road, rail, river and pipeline transport.
Also included are definitions of rail services or routes, and
the location of possible points of transfer between modes.

     For the transport costs in the base year, observed
tariffs were used in which case the minimum routes were
computed using time as a criterion.  In 1989, variable
economic costs were used for computing routes.




                         -66-
     Distribution Models - The inputs to these models consist
of the zone-to-zone transport costs produced by the network
model, together with zonal productions and consumptions of
goods. The outputs are matrices of zone-to-zone flows of
goods for each commodity.

     Modal Allocation Model - The inputs to this model consist
of the modal transport costs produced by the network model,
the excess time costs,. and the flow matrices produced by the
distribution models. The outputs are two flow matrices for
each commodity class, one made up of flows which use only
road and the other of flows which use rail for some part of
their journey.

     Vehicle and Assignment Models - These models convert the
tonnage flows produced by the modal allocation model into
vehicle flows using as input time matrices produced by the
network model. The road tonnages are first converted into
loaded trucks and then empty trucks are added. The rail flows
are converted directly into loaded wagons.
     The final stage of this procedure is to assign the vehicle
flows onto the routes produced by the network model to give the
number of vehicles on each transport link.
     Passenger Models - There are three different passenger
models. These are all regressipn based and consist of the
surface public transport model, the private car model and the
air model. They are similar in form to the freight models
being made up of, firstly, the passenger network model which
produces zone-to-zone routes, costs and times; secondly, the
regression model which produces zone-to-zone passenger flows,
and thirdly, in the case of surface public transport, a modal
allocation model to split bus and rail trips.


     These trips are finally converted to vehicle flows which are
assigned to the network. Thus, taken with the results of
the freight models, the total flow on each link can be obtained.

    THE FREIGHT TRANSPORT MODELS
WL,~.lAIMi.'.$            FIGURE 3F -2
                 THE FREIGHT NETWORK MODEL


     The function of the network model is to define the trans-
port system for testing so that information on transport
characteristics by mode can be extracted for use in later models.
The network describes the characteristics of each mode present
in the transport system and the characteristics of transfers
between modes.
     The main feature of the network model is its ability to
compute optimum routes between pairs of analysis zones. Net-
work evaluation programs are available for extracting informa-
tion on zone-to-zone travel characteristics by mode, including
direct transport costs.
     A detailed description of the base year transport networks
is given in Working Paper 50 (1). The main elements of the
network are briefly described below.
Definitions
     A transport network represents a physical transport
system in numerical terms, designed for use in a computer.
As shown in Figure 3F-3, the network describes the character-
istics of each mode present in the transport system and the
transfers among the transport modes.
     Nodes - The nodes form a set of defined geographical points
that occur at break points in the transport system. For example,
in the road network they usually represent intersections or
pOints where the physical characteristics change significantly;
in railroads they represent stations and also junctions, in
rivers, ports and confluences; airports in the air network;
and conjunctions and points where the diameter of the pipes
change in pipelines.
     There are special classes of nodes that do not have the
same physical interpretation and these represent the zone
centroids and transfer nodes. The first are the pOints where
it is supposed that the movements from and to zones begin and
end and the latter represent the transfers between the modes.

                                                                     I,



      The nodes have a number assigned for their identification.
In the case of zone centroids, the nodes have the same number
as the zone.                                                         .,
     Links - The links represent the physical elements of the
transport system and are the basic elements through which the
network is described in the computer. For example, in the road       II

network, the section between two intersections forms a link,
provided that the characteristics of the road do not change
between the two intersections. In the same manner, in railroads,
the section between two stations chosen as nodes is also a link.     "
     Special links in the network are: the centroid connectors
that link the centroids with the network proper and allow access
from the zones to the network; and the transfer links that link
the transfer nodes with network nodes and facilitate transfer of
cargo and passengers between the transport modes. These links
in general do not represent physical infrastructure, but the
impedance that freight and passen<;rers encounter in entering or
leaving the network, or in transferring between modes.
     The links are defined to the computer by the nodes at each
end, by the mode and jurisdiction, and by their physical characte-
ristics such as distance, travel time, altitude, etc.                "
      Modes, Jurisdictions and Services    The mode is the prin-
cipal form of classifying links. Thus, all the network links
are classified by the transport rrode that uses them. Also,
wi thin one basic mode, there are sufficient dif'ferences to
justify other classifications.
     There are four classes of modes: modes with services,
modes without services, centroid modes and transfer modes.
     Modes with services are those that run with schedules on
specific routes, e.g. passenger trains. The services are
described to the computer by indicating the links traversed.
Modes without services would be those where the routes through
the network can vary for each consignment and are not subject
to any schedule. A typical example are truck movements in the
road network. The centroid modes are used to classify the
centroid connectors and the transfer modes to identify the
transfer links.
     The jurisdiction is a subclass within the mode, used to
represent special characteristics. Its primary function is to
allow the separation of unit costs within a mode, for example
it is possible to specify vehicle operating costs for different
types of road surface (paved, gravel or earth) if a different
jurisdiction is specified for each surface class.

     Internal Freight Network - The freight network is concerned
only with the internal freight movements and comprises the fol-
lowing modes:
     (1)     Trucks that run without fixed routes or schedules on
             the three types of road links: affected, not affected
             and interrupted by the rainy season.
     (2)     River freight transport carried out on the Orthon,
             Beni, Ichilo-Mamor~ and Itonamas-Itenez rivers.
     (3)     The pipelines as a whole, through which oil, natural
             gas and petroleum products are transported.
     (4)     The freight trains that run on the Oriental and Andean
             railroad systems. In the freight network, this is the
             only mode with services.


Freight Tariffs
     The operation and calibration of the subsequently described
models use as an important input zone-to-zone tariffs, because
these are what the transport user has to pay for transport
services. These tariffs, which were determined for the Study's
base-year (1977) are described in detail in several working
papers and so are only presented briefly here.
     Road Tariffs - The derivation and details of these are
presented in Working Paper 33c (2). The equations used relate
tariff to distance and are summarized below:
       (i)    Interdepartmental Truck
              T = 0.80D
              Where T = Tariff per ton in Bolivian Pesos.
                    D = Distance in kilometers.
              This equation was used for all movements between
              Department capitals.
      (ii)    Interprovincial Truck - Agricultural   Products
              For paved routes:
              - in flat terrain        T = 49.9 +    1.33 D
              - in undulating terrain  T = 49.9 +    1.46 D
              - in mountainous terrain T = 49.9 +    1.58 D
              For unpaved routes:
              - in flat terrain        T = 49.9 +    1.83 D
              - in undulating terrain T = 49.9 +     1.91 D
              - in mountainous terrain T = 49.9 +    2.00 D.

              Beside these basic equations, regional factors were
                                                                     ,.
              also applied to reflect differing costs in different
              areas. These are:

              Yungas           0.80

              Other areas      1. 00,

              These equations were used for the movements of         ~
              agricultural produce ,that is commodity classes 1 to
              12, within one Department (3).                         "
      (iii)   Interprovincial Truck - Other Products
              For paved routes    T = 18.3 + 1.052 D
              For unpaved routes T = 18.3 + 1.256 D
              These equations were used for the movements of all
              other products, not covered by the agricultural
              equations, within one Department.
     For movements between zones in different Departments, but
not Department capitals, the tariff was calculated by adding
the interdepartmental rate between the capitals to the relevant
interprovincial rate.
     River Tariffs - The derivation and details of these are
presented in Working Paper 34 (4). They consist of tables of
port-to-port tariffs and were used in that form.. Thus,if a
zone-to-zone movement used river as part of its path, then the
relevant port-to-port tariff was added to the cost of that
movement.
     Rail Tariffs - The derivation and details of these are
presented in Working Paper 17 (5). The tariffs were derived
from a computer tape provided by ENFE and were aggregated into
the following cost groups according to type of rail car used:

     Whenever possible, the tariffs actually recorded on the
computer tape were used: however, in cases where there was not
an observed movement, tariffs were estimated using a set of
regression equations. These equations related tariff to
distance and are presented in Table 3F-I.

     Pipeline Costs - As far as the transport of petroleum pro-
ducts by pipeline is concerned, the concept of tariffs is not
applicable, since the pipelines are owned and operated by the
same company that produces and transports the products. Thus
a cost rather than a tariff was placed on pipeline linY~. This
was taken to be $b 0.08 per ton-kilometer. Pipeline costs are
documented in Working Paper 22 (6).

Route Choice

     Zone-to-zone routes (paths) were computed for each major
mode by assuming the travel time through the network was to be
minimized. As tariffs were used instead of costs in the base
year, it was not possible to use this as a routing criterion,
because tariffs only apply to complete journeys and not to the
links that make up the route.

          Four sets of paths were built for the base year.   These
were:

            (i)   Rail favored paths - these were built by dividing
                  all rail times by four, thus ensuring that all
                  movements that could reasonably use rail would do
                  so. The factor of four was determined by examining
                  selected paths for various factors and choosing
                  the one that appeared most reasonable. As not all
                  analysis zones are connected to the rail system,
                  some of the paths also used road or river, wholly
                  or partially.

      (ii)   Road/river paths - these were built by banning all
             movements on rail so that the paths could only use
             road or river.
     (iii)   Pipeline/rail paths - these were built with the pipe-
             line links included in the network and rail favored
             as before.
      (iv)   Pipeline/road paths - these were built with the pipe-
             line links included and rail banned.
Parameter Matrices

     One of the main uses of the paths described above is in
the accumulation of various zone-to-zone parameters. Thus by
summarizing the distances along the path from one zone to
another and applying the tariff equations described earlier,
zone-to-zone tariff matrices can be built. These matrices have
many uses in the subsequent models. For instance, the minimum
tariff for each zone pair between the tariff matrices built from
paths (i) and (ii) above forms the input to the distribution
models for all commodities except commodity 17, petroleum products
suitable for pipelines, for which the minimum of costs built from
paths (iii) and (iv) is used. The individual tariff matrices
from (i) and (ii) are also used in the inputs to the modal allo-
cation model.

     Similarly the number of mode changes or rail service changes
on the paths can be summed to provide an indication of possible
delay occuring on the route. This is also an input to the modal
allocation procedure.
     The third type of parameter matrix calculated is that of
zone-to-zone times. These are used in the loaded and empty
truck models
Assignment
     The other major use of paths is the assignment technique.
This involves placing the tonnage or vehicle flows on each link
forming part of its path from origin to destination. If this
is carried out for all origins and destinations, the result is
the total flow on each link.

     An illustration of the volumes resulting from this
process is given in Table 3F-2." This compares the counts on
the city screenlines made during the roadside interview survey
for 16 hours and factored back to 1977, with the results of an
assignment of 1977 24-hour vehicle matrices. Allowing for the
difference in time period, the comparison is very close indeed.   •

              THE FREIGHT DISTRIBUTION MODELS

     The analyses made by the Study of Bolivia's economic
activity have quantified for each commodity and each analysis
zone the tonnage produced in that zone and the tonnage consumed
there (7). If imports are considered as a form of production
and exports as a type of consumption, then for any commodity
the total production over all zones will be equal to the total
consumption in all zones. However, considering a particular
zone, the quantity produced of a given commodity is only rarely
exactly equal to the amount consumed there.
     Due to this imbalance of zonal production and consumption,
it is necessary to distribute goods from their zone of produc-
tion to zones of consumption and in this way to arrive at a
matrix of zone-to-zone freight movements for each commodity.
     The process of determining a matrix of commodity zone-to-
zone movements from a set of production and consumption data and
a specified transport network is performed by a number of computer
programs and manual analyses, collectively known as the Distribu-
tion Model. The major factor in determining the pattern of
freight movements is zone-to-zone transport costs. These costs
are derived from the network model and are used as inputs to the
distribution model. The function and development of the various
elements of this model are described in this qection.
The Modelling of Depots
     Before describing the main distribution models themselves,
it is necessary to discuss the role of the depot in the distri-
bution process and its subsequent modelling. The depot acts as
a distribution center for the surrounding area that i t serves.
It therefore receives products from one or more production units
and then redistributes them at a later stage. These two move-
ments are quite distinct and are therefore modelled separately.
In general, a depot only handles the products of a single com-
modity.
     From observations for the base year, only two commodities
were found to use depots to any degree. These were sugar (com-
modity 21) and cement(commodity 33). For these commodities
both the production-to-depot and the depot-to-consumer movements
are modelled. After specifying for each depot its location and
the zones to be served by it, the consumption in each of these
zones is summed to determine the throughput of the depot. This
quantity is then considered as the amount consumed in the zone
of the depot when modelling the first stage in the distribution
process, and as the amount produced by the zone of the depot
for the second stage.

CITY SCREENLINES FOR ROAD TRANSPORT
Wlbur Smith and A~uj C HE CK S FIGURE 3F -4
     The production-to-depot movements are modelled in the
normal manner. However, the depot-to-consumer movement can
be modelled more simpl~ since supply at the depot must by
definition exactly equal total consumption in the zones it is
to serve. This second stage therefore only involves specifying
each zone's final consumption as being the amount moved from
depot to zones.
     Besides the above mentioned co~modities, two others show
similar characteristics, although with important differences.
Firstly, petroleum products suitable for pipelines (commodity
17)pass generally through a depot, in general at the terminal
of the pipeline. This type of movement is handled by the pipe-
line network model and does not require two separate distribution
models. The second example is co~modity 24 A, food distribution,
which was introduced as a result of the analysis of the roadside
interview survey. This commodity consists of movements of
various types of food and drink moved in small mixed shipments
from the cities to the surrounding villages. As the origins of
these movements are not depots but the cities' shops and markets,
and as the freight moved is not of a consistent commodity, it
was introduced as a separate cO~~Ddity and not treated as a
depot movement.
The Three Alternative Distribution Models
     The pattern of distribution of a particular commodity
depends on a large number of factors. Some of these are
influenced by the characteristics of the commodity itself while
others are a function of the nUITber and location of alternative
production units for the commodity and the relative location of
the consumer.
     The distribution of meat for example would generally be
typified by a short journey length, due to the highly perishable
nature of the commodity. Tubers may also be expected to travel
comparatively small distances on the average, although in this
case this is due to their widespread production across the
country.
     On the other hand, when a commodity is produced in only
one zone and yet is consumed in every zone, then the journeys
will vary in length over the entire range from very short to as
far as the furthest zone from the production unit. When the
product is also consumed in only a small number of zones, how-
ever,then extreme journey lengths are not so corr~on due to the
opportunity often available to plan the location of production
units in proximity to the zones of production of the raw material.
An example of this latter case are specialized products which
are the raw materials of another industry, such as limestone for
cement production.

     Due to this variety in patterns of distribution, three
alternative distribution models have been developed. These
models are described below, together with the situations in
which they are thoughtto be adequate models of particular
                                                                  '.
                                                                  'I
distribution processes, or are considered to represent a
reasonable compromise between conflicting types of distri-
bution within a single co~~odity class. The models chosen
for each of the commodities to be distributed are shown in
Table 3F-3.

     Minimum Cost Model - In this model, the output of each       "I
production zone does not normally go to every consumption
                                                                  ,J
zone but only to a sub-set of the zones in such a way that
the total cost of distribution over the country as a whole is
minimized. Since it is usually cheaper to transport goods
over a short distance than a longer one, this logic generally
results in production units serving only the consumption zones
around it.
     Although the principle of minimizing costs for the system
as a whole should be the basis for most distribution processes,
it is in practice not always suitable as a model due to the
unavoidable grouping together within a commodity class of
distinct products produced in different production zones.
     Consider a commodity which is produced in both zones A
and B. Then provided the consumption in B is less than or
equal to the production in B, the minimum cost model will not
distribute any of the production from zone A to B. If,
however, the commodity class contains two distinct products,
one of which is produced in zone A and the other in zone B,
and both products are consumed in zone B, then in reality some
of the production from zone A will be transported to B.
     The use of this model is therefore best suited to commodi-
ties containing essentially only one type of product such as
bottled gas, rather than a number of many distinct items.
     Cost Independent Distribution Model - In this model,
each production zone distributes to every consumption zone,
but in a way which is independent of the transport costs to
reach each zone. If a particular production zone produces
X percent of the total national production of a commodity,
then the quantity transported from that zone to a zone whose
total consumption of that commodity is T tons may be taken
as X percent of T.

     Such a model is suitable for a commodity which consists of     II,


a number of discrete products (e.g. vehicles) ,each of which is
produced in only one zone and for which the relative proportions
of the products consumed are reasonably constant in all zones.      "I


     Gravity Model - In this third distribution model considered,
each production zone distributes to every consumption zone, but
the quantities involved are a function of the cost of transport
to these zones. If two zones, A and B, consume equal amounts of
the commodity, but the cost of transport to zone A is cheaper
than to B, then the model will distribute a greater quantity from
the production zone to A than to B, provided of course that other
production zones exist to satisfy the remaining demand at B in
a reasonable manner.
     The gravity model in effect supposes that a commodity may
sometimes be transported extreme distances, from a production
unit to the furthest consumption zone, but that cheaper (shorter)
journeys are more likely. With this model, a production zone
generally transports most of its output to the neighboring area,
with diminishing (though non-zero) quantities being distributed
to zones further away.
     The value of this model is chiefly that it represents a
compromise between the two extreme situations covered by the
two models described earlier, rather than being itself a
representation of an actual or desirable distribution process.
     The mathematical formulation is:

     Tij


     Where: Tij      =   Movement from zone i to zone   j


            Pi       =   Production in zone i

            Cj       =   Consumption in zone j

     Calibration of Gravity Distribution Models - For the first
two types of distribution model described, no calibration is
possible, since for a given set of productions, consumptions and
costs, the resulting zone-to-zone movements are completely
determined. However, for the gravity model, the function P,
shown in the formula above, must be calculated. This function
gives, for any trip cost, the relative probability of a trip
occurring.
     The method used in the calibration is to find a probability
function which results in a trip length distribution of
synthesized flows, which is as similar as possible to that of
observed flows. A trip length distribution function gives for
each cost interval the percentage of the total flow which
oc~ in that interval.      An example of the cumulative observed
and synthesized trip length distribution is given in Figure 3F-5
for commodity 3. The distribution probability function obtained
for this commodity is shown in Figure 3F-6.
     The data, on which the observed trip length distributions
were based, were only complete for rail movements. For road
movements, most data were obtained in the roadside interview
survey (RIS), which generally covered only intercity and city-
rural movements. It was thought that these would form most of
the interzonal movements, as rural-rural movements of long
distance are unusual. Thus the interzonal trip length distribu-
tion derived from the RIS data was retained, and adjustments
were only made to the intrazonal element. This element was
estimated by comparing zonal statistics of production and
consumption against roadside interview data. Thus, if produc-
tion and consumption in a zone were both high, but observed
movements into and out of the zone were low, it was concluded
that the percentage of intrazonal movements was high and vice
versa.
     The percentage of intrazonal trips and the average trip
cost are shown in Table 3F-4. Also shown are the Chi-squared
obtained between the observed and synthesized trip length
distributions, together with the degrees of freedom, which
allow an estimate to be made of the final closeness of fit.
Validation of the Distribution Model
     Since no national statistics exist of total ton-kilo-
meters transported, the major check available on the cali-
bration of the distribut"ion model is the comparison of
screenline crossings. Table 3F-5 presents such a comparison
between a network assignment of the observed tonnages and one
of the synthesized tonnages for the cities around which inter-
views were carried out. The observed flows in the table
correspond well with the truck assignment shown earlier in
Table 3F-2, with the following exceptions:

     Firstly with regard to the Santa Cruz screenline, the
volume of sugar cane required by the city's refineries was
used as the observed figure for commodity 11 instead of the
lower figure obtained from the three days of roadside inter-
view during the sugar cane season.
                                                                          .jj

     The other exception was in the Sucre and Potos! area where
a more extensive roadside interview survey (8) had been carried
out during the dry season, covering a total of 118 days inter-
views as opposed to the 27 days of the National Transport Study.
Thus, the observed dry season volumes for Sucre and Potos! are
based on the more extensive survey; they were a::mbined with wet season
figures from the National Transport Study interviews.
     After these adjustments, the total screenline crossings
synthesized are within 4 percent of the observed figure, with
the worst city comparisons, Sucre and Potos!, being for cities
with two of the smallest absolute flows.

          THE FREIGHT MODAL ALLOCATION MODEL

     The output from the distribution models consists of a set
of matrices containing zonal flows, but with no specification
of how these flows should be carried. The object of the freight
modal allocation model, then, is to allocate the zone-to-zone
freight movements among the available modes.
     This allocation is made on the basis of relative modal
costs using a set of diversion curves derived from observed
data. The modal costs employed include the cost of excess
journey time as well as direct transport costs. The modes
involved are only those of surface transport, with air being
excluded from the model. This is because the freight volumes
carried by air are very small, with the exception of meat
transported from the lowlands to the Altiplano, a special case
which is dealt with in a separate analysis.
     Several commodities have been excluded from this analysis.
These are crude oil (commodity 13) and natural gas (14),
because they are only shipped by pipeline; and also bottled
gas (15), food distribution (24 A) and the depot-to-consumer
parts of sugar (21) and cement (33) because of the short distance
of travel involved. This section deals with the time costs,
diversion curves and the modal allocation of the remaining com-
modities.
Form of the Model
     The model is based on the diversion curve technique.
That is, that for any ratio of road cost divided by rail cost,
a point is looked up on a curve, which gives the percentage
of that movement which would go by the rail dominated route,
with the remainder going by road.
     The form of the cost ratio is:
     Ratio = R+ 0 + CD + E + F

    where C  = Cost of zone-to-zone road trip
          R  = Cost of zone-to-zone rail trip
           0 = Cost of road trip to railhead at or~g~n
           D = Cost of road trip from railhead at destination
           E = Cost of excess time
           F = Factor applied to average curves to give com-
               modity specific curves.

                                                                         'I




     It should be noted that the road and rail costs used in
the base year calibration were observed tariffs. The other
parameters used in the equation are explained in more detail
in the following two sections.
     The diversion curves derived are shown in Figure 3F-7, in
their general form, for agricultural products and other pro-
ducts.
Excess Time Costs
     This is the cost associated with the time taken to trans-
port the freight. In general, the time given by the network
model, which is the time spent in motion on either road or
rail, is similar. However, rail wagons are more likely to be
subject to delays while waiting in marshalling yards or sidings,
but these times are not explicitly included in the network. For
example, if the wagon, is initially attached to a train which is
not going to the desired destination, then a marshalling opera-
tion with its consequent excess time must be undertaken at an
intermediate point in the journey.
     For these reasons, times coded in the network are ignored
when calculating the additional time costs incurred by rail
users, and a special evaluation program is used which accumu-
lates a matrix of potential delay points for each zone-to-zone
rail movement. The places where potential rail excess time can
occur are summarized in Table 3F-6.                                     'l


     It has been assumed that a wagon accumulates a day's delay
at each of these points encountered. Using the commodity value,
and assuming an opportunity rate of capital of 12 percent, a
time cost can be calculated for any particular rail journey to          II

be included in the total costs used for modal allocation for
that commodity. These costs are shown by cOEmodity in Table 3F-7.
Derivation of the Diversion Curves
     The two types of data that were required for the deriva-
tion of diversion curves were (a) the cost ratios and (b) the
corresponding road/rail modal split.
     In the cost ratios, the only terms which have not so far
been explained are the cost of road trips to and from rail-
heads and the cost factor. Concerning the first of these, a         '!

knowledge would be required of the true origins and destina-
tions of rail freight movements. However, DC such data are
available, although the opinion was expressed by ENFE repre-        "



sentatives that most road journeys forming a part of predominant-
ly rail movements were short. As a result, a costcorrespon-
ding to a road journey of ten kilometers was assumed in all
cases where a rail siding was not thought to be available.
These costs, in terms of 1977 pesos, were $b 65 per ton for
agricultural products and $b 37 per ton for other products.

     Two criteria were applied todetenmne whether a particular
zone-to-zone movement should be included in the analysis.
The first was that a movement should have both of its ends in
zones lying on the same rail system. The second was that at
least one of the ends of the movement should be in a city around
which roadside interviews had been conducted. These criteria
were to ensure that the rail and road movements, respectively,
were complete. Tabulations were then produced of road and
rail movements against cost ratio.
     These tabulations were initially produced for each commodity
individually. However, despite the fact that all rail movements
were included, which had been derived from the complete ENFE
records for 1977, little pattern was found at this level of
detail. It was therefore necessary to further aggregate com-
modities, with the best results obtained with two groups, one
for agricultural products and the second for other products.
An effort to disaggregate the data by distance bands was made,
but produced no results worth including in the model.
     The data at their final aggregated level are shown in
Table 3F-8 and diagrammatically in Figure 3F-7. As can be
seen, the two curves are of very similar shape, with agricultural
products being rather less likely to use rail, at any given cost
ratio, than other products. As a result of the similarity in
shape, it was decided to use the observed points in the predict-
ive model, instead of regressing a theoretical curve through
them. For other cost ratios, interpolation or extrapolation
was used corresponding to the lines shown in Figure 3F-7.

     The curves as derived represent the average behavior over
many commodities, and so another factor was introduced in their
application to individual commodity classes. This factor, as
shown in the earlier equation, was added to the rail cost before
the cost ratio was calculated when applying the curves. It is
either negative or positive according to whether a particular
commodity class is more or less inclined to rail than the
average of the group. The calibration process for each com-
modity consisted of establishing a value for this factor which
gave the closest results to the observed modal split. The
values are given in Table 3F-9.
Results of Modal Allocation Model

     The basic results of the modal allocation are presented
in Tables 3F-IO and 3F-II in terms of tons and ton-kilometers.
Whichever measure is employed, road is the dominant mode for
transport movements within Bolivia. The percentage of rail
use is somewhat higher for ton-kilometers than tons because
of the longer trip lengths for rail, with an average of 375
kilometers as against 95 kilometers for road. For only two
commodities does rail handle over ten percent of the tonnage;
these are minerals and metals, about a third of which is
carried by rail.

               THE VEHICLE AND ASSIGNMENT MODELS

     The previous section dealt with the derivation of road
and rail flows in terms of tons. This sectior. explains the
conversion of these flows into the units that physically carry
them. That is, trucks on the road and wagops on the railroad,
which are the units that need to be considered in designing or
evaluating a transport system.
     Also dealt with in this section are the results of
assigning these flows to the transport networks and their compa-
rison with observations wherever sufficient data were available.
Loaded Truck Model
     This model is used firstwhen converting the tonnage flows
allocated to road by the modal allocation model into zone-to-
zone vehicle flows.
     The method is based on a set of curves relating nu~ber of
trucks required to carry a given load to journey time. These
curves were derived from data extracteafrom the results of the
roadside interview surveys, and are illustrated in Figure 3F-8.
The curves as shown give the number of each truck type required
to carry ten tons of freight. Thus for example, at a journey
time of 300 minutes, 0.2 small trucks, 0.7 mediurr trucks and
0.6 large trucks would be required to carry ten tons(9). Normally
much larger tonnages would be involved in a zone-to-zone JI'OVeIreI1t,and
results are therefore given in whole numbers of vehicles. As
can be seen from the figure, the average truck size increases
as the journey length increases while at the same time the
total number of trucks required falls.
        The curves illustrated are the average over all commodities,
because no commodity by itself provided enough data to produce
such curves. In their application, commodity specific factors
derived from the data available for each commodity are used.
The factors are applied to the number of vehicles obtained for
any zone-to-zone movement and are shown in Table 3F-13. 'l'hese
factors represent two different effects. Firstly, for example,
petroleum products suitable for pipelines (commodity class 17 -
CC 17) and cement (cc 33)have very low factors for both small
and medium trucks, indicating that these products are rarely
shipped in small quantities. Secondly textiles (CC 25) and
miscellaneous manufactured products (CC 39) have high factors
for all truck types, probably as a result of their being shipped
in small consignments with bulk rather than weight determining
the truck load.
"'(9) TruCk loading capacities defined as follOVlS: small - 41 to 119 qq,
      necllum - 120 to 199 qq, large 120 qq or rrore; 1 qq (quintal) equals

      Table 3F-14 shows the results of applying these curves
together with the commodity factors to the tonnages observed
in the roadside interview. The comparison between the syn~­

size with trip length, large trucks making up 78 percent of the

Empty Truck Model
      The second stage in the production of truck flows is to
estimate the movements of trucks carrying no freight. These
were derived using a regression equation, based on data observed
in the roadside interview surveys, which related empty truck
moverrents (of a particular size vehicle) to loaded truck reove-
ments of that vehicle size, and also to trip length. This trip
length was represented by journey time rather than any other
measure of zonal separation, because it gave the best results
in the regression analysis.
      A basic assumption in this model is that total truck flows
between each pair of zones should be symmetrical. Thus, if the
loaded truck flows are not symmetrical, sufficient empty truck
movements are added to the direction with the lower flow to make
it so. The regression equation is now used to add the further
empty truck movements beyond those required to make the flow
symmetrical. The form of the equation is:

                           (FAB X FBA)q
                                                                                    . 1




       Where:    EAB = Number of    excess empty truck movements from
                       zone A to    zone B of a particular truck size
                 FAB = Number of    loaded truck movements from zone A
                       to zone B    of that truck size

                 TAB = Journey time from zone A to zone         B

             p,q,r    = Constants to be determined.

      Thus if FAB is greater than FBA,then the total of empty trucks
from A to B is s1mply EAB, and the total of empty trucks from B to
A is (FAB - FBA + EBA). As the time from A to B is equal to
the time from B to A, EAB is equal to EBA and so the truck move-
ments between A and B are symmetrical.
     '!he above equation could not be used for the prediction of intrazanal
errpty truck IIDverrents because in this case journey time is not defineO. So the
follCMing equation was used for this type of traffic:
                   E = s F t

     The regression constants determined and the correlation
coefficients obtained are presented in Table 3F-15.
Results of Truck Assignment
     The final stage in the analysiS of truck flows is the
assignment of the zone-to-zone movements to produce volumes
on roads. This is done by routing the movements along the
minimum paths and accumulating volumes on the various links.

     Some of the overall results of this process are shown in
Table 3F-16. From this it can be seen that, although medium trucks              1
are the most important in terms of number of trips, large trucks                ,
dominate in truck-kilometers because of their much greater trip
length. Small trucks are mostly used for short distance trips
with only 28 percent going outside the zone of origin; of these,
only 38 percent are loaded. The comparable figures for large
trucks are 64 percent and 58 percent, respectively.
     Table 3F-17 gives a comparison of the city screenline cros-
sings between an assignment of the observed and the synthesized
aSSignment matrices. The excess of truck trips in the synthe-
sized assign~ent for the cities of Santa Cruz, Potos! and Sucre
is due to the same causes as were explained in the earlier
section on the validation of the Distribution Model. If those
cities are deleted from the comparison, then the remaining syn-·
thetic totals are within one percent of the volumes observed
for all truck types.
                                                                                !~



Rail \,-lagon Model
     This model is used to convert rail flows, in tons, into
rail wagon movements. The method merely consists of applying
an average load by commodity to the ton flows.
          The factors used are presented in Table 3F-18. Tiley were
derived from an ENFE publication (10) which lists wagon movements
by commodity for the Andean system. Applying these load factors
to tonnages (given in the same publication) for the Oriental
system gave a total number of wagons less than 2 percent dif-
ferent from the number of wagons quoted. Thus it was concluded
that average load by commodity was similar enough to be conside-
red the same for the two systems, and that the different overall
average load of 22.6 tons per wagon on the Andean system against
16.9 tons per wagon on the Oriental system was caused by the dif-
ferent commodity mix on the two systems.

      The result of applying these factors to the synthesized
tonnages is shown in Table 3F-19. For the Oriental system no
breakdown of wagons by commodity carried is available, because
rail records were not coreputerized for that system in 1977.
      However, ENFE quotes a total of 4,813 internal wagon
movements in a table which also records internal tonnage as
26,427 tons. In all other references to internal tonnage in
the publication, the figure quoted is 23,240 tons. If it is
assumed that the first reference includes soree movements which
are continuations of import or export flows, and that the wagon
total can be factored in proportion to the tonnage ratios, then
a total of 4,233 internal wagon movements is arrived at. This
is extremely close to the synthesized total shown in the table.

                     THE PASSENGER MODELS


     The model of personal trips seeks to establish mathematical
expressions that allow the prediction of passenger flows through
a determined transport network.
     When analyzing the characteristics of passenger travel, it
becomes evident that there are reajor differences between the
various modes used for person transport; it is therefore neces-
sary to develop separate models for the following three catego-
ries of passenger travel:

     •   Passengers of public surface transport
     e   Private car passengers
     •   Air transport passengers.

     The pararoeters affecting passenger flow include generally
the socio-economic characteristics in the zones of the trip
origin and destination, the travel time between these zones, and
the fares to be paid by the passenger. It can be noted that not
all of these variables have to be included in the expression
projecting the flow, but only those that prove to be significant.
Passengers of Public Surface Transport
     In a similar manner to the freight network model, it is pos-
sible to extract froIl'! the passenger network model the routes that
the railroad trips follow and also the routes used for travel by
bus. The same model is used to calculate the travel tiroes between
these zones. Also, by applying the functions describing the
tariffs charged for each service, the network model calculates
the fares applicable for each trip.
     In railroad transport, two roodes are considered: passenger
trains and ferrobuses. The functions that are entered into the
network model to obtain the respective tariffs are based on ENFE's
tariff book which was in force in 1977; they are as follows:
     For trains:     TRF   =   2.946 + 0.156 X d
     For ferrobuses: TRF =      4.81 + 0.255 )(' d
    where TRF is the 1977 tariff to be charged in pesos and d
    is the travelled distance in km.

     The road transport tariffs present a bigger variety: for
                                                                                      't

     TRF    =   0.225   x   d

     Interprovincial transport requires a greater division, as
detailed below:
     Altiplano in the La Paz Depart~ent                  TRF =   0.117   x   d
     Yungas in the La Paz Department                     TRF =   0.256   x   d
     Oruro Department                                    TRF =   0.120   x   d
     Santa Cruz Department                               TRF ..  0.181   x   d
     Potosf Department                                   TRF   = 0.186   x   d
     Chuquisaca Department                               TRF   = 0.184   x   d
     Cochabamba Department                               TRF   = 0.180   x   d
     Tarija Department                                   TRF   = 0.230   x   d
      These formulae give 1977 tariffs in Bolivian pesos provided
tha t the distance dis rr,easured in kilo~eters. The derivation of
the constants is described in Working Paper 33c (11).
     Subsequently, a tariff matrix is built, indicating travel
costs between pairs of zones. This is based on routings resulting
in minimum tariffs, allowing for situations where several trans-
port modes can be used.
     The results of the roadside origin/destination survey and
the data extracted from the tape of ENFE statistics are the
basis to obtain a ~atrix of interzonal trips. The total pas-
senger travel between any two zones is then estimated by sum-
ming rail and bus passengers.
     Once all the variables determining passenger travel have
been defined, the mathematical expression representing the pas-
senger flow between two zones is found by rr.eans of the ~ultiple
linear regression method; the variables are being selected accor-
ding to their statistical significance.
     The best correlation was obtained considering the following
variables: total gross domestic product(GDF) in the zones of
origin and destination and the travel cost between the two zones.
These were related to passenger flow according to the following
expression:

            FL = 10 ax A +      bx   B +   Cx   C + d
where: FL       =   the annual passenger        flow between a zone pair
       A        =   the logarithm of the        travel cost between the zones
       B        =   the logarithm of the        total GDP in the zone of origin
       C        =   the logarithm of the        total GDP in the zone of desti-
                    nation.

     The regression analysis resulted in the following values for
a, b, c and d:

     a   =-1.66039
     b = 0.60029
     c = 0.60028
     d = 2.73526.
     The zonal GDP is calculated as the sum of two products.
These are the urban population multiplied by the average urban
GDP per person, and the rural population multiplied by average
rural GDP per person.
     The above equation is used to predict total surface public
transport passenger trips. The second stage of this model splits
these passengers between the two modes of rail and bus. For this
modal allocation a curve is defined that determines the proportion
of trips that use rail as a function of the rail/bus trip cost
ratio, with the remainder of the trips being assigned to bus.
     This curve was drawn up from observed data in the following
manner: Firstly, the set of origin-destination pairs to be inclu-
ded in the analysis was identified, i.e. those pairs for which
complete information on the passenger flows by rail and bus was
available. Secondly, the network model was used to calculate the
rail and bus tariffs, and thus the tariff ratio for each movement.
Thirdly, the rail and bus trips \-lere aggregated into groups
according to the tariff ratio, and the percentage of rail trips
for each tariff ratio group calculated. The results of this
analysis are presented in Table 3F-20.
     The distribution function is found by linking the points
determined for each passenger group of Table 3F-20 with straight
lines on a logarithmic graph. The value of the function then
indicates the percentage of rail passengers based on the ratio
between the bus tariffs and the rail tariffs (Figure 3F-9).
     Returning to the matrix of interzonal movements and knowing
the ratio between the tariffs, this matrix can be divided in two,
one corresponding to railroad users and the other to bus users.
Each element of these matrices is determined by a factor that
represents the modal allocation function for the indicated move-
ment assigning it to rail: the remainder of the passengers is
carried by bus.
     The resulting flow is calibrated with the observed data.
In the case of bus passengers, these are the passenger flows
observed by the Study at the roadside survey stations; in the
case of rail passengers the observed data are based on ENFE's
statistics. Tables 3F-21 and 3F-22 indicate the results of the cali-
bration. As can be seen for the bus volumes, the worst compari-
son is for Santa Cruz. This is due to the almost urban nature

of the movements in the area north of Santa Cruz towards Guabir!
and Montero. The synthesized results for Potos! and Sucre are
both high, but on very low observed volumes, and the problem
found for frei9ht volumes in this area as was described earlier
may be applicaole.

      In the case of observed rail volumes, both foreign trips
and the large number of trips going to sparsely populated border
areas have been excluded from the comparison. (The trips going
to border zones have been included in the external passenger
analysis.) The worst aEparisons are for the Cochabarnba-Oruro
and the Santa Cruz-Corurnb! sections. For the latter the observed
nurrher of trips implies that each person in the zones on that
line made 3.33 trips per year as opposed to the national average
of 0.27. These factors will be taken into account when this
model is used for testing.
Private Car Passengers
      From the network model, the travel times of light vehicles
can be extracted for each path on the road system. The same
model can also calculate travel costs based on only the fuel
value, but this was not found to be a significant variable in the
determination of private car travel. The socio-economic variable
that is used in this model is the non-rural population of the
zone.
     Based on these variables, an expression for passenger flow
was derived through a multiple linear regression process. The
final expression for private passenger flow is the following:
     FL = 10(ax A + b x B + ex C + d x D + e)
Where:    FL   = the    annual flow of light vehicles between a zone
                   pair
          A    =   the logarithm of the travel time plus 60 minutes
                   between zones of origin and destination
          B    =   the travel time plus 60 minutes
          C    =   the logarithm of urban population in the zone of
                   origin
          D    =   the logarithm of urban population in the zone of
                   destination.
     The constants a, b, c, d and e were found by regression
analysis, which resulted in the following values:
     a   =-4.05258
     b   = 0.00140
     c   = 0.21794
     d   = 0.21738
     e   =10.41454.


                                 -114-
     The passenger flow between each zone pair is derived by
the formula above and is then loaded onto the network in order
to obtain the nUJTI.ber of vehicles using each road link.
These flows are calibrated with those observed at the road survey
screenlines. The results of this calibration are shown in Table
3F-23.

     A relatively great discrepancy is observed at the screenlines
around Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, particularly at the short paved
road links carrying large traffic volumes, as is the case with the
links between Cochabamba, Sacaba and Angostura. The link between
Santa Cruz and Montero is different from most links in the country,
in that it is used by many persons that live in Santa Cruz and work
in Montero, and vice versa, producing a high number of observed
trips without Montero having a big enough urban population to
attract, in the model, as many interurban car trips as were
observed.
Air Transport Passengers
     The air passenger model is a two phase model, the first part
of which is a regression JTlodel and the second part an adjustment
for flight frequency. It was not possible to include frequency
in the regression model, since in this case it would have become
the most important variable in the equation. This would mean
that in future productions the frequency input would determine the
number of passengers almost irrespective of the values of the
other variables. For this type of model it is obviously desirable
that frequency should be an output rather than an input.
     Air Regression Model - The variables that proved most signi-
ficant in this analysis were: total gross domestic product (GDP)      ,
in the zones of origin and destination, as described earlier;
travel cost; and difference in time between surface public trans-
port and air. The following equation was determined to predict
basic passenger flow:
     FL = lO a It A + bit B + C It C + d It 0 + c
where: FL = Annual passenger flow for a zone pair
       A = Logarithm of trip cost
       B = Logarithm of trip time difference
       C = Logarithm of total GOP in the zone of origin
       0 = Logarithm of total GOP in the zone of destination.

     The regression analysis determined the values of the con-
stants which are:

     It should be noted that, because coefficient b is positive,
the n~ber of air trips decreases as surface public transport
time between a pair of zones decreases.
     Flight Frequency Adjustment Model - This was derived by
plotting the ratio of observed trips between a zone pair
divided by the trips predicted by the above model against
flight frequency per week. These data are shown in Table
3F-24 and the line regressed through them is Figure 3F-10.
The equation of the regressed line is:
         R   =   5)( (1 _ e - 0 • 0 2 818 Fl. 5 )

where:   R =     The factor by which to ~ultiply regressed trips in
                 order to get final trips
         F   =   Flight frequency per week.
     The results of applying these models are shown in Table 3F-25
for major city pairs. The regression model by itself under-
estimates trips between zone pairs with high flight frequency
and overestimates those with low flight frequency. Although
the results after application of the adjustment are not perfect,
they are a definite improvement over the pure air regression
model.

                 CASE STUDY OF PROJECT EVALUATION

     Project evaluation falls into three main phases:
     1.    Definition of Alterpatives
     2.    Collection of Relevant Data
     3.    Cost-Benefit Evaluation.
     By far the bulk of the work lies in phase 2, collection of
relevant data. In comparison, the tasks of the definition of
alternatives and the cost-benefit evaluations are remarkably
easy, with complications occurring in only a few cases.
    Definition of Alternatives - All evaluations are concerned
with a comparison of two alternative courses of action. In the
simplest case, one alternative is to do nothing and the other
alternative is to make an improvement (pave a road, clean a
river, extend a runway, rehabilitate a rail line, etc.). In
these cases, the costs of construction are compared with the
savings in costs allowed by 'doing something' compared with
'doing nothing'.
    In the case that a number of different courses of action are
available, they must be evaluated as a series of pairs of alter-
natives. For example, in the case of the rail interconnection,
the following alternatives may be defined:
    1.    Do nothing
    2.    Rehabilitate the existing road
    3.    Build the rail interconnection
    4.    Rehabilitate the existing road and build the rail
            interconnection.
   If the Chimore - Yapacani road is not considered committed,
then the alternative courses of action clearly become more nu-
merous and more complex. In the above case though, three evalua-
tions may be initially defined; 2 vs 1, 3 vs 1 and 4 vs 1 with
the possibilities of later considering 3 vs 2, 4 vs 2 and 4 vs
3 depending upon the earlier results.
    Collection of Relevant Data - Essentially an extension of the
Initial Data Collection stage but this time concerned with
specific problems. Transport costs and traffic forecasts will
come from either the model, from the external traffic forecasts
or from the producers' surplus analysis depending on the project.

Construction costs come from a variety of sources and frequent-
ly present the most problems, usually because of an absence of
information on what the problems are. For example, how high an
embankment would be required on a land connection to Puerto Busch
to keep it above flood levels, what are the soil conditions in
this region and how would they affect costs, how costly would it
be to provide a year round channel to Puerto Ouijarro (how much
rock blasting would be required) and to keep it open thereafter?
These are crucial questions which critically affect an evaluation
but which are often difficult to answer. This is why this stage
of the evaluation can be so time consuming.
    Cost-Benefit Analysis - A process in which the economic be-                 •
nefits of a project are compared with the costs of project im-
plementation. As noted above an evaluation is always a compari-
son of two alternatives. Calling the two alternatives A and B,
the costs could be the additional cost of construction for B com-
pared with A and the benefits in this case would be the savings
in operating costs, in B compared with A. In a little more com-
plexity, the process can be shown in the following example:
A:   Length LA   = 12   km            B:   LB   = 10    km
     Volume 0A   = 70   veh/day            0B   = 100    veh/day

                                                                                '.
Vehicle Operating Cost CA =                CB   =8     pesos per veh-km
11 pesos per veh-km
Maintenance Cost MA     =                  MB   =1     peso per veh-km
2 pesos per veh-km
Construction Cost CCA        =0            CC B   =2    million pesos per km.

    Operating costs over the route per vehicle are 80 pesos in
Band 132 pesos in A. Maintenance costs per vehicle are 10 pe-
sos in Band 24 pesos in A. In both cases, alternative B shows
a saving over A. However, construction costs in Bare 20 million
pesos compared with nothing in A. What then are the costs and
benefits?
    A complicating factor is that traffic has ~ased in B com-
pared with A and this traffic increase is due to the reduction
in transport costs between the two places. This additional traf-
fic is either generated traffic (which would otherwise never had



                              -122-
made the journey) or diverted traffic (traffic which has switched
from another route because it now finds this new route cheaper}.
For example, if the Uncia-Sucre route is improved, it will generate
traffic between the towns of Uncia and Sucre and will also proba-
bly divert Oruro - Sucre traffic from the alternative route via
Potost.
    In calculating benefits, the generated and diverted traffic
are treated separately from 'normal' traffic. Clearly the nor-
mal traffic (the basic 70 vehicles a day) gains all the benefit
from the road improvement, a sum of 52 pesos per vehicle. For
generated and diverted traffic the case is rather different. If
the operating cost saving in B compared with A is only slight,
only a small growth in traffic will occur. This small amount
of traffic will in fact, gain almost all the cost saving of B
compared with A. Were the cost saving of 52 pesos per vehicle
to be reduced slightly, some of the generated' vehicles would dis-
appear and some of the diverted vehicles would no longer find it
worthwhile to divert. In other worlds, these vehicles gain only
a slight advantage in case B compared with A. Therefore, some
of the diverted and generated vehicles enjoy all the cost saving
while others gain only a slight advantage. On average, it is
assumed that this traffic enjoys only half the cost saving of
B compared with A.
    The benefits can be summarized in general terms as follows
(using the symbols given in the example):
Benefits to Normal Traffic:        QA x (LA· CA - LB • CB)
Benefits to Generated and Diverted Traffic:
                      1
    =   (QB - QA) x   2   x (LA • CA - LB • CB)

    Adding these terms together gives:
Total Benefit = ~ x (QA + QB) x (LA • CA - LB • CB,

    The change in maintenance costs can be represented as follows:



Substituting values in the example given above gives the follow-
ing:
Total Benefit   =~    (70 + ~OO,   (12 • ~1 - 10 • 8) + 70.12.2 - 100.10.1



                               -123-
    = 1
      2   x 170 x (132 - 80) + 1680 - 1000

    = 5100 pesos per day
    = 1,861,500 pesos per   year.
Hence the benefit is just under 1.9 million pesos per year com-
pared with a construction cost of 20 million pesos.
    Having established a yearly benefit for the project as well
as its costs, economic indices can be calculated to show the pro-
ject viability.
    The first index to be calculated will be the single year ~989
rate of return which is simply the 1989 annual benefit expressed
as a percentage of the capital costs. Projects should obtain a
rate of return of about eight percent to be worth considering fur-
ther. The example above has a rate of return of just over nine
percent assuming all the costs and volumes apply to 1989.
    After this, a more sophisticated test will be applied taking
into account the total benefits over the life of the project.
Year by year benefits will be estimated based on the 1989 model
traffic forecasts and hopefully also on a 1999 traffic forecast
as well. These benefits as well as construction costs will then
be discounted to a common year.
     This process is shown in Table 3G-l using the values from
the example above. Benefits for the years 1989 and 1999 of 1.9
million and 3.7 million pesos respectively are assumed to come
from the analysis of the model traffic forecast. All other be-
nefits have been estimated to cover a twenty year project life.
Costs of construction are assumed to be spread over three years
after which benefits start accruing to the project.
     The discounting process allows for the fact that a million
pesos received in ten years time is worth less than a million
pesos received today. If this sum is received today, it can be
put in a bank and earn interest. If the interest rate is 10%,
the million pesos will be worth 2.6 million pesos in ten years
time. This is aside from any question of inflation which is
ignored in these calculations. Therefore, it is not good enough
to simply add up the benefits (54.9 million pesos) and compare
with the investment (20 million pesos) and say the project is
worthwhile.   If the money had been put in a bank in 1981, it
would have earned 140 million pesos at 10% interest by 2003 which,
on the face of it, is considerably more than the project benefits.
However, this is just as much a distortion of reality as before
and Simply adds emphasis to the need to discount all costs and
benefits to a common year.    It does not matter whether 1981 or
2003 is ~ although the earlier year is more usual as shown
in the table. If several projects are being evaluated, the dis-
count year must be common to them all.

     Of course, the alternative to building the project is not
only to put the money in a bank to earn interest. This simply
represents the most conservative way in which the money could
be put to work and is the base against which to compare the be-
nefit earning potential of a project. If a project cannot do
at least as well as this it is not worth considering.
     The interest rate, or discount rate, chosen is not a bank
interest rate as such. It is often referred to as the opportunity
cost of capital and represents the minimum potential earning
capacity of capital. If capital is spent on a project, it can-
not be spent on an alternative project and the benefits from this
alternative project are foregone. The opportunity cost repre-
sents the minimum benefits which could be earned elsewhere and
so for a project to be viable and to justify investment, it has
to earn benefits at at least this rate. The ~rtmUt¥ cost, or
minimum discount rate, is usually fixed by government or by a
lending agency and today is often about 10 or 12 percent.
     In countries where a lot of capital is available and only
a few projects could be justified at this discount rate, such as
in a major oil exporting country, the minimum discount rate may
well be much lower. On the other hand where there are a lot of
projects competing for limited capital, as 1s probably the case
in Bolivia, the minimum discount rate may have to be set much
higher to help select the most worthwhile projects.
     In the example above, the discounted costs at 10 percent
are more than the discounted benefits (18.6 vs 15.9 million pe-
sos). On this basis, if 10 percent represents the minimum dis-
count rate, the project is not viable. The alternatives are to
postpone construction or to reduce design standards and hence
construction costs in the hope that benefits would be reduced
to a lesser degree. In both these cases, the comparison of dis-
counted costs and discounted benefits would become more favora-
ble and the project could become viable.
      Several different indices are available for comparing the
sums of discounted costs and benefits. One is Net Present Value
 (NPV) which is simply the benefits minus the costs. For a pro-
ject to be viable, NPV must be zero or positive at the minimum
discount rate. In the example, NPV is -2.7 million. Another
index is the benefit cost ratio which is the benefit divided by
the costs. To be viable, the ratio must be greater than 1. In
the example, the ratio is 0.86. The last is the Internal Rate
of Return (IRR) which is the discount rate which would give a
zero NPV. Viability is indicated by an IRR at least as high as
the minimum discount rate. The IRR in the example is 8.5 per-
cent as indicated in the table.

     The above represents the basic approach on established
links or on new links in comparatively developed regions. In
the underdeveloped regions, the producers' surplus approach
will be used which seeks to identify the increased production
in a region caused by a transport project and the benefits which
accrue from this. Fundamentally, it is no different from the
evaluation outlined above except that the emphasis is on generated
traffic and on the underlying reasons for this traffic.
Conclusions and Recommendations
     Having evaluated individual transport projects, the Study
must now select projects to make up a Transport Master Plan.
Possibly more than one plan will be outlined in order to face
such issues as the need for national unification and defense and
this aspect is dealt with in another note. The economic evalua-
tion of projects will be refined to establish the optimum start
year although this will be subject to budget restrictions and the
need for continuity of a project in particular corridors. The
number of projects included will of course be subject to budget
limitations. This may also lead to the reduction in design stan-
dards so that a limited budget can be shared by more projects.
     Finally recommendations will be made on transport pricing,
equipment requirements, maintenance policies and transport or-
ganization and management to harmonize with the selected Trans-
port Master Plan.

            EVJI.LUATION OF NEW MODES ON EXISTING LINKS


     When a new transport route, be it a road, rail, river or
air, is opened up where previously there was no feasible means
of transport, the benefit to the users of that route is measured
directly by estimating the producer1s surplus thereby generated;
and when an existing route is improved or replaced by another
facility of the same mode, the benefit to existing users is
measured directly from their savings in transport costs and the
benefit to new users is usually measured indirectly from the
cost reductions that induced them to use the route. But when
a new facility, say a road or a railroad is introduced on a
route already served by another mode, a new problem arises,
namely the problem of quality of service.
      When a road is improved, of course the quality of service
is improved, and this improvement is measured in terms of higher
journey speed, lower vehicle operating costs and possibly savings
in accidents. But the road is still a road and offers the basic
characteristics of road transport. A railroad offers diffferent
characteristics in respect of loading, scheduling, comfort, safety,
security from theft and damage, reliability, convenience and other
aspects. If speed and cost are the same by road and rail, some
users prefer rail, others prefer road, for a wide variety of
reasons. If a railway is introduced where only a road presently
exists, some traffic will transfer from road to rail for reasons
quite apart from any attraction of lower cost or higher speed.
Naturally the users that transfer to rail will tend to be those
that most value the particular attributes of rail transport.
Equally there may be others who transfer to rail only because it
is cheaper, but who actually consider it an inferior service to
road.
     The problem is how to evaluate correctly the benefits from
the new mode, taking into account the significant difference in
quality of service offered. We may consider first the traffic
that transfers from the existing to the new mode, and secondly
new traffic generated by the new mode.
Traffic Transferrina   to New Mode
      The only available information about users' modal preferences
is contained in the diversion curves produced for distributing
goods traffic between road and rail. In principle other diversion
curves could be produced for other modal choices and for passengers
as well as goods. The purpose of the diversion curve is to
introduce into the modal distribution the influence of the
amalgam of service quality differences (with the possible exclusion
of speed, which may be treated as a separate variable factor or
combined with cost). If diversion curves are not used and modal
distribution is- deter~ined solely by cost and speed, the influence
and importance of other service quality differences are ignored.

                             -129
     Two road/rail diversion curves have been produced, for
agricultural and non-agricultural products respectively. See
Figure 3H-l and Tables 3H-l and 3H-2. If the price of road trans-
port is known (and is independent of the price of rail transport)
demand curves for rail traffic ean be inferred from the diversion
curves. These are shown in Figure 3H-2 for aqricultural and non-
agricultural products respectively, with the price of a road trip
taken as equal to 1 and the quality of rail traffic expressed as
a percentage of the traffic formerly using tbe road.
     The benefits to rail users are measured by the area between
the demand curve and the rail price line~i.e. if ~ rail price is      •
0.6 the benefits are measured by the shaded area above 0.6 and
below the demand curve.
     These curves are, of course, the same as the diversion curves
with the axes moved. But an essential feature of the derrand curve,
unlike the diversion curve, is that the price of any competing
product - in this case, road transport - is fixed. When the price
of road transport is known, the price axis ean be shown in pesos
per ton-km instead of ratios; and when the total volume of
traffic is known, the traffic axis can be shown in ton-km instead
of percentages.Then ~ areas under the demand curves will be direct
measures of value in terms of pesos.
     If the road is improved at the same time, or before, the
demand curves for rail transport will fall and the area of surplus
or benefit above the price line will be correspondingly reduced.
This reflects the obvious.fact that, the better the road, the
less will be the benefit from building the railway and the less
traffic will use it.
Generated Traffic
     A new railway, or any other new mode, may be expected to
generate new traffic which was not attracted to the other mode. If
the railway is much cheaper to use than the road, the amount of
generated traffic might be substantial, but there is no satis-
factory way of estimating it.   Without more information about
the relative attractions of road and rail, there seems to be no
entirely logical way of estimating the amount of generated
traffic.
     The following method, however, is recoIDro.ended as the best
available:
     (a)   Distribute existing traffic between road and rail in
           accordance with the diversion curve.

                            DEMAND CURVES FOR RAIL TRANSPORT
Wlbul' Smifh and AJociafeJ                                                                                                                            FI GURE        3H-2
     (b)   Raise the volume of rail traffic in proportion to the
           cost difference between road and rail, i.e. apply a
           demand elasticity of unity with respect to cost to
           that part of the traffic attracted to rail. -
     (c)   Redistribute the new volume of traffic in accordance
           with the diversion curve.
     (d)   For purposes of evaluation assume that all generated
           traffic is among the rail traffic.
     This method is weak in logic but is the best that can be
offered without more information of a kind that would be
impossible to obtain.
Method of Calculation
     For a given zone-to-zone movement let
     v = existing tonnage of agricultural or non-agricultural
         products
     A = cost of transport per ton by road
     B = cost of transport per ton by rail
     x = percentage of tonnage transferring to rail
     y = benefit coefficient
     The value y represents the area under the demand curve for
a given percentage of traffic transferring to rail. It is
obtained from Table 3H-3, with interpolation as necessary. It
is read from the table against the value x.
     Given the values of V, A, B, x and y, we have the follm'ling
results:
     Tonnage by rail:     Ito   {I +         100    (~- 1})

     Tonnage by road: (10°1()OX)V (1 + 100 (~ - 1)}

                                x        A
     Total tonnage: V(l + 100 (B - 1})

     Generated tonnage:   160       (~   - 1) ,negative       values taken as O.

     Benefits to existing traffic:                 V   (Ay - Bx) (2 + x(A-B) - ~)
                                               TIn)                     lOOB       B


    Benefits to generated traffic: 160 (Ay - Bx)

     Total benefits: 1 V
                       OO (Ay - Bx)                (1 + x (A-B))

Example:
     Let V = 1,500 tons (agricultural products)
         A = 300 pesos
         B = 200 pesos
         x = 49.4 percent
         y = 46.02
     Hence,
     tonnage by rail     =    924
     tonnage by road     =    947
     total tonnage       = 1,871
     generated tonnage   =    371
     benefits to existing traffic (i.e. 553 tons transferring
     to rail) = 43,991 pesos
     benefits to generated traffic (i.e. 371 tons on rail)
     = 29,445 pesos
     Total benefits = 73,436 pesos.
Extension of Existing   ~odes   into New Corridors
     In the above analysis, the situation was considered of the
introduction of a completely new mode into a corridor, previously
only served by another different mode. In this Study, we are
principally referring to the introduction of a railway when
previously there was only a road. What was not considered
above was the possibility that, although only one mode previously
existed in the corridor under consideration, traffic could have
arrived by the new mode using links already in existence outside
the corridor. For example, La Paz-Cochabamba-Santa Cruz traffic
can presently move either entirely by road or alternatively, by
rail to Cochaba~ba and then by road to Santa Cruz. In this case,
the traffic in the Cochabamba-Santa Cruz corridor will be a mixture
of vehicles which !"lave come all the way from La Paz, and vehicles
which have picked up a load in Cochabaroba which has arrived there
from La Paz by rail. If now the rail interconnection is built, it
can be presumed that the previous La Paz-Cochabamba rail ~ovements
will continue to Santa Cruz all the way by rail, and some of the
La Paz-Santa Cruz road movements will transfer to rail. In addition,
some traffic will be generated by the new rail line. This is a
slightly more complicated situation than considered earlier, and
the argument must be carried a little further.
     Considering the situation before and after extending a rail
link into a corridor previously served only by road, and adapting
the previous terminology:



                                -135-
     Let   A =   Cost by road
           Bl=   Cost by rail before (in fact~ a road-rail movement)
           B2=   Cost by rail after
           xl=   % by rail before
           X2=   % by rail after
           Yl=   Benefit coefficient corresponding to Xl
           Y2=   Benefit coefficient corresponding to x2
           Vl=   Volume by road before
           V2=   Volume by rail before
           V =   Vl + v2 = Total volume before                         I

           T =   Total volume after
                                                                       •
     In this situation, generated traffic can be estimated
considerinq the change in costs from road-rail (before)to
pure rail (after). Hence the total traffic in the corridor             ,
after will be:                  B
                      T   =   V + V
                                          1                            •
                               l    2    B2
                                                                       •
     Consider now the two diagrams:                                    •




     The diagrams show demand curves with the shaded area showing
the benefits to traffic on a new rail link.
     The two demand curves are not complete and show simply the
volume of traffic using rail at a given rail to road cost ratio
when total demand is fixed - at V in the case of Cl,and at T in
the case of C2. A complete demand curve could be drawn by
estimating generated traffic in the manner indic~ted previous-
ly.     For example, points band g in the right hand diagram
are on the complete demand curve.
     The diagram on the left shows the situation discussed earlier.
The area above the price ratio (i.e. the total benefit) is measured
by:




                                 -136-
     All this benefit accrues to either diverted or generated
traffic.
     The diagram on the right shows the more complex situation.
Clearly, the area abed measured the benefit to traffic already
on rail while area bgfe measured the benefit to diverted and
generated traffic.
      Area abed is easily measured as:

      V2 (B - B )
           l   2
     Area bgfe is less easily measured but can possibly be
taken as the following sum:
                 1
      bgfe     = 7      (abcgfed + abfed) - abed

                   1
      Say      =
                   7    (Ai + A2 ) - A3


      A3 is given as above = V2 (B l - B2 )

            T
      Ai = TIfO (A (Y2 - Y1 ) - B2X2 + B1X l )

            V
      A2 = TIfO    (A   (Y2 - Yl) - B2X2 + B1X l )


             Benefit to generated and diverted traffic




     and this can be distributed equally among the volumes of
such traffic.
Introduction of a New Road
          The previous demand curve and table of benefit coefficients
 covered the case of the introduction of a new railroad into a corridor already
 served by road. The alternative case of the introduction of a new road in
a corridor already served by railroad requires a different deIIland curve and a
set of brnefit coefficients, and these are shown in Figure 3H-3 and
Table 3H-4 respectively.
