THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1422-B0)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following Is a Project Completion Report on Bolivia's Third
Railway Project, for which a loan in the amount of US$35.0 million waa
approved by the Executive Directors on May 12, 1977. Loan funds are fully
committed and US$0.4 million remaining in the loan account are expected to be
disbursed shortly.
The Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and
Caribbean Regional Office and is based upon information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board oL Directors meeting, LAC Information Center, staff
project appraisal and supervision reports, consultants' reports and a final
report prepared by the Bolivian National Railways (BNFE).
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
COED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Complotion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments. Their reply is shown as
Annex 4 to the PCR.

TH- RALWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1422-BO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Third Railway Project was to assist ENFE in its rehabilitation
and modernization through the financing of the foreign exchange component of
the investments contemplated for the first two years (1977-1978) of the
Railway's 1977-1981 Investment Plan (para 2.01). The project included track
rehabilitation works, the procurement of telecommunications equipment and
rolling stock, and the continuation of the improvement of workshcr 3 which had
been intiated under the two previous projects (para 2.02).  In aoLAition to
the financing of ENY8's investment plan, the project included, inter-alia,
technical assistance for updating the UNDP-financed, Bank-executed, 1967
National Transport Survey (para 2.03).
Physical kompletion of the project was achieved about three years
later than planned, mainly because the period of project implementation
coincided with a time of increasing economic and political instability in
Bolivia, which resulted in fE equent changes of Government officials, lack of
counterpart funds and a suspension of disbursements on all Bank financed
projects between December 1983 and July 1984 (para 3.01). Other factors
contributing to delays included lack of sufficient ballast for track
rehabilitation (para 3.02), slow procurement procedures (para 3.11), and
exceptional rains in early 1979 which severely damaged ENFE's permanent way
and required a shift of resources from the track rehabilitation program to
repair the damage (paras 3.02 and 8.07).
ENPE's operational performance seldom reached the appraisal
targets, although under the adverse circumstances it could be considered
satisfactory (pars 4.07). The financial situation of the railway
deteriorated drastically until 1981, when substantial tariff increases and a
reduction of the wage blll reversed the situation (paras 5.01 to 5.04). The
lower than expected operational and financial performances of ENPE were
mostly for reasons outside of the railways control. ENPE consistently made
every effort to comply with the agreed targets (para 6.03).
The economic reevaluation of ENFE's investments yielded an
estimated rate of return of 21%, in line with the 20X estimated at
appraisal. However, disaggregated analysis of the investments in.the Western
and Eastern Systems yielded results that differs substantially from appraisal
estimates. The estimated returns on investments in freight transport in the
Western System are quite above those expected at ap,eaisal, while the reverse
is true for the Eastern System. In the case of inr ;stments for passenger
transport in both systems, the analysis yields estimated returns below those
calculated at appraisal (para 7.02).



v 
Because the subject project was the third in a series of projects
to rehabilitate the Bolivian railways, tch, Completion Report discusses the
long-term association of the Bank and ENFE, and attributes its success tc a
well founded interpretation of the Borrower's priorities and problems, a
clear definition of the overall objectives of the projects and the Bank's
allocation of the necessary manpower to closely follow project implementation
(paras 8.02 to 8.05).
The project Completion Report presents the following conclusions:
(a) Foremost among t.i-e reasons for the success of the Bank involvement
in the Bolivian railways was a Borrower with an exceptional degree
of commitment toward the project objectives (para 9.01);
(b) Bank supervision should be closely tailored to the needs of the
Borrowers (para 9.01);
(c)  Sectoral planning efforts should be in line with the planning
framework in the rest of the economy (para 9.03); and
(d) The Bank position regarding investments in the Santa Cruz-Jacapani
line may have been unrealistic. It would have been more practical
to negotiate a procedure permitting the Bank to micigate the
uneconomic impact of the investments (para 9.04).



BOLIVIA
THIRD RAILMAY PROJECT (LOAU 1422-BO)
PROJECT COPI?TION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Bolivia, one of the two land-locked countries of South America, has
an area of 1.1 million km2 and a population of about 5.9 million, making it
the least densely populated country in Latin America,, The population is
unevenly distributed within the three distinct geographical regions of the
country: 52Z live in the highlands which represent 16% of the country's area,
27Z live in the valleys which cover 20X of the area, and only 21% live in the
lowlands with 642 of the country's area. Because of topographica' barriers
and long distances, the role of transportation in encouraging economic
development through the interchange of proauction among regions is unusually
difficult. The provision of adequate transportaticu is further complicated
by low traffic densities.
1.02      Except for the transport of petroleum and natural gas, the Bolivian
economy relies primarily upon the railway system to carry its external trade,
as well as about 6% of its internal traffic. The system consists of about
3,400 km of meter gauge railway line (Map IBRD 18044 (PCR)). The only line
not operated by the Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles (ENFE) is that from
Machacamarca to Uncia (105 km), which is- operated by CONIBOL, a Government-
owned mining enterprise. The railways form two separate systems, the Western
and the Bastern, the former carrying about 65%, and the latter 35% of total
traffic. The Western System was built between 1870 and 1920, largely in
response to the need of the mining industry for transport to Chilean Pacific
ports. The Western System consists of over 2,100 km of railways, linking the
maiut towns in the southwest of the country and providing access to the ports
of Matarani (Peru), Arica and Antofagasta (Chile), and (via Villazon) to the
A--gentine ports.  The Eastern System, built during the 1950s, consists of two
major lines which connect, respectively, with the Brazilian and Argentine
systems. The railways are the only significant mode of surface transport in
Eastern Bolivia, where most of the n<w exports (agricultural products and
gas) originate. At present, connections between the two systems are via a
600-km journey on the Argentine railway or via the road between Santa Cruz
and Cochabamba.
1.03      The Bank has been active in the Bolivian transport sector since
1969. Loans totaling almost US$150 million have been made to assist gas
pipeline construction, road maintenance, aviation development and railway
rehabilitation. The loans have followed a consistent policy of financing
major export projects or assisting in the rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure. Only the Aviation Development Project aimed, in part, toward
substantially improving exieting facilities, and even this goal was modified
during the course of the pruject.



2-
1.04      This project completion report is based upon information obtained
from the Minutes of the Board of Directors meetings, LAC Information Center,
Staff Appraisal Report and supervision reports, consultants' reports and a
final report prepared by ENFE.
II.  PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      In 1970, UND? provided funds for technical assistance to ENFE to
define and assist in the financial, managerial, operational and technical
rehabilitation of the railways. A French consulting firm was retained for
the task, and the Bank was the Executing Agency. In the context of their
work, the consultants defined an action program for improvements and a
Five-Year Rehabilitation Investment Plan for 1973-1977. This Investment Plan
was supported by the First and Second Railway Projects (Credit 346-BO, US$8.0
million, 1972 and Loan 1121-BO, US$32.0 1/ million, 1975). The French
consultants, who remained during the imptementation of the two projects to
assist ENFE in its rehabilitation and modernization efforts, developed the
1977-1981 Investment Plan amounting to a total of US$168.8 million. The
Third Railway Project, subject of this report, was to finance, inter alia,
the foreign exchange component of the investments contemplated for thge First
two years (1977-1978) of that plan.
2.02      ENFE's Investment Plan included track rehabi±itation works, the
procurement of telecommunications equipment and rolling stock, and the
continuation of the improvement of workshops which had been initiated under
the previous projects. It also included a program of technical assistance
for such tasks as training in operation and workshop management.  In striving
for the balance of the plan, efforts were made to correct, as far as
possible, the low priority that had been given, in the two previous loans, to
track rehabilitation. In addition to the investment plan, the project was to
include a pilot program for sites ard services for the construction of
housing for railway employees and a minimum program for the rehabilitation of
part of the Arica-La Paz line in Chile.
2.03      During project preparation, a transport sector mission identified
several maintenance and investment requirements (particularly for
re,ablilitation) in the Bolivian transport sector; it also recommended
updating a 1967 National Transport Survey and strengthening the Directorate
of Planning and Coordination under the Ministry of Transport, Communications
and Civil Aviation (MTCCA). The Bank's main objective was to assist in
identifying high priority infrastructure projects and to guide in the
selection of an investment program which by then was only partly defined.  It
was decided that the most effective approach would be to promote overall
transport coordination and, at the same time, to focus upon the most
important individual transport modes. To that end, the Bank's previous
involvement with railways and pipelines was being complemented t-y its support
for an aviation project and the preparation of a Highway Maintenance
Project. In order to assist the Government in the selection of projects
1/   The amount was later reduced to US$28.7 million when ENFE secured
bilateral financing for the purchase of diesel locomotives.



- 3 -
meeting the development strategy, the rehabilitation and maintenance of the
existing transport system and the upgrading of managerial capabilities to
perform these tasks, it was decided to include, in the proposed Third Railway
Project, technical assistance for updating the 1967 Natioaal Transport
Survey. Advanced technical assistance for highway maintenance was also to be
included to improve personnel training,-define proper maintenance procedures,
and assist the staff from the National Road Services (SCN) in the final steps
of preparation of the proposed Bank-financed Highway Maintenance Project.
2.04      The project was appraised in November 1976, and an Issues Paper was
circulated on November 22, 1976. The Decision Memorandum, issued on December
15, 1976, dealt mainly with:
(a)  Arica-La Pcz Line: Since the proposed investments were to provide
minor benefits to Chile, it was decided that - if, as a result of
further examination, a Chilean guarantee was required and could not
be obtained2/ - the US$1.0 million allocated for that purpose
would be deleted from the loan. In that event,the Bank would
request satisfactory assurances from the Bolivian Government that
the line would be maintained adequately;
b) §Staff Housing: Since the Bank's Urban Projects Division was
scheduled to appraise an urban development project in early 1977,
and one of the main objectives of that project was to coordinate
the efforts of the various agencies in the housing sector
(including ENFE), the Bank felt that it would be inadvisable to
include a separate housing p-ogram in the Railway Project;
(c) Passenger services: On the premise that the railways had the
potential to generate sufficient revenues to fully cover marginal
costs, and for safety reasons, it was agreed to finance the
purchase of five urgently needed passenger coaches. The other
coaches (45) included in the investment plan would be purchased
only if the economic rate of return for passenger services was not
much below 12%3/;
(d) Size and Timing of the Project: Based upon ENFE's performance in
the execution of previous projects, it was decided that the track
rehabilitation program in the proposed project was too ambitious
and that the extent of the works and plan periods would be reduced
by careful rephasing; and
2/ The Decision Memorandum was probably referring to Article III, Section
4(i) of the Articles of AgrFement.
3/   The Bank felt that, given the high social value of the services provided
by the railways, especially on the Eastern line where there was not any
transport alternative, cross-subsidization from freight revenues could
be appropriate to cover a portion of the fixed cost of passenger
services.

(e) Loan Amount: It was agreed to recommend a loan for US$45.0 million,
an increase of US$10.0 million over the amount contemplated in the
Bank's lending program.
2.05      Subsequent to the Decision Meeting, the Bank's management did not
approve the proposed increase in the loan amount. The size and scope of the
project were therefore reduced by deleting the maintenance works on the
Arica-La Paz line and the acquaiLtion of passenger cars and by reducing the
proposed track rehabilitation works.
2.06      Negotiations were held in Washington between April 7 and 8, 1977,
and a loan of to US$35.0 mllion was approved by the Executive Directors on
May 12, 1977. The apprcved project elements and their estimated costs, as
summarized in the Appraisal Report, were as follows:

respectively. The project was expected to be completed in June 1981, and the
loan Closing Date was set at December 31, 1981.
III. PROJECT DMPLEHENTATION AND COSTS
A. General
3.01      The project was completed about three years later than planned,
mainly because the period of project implementation coincided with a time of
increasing economic and political instabi 'ity in Bolivia, which resulted in
frequent changes of Government officials, lack of counterpart funds and,
between December 1983 and July 1984, a suspension of disbursements on all
Bank financed projects. Other factors contributing to delays in project
implementation included lack of sufficient ballast for track rehabilitation,
slow procurement procedures and exceptional rains in early 1979, which
severely damaged ENFE's permanent way and required a shift of resources from
the track rehabilitation program to repair the damage. What follows is a
discussion ot the implementation -%f the main project components.
B. Track Rehabilitation Program
3.02      Table 1 summarizes achieveaaents under the program as compared with
the targets agreed upon during appraisal. By the end of 1978, only 32% of
the Bank-financed 1977-1978 programed rehabilitation had been carried out.
The track rehabilitation fell behind the appraisal schedule for the following
reasons: (a) the appraisal schedule was over-optimistic, assuming a yearly
rate of rehabilitation considerably higher than that accomplished by ENFE in
the two previous Bank-financed projects; (b) severe budget constraints
limited the purchase of ballast and ties; (c) lack of spare parts for
equipment and tools for the track gangs; (d) extremely low availability of
tamping machines; (e) tine spent repairing damage resulting from derailments
on unstable tracks caused by the 1979 and 1980 floods; and (f) periods of
labor unrest. In addition, track rehabilitation was hampered by a chronic
low ballast production. This problem had beer, recurrent in the two previous
ENFE projects. It stemmed mostly from a lack of agreement between the
Government and the ballast quarries on unit ptices and was exacerbated by
high domestic inflation in Bolivia, during project implementation, which
endangered the profitability of the quarries and complicated the costing
exercise. The Third Railway Project included funds for the purchase of a
ballast plant. However, because of very high bid prices and the fact that
the government was able to contract ballast supplies on favorable conditions
from the local quarries, the plant was deleted from the project. While the
purchase of the plant might have eased the problem somewhat, it is unlikely
that it could have had a substantial Impact upon accelerating the execution
of the program. The program was completed in 1983 with only minor
revisions. The quality of the works is good.



-6-
C. Other Ways and Works
3.03      The project included the installation of 36 bridges on the
Uyuni-Ollague line, the construction of four realignments on the La
Paz-Villazon line, the reconstruction of earth fills and protection works and
the reconstruction of the Borrower's telecommunications system. Erection of
32 bridges, which had been purchased under the previous project, was
completed in 1983. Because of lack of funds, cement shortages
and adverse climatic conditions, the completion of four minor bridges, with a
lower priority, has been postponed. The other project elements were
completed as envisaged at appraisal, albeit with delays of two to three
years.
D.  Procurement of Rolling Stock
3.04      The project included funds for the acquisition of 300 freight
cars.  After some delays caused by the cancellation of the original tender
(due to problems arising from specifications that were too broad in scope),
ENFE opened the bids for optional orders of 300 or 500 freight cars. Because
of extremely favorable bid prices, ENFE, with Bank approval, purchased 500
cars at a total cost of US$8.5 million as compared with the US$7.9 million
estimated at appraisal for 300 cars. In this way, ENFE brought forward, by
two years, investments programed for 1980. The difference in the cost of the
additional cars was financed with funds realized from the lower-than-expected
prices of track laying and maintenance equipment and/or deletion of other
project items such as the ballast plant.
3.05      Although the project did not include the purchase of passenger
coaches, ENFE's investment plan contemplated the acquisition of four coaches
in 1979. However, plans had to be revised when a tragic railway accident in
early 1977 resulted in the loss of eight passenger coaches. The Bank agreed
with ENFE on the need to replace the lost coaches and to buy the four
additional ones included in the investment plan, and it advised the Borrower
regarding the advantages of acquiring used cars. ENFE tried to obtain used
passenger coaches from railway companies in neighboring countries, but with
no success. Hence, the Bank agreed to finance the procurement of 12 new
passenger coaches under the loan. Subsequent to this arrangement, the
Government secured a loan from Argentina for the purchase of an additional 48
passenger coaches, payment for which would not be a responsibility of ENFE.
The Bank agreed to this change in the investment program on the basis of
social needs.
E. Rehabilitation of Rolling Stock and Motive Power
3.06      The project included the repair of two cannibalized diesel-electric
locomotives, three diesel-hydraulic shunters, one mainline diesel-hydraulic
locomotive, and the rehabilitation of 138 freight cars at the Uyuni
workshop. The repair of locomotives and shunters was carried out according
to the original program. Under the freight car rehabilitation program, 149
cars were overhauled in 1978, surpassing the appraisal target.



-7-
3.07      Maintenance of motive power and rolling stock was consistently
below the levels agreed in the action program and resulted in a deterioration
of the availability of locomotives and cars. The program was affected mainly
by a lack of spare parts due both to insufficient funds and to delays
experienced in their procurement. During the project period, the Bank agreed
to increase the loan funds allocated to the procurement of spares. While
this increase was helpful, it was not enough to offset the negative impact
that the lack of local funds, labor unrest and the suspension of disbursement
of Bank funds had upon the achievements in this area.
F. Workshops
3.08      The project included funds for:
(a)  Completion and transformation of the Viacha workshop into the
Borrower's main diesel workshop.
(b) Completion of the upgrading of the Guaracachi workshop so that it
might maintain and overhaul the diesel motive power fleet that ENFE
had purchased for the Eastern System.
(c) Completion of the transformation of the Oruro workshop into a
diesel depot so that it might carry out routine maintenance and
small repairs on all diesel motive power units of the Western
System.
(d) Completion of the transformation of the Uyuni workshop to maintain
and overhaul all the passenger and freight cars of the Western
System.
(e) Completion of the transformation of the Robore workshop to maintain
and overhaul all the passenger and freight cars of the Eastern
System.
(f) Installation of facilities at Quijano and Jacuiba sheds to cope
with the requirements of diesel locomotives and railcars of the
Eastern System.
Except for the installation of facilities at the Yacuiba workshop, which was
assigned a lower priority, works were carried out as planned, and the
workshops were, for the most part, operational by 1979. However, because of
delays in the procurement of some tools and equipment, it took until 1983 to
fully complete this project component. Several Bank missions visited these
facilities and reported that they were well organized, well staffed and
fairly efficient.
G. Dieselization and Phasing out of Steam Locomotives and Old Rolling Stock
3.09      Full dieselization of both the Western and Eastern Systems wits
completed by the end of 1979, in line with the schedule included in the



-8-
action program. Scrapping of old locomotives and rolling stock, although
already out of service, is still awaiting the Government's approval.
H. Sigaling and Telecommunications System
3.10      Modernization of the signaling and telecommunications system
comprised, inter alia, the acquisitien and installation of automatic
telephone switching boards and radio connections by ultra high frequency
(UHF). This project element was completed satisfactorily in mid-1983.
I.  Procurement
3.11      The approval of tenders financed by the Bank was extremely slow,
many times being delayed for more than six months. Bid evaluations needed
the approval of the wJunta de Adquisiciones," a Government-appointed
committee whose membership was changed each time a new Government came to
power, i.e., five times in 1979. In periods of political unrest, which
occurred quite frequently, either the committee did not meet at all or
there was no quorum. In addition, the procurement process was delayed by
lengthy discussions of the committee regarding bids for which the scope of
the specifications was too broad and by the Bank's refusal to accept award
proposals conflicting with Bank guidelines.  These problems often resulted in
the expiration of offers and the need for retendering.
J. The National Transport Survey
3.12      During project preparation, the need to update the knowledge
regarding the Bolivian transport facilities and equipment, their condition
and their ability to meet expected demands was recognized. Hence, the
project included the updating of the National Transport Survey, which had
been carried out in 1969 with financing provided by UNDP and the Bank acting
as Executing Agency. The technical assistance to the Directorate of Planming
and Coordination was designed to cover both the study of the sector and the
implementation of the recommendations expected to emanate from that study,
and was partially financed by the Bank and UNDP, with the Bank acting as
Executing Agency.
3.13      Updating of the National Transport Survey started about one year
later than scheduled at appraisal. Difficulties in appointing suitable
counterparts and the Government postponements of approval of the contract
with the selected US consulting firm were the main reasons for the delays.
Once the research phase of the survey commenced, it proceeded reasonably
smoothly until the completion of the final report in 1983. The report itself
was received favorably by the Bank. Some of its recommendations have been
implemented, or have influenced institutional changes that took place. For
example, the structure of rail tariffs has been revised, the regulation of
the road freight industry has been reduced and the administration of water
transport has been simplified.
3.14      The group of professionals formed in the context of the National
Transport Survey, under the name of EIT (Estudio Integral de Transporte),



-9-
received technical assistance for the implementation stage of the survey for
a period of two years. Unfortunately, its isolation from the day-to-day
activities of the Ministry and the lack of any formal role for the team
limited its influence. Furthermore, the unit is now experiencing
serious staffing cotstraints since only a few of the original core of
professionals remained in the Ministry.
K. Advanced Technical Assistance for Highway Maintenance
3.15      This technical assistance was carried out by US consultants and
supervised under the Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 1587-BO; US$25.0
million; 1978).
L. Consultants
3.16      ENFE retained, under the project, the same French consulting firm
that had assisted the railway in the first two phases of its rehabilitation
to provide technical assistance in various areas. During the course of their
assignment, the consultants were mostly successful in addressing the
weaknesses in ENFE's technical and operational activities. In support of
ENFE's action plan to improve the management of the Eastern System, part of
the expatriate team was based in Santa Cruz, a measure that, coupled with
major changes in the upper echelon of local personnel and a substantial
increased presence of ENFE's General Manager in Santa Cruz, resulted in
noticeable improvements in the efficiency of operation. Increased consultant
manpower was allocated to track rehabilitation. The program, however,
proceeded very slowly because of the problem discussed in paragraph 3.02.
While the technical assistance in freight car rehabilitation, motive power
maintenance, workshop rehabilitation and improvement of ENFE's telecommunica-
cations network had positive resdlts, there was less accomplished in the area
of financial administration. Financial information is still not produced
fast enough, limiting its usefulness for management decisions; assets
revaluation was completed at a much slower rate than originally envisaged,
and also, for legal reasons, outstanding accounts between the two railway
systems, accumulated over a number of years, have not been fully reconciled.
3.17      In 1982, ENFE contracted the services of a Spdnish consulting firm
to assist in the preparation of the 1983-1987 railway investment plan, which
was to be the basis of a proposed Bank-financed project. This technical
assistance was not part of the original Third Railway Project, but was
partially financed by the proceeds of the loan. In addition to preparing the
investment plan, the consultants studied the need for an intermodal connec-
tion in the Cochabamba-Santa Cruz corridor. Their report on the investment
plan was reviewed extensively by the Bank.  The study on the intermodal
connection was completed in late 1984 and is being reviewed by the Bank.

M. Project Costs
3.18      Table 2 shows a comparison between the appraisal estimate and
the actual project costs. The final cost of the project was US$59.5 million,
about 7% above the appraisal estimate, including contingencies. While the
expected and the actual costs of the major elements of the project cannot be
readily compared because of slight changes in their scope and the type of
detailed input disaggregation in which those costs were presented at
appraisal, the original estimates seem to have been quite accurate. This
accuracy resulted mostly from the experience gained in the two previous
projects, iln which costs had been substantially underestimated.
N. Disbursements
3.19      As shown in the following table, disbursements lagged behind
appraisal estimates from the start, mostly because of the slow progress of
the track rehabilitation and procurement programs.  By the end of 1983, when
disbursements were suspended, 952 of the loan funds had been disbursed. The
loan closing date was extended from December 31, 1981 to December 31, 1983
and then to December 31, 1984. Loan funds are fully committed, and US$0.4
million remaining in the loan account is expected to be disbursed shortly.

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
A. Traffic
4.01      Comparisons between actual freight and passenger traffic and their
appraisal forecasts are presented in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. During
project appraisal, total freight and passenger traffic in unit-km, were
forecast to increase by 20% and 27% respectively during the four-year period
4/   As of May 1985.



- 11 -
between 1977 (the first year of the investment program) and 1981 (the horizon
year for the analysis). Freight traffic in ton-km actually increased by 7%
during that period and passenger traffic in passenger-km by 22%. In 1981,
passenger traffic was above the forecast in the west (5%) and below the
forecast in the east (29%), while freight traffic was below the forecast both
in the west and the east by 5% and 29% respectively.
4.02      In terms of total units carried, the appraisal estimates for the
period under consideration were reasonably accurate, although there were
considerable differences between actual and forecast traffic, for each
element of the forecast, during the intervening years. Total passengers
carried were about 3% above the forecast, and total freight-tonnage was 14%
below the forecast. The average haul for freight increased from 492 km in
1977 to 502 km in 1981, and the average haul for passengers remained stable
during the same period.
4*03      Traffic levels fluctuated considerably from year to year.  The
fluctuations become even more dramatic if the period of analysis is extended
to include 1982 and 1983, the most recent years for which data are
available. Passenger traffic on the Eastern System declined by 17% during
1979, while it increased by 24% in 1980. The increase in passenger traffic
for the Western System during 1980 was 50%. The reason for the large traffic
increase in 1980 lies in the expansion of ENFE's capacity during that year,
both because of the repair of the lines damaged by flooding in 1979 and the
introduction of new passenger coaches. In 1983, passenger traffic increased
by 38% in the west and 25% in the east, mostly as a result of tariff
increases well below domestic inflation.
4.04      Freight traffic on the Western System experienced small yearly
variations. By 1981, traffic, in terms of tonnage moved, was 18% below the
appraisal forecast. However, from 1978 to 1981, traffic in ton-km was
consistently above the forecast by a difference ranging from 5% to 13%, as
a result of the appraisal under-estimation of average hauls. In general,
average hauls increased substantially in the years before project
implementation, reflecting the railways' increasingly important role in
handling longer haul external trade, and the loss of part of their share of
the shorter haul domestic traffic, for which ENFE had substantial competition
from truckers. By 1982, the economic recession in Bolivia had deepened, and
freight traffic both in tons and ton-km decreased by 19%. This was reversed
in 1983 when, as a result of food imports generated by an international
emergency program to alleviate the effects of unusually severe droughts and
floods, freight traffic increased by 22% in tons and 36% in ton-km with
respect to the previous year.
4.05   . Freight traffic on the Eastern System experienced, until 1981,
considerable variations on a year-to-year basis, mostly brought about by
movements in the sugar export markets. In 1982, because of the economic
crisis, traffic fell by 30%, and it continued to decrease slightly in 1983.
In general, traffic was consistently below the appraisal forecast, both In
terms of tonnage moved and in ton-km. In 1981, freight traffic was 22% below



- 12 -
the appraisal estimate.
B. Operations
4.06      ENFE's transport plan for the 1977-1981 period, in terms of traffic
and number of trains per year, was not implemented to the extent originally
envisaged. The number of trains running during the period amounted to about
75% of the number planned. Events affecting the implementation of the plan
were mostly outside the control of ENFE. Scheduled traits had to be
canceled because of: (a) lack of oil lubricants and fuel shortages in the
country; (b) track interruptions due to rehabilitation work under wav;
(c) lack of freight due both to unusually heavy rains in 1979 and 1981 and to
the depressed economic activity of Bolivia and neighboring countries; and
(d) labor strikes.
4.07      Selected operating statistics for ENFE during the 1977-1981 period
are presented in the Action Program shown in Annex 2. With a very few
exceptions, the operational performance of ENFE did not reach the appraisal
targets, although, under the adverse circumstances, it could be considered
satisfactory. The availability of diesel motive power on the Western System
reached its height of 72% in 1981, while, on the Eastern System, it remained
stable at about 72%. The appraisal target of 85% could not be achieved
because of accidents caused by the poor state of the permanent way and the
delays suffered in the spare parts acquisition program. Also, ENFE
encountered problems in obtaining compensation from the company insuring
locomotives which had been involved in accidents. Hence, seven locomotives
on the Western System and one on the Eastern System remained paralyzed for
almost three years. Finally, ENFE decided to repair the locomotives by force
account and to organize its own insurance for locomotives and cars.
Regarding locomotive utilization, there was a significant improvement on the
Western System, from 290 km average daily run of diesel mainline locomotives
in 1981 to 377 km in 1983, as opposed to the performance on the Eastern
System, which experienced a slight decline.
4.08      Availability of freight cars on the Western System improved
substantially in 1979, with the arrival of the new wagons purchased under the
loan. However, it declined from 87% in 1979 (the appraisal target was 88%)
to 79% in 1981, to increase again to 86% in 1983 because of improved loading
and unloading operations in the terminals to meet the needs of the food
emergency program. The main reasons for the lower-than-expected availability
were: (a) lack of spare parts; (b) a shortage of raw material for the
manufacture of brake shoes; and (c) the obsolescence of cars belonging to
neighboring countries, which caused frequent accidents affecting ENFE's
freight wagons. The allocation of wagon stock to particular traffic needs
some revision since some important traffic is apparently lost to road
transport because of lack of wagons while, at the same time, suitable wagons
are being used for less profitable traffic. Since 1977, wagon utilization,
measured in terms of kilometers per day, has been worse on the Eastern System
than on the Western System, whereas, before that, the situation was the
reverse. Difficulties in returning wagons from Argentina has been the main
cause of a decline in utilization on the Eastern System.



-13-
4.09      Average net load per car in tons was substantially above the
appraisal targets. On the Western System, average net load in 1977 was on
target at 21 tons per car, increasing to 24.5 tons in 1981, quite above the
21.4 tons target. By 1983, average wet load per car reached 27.7 tons. On
the Eastern System, average net load per car experienced slight fluctuations,
although it was always above the agreed targets. In 1981, average net load
per car was 18.4 tons (the target was 18.1 tons), and, by 1983, it had
reached 21.5 tons. Average daily run per car on service on the Western
System was also consistently above the appraisal targets until 1981, when it
fell to 51.5 km (the target was 61.0 km) from the 74.5 km achieved in 1980
(the target was 59.0 km). By 1983, however, it had improved to 77.3 km.
4.10      Passenger car availability was, on the average, about 65%, well
below the 80% target, mostly because of the old age of 27% of the fleet and
the lack of spare parts. Also, the excess demand for passenger transport
resulted in a neglect of proper maintenance. The units are only taken out of
service for major repairs; therefore, they have to remain in the workshops
for longer periods of time.
4.11      The staff reduction targets included in the Action Program were not
met: these targets required reducing the staff from 6,561 in 1977 to 5,740 in
1981. The number of ENFE's employees, grew by about 6% in the 1977-1979
period and declined by 5% between 1979 and 1983. In 1983, the number of
employees was still 13% above the target. Productivity, in terms of traffic
units per employee, declined to 137,000 in 1979, but started to improve from
1980 on, reaching 202,500 in 1983, well above the 1977 _evel of 148,600.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      ENFE started the project implementation period with a sound
financial position, and was expected to finance a substantial portion of its
investment program from its internal cash generation. However, the financial
situation of the railways deteriorated drastically until 1981, when
substantial tariff increases and a reduction of the wage bill reversed the
situation. Working and operating ratios in the following table illustrate

5.02      ENFE's finances were affected by events mostly outside its
control. Increases in operating costs, resulting mainly from the
Government 's policies of raising both real wages and the number of ENFE's
employees, were not accompanied by similar increases in revenues. Tariffs
were not raised for almost two years (from 1978 to 1980), while domestic
inflation accelerated. The situation was aggraiated by a disappointing level
of traffic, caused by the depressed economic activity-of Bolivia and by
traffic interruptions during the unusually heavy rainy seasons.
5.03      By late 1980, the financial situation of ENFE was considered so
severe that the project was placed in the problem projects' category, and a
significant action program for improvement was agreed by ENFE and the
Government. This program was implemented fully in January 1981. It
basically consisted of a 40% increase in tariffs, retirement of about 600
staff members and provision of additional Government grants to pay off some
Pf ENFE's financial obligations* As a result of these actions, together with
the fact that real wages started to fall and, to a certain extent, because
maintenance activities were limited by a lack of spare parts, ENFE's working
and operating ratios in 1981 surpassed the appraisal targets.
5.04      The appraisal financial projections and actual results are
presented in Tables 5 and 6. The railways were profitable in 1977 and,
again, in 1981, when the action program discussed in the preceding paragraph
was implemented. However, for the rest of the period under consideration,
the railways incurred net losses. They were, however, except for 1983,
always in a position to cover working expenses and depreciation, but
revenues, in general, were insufficient to meet debt service obligations.
Also, ENFE depended upon Government contributions in order to meet portions
of its interest bill and all debt amortization. Until 1981, ENFE could
generate sufficient surpluses to meet its interest commitments. By 1982,
however, the situation worsened with the rapid devaluation of the Bolivian
peso. While ENFE's earnings are mainly in local currency, a large portion
(about 80%) of ENFE's interest is related to foreign debt and has to be paid
in dollars, so that the interest bill in pesos increased dramatically.
Although ENFE was almost able, in 1982, to maintain its previous year's
revenue-working cost relationship, it could cover only about 65% of the
interest bill; the rest of the interest costs and the entire
principal repayment obligation had to be met by the Government. In 1983,
with the increase in depreciation brought about by asset revaluations, ENFE
experienced operating net losses, although the revenue-working cost
relationship improved. The Government's contribution to ENFE's debt service
has been treated as equity contribution.
5.05      A discussion of the financial covenants included in the legal
documents is presented in Annex 3.

VI* INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      The issue of institutional development was addressed under the
project, through the inclusion of technical assistance to strengthen ENFE's
operating efficiency and through loan covenants to support the objective of
transforming ENFE into a commercially oriented enterprise.
6.02      In those areas of institutional development that are essentially
internal to ENFE and not subject to outside considerations or pressures,
there were quite a few achievements. Among them is the implementation of a
management system which provides monthly informatiorn in different production
areas; this system was utilized to monitor project execution. Also, during
the project period, ENFE implemented a few changes in its administrative and
operational management organization, of which the most important was the
creation of mid-level management positions to oversee the technical,
financial and industrial relacions aspects of the company.
6.03      By the beginning of project implementation, the managerial and
technical shortcomings on the Eastern systems were evident, and the Bank
pressed for the strengthening of its management. ENFE promptly appointed
more experienced railway personnel to the Eastern System's most Important
technical and administrative positions and arranged for an increase in the
presence of the company's top management and their French consultants in
Santa Cruz. While these measures resulted in some improvements, there are
still technical and managerial weaknesses, partl) the result of a substantial
staff turnover which started after a salary freeze in 1981, for which
additional efforts -in terms of training and technical assistance- would have
been desirable, mostly in the areas of maintenance of permanent way,
operations, traffic costing and tariff design.
6.04      The Borrower's and the Guarantor's performance with respect to
compliance with their non-financial obligations, as set forth in the legal
documents, was mixed. A discussion of those obligations, and the efforts to
comply with them, follows:
Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement obligated the Borrower to: (a) carry out
the Investment Plan with due diligence and efficiency; (b) periodically
review the Investment Plan; and (c) not make any major change Ji the
Investment Plan without the agreement of the Guarantor and the Bank. ENFE
fully complied with this covenant. As already explained, problems
encountered during project implementation were mostly outside of ENFE's
control. In those areas directly under ENFE's responsibility, the Borrower
made every effort to carry out the project promptly and efficiently.
Section 4.06 of the Loan Agreement stated: "The Borrower shall take all
action necessary to achieve the quantitative targets of the Action Program
set forth in .....  this Agreement.' ENFE made the best of efforts to comply
with this covenant, but could not achieve many of the targets. Reasons are
given throughout the report.
Section 6.01(b) of the Loan Agreement specifies the following event as cause
for the use of the remedies of the Bank: "the railway line linking La Paz
with Arica shall, at any time during the carrying out of the Project, not be
in adequate operational condition   ......  Throughout the project



- 16 -
implementation period, Bolivian and Chilean authorities held several meetings
on the problem of providing Bolivia with an adequate line to the Port of
Arica. However, no satisfactory solution was achieved because of political
difficulties, and one still remains elusive. As a result of the precarious
state of the line, capacity is limited to less than 12% of the total imports
carried by rail, and Bolivia has to rely upon the mere expensive alternatdve
provided by the port of Antofagasta.
Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement states: "The Guarantor shall refrain
from making investments for the construction of a highway linking Santa Cruz
with Corumba before an adequate study...." No investment was carried out for
the construction of the highway.
Section 3.04 of the Guarantee Agreement obligated the Guarantor to refrain
from making investments on the extension of the Santa Cruz-Japacani railway
l-ine beyond Japacani before carrying out studies on its economic
justification. In September 1980, construction of the line extension started
without previous feasibility studies. Works are being carried out and
financed by Argentina. The very soft terms of the Argentine loan (3% annual
interest, five-year grace period, 20-year amortization and payments
to be made with natural gas), the fact that design standards were being kept
at a bare minimum and that the line is opening up a vast area, previously
isolated, which seems to have important agricultural potential, persuaded the
Bank to offer no objections to the construction investment. In its dialogue
with the Government, the Bank decided to focus upon the need to design and
implement a regional development plan to maximize the economic benefits for
Bolivia from the construction of this line. ENFE, subsequently, did carry
out a preliminary study on the economic potential of the area and the railway
traffic that it was likely to generate. This study was to serve as a basis
for further discussions with the Government during the preparation of a
planned follow-on Bank loan to ENFE.
Section 3.04 of the Guarantee Agreement also covenanted the Government to
reimburse ENFE for any losses arising from the operation of the Santa
Cruz-Japacani line. Even though the Government did not make specific
payments to ENFE for this purpose, its total financial contributions to ENFE
were substantially higher than the appraisal forecast. Since part of those
contributions was applied to reimburse the losses, the Bank considered that
the Guarantor did fulfill its obligation in this respect.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      ENFE prepared a reevaluation of the possible economic viability of
the project, following the appraisal methodology. The reevaluation is based
upon estimating the costs to the economy in the event that the investment
program had not been implemented. The main benefits related to the
investment program are the avoidance of: (a) highei transport costs for
traffic remaining on the railroad; (b) higher costs of transporting, by road,
the freight and passenger traffic diverted from the railways; and (c) lost
traffic, where no alternative roads exist. Since the Investment Plan covers
all major track rehabilitation works to be carried out on the Western and



- 17 -
Eastern Systems and the individual subprograms of the integrated Investment
Plan are closely interrelated, full benefits can be realized only if the
whole Investment Plan is carried out. For this- reason, the appraisal
evaluation and EN1E's reevaluation consider the Plan as a whole, separating
the expected economic return of freight and passenger investments on the
Eastern and Western Systems of the railroad.
7.02      The following table presents a comparisoa between the economic
rates of return estimated at appraisal and current estimates:
Western System       Eastern System             ENFE
Appraisal  Current   Appraisal  Curreat   Appraisal  Current
Traffic     Estimate   Estimate  Eatimate   Estirnate  Estimate   Estimate
Passenger       14.0%       10.2%      22.0% O4.1%                      11.6%
Freight         16.0%       2808%      27e0%       15.2%      -         25.8%
Passenger and
Freight       16.0%       24.3%      26.0%      14.0%       20.0%     21.3%
While the estimated economic return of the overall investment program is very
much in line with the appraisal estimate, the same is not true when the
analysis is disaggregated by system and type of traffic. Current estimates
of ERRs for investments in passenger transport are quite below the appraisal
estimate, mainly because the costs of investments in passenger coaches were
not contemplated at appraisal. Current results regarding the possible
relative merits of the investments for freight transport on both systems are
the reverse of those expected at appraisal. To a certain extent, these
results point to the shortcomings of using an overall income elasticity of
demand for forecasting railroad traffic. Traffic on the Western System was
generally stable, showing little correlation with fluctuations in the
national output. As a matter of fact, as discussed in Chapter IV, traffic
increased dramatically in 1983, at the peak of the economic crisis. In the
case of the Eastern System, in spite of little competition from road
transport, the relationship between traffic and the level of economic
activity was evident. Furthermore, the appraisal envisaged a substantial
increase in railroad traffic as a consequence of planned investments in the
production of cement and iron ore. These investments, however, did not
materialize. Details of the costs and benefits of the investment program are
shown in Tables 7 to 10.
7.03      The economic analysis performed during the original evaluation of
the project represented an improvement with respect to those carried out for
the two previous projectst since it calculated discrete rates of return for
investments in passenger and freight for each region separately and analyzed
the merits of the track rehabilitation works, rather than the program as.a
whole. While there are definite inter-relationships among the program
components, it would have been useful, for the assessment of project
priorities, to go further into the analysis of its major items. It does not



- 18 -
appear that the lack- of a detailed evaluation has affected the
aeppropriateness of the program adversely but it has limited the ability of
this completion report to reevaluate the decisions regarding changes in the
project. Also, the economic evaluation should have considered alternative
technical solutions for the railways' ie.labilitation, such as different
standards of track works, since, as suggested by the National Transport
Survey the track rehabilitation works were somewhat over-designed, and
benefits could have been increased by spreading funds more thinly over the
network.
VIII.  THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01      Because the project being considered herein was the third in a
series of projects to rehabilitate the Bolivian railways, the role of the
Bank in helping to achieve that objective should be seen in terms of its
long-term association with ENFE.
A. Project Justification and Objectives
8.02      The Bank's decision to provide financial support for the
rehabilitation of the railways appears to have been very sound. It is
interesting to note that tne decision was made in spite of a negative
assessment of the potential of the railways by the consultants who performed
the Bank-executed, UNDP-financed National Transport Survey in 1968. The
Bank's decision reflected a conviction that the railways' basic role as the
major carrier of international trade was too important to allow further
deterioration to take place, and that substantial economic benefits could be
achieved through investments in the railways. In the years since the
association commenced, whi.'.e local traffic handled by the railways has
declined, international traffic has increased dramatically. The projects
were instrumental in preparing ENFE to meet these developments in traffic.
8.03      The Bank's interpretation of the Borrower's priorities and problems
was well founded, primarily as a direct result of an extensive analysis of
the needs of the railways made prior to the first loan. The basic actions
necessary to enable the railways to start on a rehabilitation program were
taken before making the first loan. The Bank's strategy of clearly defining
the overall objectives of the projects in terms of specific action plan seems
to have been the best way of tackling this complex task, even though many of
the specific targets had to be revised during project execution. In fact, an
important corollary of this approach is the need for flexibility during
supervision in the monitoring of progress on these targets. As circuastances
change, so should the targets.
B. Project Content and Scheduling
8.04      In retrospect, the overall content and the loan conditions of the
project were appropriate, although the implementation schedule was overly
ambitious, even after the revision, during project preparation, of the track
rehabilitation program. The original physical targets were not achieved
until 1983, four years later than the original schedule.



- 19 -
C. Project Implementation and Outcome
8.05      The frequency of Bank supervision was adequate, and the quality of
work was high in that many detailed recommendations for necessary action were
made. The Bank was able to allocate sufficient manpower with the necessary
expertise to follow the implementation of the different project components
closely, and the relationship between the Bank and the Borrower has been
excellent. Although the estimated returns from the project are satisfactory,
its impact has so far been below expectations, mainly for reasons difficult
for the Bank or the Borrower to control.
D. The National Transport Survez
8.06      The Bank encouraged the inclusion, in the project, of updating the
National Transport Survey, a position that, until the study started, received
varying support from the different Governments in office. Much of the
skepticism about the need for the study was based upon the disappointing
results that similar efforts had achieved in the past. In retrospect, some
of that skepticism was warranted, since the study represented a planning
exercise requiring the definition of alternative development strategies by
upper levels that were not forthcoming. Furthermore, the implementation of
the recommendations of the study would have required a degree of
institutional coordination within the sector that could not be achieved
unless comprehensive institutional reforms were implemented.
E. Other Bank Assistance to the Borrower
8.07      The Bank, during the period of project implementation, closely
monitored and, at the request of ENFE, advised the Borrower on several issues
related to the railways' investment program. Such was the case with the
reconstruction of the Santa Cruz-Corumba line, which suffered serious damage
during the 1979 floods. Although ENFE was able to make the line operational
in a relatively short time, this was done precariously, and the need for a
more permanent solution was evident. The Bank expressed its willingness to
include the rehabilitation of the line in the project, but ENFE subsequently
entered into negotiations with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) for financing the works. JICG studied a number of technical
alternatives. The latest JICA proposal for reconstructing on the original
alignment has been accepted by ENFE, together with a loan of US$22.3 million
equivalent to carry out the works.
8.08      Another issue of speciaL interest for Bolivian export-import
transport relates to investments that, according to bilateral agreements,
Peru has to undertake for the construction of the Guaqui (Bolivia) rail-ferry
terminal, which would allow the present Lake Titicaca rail-ferry to increase
Bolivian traffic. This ferry can take 17 wagons, or 1,000 tons, and thereby
permit container traffic to be carried from the port of Matarani to La Paz.
The Bank actively encouraged regional dialogue on this issue. However, the
investments have been postponed because of budget limitations in Peru.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      Bank involvement in the rehabilitation of the -Bolivian railway
represents a success story only partially marred by the effects of the
economic crisis in Bolivia. Foremost among the reasons for the success was a
Borrower with an exceptional degree of commitment toward transforming the
Bolivian railways into an efficient, self-financing enterprise, an objective
which had mostly been achieved by 1977. This commitment was more evident
after the collapse of the economy, when ENFE, under the most adverse
circumstances in terms of available resources, was able to resort to a high
degree of ingenuity to keep its lines operational.
9.02      While the project had positive results in its institutional
aspects, its impact is difficult to assess because of t1he exogenous factors
affecting ENFE's performance. However, it could be safely said that the
project helped to shield the railways from an even more dramatic downturn
than they actually suffered. The reasons are twofold: one is the obvious
benefits of the funds that the loan provided, and the other is that ENFE's
contractual obligations with the Bank helped the company in its negotiations
with the Government to obtain tariff increases. The outcome of these
negotiations, in general, did not meet the requirements of the loan
covenants. However, ENFE fared better than its counterparts in the sector,
at a time when political considerations made tariff increases difficult.
Admittedly, this was probably, in part, because of the recognition of the
importance of the railways to the Bolivian economy.
9.03      The success of the Bank-ENFE relationship has long been considered
as an example for the LAC Region. As such, it should provide the Bank with
some useful lessons:
(a) The importance of the commitment of the Borrower to the objectives
of the project cannot be sufficiently stressed. In the case of
ENFE, the Bank very carefully evaluated that commitment, as the
record of its involvement in the railway subsector suggests. The
Bank rightly commenced its relations with ENFE on an initial
limited basis, i.e. serving as Executing Agency of a UNDP-financed
technical assistance project, then providing a small loan,
postponing the financing of larger investments for the time when a
suitable multi-year investment framework had been defined and there
was sufficient evidence of the seriousness of the Government's
intentions regarding the railways' rehabilitation and related
pricing policies; and
(b) Bank supervision- missions, in terms of the diversity of staff
expertise and the frequency of their visits, were an important
factor in ENFE's development. The good results from the
supervision was due in part due to somewhat fortuitous
circumstauces of personalities, attitudes and inclinations of
various mission members regarding their level of involvement in
detailed operational matters, which seem to have been appropriate
for ENFE's needs over twelve years of association. Mission members



- 21 -
provided advice regarding improvements in several operational areas
which was welcome and taken into account by BNFE. The fact that
the same would not have been true for other similar enterprises in
the region suggests the following lesson; Bank supervision should
be tailored closely to the needs of the Borrower. The Bank should
not limit its involvement to monitoring progress toward the
achievement of targets but -after an in-depth analysis of the
Borrowers' cultural idiosyncracies, degree of institutional
development, receptiveness to the advice of 'outsiders" and
technical, operational and managerial constraints- Bank staff
should clearly identify the areas in which supervision missions can
make a noticeable positive impact and the ways and means by which
that impact can be maximized.
9.04      Another lesson to be learned from the project is that sectoral
planning efforts should be in line with the planning framework in the rest of
the economy. Economic management in Bolivia suffers from a conspicuous lack
of inter and intra-sectoral coordination. Responsibility for planning the
development of transport activities is divided among several organizations,
with ultimate reaponsibilities resting in, at least, four different
Ministries. Although road and rail transport are the responsibility of the
same Ministry, there is little evidence of policy coordination between the
two modes. While the National Transport Survey was a step in the right
direction, the appraisal team was over-optimistic about the impact of the
recommendations of the survey and did not assess the difficulties of
providing the Transport Planning Unit with a formal role in bridging the gaps
between the coiplex and divided bureaucracy.
905      As for the Bank position regarding investments on the Jacapani
line, the aim of trying to prevent uneconomic investments was correct.
However, in light of the long-standing agreements between the Argentine and
Bolivian Governments regarding these investments, it may have been
unrealistic to expect to stop them in the context of the project. It would
have been more practical to negotiate a procedure through which the Bank
could have helped to mitigate any possible uneconomic impact of the
investments by altering their timing and/or their level.

BOLIVIA
THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1422-BO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Finaucial Covenants
Loan Agreement
Section 5.01 stated that ENFE "shall maintain records adequate to reflect, in
accordance with consistently maintained appropriate accounting practices, its
operations and financial condition."  ENFE keeps books and records in an
appropriate and consistent manner. They reflect the results from the
operations of the enterprise adequately, with the exception of depreciation
(see discussion on Section 5.04 following). Some Balance Sheet accounts
require adjustments dating back to 1972 for proper consolidation. ENEE is
still working on these adjustments.
Section 5.02 required ENFE to (i) have its accounts and financial statements
for each fIscal year audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank;
and (ii) furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later
than six months after the end of each such year, the relevant audited
financial statements and auditors' report. By Bolivian law, the audit of
state enterprises must be conducted by the Contraloria General de la
Republica (Government Auditors).  The Contraloria General was late in
performing the audits of ENFE and, as a result, ENFE could not meet the
covenant requirement. For example, the auditors' reports for 1979 and 1980
were delivered to the Bank in July and November 1981, respectively, and the
report for 1981 was only available in July 1983. In spite of.frequent
requests, the Contraloria General could not accelerate the audit process. In
1983, ENFE obtained Contraloria's agreement to employ independent auditors,
but because of lack of funds, it did not do so.
Section 5.04 required ENFE to (a) revalue the fixed assets of the Railways or.
the basis of prices prevailing in 1977 and show such assets in its balance
sheet as of December 31, 1977, as so revalued and (b) thereafter revalue such
assets from time to time, but not less than once every three years. ENFE's
assets were revalued in 1977, but a second revaluation was completed only in
1984.
Section 5.05 obligated ENFE to not incur any debt "unles- the amount of the
Borrower's net cash revenue for the fiscal year next preceding the date of
such incurrence or for a later twelve-month period ended prior to the date of
such incurrence, whichever amount is greater, shall be not less than 1.5
times the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding year on all
the debt of the Borrower, including the debt to be incurred." ENFE fully
complied with this covenant.



-36-                        Annex 3
Page 2 of 2
Section 5.06 stated that 'whenever, because of a rise in the Borrower's cost
level, there is reasonable cause to believe that the Borrower will be
prevented from attaining the financial targets of the Action Program.+.., the
Borrower shall promptly take all such measures, including increases of its
tariffs and charges, as necessary to attain such targets." ENFE fully
complied with this covenant, by requesting Government approval for increasing
tariffs. However, when such increases were not approved, ENFE took measures
to contain costs effectively, although too often at the expense of
deferringmaintenance expenditures.
Guarantee Agreement
Section 2.02 covenanted the Bolivian Government to,".....whenever there is
reasonable cause to believe that the funds available to the Borrower will be
inadequate to meet the estimated expenditures required for the carrying out
of the project, to make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, promptly to
provide the Borrower ....with such funds as are needed to meet such
expenditures."  Although the funds provided by the Government were not
sufficient to complete the project on schedule, they were well above the
appraisal estimates, as funds generated by ENFE were insufficient to provide
for its appraisal estimated share of project financing.
