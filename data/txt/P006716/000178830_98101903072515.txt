INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$7.6 million to
the Republic of Colombia.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's first loan for education
in Colombia. Several Bank/UNESCO preparation missions visited Colombia
during 1964-68. The Project was appraised in November and December 1967
by a Bank/FAO mission. Negotiations of the proposed loan took place in
Washington during the period June 27 - July 2, 1968. The Colombian Govern-
ment was represented by Dr. Gabriel Betancur, Minister of Education, who
was assisted by several officials of the Ministry and an outside advisor.
3.        Together with the loans for the Fifth Highway Project and for
the Fifth Railroad Project, which will be considered at the Board's
meeting on July 23, the proposed loan would bring the Bank's lending to
Colombia to US$543.1 million (net of cancellations). In addition, an
IDA credit of US$19.5 million for highways was made in 1961. The fol-
lowing is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Colombia
as of June 30, 1968:

2/  Excludes US$44.5 million for Loans 534 c0, 536 CO and 537 CO which
have been signed but have not yet become effective.
4.        Twenty-three loans have been completely disbursed and four have
been repaid in full. On the remainder, disbursements are proceeding nor-
mally except on Loan 345 Co (Acerias Paz del Rio, S.A.). The Executive
Directors recently approved an extension of the Closing Date by one year
to October 31, 1969 to allow for further disbursements, mainly of contract
retentions.

5.        In the near future I expect to present to the Executive
Directors a loan of about US$16.0 million equivalent for Power Inter-
connection.
6.        IFC has made 21 investments and underwriting commitments in
13 enterprises in Colombia totalling US$14.7 million.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.        The main features of the proposed loan are as follows:
Borrower:          Republic of Colombia.
Purpose:           Construction and equipment of ten comprehensive
secondary schools to provide space on a two-
shift basis, for 48,o00 students.  The project
would introduce a new concept of education
into the Colombian school system emphasizing
the basic preparation of skilled manpower for
business, industry and agriculture.
Amount:            The equivalent in various currencies of
US$7.6 million.
Amortization:      Loan would be for a term of 25 years, including
a 10-year grace period. Repayment would be
in 30 semi-annual installments from May 15,
1979 to November 15, 1993.
Interest rate:     6-1/4 percent.
Commitment charge: 3/4 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A detailed description of the Project is given in the attached
report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project in Colombia" (TO-660a)
9.        Colombia's secondary school enrollment in public schools is
projected to rise from 119,000 in 1965 to 300,000 in 1975. The Government
is embarked on a program involving the construction of nineteen compre-
hensive secondary schools which at full utilization would account for
28 percent of this enrollment. The Project represents the first phase
of this program and comprises the construction and equipment of ten of
the nineteen schools. Apart from accommodating part of the projected
increase in secondary school enrollment, the schools will serve as means
of introducing a new educational concept to Colombia. The syllabi at the



- 4 -
new schools will be designed to overcone the unpopularity which now
attaches to vocational training at the secondary level. The schools
will prepare students for employment or further technical training,
but also offer sufficient academic education to enable students to
proceed to post-secondary institutions or universities.
10.       The Government is establishing a unit for the implementation of
the Project. This unit will function under a Project Director within the
agency responsible for planning and coordinating school construction
programs, which is attached to the Ministry of Education. The unit will
take charge of construction of the ten schools. It will also be responsible
for curriculum revision and the coordination of teacher training in prep-
aration for the new syllabi. The Ministry would employ consultants for
the design of the schools and supervision of construction.
11.       The Government's plan for the operation of the ten schools on
a double-shift is an essential aspect of the Project. It justifies the
inclusion of more extensive facilities than would be feasible for a single-
shift operation. Expected utilization of the facilities is correspondingly
high, while the cost per student of each space compares favorably with
similar projects in other countries.
12.       The total cost of the Project is estimated to be Ps 246 million
(US$15.2 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange component of
US$5.4 million equivalent. The proposed loan would represent 50 percent
of the Project cost. It would cover the estimated foreign exchange com-
ponent plus 22 percent of the local currency cost. The other half of
the Project cost would be covered out of the Government's budget allocations
to education.
13.       The proposed loan would finance the cost of equipment and
furniture, site preparation and development as well as construction of the
school buildings, and architectural consulting services. Under the loan,
the Bank would cover in full the foreign exchange cost of equipment and
furniture procured abroad and disburse on a percentage basis for civil
works, professional fees and locally procured furniture. Equipment and
furniture would be procured, and construction contracts would be let, on
the basis of the Bank's bidding procedures.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
14.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and
the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
15.       The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions generally used
for education projects. The Borrower would undertake to operate the
Project schools on a double-shift basis and agree to make adequate pro-
vision for the maintenance of the Project schools (Section 5.01(c) and
(d) of the Loan Agreement).

PART V   THE ECONOMY
16.       The Judgments provided in the section on the Colombian economy,
in the recent President's Report on the Development Finance Companies
Project (P-592, May 2, 1968) continue to be valid.
PART 7I - COPLANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
17.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECCMMENDATICN
18.       I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:
RESOLUTION No.
Approval of Loan to the Republic of Colombia
in the amount of the equivalent of US$7.6 million
for an Education Project.
RESOLVED:
THAT the Bank shall grant a loan to the Republic of Colombia,
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to seven million six hundred
thousand United States dollars (US$7,600,0oo), to mature on and prior
to November 15, 1993 to bear interest at the rate of six and one-quarter
percent (6-1/4%) per annum, and to be upon such other terms and conditions
as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in the form of Loan Agreement (Education Project) between the
Republic of Colombia and the Bank, which has been presented to this meeting.
