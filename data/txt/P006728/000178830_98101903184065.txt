BCTH WITH THE GUARANTEE
OF THE
REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on two proposed
loans for water supply projects in Colombia, one in an amount equivalent
to US$2 million to the Empresas Publicas Nlunicipales de Palmira (EPMP)
and the other in an amount equivalent to US$88 million to Empresa de
Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogota (EAAB). Both loans would be guaran-
teed by the Republic of Colombia, and both would carry an interest rate
of 7½1 percent. The loan to EPMP would be for a term of 25 years includ-
ing a four-year period of grace; the loan to EAAB would be for a term of
30 years, including a seven-year grace period.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The first Bank loan in Colombia's water supply and sewerage
sector was made in June 1968 for US$14 million to EAAB for the expansion
and improvement of Bogota's water supply system in association with joint
financing of US$0.6 million from West Germany, and US$4.0 million from
the United States; a second loan of US$18.5 million was made in June 1970
to the Establecimiento Publico Empresas Municipales de Cali (Emcali) for
the Cali Water Supply and Sewerage Project.
3.        The Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage Project was originally
appraised in July 1969. Negotiations began in April 1970 but had to be
suspended for a year, pending politically difficult decisions by
EP.2P upcn water tariff incruasos adequate to ccm.plete the financing
plan fcr the propcsed Project, and thc renegotiation of a supplier's credit
for telephone equipment, on which EPMP had fallen into arrears. The Project
was re-appraised in November 1970 and negotiations were completed in
April 1971 after EPMP had proposed a tariff program apprcpriate to the
Project,and had renegotiated the supplier's credit.



-2-
4.        The proposed loans would bring the total number of loans made
to Coloroia to forty-seven and would increase the total amount of Bank
loans to Colombia to US$831.8 million (net of cancellations), of which
US$572.4 million is now held by the Bank. Colombia has received one IDA
credit of US$19.5 million for highways. A summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits to Colombia and their status of disbursements as
of March 31, 1971 was included in my Report and Recommendation on the
loan for the Caqueta Land Colonization Project (P-921), dated April 21,
1971.
5.        IFC has made 35 investments and underwriting commitments in
18 enterprises in Colombia, totalling US$18.5 million (net of cancella-
tions), of which IFC now holds US$11.3 million.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.        A summary of recent developments and a favorable conclusion
regarding Colombia's creditworthiness for additional external borrowing
-eze contained in paragraphs 20-23 of my Report and Recommendation on
the loan for the Caqueta Land Colonization Project (P-921), dated April
21, 1971. A Country Data sheet is attached as Annex II.
PART III - THE PROJECTS
A. Problems of Financing Water Supply and Sewerage in Colombia
7.        The growth of Colombiats urban population from 4.5 million to
12.7 million over the past twenty years, has placed great strains upon
the supply of urban public services. The supply of electric power has
kept up with demand better than other services. For example, in Bogota,
power generation has been adequate since 1962, while two-thirds of the
population is still affected by inadequate water supply (low pressures
and intermittent supply). Foreign loans for the power sector in Colombia
amounted to US$383 million over the past decade, as compared with US$125
million for water supply and sewerage (of which the Bank provided US$219.1
million for power and US$32.5 million for water). The Colombian central
and municipal authorities are concerned to make up for the lag in the
development of the water supply and sewerage sector, and over the past
six years have developed a substantial program of preinvestment studies
for urban water supply and sewerage projects, which has led to the Bank
lending noted in paragraph 2.
8.        The projects in the larger cities, such as Bogota and Cali,
are of a size appropriate for individual project loans. However, if the
Bank is to support a balanced development of the sector in which the
small and medium sized cities would also share, it confronts the pros-
pect of making a large number of loans to individual cities, ranging in



-3-
amount as low as a few hundred thousand dollars, which would present
problems of loan administration difficult to deal with from the Bank's
headquarters. To overcome this difficulty, arrangements are being
worked out with the Colombian authorities for aggregating a number of
projects in small and medium sized cities with a loan for each aggrega-
tion rather than for each project. Such loans would be channelled through
a central agency, the Colomibian Institute for Municipal Development
(INSFOPAL), which would share with the Bank in the responsibility for
loan administration. Thus, I would not expect to present another loan
for a water supply project in Colombia of as small an amount as the
US$2.0 million for the proposed Project in Palmira.
9.        The water supply and sewerage sector also presents special
problems of raising sufficient funds from taxation and from water rates.
Over the past four years the tax revenue of the Central Government has
increased in real terms by 46 percent, permitting an increase of 130 per-
cent in the contributions of the Central Government budget to investments
by public agencies. This has enabled the Colombian public sector to under-
take more investments, including investments in projects which do not
generate enough income and therefore have to rely partly on budget funds.
To illustrate this, a few years ago there were only six Bank-financed
projects which relied on contributions from the Central Government budget
for all or part of their local financing. Today, there are 13 such
projects and two more may be approved in the current fiscal year. These
projects would claim a total of over Col.$l billion, or nearly 20 per-
cent, of the Central Government's investment budget for 1971. The 1971
budget, indicating a need to raise additional funds, was described in
paragraph 22 of my Report and Recommendation on the loan for the Caqueta
Land Colonization Project (P-921) of last April 21.
10.       However, the requirement for public investment to meet both
social and economic needs is steadily increasing. Therefore, while
mobilizing resources from general taxation, the Colombian central and
municipal authorities have also pursued a policy of increasing the
revenue of the public sector from the earnings of public utility serv-
ices. In the areas of the public sector which earn income from the sale
of water, power, and telecommunications, the Colombian Government has
taken the position that the Colombian share in the cost of investment proj-
ects should be financed to the maximum extent from the earnings of the
public utilities concerned, together with the proceeds of bond sales to
the private sector, and only when these possibilities are exhausted
should the enterprises seek contributions from the Central Government bud-
get. This policy is mitigated by the Government's recognition that the
smaller municipal enterprises may have special difficulty in generating
adequate profits, and in selling bonds, as the smaller cities often have
a low per capita income. Thus, though an exemplary effort to mobilize
local resources has been made by both Bogota and Palmira, no budgetary



contributions are needed for the proposed Bogota Project, while the
Government would contribute 28 percent of the financing requirements
of the proposed Palmira Project.
11.       In 1968, the Government established a Public Utilities Tariff
Board, charged with regulating tariffs to produce an adequate rate of
return on assets realistically valued, in order to facilitate the fi-
nancing of the investment program of public utilities. The Board was
also required to take considerations of income distribution into account
by regulating tariff structures in accordance with the capacity to pay of
different classes of consumers. The Board initially encountered major
problems in the water supply sector. Because of lags in the development
of the sector, the projects tended to be rather large, requiring sub-
stantial amounts of financing, while water tariffs and other charges were
generally insufficient to cover even operating costs. Accounting and
budgeting practices were frequently inadequate, particularly among the
smaller enterprises, presen-ting the Board with technical problems of cal-
culating rates of return. MIuch of 1969 and 1970 was thus spent in clear-
ing the ground for the implementation of the Government's policy, but
by late 1970, tariff regulation had been rationalized for about 250
public utilities, mostly in the water supply sector, increasing their
ability to finance projects from their own earnings.
12.       This may be illustrated by the cases already mentioned of the
water supply enterprises of Bogota, Cali and Palmira. In 1967, the net
revenue of EAAB produced a return of 2.9 percent on assets. By 1971,
net income is expected to have increased seven times and the return is
expected tc be 10 percent, as a result of two tariff increases, one of
80 percent in 1968 and another of 30 percent in 1970. In the case of
Emcali, the water division earned a return of 2.6 percent in 1969. As
public opinion in Cali had reacted against abrupt tariff increases which
had taken place in 1968, Emcali established a program of gradual in-
creases in water rates over the three years 1971-73 to finance part of
the local cost of the Cali Water Supply and Sewerage Project, which would
leave tariffs about 50 percent higher at the end than at the start of
the period. At the time of the initial appraisal of the proposed proj-
ect of EPMP, a rate increase of no less than 100 percent would have been
required just in order to achieve a zero rate of return; further increases
would have been necessary to make some contribution to the costs of the
proposed Project.  As noted in paragraph 3, EPIP was initially unable to
obtain the agreement of its Board to an adequate rate program, and nego-
tiations with the Bank were consequently suspended. When they were resumed
in March 1971, EPMP had already instituted a rate increase of 60 percent,
and planned further increases of 56 percent in July 1971 and 20 percent
in January 1973, to gradually improve the rate of return from 4
percent in 1971 to 9 percent in 1977.
B. The Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage Project
13.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Palmira Water Supply and
Sewerage Project - Colombia" (PU-33b) is attached.



-5-
14.       The proposed Borrower is an autonomous municipal entity which
provides water supply, sewerage and local telephone services, and oper-
ates the slaughterhouse and two markets in Palrira, a city with a popu-
lation of 160,000, grcwing at an annual rate of about 6 percent. The
Project will help to increase the population served directly by water
supply and sewerage from about 140,000, representing 87 percent of the
total present population, to more than 210,000 by 1977, which would re-
present 94 percent of the population at that date. The Project includes
primarily new water supply treatment and distribution works. The sewer-
age portion of the Project is relatively small, consisting of only the
most urgent sewerage and drainage works.
15.       The Project's financial requirements total US$4.2 million
equivalent of which US$3.8 millicn would be for the estimated project
cost and US$0.4 million for the estimated interest during construction
on the Bank's and a Government loan. The proposed Bank loan of US$2.0
million would finance 47 percent of total requirements covering the
estimated foreign exchange cost of US$1.2 million and local currency cost
of US$0.8 million. The Government loan would finance 28 percent of the
total requirements and the remaining 25 percent would be financed from
internally generated funds. The financing of US$0 .8 million of local
costs seems fully justified, especially since the Bank's share in the
total cost would remain less than one half. As set forth in some detail
in the Bank's latest economic report on Colombia (WH-200a, of November 1,
1970), Colombia has a well conceived developrment program, but, in spite
of its efforts to mobilize domestic resources in its support, requires
external assistance in excess of the foreign exchange component of
development projects suitable for external financing.
16.       EPMP would be committed to increase the rates of return on
its water and sewerage services by stages from 4 percent in the first
year (1971) to 9 percent in the seventh year (1977) at which level EPMP
could cover all operating expenses, debt service and have a small sur-
plus for its continuing investment requirements. In order to meet the
rate of return required for 1971, EPMP would, as a condition of effec-
tiveness of the proposed loan, increase its water supply and sewerage
tariff 56 percent to Col$1.25/m3. EPNP agreed that it would also main-
tain tariffs on its slaughterhouses and markets sufficient to cover
operating expenses and depreciation. On its telecommunications service,
EPMP would be required to earn a return on revalued assets sufficient
to finance the service on old debts, and cover part of the cost of future
expansion.
C. The Second Bogota Water Supply Project
17.       The proposed Project is described in detail in the attached
report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Bogota Water Supply Project -
Colombia" (PU-66a).



-6-
18.       The proposed Project would be the second phase of the long
range expansion prcgram of the Bogota water supply system. The first
phase, being implemented very satisfactorily under the First Bogota Water
Supply Project, will,upon its completion in 1972, terminate the present
supply deficit and keep water supply ahead of demand through 1976. The
prcposed second Project is to be completed in 1976, and would cover demand
through 1985. It will divert, treat, and distribute water originating in
the Chingaza area 40 km east of Bogota by means of a dam on the Chuza
River, a 39 km conveyance system (consisting of 33 km of tunnels and 6 km
of pipelines from the dam to the city), a treatment plant, and additions
to the Bogota water distribution system.
19.       The Chingaza area has a very large potential yield of water, of
which 35 percent would be developed by the proposed Project. Neverthe-
less, it is necessary to include the full conveyance system of tunnels
and pipelines in this Project, and this accounts for the long construction
period (1971-76) and large capital requirements of the Project. Highly
mechanized construction methods are required for the conveyance system
in particular, and this accounts for the foreign exchange component of
70 percent, which is high by comparison with most other water supply proj-
ects.
20.       While the financing of some local costs is justified on macro-
economic grounds (see paragraph 15), US$86 million of the proposed loan
would cover foreign costs, and only a maximum of US$2 million would be
for local costs of engineering services -- this in order to put competent
foreign and Colombian consultants on an equal footing by financing 50 per-
cent of the costs of engineering services irrespective of origin. The
proposed loan of US$88 million is equivalent to about 75 percent of the
total project financing requirements of US$118 million, including US$14
million interest during construction on the proposed Bank loan. However,
external financing plays a relatively less important role in EAAB's total
1971-76 investment program of US$228 million, accounting for only 39 per-
cent of financing forthcoming from all sources. EAAB's investment program
includes important sewerage, drainage and flood control works, which were
postponed from 1968-70 in order to permit the available local financing
to be used for the First Water Supply Project, and which would have to
be further delayed if the Bank loan did not cover the full foreign ele-
ment of the Project's financing requirements.
21.       Internally generated resources would finance 49 percent of
EAAB's investment program and less than two percent would be required
from the Government budget (remainder of Government contribution for
First Project). Earnings have been satisfactory with rates of return of
9 to 10 percent on a revalued rate base. Future earnings are expected
to yield rates of return of 9 to 12 percent during the period of construc-
tion, and the draft Loan Agreement provides for a minimum rate of return
of 9 percent during 1971-73 and 10 percent thereafter. It was also
agreed during negotiations that the rate of return required after the con-
struction period would be reconsidered upon the completion of the Project
in the light of EAAB's financial requirements. Present estimates indicate
that a rate of return of 7-8 percent would be adequate after 1976.



-7-
22.       The Project and subsequent developments of the Chingaza area
would increase the hydroelectric potential of the Bogota River which
is exploited by plants of the Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota
(EEEB). BEEB has therefore agreed to make a contribution of Col$280
million to the financing of the Project, equivalent to 12 percent of
Project cost, or 5 percent of EAAB's total 1971-76 investment program.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUME2ITS ASD AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Loan Agreements between the Bank and EPNP and
SAAB and the draft Guarantee Agreements between the Republic of Colombia
and the Bank as well as the Reports of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the texts
of the Resolutions approving the proposed loans are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
24.       The draft Agreements contain covenants normally included in
agreements for public utilities projects.   Under Section 5.13 of the
Loan Agreement for the Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage Project, the
Borrow,er would be committed to financial targets for its water supply
and sewerage services as wiell as its telecommunications services, market
places and slaughterhouse. Special features of the draft Loan Agreement
for the Second Bogota Wvlater Supply Project are commitments by the
Borrower to consult with the Bank on its investment plans cutside the
Project (Section 3.05) and on the results of studies on pollution control
and thedr implementation (Section 3.07), and to inspect periodically the
Chuza Dam and related works (Section 4.03).
25.       I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATIOIN
26.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loans.
