priority\n            development needs for water supply and sewerage services in\n            Brazil. It is in support of the Plano Nacional de Saneamento\n            (PLANASA) whose objectives are to provide by the year 1990\n            90% of the urban population with piped water and 65% with\n            sewerage services. The estimated cost of the proposed\n            project is $US863 million. It includes about 60% of new\n            PLANASA investment for the 1983-84 period. The Bank loan\n            would cover 35% of the estimated project costs. All 26 SWCs\n            would be eligible to borrow Bank resources provided they\n            comply with eligibility criteria resources agreed with BNH\n            and the Bank. The project will support the goals of\n            PLANASA's program to benefit an estimated 33 million\n            people including 15 million below the poverty level. It will\n            substantially strengthen the operational capability of BNH,\n            especially in the areas of project selection, appraisal and\n            supervision. In addition it will provide institutional\n            support and strengthening to the SWCs. Important benefits\n            include: improved health, lower infant mortality, increased\n            labor productivity, and improved environmental conditions."}, "docdt": "1983-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
