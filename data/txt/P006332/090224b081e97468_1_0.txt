clearly indicate any preference which will be granted, the
information required to establish the eligibility of a bid for
such preference and the following methods and stages that will be
followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
2.   After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one
of the following two groups:
(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in
Brazil if the bidder shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that
such goods contain components manufactured in
Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the
complete goods.
(2) Group B: bids offering any other goods.
3.   In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of each
group, all evaluated bids in each group shall first be compared
among themselves, without taking into account customs duties and
other import taxes levied in connection with the importation, and
sales and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or
delivery, pursuant to the bids, of the goods. Such lowest
evaluated bids shall then be compared with each other, and if, as
a result of this comparison, a bid from group A is the lowest, it
shall be selected for the award.
4.   If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3 above,
the lowest bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids shall be
further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group A after
adding: (i) to the c.i.f. bid price of the imported goods offered
in each group B bid, an amount equal to the smaller of: (A) the
amount of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-


﻿- 32 -
exempt importer would have to pay for the importation of the
goods offered in such group B bid; or (B) 15% of the c.i.f. bid
price of such goods, and (ii) to the ex-factory bid price of
domestically supplied goods offered in each group B bid an amount
equal to the smaller of: (A) the amount of customs duties and
other import taxes which would be levied on the goods offered in
such group B bid if they originated from the same foreign country
as the goods involved in group B bids which enjoy the lowest cus-
toms duties and other import taxes; or (B) 15% of the ex-factory
bid price of such goods. If the group A bid in such further com-
parison is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if
not, the lowest evaluated bid from group B, as determined under
paragraph 3 above, shall be selected for the award.
C.   Other Procurement Procedures
Contracts for equipment and materials estimated to cost less
than the equivalent of $500,000 and contracts for civil works
estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $3,000,000 may be
procured in accordance with locally advertised bidding procedures
satisfactory to the Bank.
D.   Review of Procurement Decisions by the Bank
1.   Review of prequalification. The Project Company shall,
before qualification is invited, inform the Borrower in detail of
the procedure to be followed, and shall introduce such modifica-
tions in said procedure as the Borrower shall reasonably request.
The list of prequalified bidders, together with a statement of
their qualifications and of the reasons for the exclusion of any
applicant for prequalification shall be furnished by the Project
Company to the Borrower for its comments before the applicants
are notified of the Project Company's decision, and the Project
Company shall make such additions to, deletions from, or modifi-
cations in, the said list as the Borrower shall reasonably re-
quest.
2.   Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and
final contracts:
(a) Before bids are invited, the Project Company shall fur-
nish to the Borrower, for its comments, the text of the invita-
tions to bid and the specifications and other bidding documents,
together with a description of the advertising procedures to be
followed for the bidding, and shall make such modifications in


﻿- 33 -
the said documents or procedures as the Borrower shall reasonably
request. Any further modification to the bidding documents shall
require the Borrower's concurrence before it is issued to the
prospective bidders.
(b) After bids have been received and evaluated, the Proj-
ect Company shall, before a final decision on the award is made,
inform the Borrower of the name of the bidder to which it intends
to award the contract and shall furnish to the Borrower, in suf-
ficient time for its review, a detailed report on the evaluation
and. comparison of the bids received, and such other information
as the Borrower shall reasonably request. The Borrower shall, if
it determines that the intended award would be inconsistent with
the Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform the Project
Company and state the reasons for such determination.
(c) The terms and conditions of the contract shall not,
without the Borrower's concurrence, materially differ from those
on which bids were asked or prequalification was invited.
3.   With respect to each contract, each Project Company shall
furnish to the Borrower for transmittal to the Bank, promptly
after its execution and prior to the submission of the first
application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan-Account or the
Special Account in respect of such contract, two conformed copies
of such contract, together with the analysis of the respective
bids, recommendations for award and such other information as the
Bank shall reasonably request. The Bank shall, if it determines
that the award of the contract was not consistent with the
Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform the Borrower and
state the reasons for such determination.
4.   Before agreeing to any material modification or waiver of
the terms and conditions of a contract, or granting an extension
of the stipulated time for performance of such contract, or
issuing any change order under such contract (except in cases of
extreme urgency) which would increase the cost of the contract by
more than 10% of the original price, the Borrower shall inform
the Bank of the proposed modification, waiver, extension or
change order and the reasons therefor. The Bank, if it determines
that the proposal would be inconsistent with the provisions of
this Agreement, shall promptly inform the Borrower and state the
reasons for its determination.

SCHEDULE 4
Sub-project Selection Criteria
(a) Sub-projects shall comply with the following condi-
tions:
(i) Each Sub-project must have been included in the
last EVG approved by the Borrower and accepted by
the Bank;
(ii) total Sub-project cost shall not be substantially
higher than that included in the respective EVG.
If the Sub-project scope or costs are substan-
tially different from those contemplated in the
EVG, satisfactory evidence shall be presented to
the Borrower and the Bank that their inclusion and
financing  will   not  deteriorate   the  Project
Company's financial position; and
(iii) Sub-projects shall be the least-cost solution.
(b) Water supply Sub-projects to be carried out in cities
with populations greater than 50,000 shall have water rates equal
to or higher than 75% of the long-run average incremental cost or
an internal financial rate of return of 5% or higher.
(c)  Sewerage Sub-projects, or water supply Sub-projects to
be carried out in cities with populations between 5,000 to
50,000, shall have water (or sewerage) rates equal to or higher
than 60% of the long-run average incremental cost or an internal
financial rate of return of 1% or higher.
(d) In the event that the internal financial rate of return
criteria is used for the purpose of paragraphs (b) and (c), a
financial analysis of the Sub-project and its effect on the
ProjeCt Company showing no negative effects on the Project
Company's projected cash flows must be prepared.
(e) Sub-projects or group of Sub-projects to be carried out
in communities with populations of less than 5,000 shall have a
per capita construction cost of less than the equivalent of $180
in 1980 prices. (The per capita construction cost shall be
determined by dividing construction cost by the population to be
served after the completion of Sub-project construction).


﻿- 35 -
(f) Sub-projects not meeting the criteria set forth herein
shall be redesigned to lower acceptable standards or carried out
in stages. If the Sub-project does not fulfill the criteria after
it has been redesigned, it shall be eligible for Bank financing
only if a satisfactory social and economic justification is
furnished to the Bank.
(g) Calculations of long-run average incremental costs for
Sub-project acceptability, and of present value and long-run
average incremental cost for least-cost analysis, shall use an
annual discount rate equal to the opportunity cost of capital
(11%) or another value agreed upon between the Borrower and the
Bank. These calculations will be based on the Sub-projects'
capital costs, operating costs, and complementary investment.
(h) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) above, "long-run
average incremental cost" means the present value of capital
invested in, plus the present value of incremental operating,
maintenance and administrative costs of such Sub-project, minus
the present value of incremental installation charges or other
consumer contributions to capital expenditures, divided by the
present value of the incremental volume of water (or sewerage)
billed. All costs and revenues are to be projected in constant
prices and in accordance with methods satisfactory to the Bank
and the Borrower.
(i) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) above, the
average rate to be used shall be obtained by dividing the reve-
nues billed in each city for water (or sewerage) services by the
respective volume. When the present average rates do not satisfy
the selection criteria, the average rate to be put into effect
within the following 12 months would be used.
