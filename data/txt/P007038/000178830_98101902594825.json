These\n            improvements are expected to result in an increase in total\n            cattle numbers and herd productivity. It is expected that\n            about 240 beef cattle farms would participate in the\n            project. Technical assistance to farmers would be provided\n            by qualified livestock technicians under the supervision of\n            the Project Director. This group would also be responsible\n            for assisting farmers to prepare farm development plans, for\n            recommending these to the participating banks as basis for\n            lending, and for supervising the execution of the work for\n            which loans are made."}, "docdt": "1967-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
