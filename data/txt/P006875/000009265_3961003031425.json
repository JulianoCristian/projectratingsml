"The Agricultural Sector Credit Project\n            for Colombia will help the government adjust the provision\n            of agricultural credit to a market-based framework.\n            Specifically, it will support the government's actions\n            to:  (a) implement the agreed program of financial and trade\n            reforms; (b) promote, encourage and facilitate voluntary\n            lending by commercial banks to the agricultural sector\n            without incurring a significant decline in lending\n            resources; (c) monitor and analyze agricultural credit\n            demand and supply, and recommend measures to ensure a smooth\n            transition to market-based credit system, including the\n            phasing out of forced investments; and (d) transform Caja\n            Agraria, the largest bank serving the rural sector, into an\n            efficient rural financial institution.  The project will\n            provide US$250 million of loan funds to the Fund for\n            Financing the Agricultural Sector to be used to rediscount\n            medium- and long-term loans to finance on-farm investments,\n            agroindustry and related working capital.  The project will\n            also help ensure the implementation of Caja Agraria's\n            Corporate Plan aimed at restructuring, rationalizing and\n            recapitalizing the institution."}, "docdt": "1993-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
