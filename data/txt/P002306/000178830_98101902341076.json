The project also\n            includes village water supplies, an allocation for\n            additional directly productive activities to be identified\n            and prepared during implementation, and provision for a\n            management structure. The project's directly productive\n            activities will benefit some 4,200 families, or 42,000\n            people, nearly all presently having incomes at or below the\n            relative poverty level. In addition, about 100,000 people\n            will benefit from permanent village water supplies."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
