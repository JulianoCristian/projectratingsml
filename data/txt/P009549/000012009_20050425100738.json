Experience with this project confirms\n            a number of lessons: 1) Continuous attention should be paid\n            to implementation performance in disaster-related\n            operations, to ensure that such operations do not sideline\n            needed sector reforms. Issues that particularly require\n            attention are ensuring that the Borrower has the\n            institutional capacity to manage, and monitor social\n            mobilization and resettlement, and is conversant with the\n            Bank's procurement procedures (in this operation, the\n            Borrower's attention to social mobilization and\n            resettlement languished, once donor financing ceased). 2)\n            Technical and social/organizational assistance, essential\n            for the introduction of new innovations in doing business,\n            must be fully funded for the duration of a project. This\n            project also highlighted the importance of harmonization of\n            policies among donors, for sub-sectors in which they share\n            common concerns and investment. If development partners are\n            unwilling to commit to the duration of the project, then\n            alternative ways of financing technical assistance should be\n            explored. 3) Coastal defenses should be renovated to higher\n            engineering standards within homogenous units. This not only\n            has greater sustainability than isolated repairs of existing\n            infrastructure, but it also provides a model that can be\n            monitored to test the success of the innovation - an\n            important design consideration."}, "docdt": "2005-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
