EMBANKMENT\n            REHABILITATION PROJ", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The assessment of outcome is\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, though institutional\n            development impacts were only modest, with both performances\n            by the Bank, and Borrower rated satisfactory. Lessons drawn\n            form the project convey the following. 1) Embankment design\n            must combine engineering solutions with appropriate\n            plantation: the components supported by the project,\n            including vegetative practices on the embankment slopes, and\n            afforestation to reduce cyclone damage, and embankment\n            maintenance costs, are good in physical, financial and\n            social terms. The technically sound project interventions\n            combined sustainable embankment maintenance practices, with\n            gains in agricultural production, and farm incomes, setting\n            the foundation of the project's success. 2)  Need for a\n            comprehensive approach in coastal zone management. future\n            projects should assist the Government to prepare and\n            implement a comprehensive development plan in line with\n            their policy, to include: (a) coastal protection plan; (b) a\n            network of safe havens; and, (c) a disaster preparedness,\n            and response system. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management\n            (ICZM) concept will be essential for ensuring sustainable\n            development of the coastal zone, and, to this end, adequate\n            attention and funding has to be provided to monitor the\n            physical conditions of coastal embankments, and\n            environmental and social impacts in the coastal areas. 3)\n            Harmonization of donor policies and procedures: The\n            difficulties, experienced in co-financing of technical\n            assistance (TA), reflect lack of implementation readiness,\n            and the need for harmonizing donor policies, and procedures\n            for timely flow of funds. 4) Procurement reform is essential\n            to improve public sector accountability: improper\n            procurement practices found under the project, reinforce the\n            importance of public sector procurement reform, fortunately,\n            a public procurement reform project is now underway, to\n            strictly follow the new procurement rules and standard\n            bidding practices; including a reform approach toward\n            procurement of maintenance works."}, "docdt": "2003-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
