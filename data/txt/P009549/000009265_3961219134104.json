Following the May 1985 cyclone, the Government\n            of Bangladesh (GOB) formulated in 1986 a National Cyclone\n            Protection Program (NCPP) with the objectives of minimizing\n            disastrous effects of cyclones and storm surges. NCPP\n            included plans for improving the coastal embankment system\n            and introducing associated preventive measures. The\n            objectives of PWP were to: (i) protect the agricultural\n            areas within the polders against inundation by saline water;\n            and (ii) provide protection against loss of human lives and\n            damages caused by cyclonic storm surges. It should be noted\n            that the Bank was prompt in responding to the request for\n            emergency assistance from the Borrower, the quality of the\n            physical works is good and the objectives of this assistance\n            in terms of protection of human life and property and\n            increased agricultural production are expected to have been\n            substantially achieved. The outcome of the program is,\n            therefore, rated as satisfactory. The main lessons learned\n            are: 1) Design of engineering works under deadlines\n            appropriate for emergency works increases the risk of\n            under/over estimation of quantities and cost overruns; 2)\n            Public opposition to the alignment of retired embankments\n            was a significant factor in implementation delays; 3) Even\n            under emergency procedures, land acquisition bottlenecks can\n            cause significant implementation delays; 4) During the\n            planning phase, beneficiaries need to be involved in\n            deciding the provision of hydraulic structures; 5) Designs\n            for improvement and/or repairs to existing structures should\n            be done to minimize maintenance; 6) Contract management of\n            major civil works by consultants is efficient and improved\n            quality in civil works construction can be assured; 7) There\n            is a need for GOB to review its procurement procedures to\n            find ways to expedite decisions, particularly for emergency\n            operations; 8) The implementation of the foreshore\n            afforestation development under CERP should be given\n            priority; and 9) When financing a project of significant\n            size funded from several credits, an early decision should\n            be made to prepare separate supervision reports for such projects."}, "docdt": "1996-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
