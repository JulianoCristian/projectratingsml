participation in investment and management; improves the\n            overall efficiency of Brazil's water supply and\n            sewerage (W&S) sector; and increases coverage of W&S\n            services while improving the quality of water bodies located\n            in states and municipalities served by participating\n            utilities. The project has four components: 1) financing the\n            costs of goods and consultant services needed for day-to-day\n            management of project implementation and the promotion and\n            dissemination of project experiences; 2) financing technical\n            assistance to support programs by the federal, state, or\n            municipal governments aimed at institutional and regulatory\n            reform of the water sector; further developing sector\n            programs and data banks; developing and implementing a\n            utility rating data base and a yardstick regulation system;\n            environmental management programs; and studies and sector\n            planning at the local level. This component also supports\n            institutional reform programs. The third component finances\n            unaccounted-for water control subprojects and other small\n            but profitable operational, financial, and administrative\n            actions in water utilities. It finances consultant services,\n            goods, and works needed to support supply and installations;\n            reviews and updates commercial cadastres and commercial,\n            financial, accounting, and information systems;\n            decentralizes operations and management; and funds marketing\n            and communications."}, "docdt": "1998-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
