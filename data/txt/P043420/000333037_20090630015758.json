        outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was negligible to low, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was negligible\n            to low, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project has worked well at the three\n            levels of government, the federal, state and municipal, and\n            has introduced systems that require their coordination, like\n            National Water and Sanitation System (SNIS). This was a\n            challenge (and is for many of the Bank projects in Brazil)\n            but the project has performed remarkably well in this\n            intergovernmental regards. The projects emphasis on outreach\n            and dissemination efforts partially account for this\n            achievement. PMSS demonstrated its significant ability to\n            support National Secretariat for Water Supply and Sanitation\n            (SNSA) and Ministry of Cities (MoC) in the formulation and\n            evaluation of guidelines and public policies. In\n            implementing the public policies for the sector, the project\n            was subject to performance guidelines defined by the\n            Government for the sector at the same time as it offered the\n            expertise of highly specialized consultants, which was a\n            particular model of organization in which the participation\n            of specialists was required and was always met with speed\n            and technical quality. In this context, it is also worth\n            citing the invaluable contribution of the project in the\n            elaboration and approval of the regulatory and legal\n            framework of the Brazilian water supply and sanitation sector."}, "docdt": "2009-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
