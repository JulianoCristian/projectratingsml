PROJECT C    IPETON REPORT
FIRST INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT (CIB I)
(LOAN 2226-CHA AND CREDIT 1313-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Industrial
Credit Project (CIB I) in China, for which Loan 2226-CHA and Credit 1313-CHA
in the amounts of US$40.6 million and SDR 28.0 million respectively were
approved on December 21, 1982. The loan and credit were closed on December
31, 1988, one year behind schedule. Both were fully disbursed with the last
disbursement on June 20, 1989.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Industry and Fmnergy Division,
China Department, of the Asia Regional Office (Evaluation Summary, Parts I
and III) and the China Investment Bank (CIB - Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's appraisal
mission for the Fifth Industrial Credit Project (CIB V) in February 1989, and
is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan, Credit and
Project Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and
CIB, and internal Bank memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are reproduced
as an Attachment to the Report.

FIRS1 INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT (C;8 I}
(LOAN 2226-CHA AND CREDIT 1313-CHA)
Qb3ectives
i.       The Industrial Credit Project (CIB I) was approved in 1982 and was
the first Bank operation in industry through a development finance institni-
tion - the China Investment Bank (CIB). This was the first in a series of
measures included in the Bank's strategy for the development of the indus-
trial and financial sectors in China. The objectives of CIB I werp to assist
in:   (i) meeting the need for foreign exchange for industrial financing;
(ii) improving industrial efficiency; and (iii) organizing and improving
CIB's capacity for project lending and strengthening CIB to become an
efficient and autonomous financial intermediary for industrial finance.
Implementation Experience
ii.      CIB I was implemented successfully and its objectives were substan-
tially met. It was followed by the Second, Third, Fourth, and Flfth Indus-
trial Credit Projects in 1984, 1986, 1987, and 1989 for an aggre,4te amount
of US$945 million. Although commitments under CIB I were faster than esti-
mated, disbursements were delayed and the Closing Date was extended by one
year. This was due primarily to delays in implementing some subprojects and
partly to the establishment and learning process which CIB had to undergo as
a new institution, particularly with respect to the utilization of the Bank
loan/credit. The disbursement period covered 6.5 years which is still satis-
factory for a first operation and as compared to the Bank's profile of
similar operations. CIB I funded 59 subprojects with an average subloan of
US$1.2 million; there were 30 subloans above CIB's free limit (US$1.0 mil-
lion) which accounted for about 73% of the total approvals.   State-owned
enterprises and modernization/expansion projects accounted for over ninety
percent of the subloans; by industrial sector, 27% of the subloans were to
the textile sector and 19% were to light industry; packaging and electronics
accounted for slightly over 10% each.   By location, projects in Jiangsu
province received 46% of the total subloans, 17% in Tianjin, 14% in Hebei,
with the rest spread over 6 other provinces and localities. On the whole,
the average overrun was 24% which was financed by the subborrowers them-
selves and meant a lower exposure for CIB. The projects financed under CIB I
showed satisfactory financial and economic returns. As a result, CIB showed
a high average cumulative collection rate of 99% leaving a very small propor-
tion in arrears.   Such utilization was in line with the CIB's plans and
strategy under CIB I.
Results
iii.     With Bank assistance in five industrial credit projects, CIB has
achieved substantial institutional development and operational growth.



- iv -
However, CIB is still relatively small compared to other financial institu-
tions in China. CIB has built up an adequate organization and branch network
with trained staff, appropriate procedures and satisfactory standards for
project lending. Its project operations are guided by its appraisal manual
which has been developed with Bank assistance. This manual has been improved
over time and has become a model for many government agencies and financial
institutions.   Its operations have been profitable resulting in a stronger
equity base. CIB has adopted satisfactory financing and operating policies
and strategies including intensive efforts. to diversify its resources, port-
folio, and financial services.   Overall, CIB is -iow better poised for
expanded operations and to face an increasingly competitive environment.
Lessons Learned
iv.      Some of the lessons learned from CIB I were in the following areas.
One of the objectives of CIB I was to assist in developing CIB into an
efficient and autonomous financial intermediary. Under the Chinese planning
and approval system, the projects that are considered by CIB for financing
have been approved and listed in the national plan; this, in turn, means that
these projects have been examineJ and approved by the concerned state and
provincial authorities. Under these circumstances, and while it retains the
right not to provide financing, CIB's full autonomy in selecting projects for
financing is clearly diluted. However, this situation is generally changing
as ZOC implements its decentralization and overall reform program. For CIB,
it is crucial for it to keep improving its appraisal capabilities to ensure
viability of such projects since its technical views are an increasingly
vital input to the collective decision-making process and it retains a veto
on the use of its own resources.
v.       Although it was established under a separate Charter, CIB was under
the guidance of the Peoples Construction Bank of China (PCBC). This bene-
fitted CIB in staffing its organization and starting its operations quickly
through the appointment and secondment of some PCBC staff and use of PCBC's
staff and branch facilities. PCBC also provided local currency resources for
project lending.   However, this served to undermine CIB's autonomy in the
early years and limited its operational independence from PCBC as well as its
ability to diversify its activities and resources.   In retrospect, a more
permanent solution could have been to transfer overall control/supervision
from PCBC to other agencies such as the Ministry of Finance which is now
under active consideration by GOC.
vi.      The Bank's supervision missions as well as appraisals of follow-up
loans to CIB have given close attention to the autonomy issue. During this
time, CIB has become substantially independent of PCBC for staffing and
resources. CIB remains dependent, however, on COC's quotas for its foreign
exchange borrowings.   During the initial years, CIB was seen largely as a
"retailer" of World Bank funds. Until the end of 1985, the World Bank was
the only external source of its foreign currency resources. By the end of
1988, the Bank's share was reduced to 68%. While this weaning process has
slowed somewhat as a result of the government's current retrenchment plans,
the Bank's share is expected to remain at 50% of new borrowings through 1990
and to be reduced further to 41% by 1992 as agreed under CIB V.   It is
possible that the Bank's willingness to lend five loans totaling US$945
million over a seven-year period may have undermined its own advice for CIB



-to seek other resources.   A timee-bound resource diversification program
should have been adopted sooner; howover,  it is doubtful that resource
development would have come earlier.
vii.     Finally, the Bank's focus should remain on assisting CIB to develop
and maintain its competitive edge while expanding and diversifying its opera-
tions.  At the same time  the Bank should also seek to support other institu-
tions involved in indut t{l finance to promote effective competition to CIB
which, in turn, would hal1 ensure CIB's development.

II. js.kzia3
2.1      At the time the China Investment Bank I (CIB I) project was
approved, China had recently initiated a program of reform and adjustment to
improve the overall efficiency of the economy. The Bank and the Government
of China (GOC) had also begun to develop a longer term strategy for the Bank
Group's industrial lending to China. In the context of the overall economic
thrust at that time, China's industrial sector needed foreign exchange and
more efficient intermediation mechanisms to support the new Vtransformation"
investments and to upgrade industrial technologies and processes.
2.2      The GOC was also exploring ways to improve the operations and
efficiency of the financial system.   Planned measures were to include the
establishment of new financial institutions, the spin-off of some functions
of existing institutions and/or the eventual development of universal-type
banks and financial institutions.   In December 1981 the State Council
approved a special charter establishing the China Investment Bank, one of the
first of the new institutions which would form part of an increasingly com-
petitive and efficient financial intermediation system.
2.3      In December 1982 the World Bank approved CIB I to assist CIB in
financing investment loans for small- and medium-sized light industrial
enterprises needing foreign excbange. CIB I was expected to be the first in
a series of projects to help CIB develop into an important part of China's
economic reform program. CIB I consisted of Loan 2226-CHA (US$40.6 million)
and Credit 1313-CHA (SDR 28.0 million). It was the Bank's first credit line
to CIB.
2.4      The loan, credit and project agreements signed on December 28, 1982,
specified: (i) standard terms for the COC; (ii) a fixed interest rate of
6.9% p.a., 20 years' maturity and 5 years' grace for onlending by the COC to
CIB; and (iii) a minimum interest rate of 8.0% p.a. and a maximum maturity of
12 years including the grace period (normally not to exceed 7 years) for



-2-
onlending by CIB to subborrowers. The subborrowers were to absorb the for-
eign exchange risk between the US Dollar and local Yuan, while the COC would
absorb the interest rate risk and excharge risks between the US Dollar and
the SDR and currency pool fo-. the loan and credit, respectively. The Closing
Date was December 31, 1987; however, it was later extended to December 31,
1988. Both the loan and the credit were fully disbursed.
III. Protect Objectives and Description
3.1      The objectives in creating and approving CIB I were to:
(i) assist in meeting the need for foreign exchange for industrial
financing;
(ii)  improve investment efficiency;
(iii) assist in organizing and improving CIB's capacity for project
design, selection criteria and transfer of foreign technology
and upgrade its project appraisal methodology; and
(iv)  while not explicitly stated, strengthen CIB as an efficient,
autonomous financial intermediary for industrial financing.
CIB's initial policy and strategy statements envisioned that its
subborrowers would be state enterprises with an export orienta-
tion, primarily in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Tianjin, the main
coastal areas actively involved in industrial activity and
exporting.
3.2      CIB I provided foreign exchange funds to finance:   development
projects in light industry; training for CIB staff in project preparation,
appraisal and supervision; consultants' services; and overseas study tours
and technical visits. The project had the following compone-its:
(i) investment subloans for eligible enterprises -- US$69.3 million
(loan of US$40.6 million and credit of SDR 26.78 million);
(ii)  preparation subloans -- SDR 940,000 (on July 19, 1984 the Bank
agreed to reallocate this amount to the subloan component, since
funds were available from other sources); and
(iii) CIB training, consultant services, overseas study tours and
technical visits -- SDR 280,000.
3.3     -As noted, CIS I was timely in that China was in need of long-term
financing, particularly in foreign exchange, to help upgrade its industry
and acquire modern technology. At the same time, it needed a new and autono-
mous institution capable of screening industrial projects based not only on
their financial but also on their economic viability and merit.   While
development banking was not new, CIB was to be the first development bank in
China to provide term financing based on comprehensive project analysis, with
a focus on economic appraisal.

IV. Institutional 'Aspcts
4.1      CIB I was implemented from 1983 through 1988 but was fully committed
by December 12, 1984, a year ahead of schedule.   It was followed by four
other Bank Projects:   CIB II in 1984, CIB III in 1986, CIB IV tn 1987 and
CIB V in 1989. The Bank's Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) No. 7659-CHA, date~d
April 28, 1989, for the Fifth Industrial Credit Project in C,hina (CIB ')
provides an up-to-date description and analysis of the major developments in
industry and finance during this period. The SAR also discusses the institu-
tional aspects and actual operational and financial performance of CIB itself
from 1983-88. This Project Completion Report (PCR) therefore concentrates on
some major aspects and issues relating to CIB's policies, strategies, organi-
zation, management and operations as they evolved and were addressed by CIB
and the Bank under CIB I.
4.2      Policies and Strategies.  Under CIB I, CIB's Board approved formal
policy and strategy statements. CIB's main function was to raise medium- and
long-term foreign exchange resources from abroad to provide investment loans
to small- and medium-sized enterprises. The strategy was relatively simple
and straightforward: the priority was to build its staff and clientele and
to relend its funds to light industrial projects, in keeping with the
national policy of upgrading technology and modernizing productive facilities
in priority sectors and on financing the projects of existing enterprises.
CIB also emphasized projects that could be implemented quickly and that
preferably were export-oriented. As such, CIB was to concentrate mainly on
textils and some light industrial sectors in the three coastal areas.  The
utilization of funds under CIB I reflects this strategy (paias. 5.1-7.15).
4.3      Organization and Hanagement.   Appendix 1 shows the organizational
chart for CIB in 1988. The main differences since 1982 are: the addition of
departments, including one more in project lending, in credit management
(monitoring/supervision) and in personnel/training; and expansion in the
number of branches from 3 to 31.   CIB's staff is up to slightly over 1,300,
including 173 engineers and 455 financial analysts/ economists wbo are
directly involved in project work.   In August 1986 and after consistent
urging from the Bank, CIB appointed a full-time CIB president.   Similarly,
the Bank urged the appointment of full-time presidents for CIB's branches (a
condition of CIL _V); and by the end of 1988, they had been appointed for 20
out of the 31 branches. The remaining 11 branches have presidents who are
concurrently vice-presidents of the local People's Construction Bank of China
(PCBC) branches.   Based on the Bank's advice, CIB recently reviewed its
projected staffing with a view to consolidating its organization and
increasing its overall efficiency vhile maintaining existing staff levels.
V. Financial/Lcerational Results
5.1      Loan Operations.  Since CIB was a new institution, it was difficult
to project its operations. However, based on its subproject pipeline and the
perceived high demand for term loans, it was estimated that its operations
would grow at about 40X per year, starting at a level of loan approvals of
Y 50 million and US$50 million for the first year. Actual performance was
much higher than this seemingly optimistic projection, particularly for local
currency approvals. Actual loan approvals in foreign exchange started slowly
but accelerated in 1985-88.   Commitments and disbursements showed similar
trends. The cumulative figures are shown below (details on the actual loan
operations of CIB for 1983-88 are available in the Project Files).

Note:  The 1983-87 figures are based on CIB I projections; the 1988
figures are based on CIB II estimates. CIB provided the actual
figures to the CIB V appraisal mission.
5.2      Average actual foreign and local currency operations were 501 and
701 higher than projected, respectively.  CIBWs loan operations have been
consistently above projections because the demand for its resource has been
much greater than anticipated.   Initially, disbursements lagged but are
currently at a reasonable level equivalent to 861 of commitments for local
currency and 791 for foreign currency. Present projections for 1989-92 show
an average growth of about 201 per year, a conservative level that is limited
only by CIB's approved borrowing plans.   The Bank has encouraged CIB to
diversify its sources of funds beyond Bank resources to meet the demand and
under CIB V, an understanding was reached that non-Bank foreign exchange
resources would increase from 501 in 1990 to 591 by 1992. CIB's experience
in this respect reflects that of other Chinese financial institutions vhich
all face chronic excess demand for industrial investment finance, a phenomena
familiar to all the centrally planned economies.
5.3      FinancialLOrational Results.  A detailed comparative breakdown of
the projected and actual financial statements of CIB are available in the
Project Files.   Summary statistics are shown in Appendix 3.  CIB's actual
financial performance is much better than what was projected during the
appraisal of CIB I, and as a result its financial position is also much
better.   This was partly due to the low SAR estimates which projected a
negative gross spread on foreign exchange loans with net income resulting
mainly from local currency lending and deposit income.
5.4      The task ahead is for CIB to maintain its performance  particularly
its debt service coverage. Its ability to do so depends on the quality of



-5-
its portfolio and collection performance. To this end, CIB V emphasizes the
adequacy of CIB's provisions for bad debt, supervision responsibility and the
diversification of its portfolio and reaources.
VI. Pro1ect leaults
6.1      Actual tblan Utilization and Disbursements.  As of June 30, 1989,
the Bank's loan and credit were fully disbursed amounting to US$71.5 million
equivalent, including the front-end fee and technical assistance. However,
the following analyses cover the period as of March 31, 1989 in line with
CIB's own report.
6.2      The Bank authorized 58 subloans/subprojects to 56 enterprises for a
total of US$39.934 million and SDR 27.720 million. A summary of the subloans
as of March 31, 1989 is as follow (see Appendix 2 for further details).

Note:  As of June 30, 1989 there were a total of 59 subloans of which 31
(531) were above the free limit.
6.3      Although the Bank reviewed only slightly over 501 of the subloans
(the SAR esftmated 60X), the amount of funds covered equaled 731 of the total
(the SAR estimated 801), an appropriate level particularly for a first opera-
tion such as CIB I. Thus, utilization of CIB I was quite satisfactory. Only
three subloans were cancelled.   The average subloan was US$1.2 million,
ranging from a low of about US$0.170 million to a high of US$5.9 million.
These levels are reasonable. CIB I's free limit of for subloans of US$1.0
million equivalent and a maximum subloan amount of US$8.0 million.

of the TA component financed study trips to major financial markets for 20
staff.   The balance financed short-term training for 51 staff; the areas
included project appraisal and supervision, finance and loan management,

The overseas training was appropriate for a first operation with a new
Chinese financial institution and provided urgently needed exposure to inter-
national operations and practices. However, as CIB matures, the focus should

(Appendix 2) was in line with CIB's initial strategy statement. Subprojects
would mainly involve "transformation" (balancing, modernization, rehabilita-
tion and expansion, BNRE) efforts at state-owned and export-oriented enter-
prises, located primarily in the coastal provinces and municipalities of
Jiangsu, Shanghai and Tianjin; they were directed largely to the textile and
other light industrial sectors. As of March 31, 1989, approved CIB I sub-
loans broke down as follows.

6.6      As can be seen, 27 projects  (46.5%) were located in Jiangsu
province, one of the more industrially advanced provinces; they accounted for
31.3% of the total amounts approved.   Two projects each were located in
Beijing and Liaoning, and one each in Anhui and Hubei provinces. The textile
sector accounted for 16 subprojects (27.6%), light industry for 11 (19.0%).
Other sectors included electronics, packaging, building materials, chemicals,
machine,y, pharmaceuticals, metallurgy and services.  By amount, three sub-
sectors (textiles, light industry and packaging) accounted for 57% of the
total (about 19% each). By the end of 1988, CIB's loan approvals for tex-
tiles reached 30% of total approvals. CIB has agreed under CIB V to limit
its exposure to any single sector to no more than 25% of its portfolio. The
Bank actively promoted this change in policy, which should result in a more
diversified portfolio and a resultant lower overall risk.
6.7      CIB's portfolio is diversified geographically primarily because of
the increase in its branch network. However, Jiangsu province accounted for
a large portion: at the end of 1988, it had 161 subprojects (17%), for an
amount equivalent to 13.8% of total approvals.   CIB's Tianjin branch
accounted for the next largest amount.
6.8      By type of enterprise, 98% of CIB I went to state-owned enterprises,
consistent with the original plans. The Bank and CIB have agreed that CIB V
will provide assistance to non-state-owned enterprises equivalent to at least
10% of total approvals beginning in 1989. This pattern would be a signifi-
cant change in that, as of the end of 1988, only about 6% of the total
foreign exchange loan approvals by CIB had gone to non-state-owned enter-
prises (by number, 106 out of 1,014 total projects or 10%).

Source: CIB Reports.
7.2      The average cost overrun was 24X over the projected figures,
attributable mainly to higher local currency costs. The enterprises them-
selves financed these overruns. Thus, CIB's actual exposure was much lower
and more reasonable than projected -- about 671 of totral costs instead of
841. The actual ratio of foreign to local currency loans was 60:40. Based
on information gathered by CIB, the main causes for the overruns were delays
in project implementation arising from changes in the investment programs and
equipment design. CIB usually provides 1001 financing; this was true for 28
projects (501); for 4 projects CIB financing was under 801 of total require-
ments (A-7 for 66%, A-ll for 64X, A-24 for 301 and A-26 for 451).
7.3      lub=ject Imlementation.  For a first operation, overall implemen-
tation of subprojects was satisfactory.   Twenty-nine (501) were completed
either ahead of or on schedule; of the balance, one subproject was delayed by
up to 6 months, 6 were delayed by up to 1 year, 3 projects by more than 2
years. A summary breakdown follows.

7.4      Since the subproject delays and cost overruns were mainly the result
of changes in design, CIB is now emphasizing its role in project preparation
to ascertain proper design and agreement with project entities.   This
strategy should not only avoid delays later in the project cycle but will
also hopefully lead to more accurate estimates of costs and appropriate and
adequate financing, whose absence has often been the cause of delays and cost
overruns.
7.5      Performance of the Suborolects.  As of June 30, 1988, 48 of 56 sub-
projects had been completed and were operating; 6 had been completed but were
still in trial operations; and 2 had not been completed (CIB has provided an
individual breakdown that is available in the Project Files).   All 48
operating subprojects showed profits, although the results were mixed when
compared with the projections. The actual profits of 20 of the 48 operating
subprojects (421) were above projections.   Of the remaining 28, 14 had
profits marginally below projections and 14 had actual profits 501 or lower
than projected.
7.6      Thirty-five subprojects were operating at over 901 of designed
capacity, 7 at 70-892 of capacity. Only 6 subprojects had capacity utiliza-
tion below 70X (one was marginally below at 681, the rest -- 5 projects --
were under 50X, with the lowest at 151).
7.7      CIB's report provided no explanation as to how these projects could
have made profits given their very low capacity utilization.   CIB should
examine this issue more carefully. Possible reasons include accounting prac-
tices in China (zero fixed costs because of the age of equipment and low/sub-
sidized borrowings) and the fact that the new capacity of subprojects is
usually minimal compared with that of the whole enterprise.  CIB needs to
investigate these and other problem projects more closely to:  (i) make an
in-depth diagnosis of the problems; and (ii) assist in developing a program
of corrective measures.
7.8      12payn        URerence.  The repayment and arrears positions of the
individual subprojects under CIB I are suvmarized below as of June 30, 1988
(details can be found in the Project Files).

Note:  The amounts include prepayments; the amount due represents the
principal; the amount repaid and in arrears includes both
principal and interest payments; no breakdown for interest and
principal was provided.
7.9      The above figures came from CIB, which has been using the Chinese
accounting form (current practice is to monitor mainly the repayment of prin-
cipal). To meet Bank needs, CIB has agreed to a new format that will show
the repayment and arrears positions for both interest and principal. This
information was not available at the time of the PCR but is expected to be
provided starting with the progress report for the period ending June 30,
1989.
7.10     Nevertheless, the above figures provide a reasonable indication of
the state of and repayment performance on subloans under CIB I. Overall, the
collection performance on the CIB I subloans reflects the performance of the
subprojects/enterprises.   Since, under the Chinese system, repayments of
principal are deducted from taxable income, enterprises pay off as much of
the loan as their operations permit, the reason for the large amount of pre-
payments. Under CIB I, a total of 16 subloans (27.5X) had been redeemed/re-
paid in full by June 30, 1988, for a maturity of only about four years.
Nevertheless, 27 of the subprojects (461) were not performing well and showed
arrears equivalent to 321 of their amounts due (301 for foreign currency and
431 for local currency subloans). While these arrears represent only 1 of
the total amounts due on CIB I subloans (and an even lower of CIB's total
portfolio), that level is on the high side. Although most of their enter-
prises carry a guarantee from their *parent companies" or from the provincial
governments, this issue should be of concern to CIB.
7.11     Because of government regulations, CIB could make only limited
provision for doubtful debts.   The Bank staff have pursued this matter
vigorously during imptementation and as a consequence under the CIB V, it has



- 11 -
been agreed that CIB will be allowed to increase its provision to at least 2X
of its portfolio, a level that should be adequate, since its portfolio
quality and financial position remain strong.
7.12     Other Economic Benefits.  Direct employment in CIB I subprojects has
been estimated at about 11,500 jobs, for an actual total cost per job of
about Y 37,000 or US$10,000 equivalent. For the 17 subprojects with data,
actual export earnings in 1986-87 were about Y 145 million (US$39 million
equivalent), representing 321 of total sales.   Textile/garment factories
accounted for most of the exports, with the pharmaceutical and machinery
sectors contributing marginally. This level of exports could be expanded,
although the current amounts may be sufficient to service the foreign
exchange loins and were in line with projections.
7.13     The range for the ex-ante financial rates of return (FRR) for CIB I
subloans was wide, from a low of 16% to a high of 112X; the range for the ex-
ante economic rates of return was from 122 to 1001.   The breakdown is as
follows:
Table 7

12X to 151                                      5

Total                       57              52
7.14     For purposes of the PCR exercise, CIB compared ex-ante and ex-post
rates of return for a sample of 10 subprojects. As indicated in para. 7.5,
all the subprojects showed actual profits, albeit often below projections.
The ex-ante FRRs of the sample were 16X and above, while the ex-post FRRs
were 201 or higher except for one project that had a negative ex-post FRR
because of very low profitability resulting from intense import competition.
7.15     The ex-post ERRs were much closer to the ex-ante estimates.  Except
for one project, the ex-post ERRs were estimated at 181 and above, which
rates are satisfactory. Although there were no minimum FRR or ERR require-
ments under the CIB I (CIB V will require a minimum of 121), the actual
financial results of most of the projects indicate a reasonable level of
actual rates of return. The reason is that most subprojects involved "trans-
formation" efforts of existing profitable and export-oriented enterprises.

VIII.  Conelu9nsaMsagnhs learAned
8.1      Ob1ectkvs.  As noted in para. 3.1, CIB I had three major objec-
tives, namely: (i) assist in meeting the need for foreign exchange financing
and improve investment efficiency; (ii) assist in improving CIB's capacity in
project design/selection and transfer of technology as well as appraisal
methodology; and (iii) assist in developing CIB as an autonomous and
efficient financial intermediary in industrial finance. Although the amount
of the Bank loan was small compared with the total requirements of enter-
prises in China, CIB I nevertheless helped fill the gap in foreign exchange
industrial financing.   It provided financing to a select group of export-
oriented enterprises for modernizing their equipment and upgrading/ adapting
new processes and technologies. Furthermore, the early evidence is that the
subprojects had satisfactory financial and economic rates of return.   CIB
committed the Bank funds slightly ahead of schedule, but the slowness of
disbursements at the beginning required the one-year extension of the Closing
Date. The reason was normal start-up difficulties for a new institution and
delays in implementing some projects.
8.2      CIB was expected to assist in project design and transfer of tech-
nology. While the subprojects resulted in additional modern equipment and
processes, CIB played only a limited, if any, role in project design and the
choice of technology.   Given the newness of the institution and the very
limited in-house technical capability, this expectation was clearly un-
realis ic.   Furthermore, under the Chinese system, these aspects normally
fall within the purview of enterprises and local engineering and design
institutes and not the financial institutions.   In retrospect, ths Bank
should have recognized that subborrowers should have been expected to have
the technical expertise (with the assistance of outside consultants, if
necessary) as one of the eligibility criteria for CIB financing. CIB's role
would have better been confined to the evaluation of project proposals for
their commercial and technical feasibility.
8.3      In this regard, one of the other major achievements of CIB I is
CIB's adoption of the Project Appraisal Manual, which provides an acceptable
methodology for the commercial, technical and economic evaluation of indus-
trial projects and which has become the model for many government agencies
and other financial institutions.
8.4      While CIB achieved an adequate level of proficiency under CIB I, its
appraisal standards can still be improved. Some of the weaknesses noted in
CIB's appraisal reports were:
(i) As a new institution, CIB was still recruiting and training its
staff over the period of the loan, and the quality of its
appraisal was therefore uneven. CIB seemed to have applied its
appraisal manual in mechanical fashion so that some of the
critical issues in a project's financial and economic viability
were often not analyzed fully.   While this problem is still
apparent, head office has been able to effectively manage it by
exerting quality control through its free-limit mechanism for
branches and regular improvements of the appraisal manual.
(ii)  As noted, CIB rarely examined design alternatives because of its
own limitations and the procedural aspects of investment reviews
for state-owned enterprises, over which CIB has little or no



- 13 -
leverage.   While CIB cannot be -  expert in all technical
matters, it is attempting to p. lie some input by getting
involved in the project cycle as early as possible.
(iii) There was a lack of analysis of the enterprise as a whole,
particularly in terms of its financial capacity and position.
The focus instead was solely on the subproject, mainly because
of CIB's lack of experience and the "trial" nature of opera-
tions. Over time and with intensive Bank follow-up, this aspect
has now been largely corrected with appropriate revisions in the
appraisal manual.
8.5      Institution Building.  One of the objectives of CIB I was to develop
CIB into an efficient and autonomous financial institution focussing on
industrial finance. This objective was partially met during the implementa-
tion of CIB I. Under the current Chinese planning and investment approval
system, the projects that are considered by CIB for financing have been
approved and listed in the national plan; this, in turn, means that these
have been examined and approved by concerned state and provincial authori-
ties.   Under these circumstances and while it retains the right not to
provide financing, CIB's full autonomy in selecting projects for financing is
clearly diluted. However, this situation is generally changing as COC imple-
ments its decentralization and overall reform program.   For CIB, it is
crucial to keep improving its appraisal capabilities to ensure the viability
of such projects since its technical views are an increasingly vital input to
the collective decision-making process and it retains a veto on the use of
its own resources.
8.6      Furthermore, CIB needs to develop more varied sources of funds.  At
the start, the COC and PCBC envisioned CIB's initial and main role as a
"retailer" of foreign exchange resources from the World Bank with local funds
financing complemented by assistance from PCBC.   In the medium and longer
term, CIB was expected to emerge as an independent banking institution
specialized in financial intermediation of overseas capital.   This concept
benefited CIB in staffing its organization with the assistance of PCBC during
its early years of operation; PCBC was also a major source of CIB's local
currency funds.   In the early years, this stance also served to undermine
GIB's autonomy and limited its operational independence from PCBC as well as
its ability to diversify its activities and resources.   In 1986, GIB was
authorized to raise and utilize foreign currency funds domestically and
abroad without any limitation to specific sources.
8.7      Bank supervision missions, as well as the appraisals of the follow-
up loans to CIB, have given close attention to the autonomy issue. During
this time, CIB has become substantially independent of PCBC for staffing and
resources; and it has appointed its own full-time presidents for its head
office and most branches. CIB remains dependent, however, on GOC's quotas
for its foreign exchange borrowing.   CIB is also gradually becoming inde-
pendent of the World Bank for its resources.   Under CIB I (until end of
1985), the Bank was the only external source of its foreign exchange
resources; by the end of 1988, the Bank's share was reduced to 68%. While
this weaning process has slowed somewhat as a result of the government's
current macroeconomic retrenchment plan (the Bank's share is expected to
remain at 50% of new borrowings through 1990), CIB has (under CIB V) agreed



- 14 -
to reduce the ratio further to 41% by 1992. It is important that CIB con-
tinue to actively diversify its foreign and local revenue base and that the
Bank staff continue to pay close attention to these aspects.
8.8      Finally, it should be emphasized that CIB will always be a rela-
tively small institution when compared to such it..ermediaries as PCBC and
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.   Its success or otherwise should
therefore be judged on its performance in its area of specialization, light
industry and export financing, as well as the example it sets for other
intermediaries.   With respect to the latter, its appraisal techniques have
already been copied by many other institutions (para. 8.3 above). In order
to achieve the former objective, it is important that it continue its efforts
to diversify its products, e.g., working capital and trade financing, to more
fully service its traditional clientele and to continue to become pro-
gressively more autonomous so that it can sustain its operations under the
emerging competitive environment in China.
8.9      Training.   CIB continues to provide intensive training for its
professional staff, a program initiated and funded under CIB I.  Most of
CIB's staff has received some form of training through both domestic and
foreign courses.   CIB still requires substantitl training, particularly in
the new areas in which it plans to operate, such as equity investments,
leasing operations, working capital financing, etc. The Bank continues to
support these efforts under its CIB IV and V projects, which will fund CIB's
five-year training program (1989-92). This program includes CIB's computeri-
zation program and training in new activities, subsector analysis and
fund/cash management. The thrust of its current program is to undertake more
training in China to attain specific skills; this approach is cost-effective
and can extend to a larger number of staff.
8.10     Bank Performance.  Together with GOC and PCBC, the Bank was instru-
mental in the creation of CIB.   It played a key role in developing and
improving CIB's operational manuals and in establishing and improving CIB's
overall management and operational procedures. As a first operation, CIB I
required higher than average Bank inputs totalling 285 staffweeks (178 pre-
appraisal/appraisal and 108 supervision/project completion).l This included
a special supervision mission and report on the implementation and disburse-
ment of subproJects under CIB I (report dated September 24, 1985, which is
available in the Project Files). Through its subproject reviews and super-
vision missions, the Bank continuously contributed to improve appraisal
standards, including the recent inclusion/improvement of CIB's manual on
environmental aspects. The Bank has also conducted periodic ex-post assess-
ment of the subprojects' environmental pollution control mechanisms designed
to help strengthen CIB capacity in this area. Bank missions also spent con-
siderable time promoting and assisting CIB to become operationally inde-
pendent of PCBC, e.g., appointment of full-time presidents in head office and
branches. Considerable time was also expended on key aspects of CIB's per-
formance including progress in establishing the needed information system,
financial and audit reports, delegation of authority to branches, adequate
provisions for doubtful debts.
1/ These figures actually understate the Bank's inputs since much of the
staff's work on institutional and more general matters is recorded under
CIB II, III and IV.



- 15 -
8.11     Finally, the staff devoted significant effort to encourage ClB to
diversify its activities and resources; a significant breakthrough resulted
during CIB IV.  It is possible that the Bank's willingness to extend five
loans totalling US$645 million over a five-year period may have provided
disincentives for CIB to seek other resources more rigorously; however, it
gives the initial perception to some parts of GOC and PCBC of CIB as a
retailer of World Bank funds (para. 8.6 above). It is doubtful that resource
development would have come earlier. While the Bank's institution-building
effort has clearly resulted in significant success, the staff, in some
instances, may have given too much attention to appearances rather than sub-
stance. The Bank pushed hard for the appointment of full-time branch presi-
dents to replace the local PCBC vice presidents who were concurrently part-
time presidents of CIB branches. To some extent and as a first step, this
contributed to assist CIB to become more administratively independent of PCBC
at the branch ievel. However, in retrospect, a more permanent and long-term
solution coald have been found in some other ways, such as transfer of over-
all control/supervision from PCBC to other agencies such as MOF which is now
under active consideration by GOC.   Despite these administrative short-
comings, the full-time CIB vice presidents do seem to have satisfactorily
performed their executive role with little or no undermining of CIB's long-
term institutional development.   In the future, the Bank's focus should
remain in assisting CIB to develop and maintain its competitive edge while
expanding and diversifying its operational products for its established
clientele.   At the same time, the Bank should also seek to support other
institutions involved in industrial term finance to promote effective com-
petition to CIB which, in turn, would help to ensure CIB's development. The
proposed FY90 Financial Institution Loan is an important step in this
direction.
8.12     Overall, CIB I was implemented successfully and marks a significant
first step in the long-term process to developing it as an efficient and
effective institution for financial intermediation for industry. Experiences
CIB has obtained during the past eight years have firmly established a ground
for making a leap to become an efficient banking institution with an improved
wider range of services.

Chapter One. Economic Enviroments
China had carried out the economic reform in 1970.
At that time, the industrial sector faced with three
problems: (1) Imbalance in the structure of industries
between heavy and light industries '(including all the
industrial sectors except heavy industry) and dispor-
tion of the internal structure of heavy-hight industries.
The situation in general then was the short supply of
raw materials and consuming goods where as with regard
to specific commodities both consuming good and produc-
tion materials had whether certain amount in inventory
or in short supply; (2) Inefficiency in sectors and
enterprises and high costs of energy and raw materials
in production with low economic benefit. Inputs exeeding
outputs. (3) The equipment was old and worn out, and
technology out of date. So, innovation and transforma-
tion would be urgently needed.
In order to change serious situation of dispropor-
tion in economy, our country adopted the policy of
structural adjustment and reform in 1979. It includes
(1) Lay important position on the development of the
consuming goods production and further adjust the
orientation of heavy industry; (2) undertake techno-
logy innovations enlarging production capacity, increa-
ing varity of products, and improving quality of products.
in the existing enterprises to raise economic benefits.
(3) increasing the utilization rate of energy rescour-
ses (4) reform the unreasonable economic system and raise
efficiency. In the meantime appropriate economic reform
includes: 1) to simplify the structure of authorities;
and extend initiative in enterprise own hands; 2) adopt



- 20 -
the method of retaining proportional profit and foreign
exchange. 3) change the distribution system of indivi-
dual working staff; 4) adopt the principle of capital
repayment, and give full paly to banks' function as
an economic regulator; 5) expand foreign economic and
technological exchange; absorbing advanced technology
and managerial skills; 6) reform the price system,
laying more emphasis upon function of market mechnism
in regulating economy.
Through these three years of structral adjustment
from 1979-1981, the light industry gained an annual
averege growth rate of 14%. The procentage of its output
value in the total output value of the industry as a
whole raised from 43% in 1978 to 51.4% in 1981. The
ratio between light and heavy industries came to be
rationalized. This laid a solid foundation for the eco-
nomic development in the forth comming years. Although
world economy underwent great rush by the oil prices
in 1979, and a world wide recess when entering 80's,
China still mantained a relatively high growth rate.
In order to transform the obsolete equipment in almost
all the industrial enterprises and adopt advanced
technological,the Chinese government advocated those
technological innovatior withlittle investment and
quick economic returns. It encouraged expension of
foreign economic and technological exchange,absorbtion
of advanced technology and equipments,and active utili-
zation of foreign capital in economic construction. On
the one hand, China have to improve the investment en-
viroment, attacting foreign investors invest in China;
to set up sino-foreign joint ventures and foreign en-
terprises, to do compensation trade, and to run or a
trial basis, the special economic zones. On the other



- 21 -
Chapter Two. the Establishment and Functions of CIB
In 1980, the major financial institutions in
China were People's Bank of China(functions as Central
and Commercial Ban)  People's Construction Bank of
China (dealing with investment in fixed assets), Agri-
culture Bank of China(running agriculture credits),
Bank of China (functions as commercial bank for fdreign
trade and investment loans of foreign currency to
domestic enterprises), People's Insurace Corporation of
China (specializing in insurance), China International
Trust and Investment Corporation (dealing wlth trust
and investment for domestic and foreign enterprises).
At that time, these financial institutions had clear
division of functions among themselves.
In November of that year, the first economic dele-
gation from World Bank visited China. It suggested
that China should establish intermediate financial
institution dealing with the World Bank loans to our
medium-and small sized industrial projects. With a
lot of consultations and assistance from World Bank
and approval by the State Counsil, CIB was founded in
Dec.1981. According to the Charter of CIB retified
by the State Council, CIB functions both as an inter-
mediate financial institution for the transfer of
World Bank's industrial project loans, and as a spe-
cialized bank to raise capital for construction from
abroad and deal with investment credits. Its terms of
reference are under the guidance of our Country's
general principles for construction and the plan for
national economy, to receive loans from international
financial institutions, raise foreign capital through
other means and channels; and to support technology
innovations in the domestic medium-and small sized



- 22 -
enterprises, aiming at export expansion and foreign
exchange generation.
In the beginning of 1982 when our bank was just
founded, the Ministry of Finance allocated funds of
RMB Y 1.15 billion from Ministry of Finance
as our funds. As an intermediate financial institution
for transfering loans from international financial
organizations, we have enjoyed full support from WB.
In the past several years, we have received four credit
loans for medium-and small sized industrial enterprises.
It consis-ts of USD 70,6million in the fisical year of
1982, USD 175 million in 1984, USD 100 million in 1986
and USD 300 million in 1987. These four credit /loans
totalled USD 6456 million which was 9% of the total from
World Bank to China. World Bank also introduced to us
the methods of project appraisal, trained large number
of professionals engaged in banking development and
provided advisary service on the organizational and
institutional constructions. As CIB undergoes develop-
ment, World Bank emphasized now and again that CIB should
not rely solely on WB loans but seek alternative chan-
nels to raise funds as well. CIB started preparation to
raise funds from international market in 1985. In May,
1986, State Counsil reiterated that CIB as a channel of
raising capital for China, may also, in addition to
continue its transfer of loans from international finan-
cial organizations, seek foreign loans and issue bonds
abroad. From then on, our business has grown rapidly.
We raise foreign capital through various channels and
explore our business from all dimensions. In 1986, we
acquired 10 billion Japanese Yei.i,from L Japan. In. 1987,



- 23
we obtained first loan of USD 100 million from Asian
Developemnt Bank and at the same time, we received
several mid-term and long-term loans on favorable terms
With the assistance of WB and under the leadership
of Ministry of Finance, People's Bank of China and
People's Construction Bank of China, CIB is developed
repidly. At the end of 1982, we only possess three
branches with 250 staffs or so. By the end of 1987, we
established 55 branches all over China with staff of
975 people. During these five years, the number of bran-
ches enlarged by 18 times and staff members by 19 times.
Our assets valudd only RIB V550 million in 1983, but
reached RMB V 3.83 billion in 1987. 6 times of increase
in the four years. In 1983, our net profit was RMB V 5
milllion whereas in 1987 our profit before tax reach to
RMB V 94.36 million, 19 times of increase. Through se-
veral years of efforts, our bank has become a multi-func-
tional bank, abling to jraise funds through various
channels and apply advanced techniques of project eva-
luation and supervision to undertake investment loans.
As one of the subprojects in China assistanted by the
WB, CIB has made great progress, sound structuce and
exerted important effect at home and abroad.
Meanwhile, we should also realize that our bank is
a new type of bank in China with a very short history.
CIB's foreign currency loan takes only a small proportion
of the total amount of whole nation's loans of foreign
exchange for investment. What is worth me .oning is
that as China is pursuing the policy of opening to the
outside world and revitalizing the domestic economy, and
as the development of commodity economy, the pace of



- 24 -
financial system with People's Bank of China as leading
bank; specialized banks as its main body has gradually
formulated. Various banks and financial institutions are
now gradually commercialized, with their functions both
overlaping and divided. In particular, since 1987, more
and more financial institution had opened business in
foreign exchange. Competition machnism has been intro-
duced into banking, forming a situation of both coope-
ration and division of business among banks. This situa-
tion has put some presure on CIB to further its efforts
to expand the business scope, strengthen its financial
basis, provide the clients with various service of good
quality and strive for existance and development.

Chapter Three.Projects of the first Industrial
loan /credit
I. The goals of the loan/credit
The first industrial loan/credit projects (US$ 70.60
mil.) the WB offered our bank was approved and bound in
agreement in Dec,1982. Its goals includes: (1) provide
funds for the projects of transforming the Chinese medium
-and-small sized industries; (2) Th provide CIB with a
fund,developing its business and enlarging institutions
and train its staff; (3) Appraisal and management method
for industrial projects be introduced into China.
In the course of carrying out these projects, the
World Bank emphasized time and again the goals mentioned
above and further provided us three even bigger loan /
credit loans in order to coordinate the first loan/credit
and to promote the goals of the first loan/credit be fur-
ther realized.
Our organizational development, personel training and
business and financial statements in the course of carry-
ing out the first loan/credit will be elaborated in Chap-
ter Four and Chapter Five. This chapter will mainly deal
with the first loan/credit projects. The general.classi-
fied data of the subprojects are as follow:

II. Approval and disbursement
1. Approval first loan/credit took effect in close coor-
dination with the sides concerned. The subprojects were
approved       75% of the total loan that allocated to
31 subprojects within eight months after effective-ess.
By the end'of 1984, a Aum of USD 70.00 mil. loan/credit
(aeducting front-end fee of US$ 600000) had been allocated
among the 56 subprojects. The allocation of the loan is
listed in Table-I while Table-4 presents an analysis of
the composition of the subprojects.
Our bank approved quick credits mainly because:1) The
Government pays great attention to technical innovation
by introducing advanced technology with foreign capital,
so many enterprises urgently need foreign exchange. 2)
In early 1984, the State Council issued a document,
which emphasizes the advantages of a new channel of uti-
lizing foreign exchange by our bank. 3) Our bank has
branches which have developed rapidly. In addition, the
local governments strongly support our work. They asked
to set up local branches. As a result, the range of
project selecting has been widened and prepared the way
for accelerating grant of projects. 4) Our bank pays
close attention to appraise projects. At the early stage'
our bank concentrated upon appraisal projects, made
great efforts to improve personel qualities, sped up the
appraising, and increasing the quality of our appraising.
2. Disbursement
The disbursement was slow in 1983 and 1984 as is
indicated in Table-2. By the end of 1984, the total
disbursement was USS 12.41 mil., covering 17.6% of the
total sums of the loan, for which the reasons are: 1)
According to the procedures of project-managing in



- 28 -
China, the initial design can be expanded,equipment can
be selected, study abr-oad can be carried and technical
negotiation can be undertake.            Such work would
generally take over six months. It took another several
months from signing an.- procurement contract to pay on
delivery (more than half a year for large complete set
of equipment). Therefore, disbursement date was post-
poned. 2). The procedures practised by the World Bank
vnfamillar. As lack of experience, it was uncoordinated
between CIB, enterprises, and procurement company as
well as the World Bank.
CIB was fully aware of the problems mentioned above.
Since 1985, our bank had strengthened disbursement work,
and built close ties with sides concerned, resulting
in good effect in quickening the payment. In 1985, the
disbursement of the first industrial loan/credit amounted
to US$ 27.15 mil., which is 2.57 times than that of 1984.
Generally speaking, the disbursement date of the
first loan/credit was delaid for one year than the date
provided in the agreement. By the end of June,1987,
USS 62.36 mil. had been disbursed, covering 89% of the
total loan/credit USS 70 mil. At that time 13 subprojects
out of 56 did not put into operation; now payment is
being done one after another. if the loan would be inva-
lid by the end of 1987 according to the original plan,
it would be impossible for some projects to obtain their
funds. So, we applied to the WB for using the first indus-
trial loan/credit for another year (till Dec.31,1988).
By June 31,1988, the loan account 2226-CHA had ba-
lance of USS 1.68 mil. Under loan Account 2226-CHA, the
three subprojects- Tianjin Copper Wire and Net Factory,



- 29 -
China Yaohua Glass Company and Chengde Tourist Hotel
remain their disbursement. Loan Account 1313-CHA had a
balance of 2.64 mil. SDR. Under this account, Tianjin
Sensitive Film Factory is now under trial operation
which will pay USS 800,000 (about 600,000 SDR) for the
imported equipment by the end of 1988. Our bank has a
surplus of 235,000 SDR for personel training, which is
now under payment. The personel training expense. arranged
by the first industrial loan will be paid off by the end
of 1988.
1II. Composition of the Subprojects
According to the developing strategies of our bank
the subprojects opened up by the first industrial loan/
credit have the following features (see Table-4): 1) To
put emphasis on supporting light industry. Of,:all the 56
subprojects, 19 are among light industry, covering
33.93%. The total sums for light industry amount to US$
22.19 mil., covering 31.71% of the total loan. 2) To
mainly onlend technical innovation loan. Of the total
projects, 51 are technical innovation projects, which is
91% of the total. The total amount to such projects
were about US$ 48.06 mil, covering 60% of the total.
3) The loan are basically concentrated on the coastal
areas of Eastern China. Except for two subprojects,
(about US$ 1.48 mil), the other subpvojects are distri-
buted in Jiangsu, Hebei, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing,
Shenyang, Dalian and Fujian. These provinces and /or
cities constitute the key zones where China opens to the
outside world and the economy is comparatively well-
developed. Our bank concentrates the loans in these
areas because the enterprises are desirable qualities



- 30 -
and high level of management. The*eby less risk would
be occured. It has coordinated not only the programme
adjusting of the country but also expanded the effect
of our bank. 4) our funds are chiefly onlending to the
medium-and-small sized industrial projects. In terms of
allocation to the 56 subprojects, the average loan per
project was US$ 1.25 mol. Of the subprojects 51 were less
than US$ 3 million per project. 3 were more than US$-
5 million each; and only one with maximum amount of
US$ 6.77 million. All this entirely conforms to the sti-
pulation of our hank drew up in 1982 that individual
loan in foreign exchange in the developing strategies
should not exceed the limit amount USS 8 million. 5)
To take the state-owned enterprises as the center.
The funds were onlending to the 56 state-owned enter-
prises with amount of US$ 68.81 mil, covering 98%.
This is mainly because the state-owned enterprises are
main economical elements and their basical condition
are relatively satisfied with less risk,
IV. Analysis of the investment cost
Of the 56 subprojects funded by our first industrial
loan/credit, by June 30,1988, 51 were completed and put
into production (see Table-3), two were completed and
put into trial production. According to the original
plan, the total investment cost for these 53 subprojects
amounts to RMB 351m846,500, exceeding V85,346,400.
CIB originally planned to lend a loan of V 294,368,600,
but actually lend V291,834,800, reducing V 2,533,800 of
which foreign exchange loan was reduced US$ 1,254,200
while the loan in RMB was increased V 1,900,400. The
main causes for an increase of the total cost are as
follows: 1) Individual projects had changed their designs



- 31 -
and increased construction contents. Take Changzhou
Iron and Steel Plant for example that the plant merged
second period engineerings into the first period engi-
neering in advance, so that the additional investment
cost amounted to RMB V 49 million, covering 57% of the
total over.xpenditure of the 53 subprojects. 2) The
subprojects which-meet with requirement of city program
and increased varieties of the products such as Beijing
No.3 Clothing -Eactory, costing about V 30 million,
covering 35% of the total overexpenditure. 3) Other
factors such as price raising of some raw materials at
home; the adjusted exchange rate of U.S.Dollar to the
devaluation of USD to the major currencies in the
Western World, caused to raise the cost of some cons-
truction projects.
The     53 subprojects wich have been put into
production and/or trial production, our bank originally
planned to lent a loan covering a proportion of 83.66%
of the total investment, but actually turned out to be
only 66.75%. This is chiefly because some of the pro-
jects like Chengde Tourist Hotel, Beijing NO.3 Clothing
Factory and Nanjing Clour Printing Mill increased cons-
truction contents. Renminbi was overspent quite a lot.
The enterprises managed to collect RMB funds by them-
selves in some other way and our bank thus comparatively
reduced the loan proportion.
V. Analysis of economic benefit from the subprojects
As is shown in Table-3, the subprojects have put
into operation one after another since August, 1983.
by June 30,1988, the number of the projects that had
been put into production reached 51,and 2 projects are
under trial production and 3 projects are coming to
completed. Compared with original plan, then we will



- 32 -
find that 28 subprojects went into operation as sche-
dule or ahead of time. And 28 were postponed (including
those that are not put into production). The time of
delay ranges from one month to 20 months or more. The
main causes for the delay are: some projects had post-
poned its construction date and some people concerned
were not fully consider the variety of factors when
appraising the projects, and failed to predict many
unfavotirable factors. To be specific, 11 subprojects
were postponed because of changing of construction
plans or added more construction contents; 3 subprojects
were postponed because the foreign firms were changed i
in mid-way when equipment was being introduced into
China; another 8 subprojects were postponed because the
imported equipment was not delivered in due time or
was difficult totrial: another 2 subprojects were post-
poned because domestical equipment was not delivered
or under the trial testing; still another 4 subprojects
were postponed because of other factors.
Table-6 indicates that 49 subprojects under opera-
tion have achieved good economic benefit. According to
statistics that actual profits from projects in fact
got V136.335 mil every year, which exceeding the pro
jected level. It was 116.54% than that of the original.
plan. Actually, they submitted tax V 43.824 mil every
year, reaching 78.82% of the projection. It could gene-
rated foreign exchange US$ 38.761 mi. and save US$5.92
mil.each year.             Except 6 subprojects which
could not achieve desirable benefit because of the rai-
sing price of the raw material and 2 of which were su-
ffered from spar tarts damaged; other subprojects have
,,-r                    s have~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



-33-
achieved good economic benefit. Compared with others,
the bubprojects of textiles and electron have achieved
much better benefit. For example, Beijing No.3 Clothing
Factory were produced only 850,Q00/ypar clothes before
project. After that, the output actually reached to
2,320,000 piece/year,exceeding the original quota of
1210000 piece/year by nearly one time. It was projected
to generate additional profits and tax V 1.55 mil,
but actually V 14.68 mil, 8.5 times than that of the pro-
jection. Besides, Subprojects like Shijiazhuang Warp
Knitting Mill, Changzhou Dongfanghong Pr.Linting and Dye-
ing Mill, Dalian Woolen Fabric Clothing Factory and Da-
hua Cotton Textile Mill, had greatly exceeded the ori.
ginal projection.
VI. Analysis of loan payment
As is shown in Table-7, by June 1988, 51 subpro-
jects (including 2 subprojects, although not'formally
put into production, the loan could be paid back from
other multiple profits) funded by the first loan/credit
had started to pay back the loan. The grand total of
due foreign exchange loan for 51 subprojects was USS-
34.5848 mil, which was actually paid back US$ 34.0483
mil, covering 98.5% of the loan that ought to be recei-
vable. The overdue loan amounts to USS 536.500, covering
1.55% of the due loan in foreign exchange to be recei-
vable. The grand total due loan in RMB amounts to
V40.4261 mil,.actually V 42.2191 mil. received,and
Vl.7930 mil. were received before due date.
In terms of the ability to pay back the loan, 13
subprojects had paid back as scheduled, 18 subprojects
have paid back ahead of time, totalling UO$ 3.566 mil.
About 20 subpvojects paid before the due date.



-34-
6 subprojects are not in a position to pay the loan
yet since postpone4 of production or having trial test.
So there exists an overdue loan/credit V 2.819 mil.

Chapter Four:
The Development of CIB's Administration System
At the first Industrial Loan and Credit agreement,
the World Bank requires our bank to perfect our organi-
zation and administration system; to increase our staff
members; to improve our staffs' qualities. It will
become an opening banking institution which can provide
investment loan for Chinese modernization projects in
both medium and small sized industrial sector by using
foreign funds collected through various channels.
The main targets include: before the agreement comes
into effective (1) two vice presidents would be appoint
-ed; (2) a senior economic advisor would be appointed;
(3) the tentative criteria of investing banking loan
would be established and issued; (4) the Manual On
Project Appraisal would be issued and tried out. After
the agreement comes into effective, (1) engineering and
technical advisor and other advisors would be engaged
according to the requirement; (2) staff members would
be trained according to the trainning plan of the
agreement; (3) all the sub-projects should be appraised
according to the " Manual a; (4) the "Manual on project
suppervision" will be issued on June,30,1983.
Our-bank fulfilled all the targets above under the
requirement.
I. President:
Before 1986, Mr. Zhou Hanrong, Vice Chairman of
directors of China Investment Bank and Vice President



- 36 -
of People's Construction Bank    of China (PCBC) was
the president. As one of the terms on loan effective,
Mr. Geng geng-shan, another Vice president of PCBC
and concurrently managing direCtor of CIB was appointed
as Vice president at the end of 1982; at the begining
of 1983, Mr. Zhao Hong, the former chief of administra-
tive office of CIB was appointed as the Vice president.
In 1986, a big change on our senior official had
took place. At the beginning of 1986, Mr. Geng Geng-shan
retired. A new Vice president, Mr. Wei Xigen was in
charge of the project Work. Due to increasing activity
of both our CIB and PCBC Mr. Zhou Hanrong was no longer
our concurrently Vice president. At same time, Mr. Liu
Xian-lin was appointed as our formal president according
to the suggestion from the World Bank mission. He is in
full charge of the work.
II. Organization: organization of both head office and
its branches
1. branches
Before the agreement came into effective our bank
set up three branches in Tianjin, Shanghai and Jiangsu.
After the loan became effective, the organization has
been enlarged with the increasing activity. Seven
branches had been set up by the beginning of 1984. On
the average, there are two branches were set up each
years efforts, CIB has gained a certain credit in China.
The staff members have been increased rapidly. By the
end of 1985. provicial branches have been added up from
1 in 1984 to 19. Such rapid development was mainly be-
cause our government has paid good attention to financial



- 37 -
institutions and gave important role in economic foreign
capital especially the loans from international financial
institutions one main resources to meet the requirement
of construction development.The strong support was given
by the government and concerned departments when CIB
improving its organization.
The local governments are eager for setting up
brenches by CIB in those areas in order to lend loan on
plenty of medium and small sized sub-projects in exis-
ting industrial sectors.
The rapid development of CIB branches not only exten
-ded its activity but also ncreased and trained the sta
-ff members.
Since the different management level in both old and new
branches brought the pressure to CIB head office, It was
decided to strengthen the exsting structure and improving
the management level. At same time, We also paid atten-
tion to project appraisal, supervision, and disbursement
The second development step of CIB organization was
from the end of 1987 to the beginning of 1988. During
this period, new activities had emerged as more funds
from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Interna-
tional Capital Markets.The amount of loan increased
greatly. so,
2. New provincial branches and 8 planed independent city
branches were established. The areas where the 8 planed
independent city branches are located are the cities
with advanced economic development, In those cities,
CIB carried out it work very early. Some subprojects
were completed and many sub-branches were set up. Since
1986, in order to make the economy more active and



- 38 -
fully paid an important role as a economic center,
our government greated those big cities rights for
provincial economic administration. Their economic and
social develop.ment plans are listed separatly on govern-
ment plans. In order to coordinate the country's reform
measure and increase the business in those cities, at
the end of 1987, the branches in those cities were direc
-tly administrated by CIB head office up to June, 1988,
CIB has set up 31 branches, 24 sub-branches and also set
up the organizations in most provinces, municipa lities
autonomous regions and medium-sized cities.
2. Head Office.
Before the loan became effective, CIB has 5 depart-
ments: Project department, coordination and planning
department, financial and accounting department resear-
ch department and administrative office. In 1985, more
and more sub-projects came to CIB. At that time, 283
projects were approved and supervised and we also tried
to start investing business. Under such condition,
a sepcial department should be established to supervise
and implement the projects. Based on the suggestions
from the World Bank mission,the organization was readju-
sted in September,1985. The original project department
and research office were devided into project department.
technology department and project supervision department.
The fact proves that this readjustment is good for
work division. It strengthens the work of analysis and
examination on project technology and economy. It impro-
ves the standard of project supervision and administra-
tion.
After 5 years' preperation for setting up a series



- 39 -
of systems, CIB entered into a new period of develop-
ment in all aspects. In order to meet the new demand for
development,CIB had readjusted its organization again
in June. 1987. It includes: tl) recovering the research
department so as to strength the work on policy study
and information collecting; (2) combining the department
of technology and project while setting up two project
departments No.1 project department is in charge of
machinary, chemical industry, electronics industry and
subsidary agricultural products processing sectors; No.2
project department is in charge of light industry, tex-
tile industry, food industry and packing industry. The
purpose of the,readjustment is to emphasize the close
cooperation between the staffs on engineering technology
and economic analysis when examine the projects. it
shows a clear work division which is easy for the staffs
familiar with their work collecting the latest informat-
tion in hand as soon as possible. In this way, the
appraisal and examination work could be improved.
(3)setting up a personnel education division for the
purpose of coodinating administration on the aspect of
engaging, distributing, examining promoting, rewards and
disciplinary and training. It can provide qualified
people for CIB; (4) Changing project supervision depart-
ment into credit administration which can strength the
management work of project supervision and credit.
3. The relationship between CIB head office and its
branches:
All the branches are subordinate to CIB head office



- 40 -
under the leadership of The Board of directors, CIB
plays r:role of lending, examing, supervising, coordina-
ting for its brancies. It is also in charge of connec-
ting with the World Bank and all the departments within
China; raising funds, approving projects, making credit
polity, regulation and principle.
The function of the branches is mainly in charge
of choosing and appraising projects in their areas.
When the projects are approved by head office, the
branches will supervise and implement the projects. It
includes project implementation program supervision of
loan disbursement; review and supervise for purchasing
equipments; recovering of loans, accounting and staff
management.
In 1987, 4 branches of Shanghai, Tianjing, Jiangsu
and.Hubei were selected to carry out the experiments
of delegating a certain rights of approval. Three of
which (Shanghai, Tianjing and Jiangsu)are limited to
US$ 1,500,000 for single project, Hubei US$ 1,000,000
project. The total sum will be ratified by head office
each year.
This reform not only releases the presure on head
office to review the projects, but also mobilize all
possitive factors and respossibilities of the branches.
It decreased certain unecessory formalities, shortens
the time of examination increases efficiency.
III. Staff members
The Table-8 shows that there were 50 staffs by-
the end of 1982. Along with the developing activity,



- 41 -
the number of staffs increased repidly at the last few
years.By the end of 1987. There were 975 members. On
an average, there were 215 members added each year.
perfessional staff increased repidly, too. There were
32 members at the end of 1982. By 1987, There were843.
On an average there were 162 member added-each year.The
proportion of perfessional staff to the total staff
members was increased from 64 percent.in 1987 to 86 per-
cent at the end of 1987.
Table-9 shows tha- the percentage of perfessional
staffs who specialized in economics, accounting, engi-
neering technology are stable. Mainly economics which
is obout 58% of the total. From the end of 1987 to the
beginning of 1988, accounting staffs were increased
repidly because both heal office and its branches star-
ted the new activity of international settlement. Law
staff and interpreters also increased while the total
persentage decreased which is nomal.
Although staff members increased, It is far to
meet the demands. The reason is that CIB haven't got
enoughsenior sepcialists in engineering, economy and
accounting. The qualities of some staffs are not totally
reach the standards. We easist on inviting senior
specialists, but it is not very easy to mobilize from
other departments. A few years ago, the main channel of
staff members were from Construction Bank which has a
long history and rich experiences in management and
fixed assets investment. Those high qualified staffs
played an active and important role in developing.
However, since open-door policy has been carried out,
PCBC'S business is also developed rapidly. It also



- 42 -
faces with lacking of staffs. In this case, PCBC
could no longer provide high qualified staffs for CIB.
Further more., Table-8 shows, 58 members left in 1985.
We strengthen management, ana a group of staffs were
transfered to CIB, which filled the vacancy. In 1987
another 58 people left because of the retirement is
5 percent out of total.
IV. Training.
Training has been an important program in CIB
since the personnel increases rapidly and many staffs
are not familiar with their financial activity. Before
April 1987, an official was appointed to be in charge
of training, later on, Personnel education division
was set up to do this work as well as personnel orga-
nization and administration. Table-10 shows that each
year, 30 percent out of the total staff members are
sent to be were trained both in the country and abroad.
Each staff member has been trained once or twice.
Within five years, By 1986, 97% out of total had been
trained. It takes CIB a great amount, but it is necce-
ssary for a new financial institution.
The staff training is mainly trained in China.
We had sent our staffs to the training center to attend
course sponsored by economic development institute.
Some Chinese experts were invited to conduct training
classes on appraisal, accounting, management, computer
and project supervision.some staffs were sent to have
long-term, medium term and short-term study in Univer-
sities and Banks in America and Japan, we also have the
oppotunity of tuation-free trainning abroad provided
by foreign banks. Each year ten more staffs were sent



- 43 -
there to study sometimes, some foreign experts were
sent to CIB gave lectures for our staffs. All the train
-ed people play an exellent role in their departments.
V. Development Strategy and interest rate
1. Development Strategy
The focus of CIB loan is mainly on medium and small
-sized modernization projects in state and collective
ent r.pxises. Especially to such projects which could
generate foreign exchange. The project on light indus-
try with less capital fast effective, strong ability
to repay is concentrated to invest. In 1983, 59 percent
out of the total loan was lent to Light industry.
Changes were made because of the development of activi-
ty since 1984. According to the statistics on June,30
1988 that 854 projects were approved of which 244 were
in light sectors; 209 were textile sectors (including
printing and dyeing, chemical fibre,and garment).
A little higher percentage for textile industry was
that CIB undertook a few large chemical fibre projects
and some large printing and dyeing, clothing projects
from our own financing funds in 1986.
2. Interest rate
CIB interest rate is determined based on the cost
of funds and margin. The onlending interest rate of
CIB I II were 8% annually. According to the suggestion
from World Bank mission that CIB's interest rate should
be same as the other domestical bank's. So, the in-
terest:rate of foreign currency loan was raised from
8% to 8.5% annually, and that of RMB loan was also
raised based on the concerned regulations issued by
People's Bank of China
In order to correspond to changeable interest rate



- 44 -
and currency exchange rate of the international finan-
cial market, CIB has experimented floating interest
rate on some subprojects from February 1988. This is
a proper step to increase the foreign funds sources
while enlarge CIB's activities.
VI. Project appraisal and supervision
One of the targets for the World Bank to aid China
is to introduce the appraisal method into the constrc-
tion project before decision making. As one of the
terms of making loan effective,"Appraisal Manual on
Industrial Project'. on trial was issued on March 1983.
It was written based on the experiences introduced by
the WB combining actual situation. It was also regula-
ted that all our projects must be strictly appraisal.
At first few years. loan repayment system was just
carried out, the feasibility study was just introduced.
So some departments on enterprises didn't fully under-
stand the method which deemed complication. On one
hand we explained and introduced this scientific method
to concerned departments and enterprises, Cn the other
hand, we insisted that all the projects should strictly
go through the sppraisal process to make sure that all
the subprojects are qualified. The work is hard, but
the efficiency could be raised, some time later, the
enterprises and departments no longer worry about this
appraisal mothod and the work is going on smoothly.
One year later after CIB tring to utilize appraisal
method, the concerned authorities realized that this
is a ad-anced method to select project and the benefit
for economic construction projects could be highly



- 4S -
increased. In the latter years. *The Appraisal Mannual
on Industrial project" written by CIB have been widely
spread in China. Some banks and bonstruction units have
learned a lot from this Manual put them into practise.
At the beginning there were some weak points about
market analysis and supply-demand projection. That is
the information of Market analysis was not enough and
reflects short period.So it was hand to analysis exact
trend. It was inadequate to consider factors which
would affect market. The technical analysis was genera-
lly explained without detail. In order to overcome
such weak points, and increase the appraisal quality,
CIB hold meetings of exchange experience on project
appraisal both in April,1983 and January,1984. During
this period, some senior perfessional staffs who have
rich practical experience had amend and supplimend the
Manual. At same time, some training courses were hold
to train CIB staff.
According to the suggestion from the WB, at the
time CIB 11 loan became effective,a senior economic
advisor and a technical advisor were invited. They are
in charge of examing the US$ 2 mil projects which will
submit to the WB. They should write down their opinions
and direct appraisal work.
After an effort was made, project appraisal quality
increased. Some appraisal reports were praised by the
WB experts.
In April, 1988, Senior management officials were
sent to the World Bank exchanging opinions on how to
further increase the quality of appraisal reports. At



- 46 -
present, second amendment has been done under the
suggebtion of the World Bank.
In June, 1983,. CIB made and issued.  The Regulation
of Project Supervision' project.from which day put
into pipeline to the day when pay off the principal
and interest will be managed by oyerall supervision
and implementation system. The project were managed
directly by project department. Then, the branchs imp-
lemented.
A supervision and implementation department was set
up to supervise and implement the projects. Most of
the branches followed the same procedure.
In 1986, CIB continuously focus on project super-
vision and implemeantation. The enterprises who borrow
-ed loans procured equipments at favorable price and
advanced technology through technical exchange, study
abroad and negociation such method could save,not only
the foreign exchange, but also solving the problems
during design and construction. Therefore, quickening
the pace of implementation.
1986, 116 projects were completed, which exceeded
the total project. In the past few years, best projects
selectes were appraisal reports appraised and approved
strictly. So, economic benefit could be guaranteed.
The success rate of projects is in a leading position
among the came financial institution in China.
VIII. The source of funds.
The matched RMB loan was mainly from the Ministry
of Finance. By the end of 1987, total sum of appro-
priation was RMB V 1150 million. Besides, RMB W420 mil
was borrowed from PCBC. In 1988, RMBY 100 mil was
again borrowed from Ministry of Finance. About 20



- 47 -
branches had opened up the new activity of RMB de-
posit. Some branches were trusted by local authorities
to receive the savings.
Although the history is short, the activities
developed rapidly. The following chart shows in de-
tail of foreign funds sources and the actual excutive
situation.

- 9 _
According to CIB's a charter that CIB raise foreign
funds from other channels under the permission of
chinese government. "The World Bank also suggested
again and again that CIB should follow what the other
development banks do in other countries and find
foreign loan sourcesthrough vanious channels.
In 1985, CIB started to find new channels for raising
foreign.exchange. A delegation led by Mr. Geng Gengshan
Vice President of CIB visited international financial
markets in New York, London and HongKong, They studied
in detail about method, chance and terms. They connected
with concerned Japanese banks and discussed with them
After coming back to China. At last in 1986, CIB borrowed
Japanese Yen 10 billion which equivalent to USS 65.2 mil.
It was the first time for us to lend from other channels.
Although it was half an year later than scheduled, It
was finanly making the key step.
The oriqinal plan was that CIB would borrow third
loan of US$ 300 million from The World Bank in 1986. The
third loan could only be signed and become effective in
1987. In order to prevent foreign loan source discon-
tinuous, CIB lend US$ 100 million from World Bank as
bridge" which was called the third loan. The original
third loan was changed as CIB forth which was post poned
to 1987.
1987 was the very year that CIB raised foreign funds
at most. The total amount was US$ 440 million.
In January,1987, CIB IV was signed total US$ 300 mil.
The first loan from Asian Development Bank was signed
with US$ 100 million. Besides, CIB borrowed long and



- 50 -
midium-term loan according to quota permited by
Chinese government. CIB foreign loan sources have
been developed stedily towards various channels.
IX. Accounting and payment
In January, 198i, CIB issued
the book of "Accounting system of China Investment Bank"
Which was written based on Westen accounting theory and
World Bank's suggestion
At the beginning of the first few years after es-
tablishment, the disbursement speed was slow. By the end
of 1984. foreign loan was disbursed only US$ 21.9 mil.
Although exceeding the disbursement plan, it was a bit
of slow than general-were carried out since 1985:
The following measures (1) organizing exgerienced
accountant to work,out a set of the method to streng-
then capital management; (2) strengthen and enlarging
the financial accounting department; (3) strengthening
capital transfering between CIB and its branches to
make all branches to pay attention on financial accoun-
ting and speeding up disbursement; (4) making close
relationship between CIB and enterprises and foreign
trade companies. Various measures were utilized to spur
them to use loars on time.
After this period of hard work, CIB received a succe-
ssful result. In 1986, the total actual payment of
foreign loans was wore than 200 million, which exceeded
the total payment in last few years.
The officials from the Accounting Bureau of WB are
satisfied with disbursement progress.

Chapter 5. The Status of Activity and
Financial Situation of CIB
I. Activity Situation
1. The overall acitivity
From 1983 to 1986, investment loan was the main
business of CIB. But in 1985 we run three £uns of inves-
tment, with US$ 1.29 miL and RMB V 2 mil. Since 1987,
with the supports of concerned departments, CIB has
made gfeat progress in the aspect of providing varie-
ties of services. Now, with the approval of the depart-
ments concerned, CIB could handle not only loan busi-
ness, but also start another 14 kinds of activities,
such as dealing with foreign exchange deposit, issuing
or as an ageat issuing securities in foreign countries;
settling accounts on importing and exporting; exchanging
foreign currency and foreign currency notes; buying and
selling spot and forward foreign exchange; providing
foreign exchange guarantee; running international finan-
cial leasing and trusting , In order to support joint
venture enterprises, we have also tried to lend loan or
investment to Chinese partners. In 1988, CIB head office
and its branches in Tianjin, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Shen-
zhen opened their business on international settlement,
and experimented on short-term turnover loan. And handl-
ing various entrust loans trusted by departments or
local governemnt sectors. All these business perfect
CIB in banking function. It created a better environ-
ment for CIB's development toward a multifunctional bank.
2. loan business
The table-8 indicates CIB's loan situation from 1983
to 1987. During the five years, takiog the advantage
..                                    r~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



- 52 -
of increasing capital sources and the rapid development
of the state economy, the loan business of our bank has
increased year by year        ;. Up to the end of 1987,
the accumulative total approved loan was US$ 913 mil.
and RMB V 1479 mil. The loan commitment, disbursement,
and repayment are in a good condition.The detailed state-
ment is as follows:
(l). The status of loan approvement: Except 1983, the
actual approved amount each year was roughly the same
with the amount planned. The Five-year average ratio
between foreign exchange and RMB was approaximately 1:1.5.
From the indivitual phase, during 1983-1984, an amount
of V400 miL wa's allocated by the Ministry of Finance and
two sums of loan were borrowed, totaling V720 miL from
the Construction Bank.So,RMB loan was relatively rich.
At the Same period, we only had CIB I and CIB II from
the World Bank. which totaled US$ 245 mil. During that
time, the ratio between matched RMB and foreign exchange
was somewhat higher than usual in order to fully uti-
lize the funds. During 1985 to 1987, as foreign exchange
sources increased and ralatively lack of RMBH,the propor-
tion of RMB was relatively less than that of foreign
exchange, From 1985 to 1987. US$ 1 could only be allo-
cated with V 1.5, while in 1987 US$ 1 could actually be
allocated with only V1.4. Besides, between 1985 to 1986.
the total amount of approved RMB loan was less than the
amount of planned.
(2). Commitment and disbursement: Except 1983, the actual
approved loan was roughly the sadme as planned or a little.
higher than planned in the other four years. what should
be specifically mentioned is that in 1983 and 1984, the



- 53 -
loan disbursement was somewhat slow. In 1985, we rein-
forced the disbursement work , and at same time, dis-
bursement plan was adjusted. Thus such work was cer-
tainly promoted. All the actual amount of disbursement
in the later years exceeded the plan.
(3) Loan recovery: The loan recovery began in 1984.
Since majority of the projects gained good economic
benefit, repayment plan was consequently well imple-
mented. On the whole, there was no overdue up to now.
During four years of 1984 to 1987. the accumulative
total amount of recovery was RMB V 132.9 million and
US$ 124.4 million, respectively reached 157% and 134%
of the plan. Except 1986, the annual loan recovery plan
was exceeded.
3. Equity and guarantee
Equity covered a rather small proportion of the
whole business. Up to the end of 1987, there were three
projects that had been invested. In 1985, together with
the Chinese Technology Import and Export Corporation
and the Japanese Mitsui Trade Limited Corporation, we
invested US$ 990.000 on establishing the Shanghai Inter-
national leasing and Trusting Limited Corporation, tak-
ing 32% stocks of the Corporation. The International
Leasing and Trusting Limited Corporation is a joint ven-
turettenterprise which combines finance and trade business.
It carries out financial leasing to domestic industrial
enterprises. For these several years, the corporation
has been running quite well. In 1986, our bank shared a
profit of US$ 99,000. And in 1987, we shared US$ 198,000.
Besides, we invested RZB V 1 million in Anhui Hotel pro-
ject in 1985; We also invested RME iV 1 million and US$
300,000 in Hebei Easten Carpet Corporation. The Anhui



-54-
Hotel had been completed and put into business. Its
business is running well. The Easten Carpet Corpor&tion
had been put into production since 1986, which gained
a good economic benefit. The profit proportion we had
shared was a little bit higher than we were invested.
In 1987, On the basis of thoroughly investigating,
fixing on its benefit,and reviewing the ability of pay
back loan, CIB Shanghai branch was getting permitted
by CIB head office to issue a US$ 10 million-guarrantee
certification for Shanghai Dazhonghua Rubber Factory.
4. The classification of Foreign Exchange Loan Projects
The classification of the approved projects from
1983 to June 30.1986 is indicated in table-12.
(1) Sector distribution of loans: Light and textile
industry have always been the important sector of CIB,
Up to June 30,1986, 244 light industry project had app-
roved with total amount of USS 271 mil.which was 25.06%
of the total foreign exchange loans. 209 projects were
textile industry with total amount of US$ 337 mil.which
was 31.19% of the total foreign exchange loans. (In our
country, textile industry includes silk manufacturing,
linen manufacturing, printing and dyeing, chemical fibre
and clothing. The projects of above subsector constitute
the great majority of the textile industry.) From 1985,
the lending field was gradually expanded. Especially
from the second half of 1987, CIB had increased amount
of loans to other sectors except light and textile in.4,
dustry. Other subsectors which had relatively more funds
are: electronics industry, to which a total amount of
USS 102 mil which was 9.4% of the total foreign exchange
loan;



- 55 -
3. It is necessary to indicate of bad debt provision.
The World Bank required that bad debt provision should
be 5% of the loan balance after 1i85. In fact, It was
only 4% in 1985 and 1986. During appraisal period of
CIB IV, officials from the WB proposed that the propor-
tion of 4% was too lower. They asked to increase the
bad debt provision from 1987 and try to reach 2% of the
loan balance by 1990. As the Ministry of Finance regu-
lated that the rate of bad debt provision of fixed assets
loan draw by banks shouldn't exceed 0.02%. We had sub-
mitted the report to Ministry of Finance on increasing
the proportion. Now, the report is under discussion.
CIB has at recent two years onlent not only medium-long
term investment, but also gradually opens the new busi-
ness of onlending the medium-short term working capital
and temporary revolving funds. It could increasing uti-
lization rate and enlarging the service scope.
4 Profit
The performanee of our bank from 1983 to June.1988
is shown on table-14. Owing to development of operation,
especially increasing loan amount, the business revenue
and profit had increased doubled and redoubled. The
various earning in 1983 was only Y 7,770,000 and profit
was V 5.14 mil. but revenue had reached f225.05 mil by
1987. The profit before tax was V 94.33 mil. The pro-
portion of interest revenue in gross income increased
from 16.47% in 1983 to 86.59%in 1987.
It is normal that various expenditures increased
rapidly as business developed and organization enlarged.

Chapter 6 Conelusion
In summary, our bank has obtained excellent achie-
vement dusing implementation of CIB I. We have establi-
shed the network of branches, employed more staffs,
improved the quality of employees after intensive train-
ing, diversified the resources of funds, and the opera-
ting scope has been extended gradually. After making
great effort, our bank has become a development bank
which can perform scientific appraisal and management
methods for projects. CIB plays important role in moder-
nization. At same time, we have gained a certain repu-
tation on demostic and international institutions.
In the past few years we have achieved great suceess,
meanwhile, The development of our operation just started
at initial phase, many new business, such as finds rai-
sed from various resources, investment, credit gurran-
tee, are under experiment. We should try our best to
expand service range of finance, obtain funds from mul-
ti plied channels, continue training and advertizing
qualified staff, to carry out the development strate-
gies of our bank, and to make more contribution to the
socializedconstruction of our country.
(1) Machinery industry got USS 89.63 mil. which makes
up 8.28% or so; the service industry was getting US$_
50.52 mil, Which makes up 4.67% or so.
(2) Nature of projects: The aims of CIB are mainly to
technical transformation projects which conforms to
the current situation of our country. In recent several



- 57 -
years, the loan of technique transformation has been
provided accumlatively, it's volume totals US$ 770 miL
which makes up 71.16% of the total loan of foreign ex-
change in our bank.
(3) Structure of loan scale: In recent several years,
the loan of our bank aims at the projects of middle and
small scale, the scale of loan averages USS 1.267 mil
project. Of all the 854 loan projects, 553 were below
US$ 1 mil project which made up 62% of the total. Only
two projects were abofe USS 10 mil, the largest project
was the Ping Ding Shan Cord Fabric Factory in Henan
Province. This factory had utilized Japaness Yen 10
billion in 1986 to produces polyamide fibre Cord fabric
subsituting product for the loan in order to save the
foreign exchange. This project is one of major projects
during "6.5 national plan* and has been guaranteed to
return the foreign exchange on time by the ;Plqnning
committee of Henan province. This project was put into
production in 1987 with good economic benefit and the
loan recovery has begun in 1988.
£4) Maturity of loan: In order to increase the social
benefit, quicken the loan revolving and minimize the
risk, Our bank aims mainly at medium and short term loans.
606 projects were onlent at maturity of 3-10 years with
total amount of US$ 940 mil.which, made up 86.8% of
total sum of loan.
(5) Structure of ownership: Th6 main object of CIB
loan is to state-ownership enterprises. 779 project
were approved with total amount of US$ 1036 mil.which
made up 95.74% of the total.64 project from collective
ownership enterprises                with total amount



- 58 -
of US$ 30.04 mAl, which made up 2.78%. Since 1987,CIB
began to provide investment and equity capital to
Chinese partners. 11 projects-had approved with total
amount of USS 16.C507 miL which made up 1.48% of the
total until.130 June.1988.
II Situation of financial affairs
1. 1983-30,June,1988, The balance sheet of our Bank can
be seen in table-10. As a development Bank the volume
of asset has been growing rapidly since CIB established.
The Asset amount in 1983 totaled only RMB V 556.04 mil.
and had reached V3830.14 mil.until 1987. Especially,the
loan of investment grown more rapidly, it totaled only
V39.80 mil.which made up 7.16% of total assets, but it
had grown up to V 2794.32 mil until 1987 which made up
72.96% of total assets.
2. Owing to support of long-term loan by the WB, the
volume of assets of our Bank has been growing rppidly.
It's a stable resource of foreign funds for CIB. As
saving depQsits, it didn't begin until recent year and
the Yolume of which made up a small proportion of the
total       . The Ministry of Finance appropriated paid-
in capital of V1150 mil.according to the development of
CIB business. So, CIB could be well matched and has a
strong ability to pay off its debts. From 1983 to 1987,
the ratio of capital to total assets is never below
1:3.

Comments: The appraisal report had no breakdown of the estimated project
cost and financing plans. The above figures were derived assuming that the
World Bank funds will fund only the foreign exchange costs equivalent to
about 65% of the total subproject cost; the local cost would be financed by
CIB and/or other banks but mainly by the borrowing enterprises' internally
generated funds. The actual figures are based on CIB's data covering most of
the actual costs of the subprojects as of the end of Jt.ne 30, 1988.
