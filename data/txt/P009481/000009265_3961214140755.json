Some lessons learned\n            included: land acquisition compensations should be fair and\n            based on market studies of prevailing land values and the\n            land acquisition system itself ought to be carefully planned\n            and the bureaucratic process should be initiated before\n            project appraisal or negotiations. Detailed designs of key\n            works should be undertaken before appraisal. FCD projects\n            need to be carefully planned taking due note of possible\n            environmental consequences (such as reduced fish production\n            and higher flood water elsewhere) and be designed to include\n            specific measures to mitigate them.
