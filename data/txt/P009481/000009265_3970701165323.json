Project.  To this end, the\n            project provides for (i) facilities for flood control and\n            improving drainage; (ii) improving BWDB's institutional\n            capability; (iii) strengthening MOI's existing\n            capability for managing independent monitoring and\n            evaluation and (iv) studies and surveys.  The proposed\n            project will promote increased agricultural production and\n            will help to alleviate rural poverty through increased\n            income for owners-cultivators and the creation of employment\n            opportunities for the landless."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
