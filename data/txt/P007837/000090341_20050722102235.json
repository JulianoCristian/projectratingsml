Lessons\n            learned: Although Panama is a country with considerable\n            human resource capacity in both public and private sectors,\n            but Government processes are often bureaucratic, involve\n            multiple layers of control, resulting in slow\n            implementation. The operation was very much designed as a\n            project instead of a more programmatic operation to\n            strengthening the Social Investment Fund (FIS) overall. From\n            the outset, the Bank was aware of the relatively weak\n            management of FIS, and tried to support it through studies\n            and other technical assistance. Despite major investment in\n            improving the existing MIS, the system was not able to\n            operate as expected. Under the education project, there was\n            an explicit agreement with the Ministry of Education that\n            FIS would implement the infrastructure construction program,\n            based on their targeting formula. Although Panama has a\n            well-developed commercial banking system, this does not\n            automatically mean expertise in micro-credit. It took longer\n            than projected to design the operational manual and action\n            plan to implement this important component."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
