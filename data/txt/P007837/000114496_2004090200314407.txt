Dear Mr. Minister 
Please refer to the Loan Agreement for the Social Investment Fund Project 
between the Republic of  Panamá (the Borrower) and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), dated August 7, 1997, as amended (the 
Agreement).
The Bank has received your letters dated July 27, 2000 requesting a reallocation 
of the amounts under the Loan, as well as an increase in the percentages of certain 
categories of expenditures to be financed under the Agreement, and December 20, 1999 
informing the Bank of the change of name of the Fondo de Emergencia Social (the 
Project implementation entity) for Fondo de Inversion Social.  We are pleased to 
inform you that the Bank agrees with your request and accordingly, agrees to amend the 
Agreement as follows:
1.
Section 1.02 (e) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and replaced in its 
entirely to read as follows:
"(e) 'FIS' means 'Fondo de Inversión Social', the Borrower’s Social 
Investment Fund, established by the Borrower’s Executive Decree No. 189 of 
November 15, 1999;"
2.
The term "FES" wherever it appears in the Loan Agreement, is hereby replaced by 
the term "FIS".
3.
A new paragraph (aa) is added after paragraph (z) of  Section 1.02 (b) of the 
Loan Agreement which shall read as follows:
"(aa) 'Rural Electrification Subproject' means a specific project to 
be financed with part of the proceeds of the Loan for the provision of 
electricity services, including, inter alia, services for unserved rural  customers 
through line extensions and isolated centralized systems for 
individual 
power supply, such as solar photovoltaic systems";
4.
A new activity is hereby added to Part A of Schedule 2 to read as follows:
"Part A: Social and Economic Infrastructure
3.
Execution of Rural Electrification Subprojects."
5.
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement is revised to read a set 
forth in the Attachment to this Amendment-Letter.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating 
this letter in the spaces provided below.  This Amendment-Letter may be executed in 
two counterparts, each of which shall be an original.  Upon your confirmation, please 
return one fully executed original to us. 
Upon receipt by the Bank of one fully executed original of this
