        Colombia will provide comprehensive assistance in several\n            mutually supporting fields to about 550,000 people, mostly\n            among the poorest 30 percent of the population, in 27 zones\n            in 23 selected towns, in order to improve their living\n            standards and productivity. The assistance would include\n            construction of community development centers, extensions of\n            primary education to about 95 percent of the eligible\n            population, health and nutrition services, promotion of\n            community enterprises and credit, regularization of land\n            tenure, home improvement, sites and services, and water\n            supply and sewerage. Achievement of the project's\n            benefit will depend upon the coordination of the agencies\n            charged with carrying out the project. The coordination\n            mechanisms devised at local and national levels, the\n            Government's strong commitment to social programs to\n            assist the poor and the monitoring system proposed in the\n            project should ensure that coordination will indeed be effective."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
