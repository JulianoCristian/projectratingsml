comprehensive\n            assistance in several mutually supporting fields to about\n            550,000 people, mostly among the poorest 30% of the\n            population, in 27 zones in 23 selected towns, in order to\n            improve their living standards and productivity. The\n            assistance would include construction of community\n            development centers, extensions of primary education to\n            about 95% of the eligible population, health and nutrition\n            services, promotion of community enterprises and credit,\n            regularization of land tenure, home improvement, sites and\n            services, and water supply and sewerage. Achievement of the\n            project's benefit will depend upon the coordination of\n            the agencies charged with carrying out the project. The\n            coodination mechanisms devised at local and national levels,\n            the Government's strong commitment to social programs\n            to assist the poor and the monitoring system proposed in the\n            project should ensure that coordination will indeed be effective."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
