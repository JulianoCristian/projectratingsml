ISAC-II supported a wide\n            range of reforms in three areas: (1) Import liberalization\n            to reduce and rationalize effective protection and also to\n            streamline import procedures; (2) Export Promotion through:\n            (i) improved coverage and operation of the duty drawback and\n            bonding programs to provide direct and indirect exporters\n            with world priced inputs; and (ii) a more strategic approach\n            to other aspects of export promotion utilizing a\n            strengthened Export Promotion Bureau, matching grants, and\n            deregulation. Three main lessons were learned to reduce the\n            risk of partial failure in support for complex reform\n            programs :( 1) Adequate allowance should be made for the\n            ability of an unconvinced and/or technically weak\n            bureaucracy to thwart essential institutional aspects of\n            policy reform; ( 2) Projects which involve reform in several\n            areas at once need commitment from all concerned Ministers,\n            with collective responsibility and/or strong leadership.( 3)\n            A Comprehensive reform agenda should be supported by several\n            operations and non-lending instruments, either in series or parallel."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
