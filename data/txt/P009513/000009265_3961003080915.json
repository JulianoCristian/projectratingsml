export-oriented private\n            sector-led development of the industrial sector. They\n            include import liberalization, strengthening of institutions\n            involved with export promotion and reforms aimed at\n            transforming the regulatory stance of the Government towards\n            private sector development to a promotional one. The reform\n            program will: (1) increase Bangladesh's competitiveness\n            and potential for labor-intensive growth; (2) increase\n            producers' ability to respond quickly to changing\n            market conditions while reducing opportunities for\n            unproductive rent seeking; and (3) enhance the\n            Government's capacity for efficient performance in\n            policy making and delivering services to export and other\n            private producers. Its comprehensiveness is intended to\n            facilitate a good supply response to the trade policy reforms."}, "docdt": "1992-10-02T00:00:00Z"}
