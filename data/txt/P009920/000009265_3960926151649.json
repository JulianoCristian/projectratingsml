To achieve these aims the project will indclude\n            the following components; the construction of a 330MW\n            hydropower station near Srinagar, including a gravity dam,\n            intake structures, sedimentation basin, and an outdoor\n            powerhouse with six 55MW generating units and associated\n            infrastructure and auxiliaries.  Associated with this will\n            be resettlement, rehabilitation and compensatory\n            afforestation.  Also finance will be the rehabilitation of\n            the Harduaganj thermal station and the reinforcement of the\n            coal handling system at the 1000 MW Obra 'B' power\n            station.  350 km of single circuit 400kv lines will be\n            constructed along with 80 km of single circuit 220 kv line\n            and associated substations and telecommunication facilities.\n            Also, energy meters and maximum load indicators will be\n            installed on 33 kv and 11 kv feeder lines.  Finally,\n            consulting services and training will be provided for the\n            execution of the project, and for improvement of the\n            organization and performance, of the utility."}, "docdt": "1988-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
