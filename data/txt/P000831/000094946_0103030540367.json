Lessons convey the following. Although the\n            Bank, by and large, favored stand alone operations with\n            limited financing for environmental capacity building, such\n            as this one, given the usually weak in-country base, it is\n            now suggested that it would be more appropriate to start\n            with a larger operation, to be extended over a longer period\n            of time. Thus, an adaptable program loan seems a more\n            appropriate lending instrument. Despite donor\n            community's awareness on the importance of Government\n            ownership, it should be recognized that national\n            institutions may not always have, neither the capacity, nor\n            perhaps the interest to ensure effective donor coordination\n            when faced with the realities of implementation, which can\n            lead to inefficient allocation of human resources, and\n            funds, as different donor initiatives compete for attention.\n            Capacity building operations should assess training needs\n            early on, based on manpower development plans prepared by\n            experts, for while workshops provide the means for\n            information dissemination, they only have marginal value as\n            a means of training, and strengthening capacity. And,\n            implementation capacity should be based on strong\n            administrative systems, with carefully appraised management capacity."}, "docdt": "2001-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
