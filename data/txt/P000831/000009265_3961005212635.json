The development of\n            management and technical skills in NEA and the provision of\n            associated training in environmental management for staff of\n            sector agencies and private sector operators, through\n            short-term practical attachments or workshops; (b) GEAP\n            monitoring and policy development, to reorient the existing\n            sectoral policies and develop new policies where necessary,\n            in accordance with the overall environmental policies\n            elaborated in the GEAP; (c) environmental education and\n            public awareness, to support the development of a strategy\n            to increase public awareness of environmental issues and\n            support for electronic and print media campaigns, using\n            existing government and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)\n            skills and capacities. The last three components include:\n            (d) monitoring of environmental quality, to support the\n            development of a system to collect information and monitor\n            environmental quality against agreed threshold levels; (e)\n            environmental information management, to finance the\n            development and implementation of an environmental\n            information strategy according to a distributed model\n            including: (i) the design of a common information\n            architecture to establish coherence and compatibility; (ii)\n            the establishment of basic information infrastructure; (iii)\n            the maintenance of key data sets; and (iv) analytical\n            capabilities; and (f) contingency planning and disaster\n            preparedness, to develop a disaster awareness and\n            contingency planning system."}, "docdt": "1994-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
