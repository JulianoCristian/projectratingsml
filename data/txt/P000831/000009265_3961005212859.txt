MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
FOR A CAPACITY BUILDING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
I.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of The Gambia for SDR 1.9 million, the equivalent of US$2.6
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years which is fully consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and would help finance a technical assistance project for
capacity building for environmental management. The Gesellschaft fur Tecbri.ische
Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) will contibute US$1.3 million equivalent in parallel cofinancing.
2.    Country Economic Background. The first teu years of independence saw broadly stable
macroeconomic conditions, with modest rates of economic growth. But from 1970 until 1985-86,
the economic and financial performance of The Gvambia deteriorated markedly, as a result of
external shocks and inappropriate domestic policies. In response to the deepening crisis
compounded by the suspension of external aid and the loss of creditworffiiness, the Government of
The Gambia adopted in mid-1985 a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilization and adjustment
program: the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) covering 1985-90 period. Under the ERP, four
factors contributed to The Gambia's economic and financial performance improvement: (a) firm
determination by the Government to implement the program; (b) close monitoring by, and frank
dialogue with, IDA and the International Monetary Fund; (c) a large influx of external aid; and (d)
improved weather conditions. Building on the success of the ERP, the Government launched the
Program for Sustained Development (PSD) in 1990, which is still in effect. The PSD aims at
reinforcing policy reforms and at promoting private sector growth by diversifying the economy.
Real GDP growth in 1991-92 is esimated at 4% due to quick recovery in trade and tourism,
despite a slow recovery in agricultural production. The inflation rate was cut to about 4% in 1992,
from about 70% in 1985. These results are impressive, but they remain fragile and need to be
sustained.
3.    Country Assistance Strategy. The CAS statement, reviewed by the Board on January 12,
1993, contains a full discussion of recent economic developments and IDA's assistance program.
One factor explaining the success of The Gambia's assistance strategy has been the close
monitoring and frank dialogue with IDA conducted at the highest level, and now squarely focused
on the long-term issues. The project is fully consistent with IDA!s strategy for The Gambia, which
stresses the need to strengthen the institutional framework for enviromnental management and the
implementation of the Gambia Enviromnental Action Plan (GEAP).
4.    Sector Background The Gambia, with a total land area of about 10,700 kni2, occupies a
narrow strip of land along the banks of the Gambia River and is surrounded on three sides by
Senegal. It has a population of about I million growing at 4.1% per annum, an illiteracy rate of
73%/o, primary school enrollment of 61%, and an infant mortality rate of 136 per 1000 (1990).
Agriculture represents 25% of GDP and uses about two-thirds of the labor force. Limited natural
resources and an undeveloped human capital base have constrained the diversification of the
economy and its growth. In addition, the expanding human (3.4%) and animal population are
steadily increasing pressure on fragile natural resources. A high population density on agricultural



2
land (207 inhabitants per kn2 in 1991' is reaching the limits of sustainability and raising
environmental issues.
S.    The deterioration of the environment is a critical long-term development constraint. In
rural areas, natural resources are threatened by increasing population pressures, overgrazing, salt
intrusion along the Gambia River, and inadequate groundwater management. In addition to the
threat to rural resources, there is also a threat to the clean groundwater supply in the Greater
Banjul Area (GBA) as a result of its proximity to the ocean, growing demand for water, and a
shallow water table, not to mention the unsanitary living conditions of most of the urban
population. As a key element of a comprehensive approach to arrest the deterioration of the
environment, the Governent has been using its existing resources more carefully through the
introduction of improved resource management practices. In this context, the Govermment hosted a
workshop on Environmental Protection and Resources Management in July 1988 and a
Consultative Technical Workshop in February 1991.
6.    The Gambia Environmental Action Plan. Based on the recommendations of these
workshops, the Government prepared the GEAP with UNDP's assistance, and presented it at the
United Nations Enviroment Conference in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 and subsequently to a
donors' meeting in Banjul in January 1993. The GEAP was prepared as part of the structural
adjustment program, and provides a framework guiding the development of sound environmental
planning and management practices. Its preparation was predominantly a Gambian effort, and is
exemplary in having achieved broad Govenmnent ownership and commitment to its goals. This
commitment has now been confirmed by the Govermment's recent creation of an autonomous
environment agency as a focal poiiit for environmental management.
7.    The two major environmental issues identified in thSGEAP are: (a) depletion and
degradation of the natural resource base; and (b) poor environmental sanitation in the GBA and
other growth centers. Contributing to the severity of environmental problems are such factors as
rapid population growth, urban drift, spiraling poverty, prolonged and repeated droughts,
inappropriate production and land tenure systems and a paucity of renewable energy sources.
Based on tIus assessment, seven policy objectives, which form the underlying assumption for the
GEAP framework and programs, were defined. They are: (a) to conserve and promote rational
natural resource use; (b) to protect and improve the health and quality of life of citizens through
sound environmental management; (c) to restore and preserve the equilibrium of the ecological
processes; (d) to strengthen the institutional framework for envirornental management and
coordination at all levels; (e) to increase environmental awareness and public understanding; (f) to
ensure the integration of environmental considerations in the entire development process; and (g) to
accelerate research and adoption of alternative sources of renewable energy.
8.    Coordination and Monitoring of the GEAP. The GEAP was prepared under the
guidance of the Environment Unit of the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). One of the major
policy objectives resulting from the process is the need to strengthen the institutional framework for
environmental coordination and management at the national, regional and global levels. The
GEAP recommended the revision of the institutional framework to improve inter-agency
collaboration and overall coordination of public sector entities whose responsibilities have an
inpact on the environment. Based on these recommendations, Government has upgraded the
Enviromnent Unit of the MNR to an independent agency under the Office of the President, the
National Environment Agency (NEA), and charged it with monitoring and coordinating the
implementation of the GEAP, with supporting environmental policy formulation and with



3
monitoring compliance with environmental regulatory codes. This decision is indicative of the
Government's serious commitment to both following the recommendations of the GEAP and
ensuring that the proper institutional and legal structures for efficient environmental planning are in
place. This project will provide direct suppoit for the Govenmment's efforts to achieve these
objectives.
9.    Project Objectives. The project's primary objective would be to establish the capacity
within the NEA and other relevant agencies to develop and guide an effective system for
environmental planning and management in The Gambia and to ensure that environmental concerns
are fully integrated and reflected in the social and economic development process in The Gambia.
Consequently, the project would focus on developing the institutional infirastructure and on
strengthening the capacity of associated human resources required to ensure that this objective is
achieved and that the policy and program objectives of the GEAP are realized.
10.   Project Description. The project consists of six major components: (a) institutional
support for coordination of GEAP implementation to support the NEA to deve!op its operational
capacity by financing equipment, training and targeted technical assistance, to develop
management and technical skills in NEA, and the provision of associated training in environmental
management for staff of sector agencies and private sector operators, through short-term practical
attachments or workshops; (b) GEAP monitoring and policy development, to reorient the existng
sectoral policies and develop new policies where necessa4y, in accordance with the overall
environmental policies elaborated in the GEAP; (c) environmental education and public awareness,
to support the development of a strategy to increase public awareness of environmental issues and
support for electronic and print media campaigns, using existing govermnent and non-
govermental organization (NGO) skills and capacities; (d) monitoring of environmental auality, to
support the development of a system to collect information and monitor environmental quality
against agreed threshold levels; (e) environmental information management, to finance the
development and implementation of an environmental information strategy according to a
distributed model including (i) the design of a common information architecture to establish
coherence and compatibility; (ii) the establishment of basic information infriastructures; (iii) the
maintenance of key data sets; and (iv) analytical capabilities; and (f) contingency planmng and
disaster preparedness to develop a disaster awareness and contingency planning system.
In addition, the Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) will finance the
following four components: (a) development and implemeation of environmental legislation and
legal reform; (b) development of procedures, guidelines, and operational systems for
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs); (c) establishment of a documentation center; and (d)
support for dissemina  of environental information in te form of a newsletter.
11.   Project Financing. The proposed financing plan includes an IDA credit of US$2.6 million
which will finance 81% of project costs excluding paraLel financing, or 58% with parallel
cofinancing, net of duties and taxes. Government will contribute approximately US$600,000
equivalent by covering the incremental operating expenss of the NEA. Parallel cofinancing with
the GTZ totalling DM2.1 million (US$ 1.3 million equivalent), amounting to 29% of the total
program cost, is in the process of being reviewed as a result of a separate project appraisal.
12.   Project Implementation. The project will be implemented over a three-year period. The
NEA is the implementing agency for the project. However, the inter-sectoral nature of many
environmental concems, and the diverse information required for effective management mean that



4
many other agencies must be involved including the MNR, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry for
Local Government and Lands, Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Ministry of Trade, Industry
and Employment, as well as NGOs. The NEA would play a key role in coordinating the
involvement of these agencics. Intor-sectoral working groups would be set up around specific
topics (education, information, policy development) in order to simplify projcct management and
enhance linkages.
13.   Project Sustainabilty. The fact that the GEAP process was so visible in the country and
that it culminated in the creation of an independent agency reporting to the Office of the President
bodes well for the importnce attached to the management and coordination of environmental
matters by The Gambian authorities. By focusing on institutional capacity development, especially
in the NEA, the project would ensure the agency develops the capacity to make this a sustainable
role for the NEA. By ensuring the NEA's role is also clearly defined in the National Environment
Management Act (NEMA), the agency will have the necessary legal authority and stature to carry
out its mandate. The Government has demonstrated its strong commitment to NEA's mandate by
agreeing to a three-year staffing plan (which includes additional positions) and the upg,rading of all
positions to salary levels which are higher than the civil service's albeit within the public service
scale.
14.   Lessons Learnedfrom Previous IDA Involvement. IDA's assistance strategy for
environmental matters in The Gambia is based on a continuing dialogue with Govermnent and on
lessons from previous operations in The Gambia as well as in other countries in the region where
national environmental action plans (NEAP) have been prepared. Although there has been no
Bank Group lending in The Gambia for enviromnental operations, much of the prior IDA lending
for sector operations (agriculture, urban infrastructure) has had a direct impact on the
environment. Experience with other lending operations and other Bank Group support for the
NEAP process indicates the need to develop strong institutional and legal franeworks for
environmental planning in order to guide any subsequent policv formulation and project
development activities.
15.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA has been supportive of The Gamnbia's efforts to
develop an NEAP. In this particular case, the Government has caried out the process admirably;
they should now receive strong support in their efforts to turn the recommendations of the GEAP
into reality. The proposed project is fully consistent with IDA's strategy for The Gambia and fits
IDA's strategy to promote sustainable economic growth in the Sahelian countries through better
planning, management and use of renewable natural resources and through the integration of
environmental considerations into the economic development process. The proposed project will
support the establishment of enabling policies, legislation and institutions to facilitate the context
which will maximize the chances of tie sectoral projects achieving their objectives. It is
complemented by four other IDA-supported projects which are consistent with and supportive of
the GEAP: the Agricultural Services Project (Cr. 2353-GM), a proposed health and population
project (FY96), the recewtly approved Public Works and Capacity Building Project (Cr. 2554-GM)
and the proposed urban enviromnent project (FY95).
16.   Agreed Actions. The following events took place priorto or during the appraisal mission:
(a) Govemment created the NEA in July 1993; (b) agreement on an indicative human resources
development plan for the three-year period of the project; (c) agreemnent on a tentative schedule of
consultant recruitment together with the timing of tleir inputs; (d) agreement on Government
counterpart fimuing covering all incremental operating costs for NEA during the three years of



5
project life; (e) agreement on the conditionality to be attached to the main activities carried out with
GTZ financing; and (f) project monitoring indicators. The following events took place prior to
negotiations: (a) official appointment of the Agency Director; (b) the finalization of a human
resources maagement plan, a manual of procedures and a detailed first-year work plan for the
NEA; (c) the appointment of, and signing of a contract with, an accounting firm acceptable to IDA
to set up the NEA's accounting system; and (d) the preparation of terms of reference and short list
for an external auditor acceptable to IDA. The following are conditions of effectiveness: (a)
signature of the grant agreement with GTZ by Government; (b) the NEA's designation of required
staff members for each of the project components; (c) establishment of working groups for
environmental education and environmental information; (d) the appointment of, and s igning of a
contract with, external auditors acceptable to IDA to carry out semi-annual audits; and (e) the
setting up of an operational accounting system. The following assurances are reflected in the legal
documents: (a) NEMA revisions will be shared with IDA for re-view and comment; (b) NEA will
submit to IDA for review and comment an updated human resources management plan, annual
workplan, annual consultant recruitment schedule and draft terms of reference for the second and
third years of the project during the fourth quarter of the proceeding year; (c) Government will put
in place EIA procedures that are acceptable to IDA, no later than 18 months after credit
effectiveness; (d) at all times during project implementation, the Agency Dirxtor will be
acceptable to IDA, and the Agency will be operated in an efficient manner; (e) at all times during
project implementation NEA will be fully staffed with competent personnel and will have adequate
budgetary provisions to cover staff costs; (f) results of ElAs, environmental monitoring and data
held in the EIS will be made available to the public at large; (g) the Government will: (i) submit
within three months of project effectiveness, strategies and action plans for environmental
education and an environmental information system; (ii) submit within one year, a strategy for
environmental monitoring and contingency planning (including one draft plan), as well as establish
the Inspectorate, define its status and its operating procedures; and (h) in anticipation of the mid-
term review, which would take place no later than 18 months after project effectiveness, NEA
would prepare a mid-term project report to be distributed to all participants (IDA, GTZ, and other
Government agencies) one month prior to the start of the review. The review would focus
particularly on progress in capacity building and staff development, as well as the functionality and
efficiency of the environmental management systems bcing put into place.
17.   Environmental Aspects. As this is a technical assistance project, its environmental
category is "C". In the long-term, the project will increase The Gambia's capacity to manage
environmental issues, so the project's direct impact will be positive.
18.   Program Objective Categories. The project's objective categories emphasize the
environmental and natural resource management, and human resource development ii1 the area of
environmental management capacity. The project's environmental education component will
increase public awareness of environmental issues and promote public participation in
environmental management.
19.   Project Benefits. The project would support Government's strategy for the sustainable use
of the environment, as set out in the GEAP and would assist with the implementation of important
aspects of the GEAP. The Gambia is one of the first countries to have completed an NEAP and is
one in which government ownership of the process is very strong. Govermnent commitment to
integrating enviromnental issues to the development planning process is reflected in the decision to
create this new agency and place it under the auspices of the Office of the President. IDA has
strongly supported countries' efforts to prepare and implement NEAPs; The Gambia's NEAP



6
process can serve as a model to other African countries involved in similar planning processes.
The project actions will ensure that the proper institutional, legislative and functional frameworks
are in place to address the critica! environmental issues facing The Gambia and that activities are
implemented to reverse the trend of environmental degradation.
20.   Risks. Certain risks are associated with the effectiveness of the environmental
management system, in particular the ability to achieve effective inter-sectoral coordination of
action-. However, the Govenmment has expressed its commitment to this integration of the
environment into the sectoral planning process through the GEAP and through the creation of the
NEA. Also, the capacity bui;ding focus of this project is designed to assist not only the staff of the
NEA, but also staff within ofer sectoral mnires whose work requires attention to enviromnental
considerations There are risks related to the general lack of knowledge of environmental issues
and limited capacity to handle technical environmental issues. The project directly addresses these
shortcomings through its focus on technical and managerial training of management and staff of
the NEA and through the provision of technical consultancies to transfer competence.
21.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Implementation Issues of Ongoing Projects in The Gambia
1.    Overall disbursement performance has been satisfactory--the Urban Management and
Development Project (Cr. 1443-GAM) has been fully disbursed. The disbursement of the
Enterprise Development Project (Cr. 1975-GM) has not experienced any significant lag;
however, the line of credit component of this credit, which has not disbursed since
effectiveness in 1989, was canceled on March 1, 1993 at the Government's request, and as a
consequence, the project's development impact rating has been revised to "2". The
Agricultural Services Project (Cr. 2453-GAM) has recently become effective.
2.    Out of the seven credits listed (see Page 1), four have disbursement lags. The
characteristics of the operations with slow disbursement are noted below.
3.    Water & Elecicy Project (Cr. 1724-GAM). Disbursement: 75% (about US$5.25
million). The credit became effective on November 7, 1984, five months after signing.
Disbursement on the credit has improved due to credit reallocation and IDA approval of a
major contract of an estimated value of about US$4 million. About US$5.3 million, out of
US$7 million, has been disbursed. The slow disbursement was due to the Government's
delays in complying with actions outlined during the June 1992 mission-the audit report for
FY92 was overdue and a proposal for the use of the remaining funds was only provided during
the last mission in July 1993. A management leasing contract was signed in March 1993 and
the operating company took over the management of the facilities on July 15, 1993.
4.    National Health Development (Cr. 1760-GAM). Disbursement: 76% (US$4.27
million). The credit became effective on November 2, 1987 and was scheduled to close on
December 31, 1992. About US$4.3 million out of US$5.6 million has been disbursed.
Although implementation of the reorganization of the MHSW continues to progress at a slow
pace, the overall pace of the project implementation is satisfactory. Good progress is being
made in a number of program areas, but continued centralization of budgetary decisions is
impeding effective implementation of decentralization program, with divisional teams being
given limited administrative and management authority. The closing date of the credit has
been extended to December 31, 1993, before which period, the credit is expected to be fully
disbursed.
5.    Women In Development (Cr. 2141-GAM). Disbursement: 46% (US$3.24 million).
The credit became effective on December 27, 1990, six months after signing. So far, about
US$3.2 million out of US$7 million has been disbursed. The initial slow disbursement was
due mainly to the delayed credit effectiveness and a procurement process which took almost 15
months. Overall, the project is making good progress on a number of components. Several
activities are going on at the "grassroot" level and NGOs are especially providing an excellent
contribution. The situation of the Women's Bureau is one element that has not been
successful. Following UNIFEM's decision to no longer support it, the Bureau faces a difficult
financial situation. The Government has taken over four positions, but at salary levels which
are much lower than those paid by UNIFEM. The Dutch govermnent sent an expert last
August to examine the Bureau's

situation and has indicated a willingness to rescue it. The Bureau's financial problems are
compounded by inefficient management. The Project Management Unit, which had to recruit
more staff than budgeted at appraisal, is also experiencing financial problems. So far,
unallocated funds have been in part used to cover it costs overruns. Major problems
experienced with the release of funds from other donors have been resolved.
6.    Second Education Sector (Cr. 2142-GAM). Disbursement: 22.8% (US$3.33 million).
The credit became effective on February 14, 1991, seven and a half months after signing.
Only about US$3.3 million out of US$14.6 million has been disbursed due mainly to
difficulties with procurement procedures. Some progress has been made-counterparts have
been recruited, a list of eligible suppliers and procurement and classroom construction
schedules have been prepared, bid documents are up-to-date according to the schedule, and the
management capacity of the Project Coordination Unit has improved. However, shortcomings
remain in the management of procurement and classroom construction due mainly to slow
tender approvals by the Major Tender Board. It is expected that slow down in classroom
construction will be resolved through the agreement reached during the October 1993
supervision mission. The Special Account is depleted due to Central Bank delays in processing
account statements and a lack of planning and timely processing on the part of the Project
Implementation Unit.
