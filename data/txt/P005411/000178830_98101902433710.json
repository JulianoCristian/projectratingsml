the Government's industrial and trade\n            policy adjustment program. The principal aim of the program\n            is to introduce structural changes in the system of\n            incentives in order to eliminate bias against export\n            production, lower manufacturing costs and hence lay the\n            basis for a restoration of dynamism to the pattern of\n            industrial growth. To achieve those objectives within the\n            context of a medium-term adjustment program, specific\n            actions have been taken and others will be implemented over\n            the next twelve months to reform the system of: (i) export\n            incentives; (ii) import protection (tariffs and quantitative\n            restrictions); (iii) fiscal incentives; (iv) financial\n            policy (interest rate policy and export credits); and (v)\n            price controls (liberalization of prices). The program is\n            described in the Government's Statement of Development\n            Policy to the Bank. The foreign exchange provided by the\n            loan will be used to finance imports."}, "docdt": "1984-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
