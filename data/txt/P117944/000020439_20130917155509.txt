Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The operation directly supports key pillars of the Government’s poverty reduction
strategy, the DSNCRP, namely building state capacity and improving management of
public resources. In particular, the operation aims to contribute to: (i) reducing
inefficiencies in the electricity sector in order to support the Government’s effort to
reduce the fiscal transfer to the electricity company (EDH); (ii) modernizing and
strengthening public financial management to raise and use public resources in a more
efficient and transparent manner; and (iii) strengthening and implementing the legal
framework for public procurement to contribute to more transparent and cost-effective
public expenditure. By addressing weaknesses in public financial management, the
operation is also expected to contribute to improvements to the PEFA indicators in the
medium term.

       IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT FOR THE
           THIRD ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE REFORM OPERATION
                      TO THE REPUBLIC OF HAITI



1.      Haiti is the poorest country in the Latin America and Caribbean region. The latest
Household survey available indicated that 76 percent of the population lived below the US$2-a-
day poverty line and 58 percent below the US$1-a-day poverty line. Poor access to
infrastructure, minimal ownership of assets, low education and literacy levels, and high levels of
child malnutrition were identified as the most important causes of poverty in the World Bank’s
2006 Country Economic Memorandum. Inequality is high, with a Gini coefficient of 0.5. A
marked gap existed between the rich and the poor in access to economic opportunities and social
services and unemployment was high at an estimated rate of 30 percent in 2009.



2.      After a two-year transitional period, Haiti successfully returned to constitutional order by
holding presidential and parliamentary elections in February and April 2006. Mr. René Préval
was elected President with a 51 percent majority, consolidating democracy and improving
political stability. The 48th legislature was opened in May 2006, ending three years of legislative
paralysis which strengthened the political process. Municipal elections were held in April 19,
2009, although delayed due to restructuring of the electoral council and the passage of a new
electoral code.

3.      In 2008, Haiti experienced a series of shocks that threatened macroeconomic stability and
diverted resources away from the priorities of the National Strategy for Growth and Poverty
Reduction (DSNCRP). In addition to the political stalemate following the food and fuel price
riots, Haiti was hit by four back-to-back hurricanes and tropical storms in August-September
2008, which caused damages and losses estimated at about 15 percent of GDP. These domestic
shocks were compounded by the effects of the 2008 global slowdown. As a result real GDP
growth slowed to 1.2 percent in FY2008 from 3.4 percent in FY2007, turning negative in per
capita terms. High food and fuel prices led to sharply rising inflation and a deteriorating current
account balance. At end 2008 inflation increased to 14.4 percent and the current account deficit
widened to 4.5 percent of GDP, driven by an increasing trade deficit, largely because of higher
food and fuel imports. The overall balance of payments remained in surplus due in part to
PetroCaribe inflows used as budgetary support that kept international reserve coverage at three
months of imports.

4.     In the period leading to appraisal the Government responded to the shocks by boosting
spending, especially investment expenditure, through the program of post-storm recovery and
reconstruction activities funded by PetroCaribe savings (around US$220 million) expected to
primarily finance capital expenditures (75 percent), with the remainder for current spending. The
reconstruction program and a new proposed program to create 100,000 to 150,000 jobs over two
years through infrastructure construction (including labor-intensive works) provided a fiscal




                                                 1
stimulus to counteract the effects of the global slowdown. The FY2009 budget also allocated a
large share of resources to social sectors and infrastructure in line with the DSNCRP priorities.

5.       Notwithstanding these challenges the Haitian economy performed well in 2009. Whereas
the GDP of Caribbean nations shrank by 2.2 percent on average during 2009, the Haitian
economy grew by 2.9 percent in real terms compared with an average growth of 0.9 percent
between 2004 and 2008. Almost half of the growth was concentrated in the agricultural sector,
which was hit hard by the 2008 hurricanes. The manufacturing and retail sectors grew strongly at
3.7 and 2.5 percent, respectively. The limited integration of the domestic financial sector in
global markets shielded the economy from direct impact of the global financial crisis.
Meanwhile, falling global commodity prices relieved pressure on the high cost of living
experienced at the height of the food and commodity price crisis in 2008, bringing annual
inflation down to -4.7 percent in FY2009, from 19.8 percent in FY2008. Falling commodity
prices and a resilient level of remittances contributed to an improvement in the current account
deficit from 4.5 percent of GDP in FY2008 to 3.2 percent of GDP in FY2009. The overall fiscal
deficit worsened from 3.1 percent to 4.4 percent of GDP because revenues were lower than
expected--although expenditure was contained through cuts in capital outlays.

6.      In June 2009, a track record of good policy supported by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program, the
implementation of governance, structural and social reforms supported by EGRO I and II helped
Haiti reach the completion point of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Haiti was thus expected to
benefit from debt relief (including HIPC and MDRI) estimated at US$1.2 billion in nominal
terms. As a result, public external debt fell from 26.7 percent in 2008 to an estimated 13.9
percent in 2009.



On January 12, 2010, an earthquake hit Haiti and caused widespread damage and massive loss of
life. The estimated official death toll was 222,570 while thousands of people were injured or
permanently disabled. Million and a half people were left homeless. The capacity of the Haitian
State was seriously affected because critical staff in various ministries perished and because
important official buildings collapsed or were damaged. Major economic, financial and
governance activities and functions were disrupted, which represented a major setback for the
country following sustained progress in macroeconomic stability in the five years preceding the
earthquake. After the disaster, the Bank realized that several of the EGRO III policy measures
were no longer consistent with the development challenges. It was decided that the EGRO series
would be discontinued, and a new series of policy loans would be considered to better assist
Haiti in addressing the new challenges in the post-earthquake period. Some of the policy
measures under the EGRO series were transferred to the emergency budget support operation
approved in August 2010 to keep up maintaining sound economic governance and to strengthen
the reforms started before the disaster.

7.      In February 2010, the government of Haiti, supported by the international community,
launched a post disaster needs assessment to measure damage/losses and reconstruction needs
arising from the earthquake. The needs assessment included consultations with Parliament, civil



                                               2
society, the Haitian Diaspora, the private sector and the population. Damages and losses were
estimated at approximately US$8 billion. The government developed an Action Plan for the
Reconstruction and the Development of Haiti, which was presented to international donors at the
United Nations in New York in March 2010. In a powerful show of support, donors pledged
nearly US$10 billion, of which US$5 billion were pledged for the period 2010-2011.

8.      On April 15, 2010, the Senate approved an 18-month extension of the state of emergency
that the President of Haiti decreed after the January-12 earthquake. The law significantly
expanded the powers of the Executive branch to implement the reconstruction plan, authorizing
the President to approve contracts without bids, to requisition private land and build camps for
people displaced by the earthquake, and to evacuate the displaced from their camps in case of
emergency. In order to ensure efficiency and coordination of reconstruction funds, the
government created new institutional arrangements. The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission
and the Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF), for which the World Bank is the fiscal agent, were
created under the Emergency State Law of April 2010. A Steering Committee made of
government officials at the ministerial level and representatives of various stakeholders would
ensure that projects are in line with the Government Action Plan. The Commission would
scrutinize project concepts and oversee project implementation funded by the nearly US$10
billion pledged by Haiti’s partners.




9.        The single tranche operation under review (EGRO III) approved by the Board on
December 8, 2009, built on the successful implementation of Economic Governance Reform
Operation I (EGRO I) and EGRO II. EGRO III was the first of a series of two programmatic
operations (EGRO III and EGRO IV) and part of a broad package of the International
Development Association support for economic management and governance reform program,
which includes two Economic Governance Technical Assistance Grants (EGTAG I and II)
amounting to US$4 million, accompanied by a US$1.5 million grant from the Low Income
Countries Under Stress Trust Fund and the Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR) finalized in FY08. This third economic governance reform
operation was funded by a $12.5 million grant supporting the reform effort to strengthen public
financial management, public procurement, and management and transparency in the electricity
sector. In particular, the operation supported policy reforms aimed at: (i) reducing inefficiencies
in the electricity sector in order to support the government’s effort to reduce the fiscal transfer to
the National Electricity Company (EDH); (ii) modernizing and strengthening public financial
management to raise and use public resources in a more efficient and transparent manner; and
(iii) strengthening and implementing the legal framework for public procurement to contribute to
more transparent and cost-effective public expenditure.

10.    The operation supported policy measures in three areas deemed critical for continued
progress on economic governance and public financial management, while maintaining a high
degree of continuity with the previous operations. The fiscal policy component addressed some
of the underlying issues creating pressure to increase fiscal transfers to the loss-making EDH.
The public financial management component supported greater revenue mobilization capacity



                                                  3
through improvements in customs and tax information systems. On the expenditure side, the
component sustained efforts to further improve budget preparation and execution, and the control
systems. Finally, the public procurement component supported the implementation of the Public
Procurement Law through the timely adoption of the main implementing regulations.

11.     The results framework proposed seven programmatic outcome indicators expected to be
completed by the end of the second operation (EGRO IV in 2011) as follows: (i) EDH’s Cost
Recovery Index (6 month moving average) has improved at least to 45 percent from less than 32
percent in FY2008; (ii) Improved collection rate as evidenced by collection ratio for gross tax
arrears, understood as the collection of tax arrears during the government fiscal year as a
percentage of total outstanding arrears ; (iii) Existence of multi-year expenditure estimates based
on strategic orientations in at least three ministries; (iv) Operationalization and full compliance
of the General Finance Inspectorate (IGF) with the 2009-11 audit work program, including
distribution of audit reports to the beneficiaries and ministries; (v) Improved comprehensiveness
of budget reporting as evidenced by compliance with the budget and accounting classifications
of consolidated statement of the deposits and expenditures from comptes courants (discretionary
accounts); (vi) Compliance of external audits with regulations as evidenced by timely
submission of the Budget Execution Law and Government Accounts to Parliament and the
Supreme Audit Court respectively; and (vii) Enhanced transparency in public procurement as
evidenced by increasing share of competitive procurement in total procurement, measured by the
value of contracts awarded without competition as percent of all contracts.

12.      Given the impact of the earthquake of January 12, 2010 on public financial management
institutions, the implementation capacity of the government was seriously weakened following
the destruction of public buildings and the loss of senior level staffs. As a result, out of the seven
indicators used to track the operation progress towards its development objectives, four were
partially met, one is not met and data to assess the remaining two are not available.

1.4   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

13.     Neither the objectives of the operation nor key indicators were revised. The Bank realized
that some of the EGRO III policy measures, following the disaster, were no longer consistent
with the development challenges. The EGRO series were discontinued, and the Bank started a
new series of policy loans to better assist Haiti in addressing the new challenges in the aftermath
of the earthquake. The emergency operation contains some of the actions that were triggers to the
EGRO IV, following an assessment of the status of triggers made in May 2010 that concluded
that only five of the ten triggers were on track.



14.    The government made significant progress in implementing reforms, largely focused on
improving the legal and institutional framework for public expenditure and public enterprise
management. However, significant weaknesses in economic governance remained and were
considered to be one of the most serious obstacles to sustained economic growth and poverty
reduction. As a result, the EGRO III focused on addressing those weaknesses. The policy actions



                                                  4
were organized under three components: fiscal policy, public financial management, and public
procurement.

1.4.1 Fiscal Policy

15.     In spite of progress achieved to improve the financial situation and management,
significant weaknesses remained in public financial management. Large fiscal transfers to the
EDH were (are) still diverting scarce resources away from DSNCRP priorities. Electricity tariffs
charged by EDH were frozen between December 2005 and August 2009, despite the substantial
increase in fuel prices. This discrepancy between cost of production and cost recovery, combined
with high technical and non-technical losses, undermined the financial sustainability of EDH and
its efforts to improve cost recovery1; it has also prevented EDH from improving the quality and
coverage of electricity services. As a result, EDH had to rely on fiscal transfers from the
Treasury in order to continue operating, which amounted US$104 million in the FY2009 budget,
exceeding Treasury-financed investment expenditures. These transfers effectively represent
inefficient and untargeted subsidies to the electricity sector.

16.     Reducing the amount of transfers to EDH was among the key objectives of the
Government to which the operation under review was contributing. Sustaining such a reduction
would require improving EHD’s cost recovery through higher tariffs and improved technical and
customer management systems and practices. In addition, greater transparency in the use of the
transfers to EDH was needed in order to better assess how quickly they can be phased out. As a
prior action for the operation, EDH had designed, publicized and started implementing a cost
recovery policy to improve its financial situation and management, which included: (i) the
launching of an electricity tariff increase; and (ii) the competitive appointment of a provider of
new customer and technical management systems in EDH.

17.      Indicative triggers for the second operation included (i) further steps of the Government
towards its medium-term goal of reducing fiscal transfers to EDH through the strengthening of
the mechanism that monitors key financial indicators for EDH, on a monthly basis; and (ii) the
Government committed to commissioning a bi-annual audit of the reports by an independent
firm in order to ensure that the information is factually correct. These policy reforms were
expected to contribute to improving EDH’s administration and enhanced transparency in the
management of transfers. The increase in tariffs and the operationalization of the new
information systems that allow for tighter monitoring of metering and billing, would decrease
EDH’s non-technical losses, improve cost recovery and eventually lead to reduced public
transfers to EDH.

1.5.2 Public Financial Management (PFM)

18.     In spite of significant progress made under the predecessor operations (EGRO I and II),
significant weaknesses remained in public financial management. The preparation of investment
and current budgets needed to be consolidated to contribute to the introduction of a forward-
looking budget. Important progress still needed to be achieved in the areas of budget

comprehensiveness and data management systems, which still lacked data on externally-financed
investment. The internal control system needed to be fully operationalized to ensure full
compliance with the budget execution framework and with the recommendations issued by the
external audits of line ministries aimed at improving the integrity of the budget. The reporting of
the discretionary accounts (comptes courants) was not processed under the regular procedures
for budget resources and the submission of the budget and annual audits needed to be in
compliance with the existing regulations. Finally, despite efforts to revamp the tax and customs
administration, Haiti’s revenue mobilization remained weak due to small tax base, the absence of
a strong legal framework (which encourages corruption) and insufficient capacity in the form of
weak decentralized presence and poor communications and coordination between the customs
and tax offices. Much of the tax legislation was outdated and dispersed, making it difficult to
administer and assess liabilities. The information system was deficient leading to ineffective
collection rate and low rate of tax compliance.

19.     To strengthen government’s revenue mobilization capacity, the operation supported the
following prior actions: (i) the operationalization of a new customs information system in eleven
key customs posts, namely, Port-au-Prince port, Port-au-Prince airport and airport arrivals hall,
Cap Haïtien, Gonaives, Saint Marc, Miragoane, Malpasse, Ouanaminthe, Belladere and Port de
Paix; (ii) the establishment in the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) general directorate
of taxes (Direction Generale des Impots) a networked information system linking all said
directorate office and units in all departments; and (iii) the interconnection of respective
information systems operated in MEF’s customs directorate and general directorate of taxes ; and
(iv) carrying out the critical staffing of the General Financial Inspectorate to enable the start of
internal audit operations.

20.    For the second operation, the indicative triggers included the submission of the Fiscal
Code to the lower chamber of Parliament aimed at improving tax collection; and as regards
public expenditure management, actions aimed at sustaining efforts to improve the budget
process for better outcomes and the strengthening of the control systems, through the following
measures: (i) the consolidation of the integration of the preparation of investment and current
budgets; (ii) the strengthening of the financial control and internal audit functions through the
adoption and dissemination of the manual of procedures for internal audit, and the
implementation of the FY2010 audit work program established by the Ministry of Finance for
the IGF; (iii) the regularization of control procedures for comptes courants; and (iv) compliance
with calendar and legal requirements for external audit; (v) the MEF has submitted to the
Supreme Audit Institution (CSCCA) the 2008-09 public accounts; and (vi) the CSCCA has
submitted to Parliament an opinion on the audit report for the fiscal year 2007-08.

21.     By the end of the programmatic operations, the reforms are expected to lead to improved
collection rate as evidenced by collection ratio for gross tax arrears; and the reforms aimed at
strengthening public expenditure management are expected to lead to: (i) improved budget
preparation process in at least three ministries; (ii) the operation and full compliance of the IGF
with its 2009-11 audit work program, including distribution of audit reports to the beneficiaries
and ministries; (iii) improved comprehensiveness of budget reporting; and (iv) enhanced
compliance of external audits with regulations as evidenced by timely submission of the Budget

respectively.

1.4.3 Public Procurement

22.     Despite efforts initiated since 2004 to reform public procurement, progress has been slow
in strengthening the system. Policy actions already taken to advance procurement reforms under
the predecessor operations include: (i) the creation of the Commission Nationale des Marchés
Publics (CNMP); (ii) the adoption of a new Procurement Law by Parliament in June 2009; (iii)
the establishment of a web site on which the CNMP publishes invitations to bid, a list of
suppliers and contracts awards; and (iv) the introduction of standard bidding documents and a
manual of procedures for government procurement staff based on the new code. The
dissemination of the new Law was expected to speed the adoption of improved procurement
practices. However, significant work is still needed to ensure full compliance with the new Law
by sector ministries. Compliance is of particular importance given the increasing number of
public procurement processes likely to result from growing external aid.

23.    This operation supported the issuance by the Government of the four key implementing
decrees (arrêtés d'application) required for the Public Procurement Law to become effective,
namely: (i) decree establishing all relevant thresholds in respect of public procurement; (ii)
decree setting forth the institutional rules and procedures for the CNMP; (iii) decree setting forth
the general rules regarding public procurement and public service concessions; and (iv) decree
adopting the manual of procedures for public procurement and mandating its general application

24.     The triggers for the second operation were designed to lay the foundation for steps to
materialize, including two key measures (i) the preparation of annual procurement plans for
FY2009-10 by key contracting authorities, communication of said plans to the CNMP and
publication of associated general procurement notices; and (ii) enhancement of the CNMP’ s
existing database of Government contracts and suppliers to provide more specific and up-to-date
information which can be accessed by the general public and can be downloaded from the
CNMP website.

25.    By the end of this series of programmatic operations, the identified policy reforms are
expected to contribute to enhanced transparency in public procurement. The share of
noncompetitive procurement in total procurement, measured as the value of contracts awarded
without competition as percent of all contracts awarded is expected to decrease significantly.
Sustaining implementation of these reforms in the medium term would lead to improvements to
the PEFA scores.



26.    Policy areas were not revised.

27.     The grant was approved on December 8, 2009. It became effective one month later on
January 12, 2010. The disbursement of the Single Tranche took place January 25, 2010, as stated
in the Financing Agreement. This operation was built on two previous Economic Governance
Reform Operations EGRO I and EGRO II. EGRO I (2005) was designed as a two-tranche
operation in view of the risks involved in a first operation in a transition period. The second
tranche conditions were met without any waivers, but with delays. Significant technical
assistance was provided to address the problem of low government capacity. Close coordination
among donors, intense supervision and a field presence were essential for moving program
implementation. The Government, under the EGRO II (2007) made good progress in public
financial management and maintained macroeconomic stability despite severe external shocks
and a difficult political climate. On the other hand, little was achieved in civil service reform,
improving governance of the electricity sector and promoting accountability and transparency in
the use of public resources for education. The operation was rated moderately satisfactory as the
Government proved unable to deliver on the corrective actions it had agreed to take in return for
the waivers granted on four conditions of second tranche release.

28.    The operation under review was designed to be followed by a fourth operation as part of
a programmatic series of two operations. The fourth operation was to be triggered by a set ten
follow-on actions. After the field visit of September-October 2010, the mission reported that
given the impact of the earthquake on public financial management institutions, the
implementation capacity of the government was seriously weakened following the destruction of
a large part of Port-au-Prince and the loss of several senior level staffs. As a result, the
implementation of the indicative triggers for the next operation (EGRO IV) was significantly
delayed. Only two of ten triggers were met; five were delayed but partially met, and three were
not met.

29.     Progress in the areas supported by this operation (EGRO III) was encouraging before the
earthquake. In fiscal policy, to improve EDH’s financial situation and management and support
the Government’s efforts to reduce the fiscal transfers to the company, EDH had designed and
started implementing a cost recovery policy including the launching of an electricity tariff
increase and the competitive appointment of a provider of new customer and technical
management systems for company. In public financial management, significant progress was
made, in particular with respect to revenue collection and efficiency and transparency in public
expenditure management. Finally, progress in procurement although relatively slow due to
significant delay in the adoption of the new Procurement Law and its implementation, as a prior
action to the operation under review, the Government issued four key implementing decrees
required for the Public Procurement Law to become effective.

30.    Table 1 below summarizes the status of the prior actions to this economic governance
reform operation (EGROIII) as well as the status of triggers for the second operation (EGRO
IV).

2.2.1 Internal factors

31.     Parliamentary ratification of the grant agreement took short time contrary to what is
generally the case in Haiti. Only one month after the approval of grant agreement (December 8,
2009) the operation became effective January 12, 2010 and the disbursement followed shortly
(January 25, 2010). However, the limited government capacity for program implementation
resulted in important delays in program execution, including taking the appropriate steps for
meeting second operation triggers.

32.     The earthquake created a substantial political uncertainty and the progress made in the
functioning of democracy before the earthquake, including the political process towards
legislative, presidential and municipal elections previously scheduled to be held in 2010 stalled.

2.2.2 External factors

33.     The earthquake of January 12, 2010 directly impacted Port-au-Prince and the entire
metropolitan area where the most important economic infrastructure facilities are located and a
third of the country’s population resides. This disaster very severely disrupted the economy, the
public finances and the governance activities and functions representing a major setback for the
country following sustained progress in macroeconomic stability and public sector governance in
the five years preceding the earthquake. The country’s productive capacities were devastated and
the vulnerability of the population and of the state institutions increased as the State’s ability to
provide essential basic services for the people was eroded. The loss of a considerable quantity of
physical capital (infrastructure, housing, equipment and materials) and also of human resources
put the country in an unfavorable position for moving into the implementation of policy
measures and actions towards the achievement of outcomes expected by the end of the EGRO
operations. Some Government institutions, already weak before the disaster, are not yet
functioning at pre-earthquake levels.

34.     The position of the public finances, which had improved before the earthquake, displayed
a definite downward trend. Revenue, which was running at a monthly average of 3 billion
gourdes (2009), slumped abruptly to 700 million gourds in January 2010. The target for the
2009-2010 fiscal years was scaled back to 26.3 billion gourdes against the 34.9 billion initially
set, hence a performance of just 75 percent. However, preliminary data show that revenue has
increased at end 2010 to pre-earthquake level (31.4 billion of gourdes versus 26.3 billion of
gourdes).

35.     Regarding the implementation of expenditure, the MEF in mid 2010 was operating out of
two provisional locations and with a reduced number of personnel. The main servers holding the
data were saved and are once again operational. The expenditure forecasts for the fiscal year
pointed to a slight reduction in current expenditure, while wages and salaries were swiftly
restored and were paid on schedule. Locally financed capital expenditures, which have been
diverted in part to cover emergency needs, were expected to increase by about 26 percent by end
2010.



                                                 11
36.     The Government was committed to the program, but was slow in meeting the triggers for
the second operation, because of severe capacity constraints due to the earthquake which
inflicted serious damages to the island and its population. The capacity of the Haitian State was
seriously affected because critical staff in various ministries perished and because important
official buildings collapsed or were damaged. Government buildings that were destroyed or
seriously damaged include the National Palace, the Supreme Court, the Law Courts, the
Parliament and police facilities, and all but one line ministry. Other affected key public entities
include the Tax and Customs Administrations, the National Statistical Institute, the National
Procurement Commission, the Court of Accounts (CSC/CA), and the FER. Major economic,
financial and governance activities and functions were disrupted—which represents a major
setback for the country following sustained progress in macroeconomic stability and public
sector governance in the five years preceding the earthquake.



37.     The operation under review drew on a wide range of analytical work carried out by the
Government and the Bank in recent years. Most notably, the overall design of the operation was
based on the Government’s DSNCRP itself, which was developed in a participatory process
consisting of consultations with civil society, government officials, and development partners.
The DSNCRP presents the government’s long-term vision to foster growth, reduce poverty, and
raise living standards, through an ambitious program of institutional reform and public
investment The overall strategic priorities of the DSNCRP are structured around three pillars: (i)
enhancing human development, with a focus on improving delivery of basic services; (ii)
improving security and the justice system; and (iii) promoting vectors of growth through
agriculture and rural development, tourism, and infrastructure. The DSNCRP also includes as
one of its cross-cutting policy priorities a strategy to build state capacity and improving
management of public resources.

38.     The Bank prepared a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) in 2006, which identified
poor economic governance as one of the main constraints to growth and poverty reduction. The
CEM highlighted the important advances made to increase transparency and efficiency in the use
of public resources and external assistance. These included changes in the legal framework for
budget formulation and execution, the setting up of critical institutions and agencies, and efforts
at disseminating basic information. The report’s recommendations focused on the need for full
implementation of the new legal framework, and the capacity building necessary to achieve the
implementation especially with regards to revenue, expenditure and human resource
management. Gradually, coverage of the framework could then be extended to offices handling
financial management in sector ministries. In addition, the CEM pointed to the need for
redistributive policies--through increased collection of progressive taxes to mobilize much
needed public resources, and improved efficiency and targeting of public spending. The findings
and recommendations of the CEM with regards to economic governance reform were
subsequently incorporated into the EGRO series.




                                                12
39.     The PEMFAR and its follow-up action plan (2008) provide the technical basis for the
proposed policy actions under the public financial management and procurement components.
The review acknowledges the significant progress in strengthening fiscal discipline and
improving the efficiency of the PFM and procurement systems over the period 2005-08, despite
the difficult environment. The study identified progress in budget preparation and execution and
in particular the improvements resulting from the implementation of the expenditure information
system SYSDEP. In the area of procurement, the establishment of the CNMP helped to
standardize tender documentation and improve the management of procurement processes. The
report identified as remaining challenges the budget’s limitation in terms of a forward-looking
perspective, and poor link with sector policies; the lack of cash-flow planning and the weak
capacity of line ministries; the need to link the different information systems; and the opportunity
to further improve the PFM regulatory framework. Policy recommendations in the area of budget
preparation included further linking budget and policy planning, incorporating extra-budgetary
funds into the budget; communicating expenditure ceilings to the ministries at the beginning of
the budget preparation process. In the area of budget execution and control, recommendations
focused on accelerating recruitment of financial controllers, public accountant, and financial
inspectors, and continuing the process of reducing the discretionary accounts.

40.      Finally, the FY2009-12 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board
on June 2, 2009. It focuses on three pillars: (i) promoting growth and local development; (ii)
investing in human capital; and (iii) reducing vulnerability to disasters. The strategy has two-
pronged approach, combining longer-term institution building (including economic governance
reform) with support for the government in the delivery of quick, visible results to the
population. This results agenda involves activities to: (i) improve the effectiveness, transparency
and accountability of public sector institutions; (ii) consolidate governance reforms including
public financial management, both from the expenditure and revenue perspectives, and
procurement to strengthen core institutions; and (iii) strengthen key sector ministries that are
critical for service delivery.

41.     The EGRO III operation supported key pillars of the Government’s poverty reduction
strategy, the DSNCRP, namely building state capacity and improving management of public
resources. It also supported policy measures and activities in areas deemed critical for continued
progress on economic governance, public financial management and procurement issues
addressed in the CAS and the CEM; while maintaining a high degree of continuity with the
previous economic governance reform operations.



42.      EGRO III operation was designed as a first in a series of two single-tranche development
policy grants (DPG), taking into accounts the experience with previous operations, and is fully in
line with the agreement reached between donors and the government on the modalities for
budget support. Furthermore, the operation was designed to reflect the government’s policy
priorities in the area of economic governance, as expressed in the joint matrix for budget support
agreed upon with all the key donors, which forms the basis for this operation. The policy actions
supported by this operation on the one hand reflected the recognition of the post-conflict
environment from which Haiti had recently emerged — the political stalemate following the



                                                13
food and fuel price riots, and the hurricanes and tropical storms in August-September 2008 and
on the other hand the progress made over the past years with the support of the preceding EGRO
operations. There was nothing new or unexpected in the third operation and it was reasonable to
envisage that, with the experience gained, this third operation could be completed within
schedule. Unfortunately, on January 12, 2010, an earthquake hit Haiti and caused widespread
damage and massive loss of life, resulting in the disruption of economic, financial and
governance activities representing a major setback for the overall country poverty reduction and
economic management strategy.



43.     The operation under review took place in an environment of high risk. Four types of
relevant risks were identified: economic risk, political risk, natural disaster-related risk, and
weak institutional capacity risk. The economic downturn in major international economies could
have a serious negative impact on Haiti, through reduced remittances, donor funding and
investment. At the time of the appraisal there was evidence of an impact in these areas already,
which could jeopardize macroeconomic stability, poverty reduction, human development and
private sector development. The economic risk was expected to be mitigated by the ongoing
support of the Bank and other donors but it was acknowledged that a serious crisis would also
reduce the overall effectiveness of this assistance.

44.     At the time of the operation’s approval Haiti remained vulnerable to the political and
social instability that has historically undermined development and the implementation of donor
programs in the country. Difficult socio-economic conditions and multiple elections increased
the risk of the recurrence of instability in the coming years. However, the appointment of a new
Prime Minister who was Minister of Planning and International Cooperation the previous
Cabinet, and as such who has actively participated in the dialogue with development partners --
including the World Bank -- in the past, provided assurance that Haiti would stay the course and
continue implementing key economic reforms supported by the operation under review.
Similarly, the presence of UN forces and the strong commitment of the international community,
including the Bank Group, to supporting the Government and its reform program were
considered stabilizing factors.

45.     As Haiti is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, flash
floods etc. renewed occurrence of large scale natural disasters would derail the government’s
reform program and divert resources from the longer term development agenda towards more
urgent recovery and reconstruction needs. The Bank’s ongoing portfolio of emergency recovery
projects directly addressed this risk and the Bank could be able to respond to any natural disaster
by reallocating funds from pipeline or existing projects. Additionally, weak institutional capacity
and delays that could arise from capacity constraints also remained important risks. This risk was
expected to be mitigated by sustaining the reforms that have started generating positive results on
which the country already had developed stronger capacity such as in public finance
management and procurement. This risk would also be mitigated by ensuring that the most
difficult reforms were taken up-front and that donor harmonization would help target efficiently
the focus of technical assistance. The Bank would coordinate with the community of donors to
enhance synergy and improve the efficiency of the EGRO III.



                                                14
46.    The risk analysis was adequate. The risks were substantial, but it was expected that the
operation would bring about potential benefits, which were essential to support the
Government’s economic governance reform agenda. The mitigation of potential risks was overall
appropriate, but the magnitude of the aftershocks of the January 2010 earthquake was so severe
and the damage so significant that the development objectives of the operation were undermined.



2.7.1 M&E Design

47.     The results framework included seven outcome indicators under three policy areas,
expected to be achieved by the end of the second operation in 2011. The fiscal policy component
had one outcome indicator: the EDH Cost Recovery Index (6 month moving average) has
increased to at least 45 percent from less than 32 percent in FY2008. The public financial
management component had five outcome indicators: (i) improved tax collection rate, evidenced
by collection ratio for gross tax arrears, understood as the collection of tax arrears as a
percentage of total outstanding arrears, of more than 60 percent; (ii) existence of multi-year
expenditure estimates based on strategic orientations in at least three ministries; (iii)
operationalization and full compliance of the IGF with its 2009-11 audit work program,
including distribution of audit reports to the beneficiaries and ministries; (iv) improved
comprehensiveness of budget reporting as evidenced by compliance with the budget and
accounting classifications of consolidated statement of the deposits and expenditures from
discretionary ministerial accounts, and (v) compliance of external audits with regulations as
evidenced by timely submission of the Budget Execution Law and Government Accounts to
Parliament and the Supreme Audit Court, respectively. Finally, one outcome was sought under
public procurement policy component: enhanced transparency in public procurement as
evidenced by an increased share of competitive procurement, measured by the value of contracts
awarded without competition as percent of all contracts awarded.

2.7.2 M&E Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

48.      The MEF was responsible for the overall coordination of the operation as set out in the
Letter of Development Policy. Similarly, the MEF would be in charge of reporting progress and
coordinating actions among other concerned entities, including the CNMP, the Central Bank and
the main line ministries managing investment projects. The Bank monitored implementation as
part of the joint donor matrix for budget support, through regular supervision missions as well as
the presence in the field of the EGRO III task team leader and the preparation of several follow-
up notes sent to the Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister to permanently remind and
identify pending reform measures, bottlenecks or pending problems, expected next steps and
institutional responsibilities for follow-up (on both the Government and Bank sides).

49.     Immediately after the approval of the operation early December 2009, a first Bank
mission visited Haiti (December 10-17, 2009) with the objective of supervising if the prior
actions of the EGRO III were on track. With the only exception of the use of transfers to EDH,
which was significantly delayed due to weak government monitoring system and SOE's, the



                                               15
other conditions were complied. As a result the Ministry of Finance would publish by the end of
2009 the existing data of EDH transfers with a note explaining the shortcomings. As the
earthquake occurred January 12, 2010 the following Bank supervision missions had to focus on
the impact of the earthquake on public financial management institutions and the loss of
implementation capacity of the government given the destruction of public buildings and the loss
of senior level civil servants. From the start, it was clear that the implementation of some of the
indicative triggers for the next operation (EGRO IV) would be significantly delayed. Bank staff
had to deal with the aftermath of the disaster and look for possible adjustments that needed to be
made as the circumstances evolved.

50.     The Bank supervision mission of May 3-13, 2010, reviewed the status of the EGRO III
and filed the corresponding Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR). In the mean time
the Bank mission already identified and agreed with the Government on the prior actions to
underpin the upcoming Emergency Budget Support operation. The last supervision mission that
visited Haiti on September 27 to October 8, 2010 prepared a detailed ISR (November 23, 2011)
with the status of each one of the indicators.

51.      The Bank mission provided information on each one of the indicators as follows: The
only indicator pertaining to fiscal policy was not met (EDH’s Cost Recovery Index has improved
at least to 45 percent from less than 32 percent in FY2008). Four of five indicators, pertaining to
public financial management, were partially achieved (existence of multi-year expenditure
estimates based on strategic orientations in at least three ministries; operationalization and full
compliance of the IGF with the 2009-11 audit work program; improved comprehensiveness of
budget reporting as evidenced by compliance with the budget and accounting classifications of
consolidated statement on deposits and expenditures from comptes courants; and compliance of
external audits with regulations and submission of the Budget Law and Government Accounts to
Parliament and the Supreme Audit Institution). For the only indicator under the public financial
management component, (improved collection rate as evidenced by collection ratio for gross tax
arrears), there was no data available at the time of the mission, not at the time of the ICR.
Finally, the indicator for public procurement (enhanced transparency in public procurement as
evidenced by increasing share of competitive procurement in total procurement) had no
information available because during the earthquake procurement data in line ministries was lost.

2.7.3 M&E Utilization

52.    The indicators were not designed to be met in the first year of the operation. They were
intended to monitor advancement in implementing specific actions in the reform program
towards progress in achieving the broad objectives of the government’s reform program.



53.     The EGRO III operation under review was expected to be followed by a fourth EGRO
within the context of a programmatic series. The series of operations would support policies and
reforms aimed at: (i) creating fiscal space for priority expenditures by reducing inefficiencies in
the electricity sector; (ii) improving public finance management by prioritizing allocations to key
sectors in poverty reduction and growth, and improving information system to enhance revenue



                                                16
mobilization capacity; and (iii) strengthening the framework for public procurement. This
operation was designed in the context of improved donor harmonization on budget support
agreed with the Government in April 2009. The assessment of the status of triggers for EGRO
IV (as of May 2010) presented in Table 1, concluded that only two of ten triggers were on track
and five were delayed due fundamentally to the earthquake. Financing needs have been
exacerbated by revenue shortfalls following the earthquake. The damage and losses caused by
the earthquake were estimated to be nearly US$8 billion, according to the Post Disaster Needs
Assessment (PDNA) carried out in February 2010. At the same time, expenditure needs to
support the reconstruction increased. In response to the damage and losses caused by the
earthquake the Bank prepared an Emergency Development Policy Operation in July 2010. As a
result, the EGRO series were discontinued.




54.      The objectives were highly relevant when the operation was prepared. As indicated
earlier in this report, the operation supported key pillars of the Government’s poverty reduction
strategy; it also supported policy measures in areas deemed critical for continued progress on
economic governance, public financial management and procurement issues addressed in the
CAS; and maintained a high degree of continuity with EGRO I and EGRO II. The objectives of
the operation continue to be a priority today after the extensive damage done by the 2010
earthquake. In effect, the Emergency Development Policy Operation approved in August 2010,
used most of the triggers for the EGRO IV and focuses on areas that do not differ from those
addressed in the latter operation. The Emergency DPO addresses the short-term challenges after
the earthquake and aims to consolidate the gains achieved under the previous EGRO operations.
Areas of continuity include the strengthening of budget controls and audits, and the
establishment of transparency in the management of transfers in the electricity sector given the
urgency of ensuring adequate monitoring and oversight of public resource use. While retaining
procurement as a key area, it shifts the focus from implementation of the procurement Law to
strengthening the legal framework and capacity given the damages to procurement institutions.



53.     As a result of the earthquake, 2010 GDP contracted by 5 percent (much less than
originally expected) owing to a stable agricultural output, and resilient manufacturing industries
and commerce. Overall production costs rose and the collapse of structures hampered the
operation of many businesses. Annual inflation initially projected at 8.5 percent, was 4.7 percent,
due to low domestic and international food prices and food aid. The overall fiscal deficit
deteriorated to 3.0 percent of GDP and as expected, the earthquake reduced tax revenues



2
   It should be noted that instead of using the result indicators at the end of the operation (2011), the ISR used, for
some indicators, medium-term results foreseen beyond the closing date of the operation. However, this does not
affect the assessment of the operation's achievement under the ICR.

       exposing the disadvantages of relying on a narrow tax base. However, overall domestic revenues
       increased due to a boost in customs revenue driven by rapidly expanding imports. By contrast,
       expenditures increased considerably in response to activities and reconstruction efforts following
       the earthquake. Progress in the implementation of the main components and development
       objectives of the reform program supported by the EGRO III operation is summarized in Table 2.

operational, up-to-date, and
accessible to the general public




   55.      One year after the 2010 earthquake that devastated the country, the macroeconomic
   situation has improved faster than anticipated, reflecting the authorities’ efforts to quickly restore
   state institutions, prudent macroeconomic policies, and the rapid and sizeable donors’ budget
   support. The external current account deficit was 2.3 percent of GDP, while net international
   reserves increased significantly to about $1.1 billion, due to capital inflows in support of the
   reconstruction activities. Debt relief, including by the World Bank, IDB, IMF, and Venezuela,
   that followed the earthquake, significantly improved the overall balance position and lowered the
   country’s external indebtedness. The three-year IMF’s program implementation under the
   Extended Credit Facility (ECF), approved in July 2010, is satisfactory to date. All performance
   criteria for the first review that took place end 2010 were met, with the exception of the poverty-
   related spending target as the poverty-related expenditure was not fully observed, reflecting a
   slower than expected response in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. Similarly,
   implementation of structural reforms has continued, particularly in tax and customs
   administration aimed at increasing fiscal revenue, and cash management to improve transparency
   and efficiency in the use of public resources. All structural benchmarks have been implemented,
   albeit with some delays. The outcome results, current status of the policy areas and progress
   toward medium-term policy actions that were outlined in the Program document are discussed
   below.

   Objective 1: Improving EDH’s financial situation and management, and support the
   Government’s efforts to reduce the fiscal transfers to the company

   56.     Despite significant progress made in the electricity sector as part of efforts aimed at
   improving public utility management and the efficiency of public expenditures, large fiscal
   transfers to EDH were still diverting scarce resources away from DSNCRP priorities. Therefore,
   reducing the amount of transfers to EDH was among the key objectives of the Government to
   which this operation was contributing. In effect, to improve EDH’s financial management and
   support the Government’s efforts to reduce transfers to the company, EDH, as a prior action had
   designed, publicized and started implementing a cost recovery policy which included the
   launching of an electricity tariff increase and the competitive appointment of a provider of new
   customer and technical management systems in EDH. As a follow-on action the EDH had to
   publish on the MEF website on a monthly basis the use of fiscal transfers beginning in
   November 2009. The publication on the website of the Ministry of Economy of the data for
   November 2008-September 2009 was satisfactory. Unfortunately it was interrupted after the
   earthquake. Additionally, the information contained in the monitoring table was to be audited on
   a bi-annual basis by an independent firm. The first audit was scheduled for June 2010, but it was


                                                    20
unable to be completed given the impact of the quake on the institutions involved (EDH, MEF,
and MTPTC) and the obvious interruption of data collection.

57.     Following the earthquake, EDH revenue collection capacity was weakened, the grid was
partially damaged, the meters were not working well in most part of the cities, therefore he
EDH’s Cost Recovery Index (6 month moving average) that was expected to be improved at
least to 45 percent in FY 2011 from less than 32 percent in FY2008 seems difficult to be
reached, given that the cost recovery index decreased from 55 percent in September 2009 to 19.5
percent in August 2010. Therefore, transfers to EDH exceeded by 3 percent the budgeted amount
for FY 2010. This does not give a clear indication on the possibility of complying with the
expected outcome by end 2011.

58.     However, steps are being taken to address weaknesses in budget monitoring and control,
as well as in cash management, in line with recent IMF technical assistance recommendations.
The authorities have agreed to identify not only budget transfers to EDH but also consolidate all
off-budget transfers to the company, including Petro Caribe resources, in monthly budget
execution reports. Furthermore, the authorities have signed a Memorandum of Understanding
with IDB and the US government (The Bank is expected to join the group of donors) on the
modernization of the energy sector, including the implementation of an interim management
contract to improve the financial management of EDH, the rehabilitation of the distribution
network to reduce technical losses, and the construction of the new power plant for an industrial
park in Northern Haiti. These would allow the MEF to reduce fiscal transfers to the company.
According to the IMF’s First Review under the Three-Year Arrangement of the Extended Credit
Facility (April 2011), preliminary data suggest that total transfers to EDH could amount to as
much as 3 percent of GDP in FY 2010-11.

The Fiscal Policy component is therefore rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Objective 2: Improving tax revenue collection and mobilization

59.     Haiti’s tax revenue (averaging 10 percent of GDP over the last decade) is the lowest in
the region, leaving the Government heavily dependent on external assistance. In a country with a
small tax base and relatively large informal sector, continued improvements in Haiti’s tax and
customs administration is critical for enhancing revenue mobilization capacity. The public
financial management component supported this goal through improvements in customs and tax
information systems. As a prior action to the approval of the operation the Government had
carried out in MEF’s Customs Directorate the operative implementation of a new customs
information system in eleven key customs posts of the territory, namely, Port-au-Prince port,
Port-au-Prince airport and airport arrivals hall, Cap Haitian, Gonaives, Saint Marc, Miragoane,
Malpasse, Ouanaminthe, Belladere and Port de Paix. It had also completed in the General
Directorate of Taxes (DGI) the establishment and operationalization of a networked information
system linking all directorate’s departmental offices and units among them; and completed the
interconnection of respective information systems operated in MEF’s customs directorate and
general directorate of taxes. Nonetheless, to be able to reach the expected outcome by end-2011,
the Fiscal Code had to be submitted to the lower chamber of Parliament. This follow-on action
was not achieved following the destruction of the Tax Directorate, consequently there was no



                                               21
information available at the time of the supervision mission (end 2010) in order to evidence if the
collection of tax arrears as a percentage of total outstanding arrears at the beginning of the fiscal
year was complied. Originally it was expected that in FY2011 the collection ratio for gross tax
arrears would reach 70 percent from a baseline of 60 percent in FY2008.

This public financial management sub-component is rated moderately unsatisfactory

Objective 3: Improving efficiency and transparency in public expenditure management,
strengthening the budget process by improving budget integration with planning, and
formulating policy priorities in line with the DSNCRP

60.     With respect to public expenditure management, the government intends to implement
key actions aimed at improving efficiency and transparency by strengthening the control systems
and improving compliance with existing regulations and procedures, thereby enhancing budget
integrity. The Government has carried out the critical staffing of its general financial inspectorate
(Inspection Générale des Finances) to enable the start of internal audit operations as one of the
prior actions for this sub-component. This would be reinforced by five follow-up actions three of
which were partially met (the adoption of a procedural manual for budget preparation; the
strengthening of the Internal Audit Function, and the application of regular controls to the
discretionary accounts). The other two conditions for the second were met: the submission to
CSCCA of the 2008-09 public accounts, and the submission to Parliament of the CSCCA’s
opinion on the 2007-2008 audit report.

61.     While progress was made with key actions aimed at improving efficiency and
transparency in public expenditure management, all of the expected outcome indicators under
this objective were partially met. The indicators and its current status are as follows:

   1. The existence of multi-year expenditure estimates based on strategic orientations in at
      least three ministries. At end 2010 most ministries lack an appropriate multi-year
      expenditure estimate, however elements of strategic orientation do exist in a scattered
      manner and efforts are underway in several ministries to design an integrated sector and
      multi-year expenditure plan. Two ministries Agriculture and Education have Multi-year
      expenditure plans.
   2. Operationalization and full compliance of the IGF with the 2009-11 audit work program,
      including distribution of audit reports to the beneficiaries and ministries. The action plan
      of IGF has been revised in June 2010 to integrate emerging priorities and expanded to
      cover the period 2010-2014. Based on this revised work program, IGF has begun audits
      in Central, North and South Region.
   3. Improved comprehensiveness of budget reporting as evidenced by compliance with the
      budget and accounting classifications of consolidated statement of the deposits and
      expenditures from discretionary accounts. New procedures on budget & accounting
      classifications on deposits & expenditures from "comptes courants" will be fully
      implemented in 2011-12 once the Operation Manual for budget execution is operational.
      .
   4. Compliance of external audits with regulations as evidenced by timely submission of the
      Budget Execution Law and Government Accounts to Parliament and the Supreme Audit



                                                 22
       Court respectively. Government accounts for 2008-09 were submitted on time to the
       Supreme Audit Institution. The audits of the 2008-09 were delayed due to the earthquake.
       The Bank staff has discussed with the MEF and the Court measures to shorten the period
       required for the preparation of 2009-10 government accounts in order to enable the Court
       to produce both audits (2008-09 and 2009-10) before end September 2011.

This public financial management component is rated moderately satisfactory.

Objective 4: Improving efficiency in public spending through the strengthening of public
procurement

62.     Despite efforts initiated since 2004 to reform public procurement, progress has been slow
in strengthening the system. To enhance policy dialogue and improve efficiency in public
spending through the strengthening of public procurement, the Government, as a prior action,
issued four key implementing decrees required for the Public Procurement Law to become
effective, namely: (i) decree establishing all relevant thresholds in respect of public procurement;
(ii) decree setting forth the institutional rules and procedures for the CNMP; (iii) decree setting
forth the general rules regarding public procurement and public service concessions; and (iv)
decree adopting the manual of procedures for public procurement and mandating its general
application. Although implementation of the Law has been slow due to continued delays in
adopting the remaining decrees needed to apply the Law fully, eight of these decrees have been
drafted by the CNMP and were submitted for review by the Office of the Prime Minister in
January 2011. Now that the electoral process has been completed the incoming Government
should be able to adopt the decrees promptly and move forward with the implementation of the
Law. Lastly, the CNMP has been able to review contracts submitted by lien ministries to them.

63.     Over the following months after the operation was approved, the objective was to achieve
compliance with the new legal framework. While full compliance is likely to take some time,
the triggers for the second operation were designed to lay the foundation for these first steps to
materialize, including two key measures. First, that key contracting authorities have submitted to
the CNMP procurement plans for FY2009-10 and associated general procurement notices are
published, which has not been met; and second, that the CNMP has rendered its database on
contract awards fully operational and accessible to the general public, which has been partially
met. However, early in 2011 the Government initiated the selection of consulting firms for
assignments (a) to gather data from line ministries for 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 and (b) to
update the CNMP's database and web site, Contracts for the two consultancies may be signed as
early as June 2011 and the results of the two consultancies will enable the CNMP to advance
more rapidly in future.

Despite progress made in public procurement, this component is rated moderately satisfactory


Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

64.    The overall outcome of this operation is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The objectives
of the grant set at the time of the approval (reducing inefficiencies in the electricity sector;
modernizing and strengthening public financial management; and strengthening and


                                                23
implementing the legal framework for more transparent public expenditure) remained relevant
throughout the operation and continue to be aligned with the Government’s commitment to the
economic governance reform agenda. The Emergency Development Policy Operation that
replaced EGRO IV supports maintaining sound economic governance in the post-earthquake
period and strengthening the reforms started before the earthquake. The operation supports
consolidating the gains achieved in governance over the past few years including the
government’s capacity to manage public resources efficiently and transparently. More
specifically, the operation supports most of the objectives of the operation under review, such as:
increasing transparency in budget transfers to the electricity sector; reinstating budget controls
and external and internal audit processes; and reinforcing public procurement regulation and
enhancing transparency in procurement practices.



(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

65.    The actions supported by this operation most likely had no perceivable impact on poverty
reduction. Reforms supported by the operation were expected to increase efficiency,
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources, so as to more effectively channel
them to poverty reduction. These actions would contribute to an overall improvement in
governance. In fact, the measures in the electricity sector aimed at increasing transparency in
public resource use; the budget strengthening measures aimed at improving budget integration
with planning; and the procurement reforms expected to improve efficiency in public resource
use, will ultimately make it easier to scrutinize the extent to which budget allocations and actual
public expenditures are in line with the DSNCRP objectives, and benefit the entire population,
including the poor.

66.      Despite widespread damage caused by the earthquake the economic growth and its
impact on poverty levels was less pronounced than originally expected given that the economic
situation improved faster than anticipated, reflecting the efforts to quickly restore state
institutions, the prudent macroeconomic policies, and the sizeable donors’ budget support.
However, internal constraints, including delays in the electoral calendar and the outbreak of
cholera have hindered the pace of reconstruction activities and, economic and social recovery.
The operation was not designed to address gender issues and in the area of social development,
this operation contributed to foster growth, reduce poverty, and raise living standards, through an
ambitious program of institutional reform in public financial management and public
procurement, in line with the DSNCRP.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

67.    The development and strengthening of core institutions for economic governance was an
important component of the operation. Specific areas where the EGRO III has had an impact
include: the strengthening of EDH through the implementation of a cost recovery policy which
include the competitive appointment of a provider of new customer and technical management
systems; the operationalization of a new customs information system in the Customs Directorate;




                                                24
the establishment and operationalization of a network information system in the DGI; and the
staffing of the IGF to enable the start of internal audit operations.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

68.    There were no unintended consequences.




69.   The earthquake of January 12, 2010 prevented the Bank from organizing a survey or a
workshop with stakeholders.



Rating: Substantial

70.     Some of the EGRO III policy measures, following the earthquake, were no longer
consistent with the development challenges. Therefore, not all the development outcomes of the
operation could be maintained in the wake of the natural disaster.




(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

71.     The reviewed operation was built on previous EGROs. EGRO I and II were approved in
January 2005 and January 2007 respectively. The operations supported the Government's
implementation of critical economic governance reforms to increase transparency and efficiency
in the use of public resources and external assistance. The key objectives were: (i) improvement
of public expenditure management and public procurement processes; (ii) strengthening of the
public sector’s human resource management and employees’ accountability; (iii) stepping up of
anti-corruption efforts; (iv) improving efficiency and transparency in the management of public
enterprises and the Road Maintenance Fund; and (v) creating a mechanism for civil society to
monitor economic governance reforms and supporting Government communications efforts to
increase public understanding and raise awareness of governance reforms. In general, progress
under these headings was encouraging under both operations.

The third operation was more simplified that the previous ones. It was intended to gain from
further streamlining, to better focus government attention on key reforms. The operation was
intended to sustain the reform effort under the previous operations by continuing strengthening
public financial management, public procurement reforms, and management and transparency in
the electricity sector. In effect, EGRO I supported the Government's efforts to improve the



                                              25
allocation, efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure, improve transparency and
accountability in the public sector and increase the country's absorption capacity for external
resources. EGRO II supported policy reforms aimed at (i) promoting efficiency, transparency
and accountability in public resource use through public financial management and procurement
reforms; (ii) strengthening human resource management in the public sector and emplo yees’
accountability; (iii) improving efficiency and transparency in public infrastructure management;
and, (iv) promoting accountability and transparency in the use of public education funds. EGRO
III supported two of the four areas for which waivers were issued under EGRO II. First, it
supported the issuance of key regulations for the implementation of the Procurement Law, and
EGRO IV would support steps to facilitate compliance with the law. EGRO III also supported
greater transparency in the use of fiscal transfers to EDH, including power purchases from
suppliers, thus supporting the remedial actions recommended in conjunction with the mentioned
waiver. It is difficult to assess if all the triggers and results outcomes were realistic enough given
the occurrence of the earthquake.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)
Rating: Satisfactory

72.     Supervision missions visited regularly Haiti and provided assistance to the Government
to take the required actions for meeting the conditions to trigger the second operation.
Supervision took place through the presence in the field of a Bank Economist and the frequent
missions of the operation’s task team leader as well as the preparation of several follow-up notes
sent to the Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister to permanently emphasize the pending
actions, bottlenecks and other problems. The supervision and monitoring mechanism relied on
frequent and regular reviews of reform implementation status.... The first Bank supervision
mission after the approval of the operation had to focus on the impact of the earthquake on
public financial management institutions and the loss of implementation capacity of the
government given the destruction of public buildings and institutions. It was evident that some of
the outcome indicators would be significantly delayed and that intended development goals and
the specific policy actions of the operation would be difficult to achieve given the circumstance.

73.     The last supervision mission, which visited Haiti on September 27 to October 8, 2010
discussed the status of the EGRO III and agree with the Government on the closure of f the
operation taking place December 31, 2010. As mentioned before, the implementation of some of
the indicative triggers for the second operation (EGRO IV) was delayed and the outcome
indicators expected for 2011 showed little progress. In the November 2010 ISR, the ratings for
development objective and implementation progress were maintained at moderately satisfactory
because of delays in the process towards reaching the results indicators.


(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.   Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Despite the fact that the
implementation capacity of the Government was seriously weakened following the destruction of



                                                 26
public buildings, and despite the challenging political and security situation, the Government
made committed efforts to implement the reforms supported by the EGRO III. In particular, it
should be noted that the Government made an extraordinary effort to improve efficiency in
public spending through enhanced transparency in public procurement and availability of
information to the public. A demonstration of its commitment and determination to pursue its
governance efforts in this area is the fact that the government is commissioning a consultancy to
gather data for 2008 – 2009 and 2009-2010 from line ministries, and to update the CNMP
database given that following the destruction of government buildings procurement data in line
ministries was lost.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.      The MEF was the principal executing agency and was responsible for the overall
coordination of the operation as set out in the Letter of Development Policy. Similarly, the MEF
was in charge of reporting progress and coordinating actions among other concerned entities,
including the CNMP, the Central Bank and the main line ministries managing investment
projects. This ministry was the unit responsible for coordination and implementation of the
activities and reforms under the previous EGRO operations.

Although several delays were encountered in the implementation of the EGRO supported
program, due to difficulties in the aftermath of the earthquake and also due to the difficult
political and security situation, the staff in the MEF tightened monitoring and coordination of the
EGRO program with the support of the Bank Staff, and tried to provide leadership to address
bottlenecks or pending problems, and tied to ensure Government attention for the most complex
issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.      On the whole, the Government's reform program was well focused but had to be
implemented under extremely difficult circumstances. Identification and implementation of the
program had to take into account the impact on the program of a serious shortage of skills in the
public sector, a fragile political and security situation, a huge devastation due to the earthquake
and the malaria, and weak economic management in the preceding years. Macroeconomic
stability was restored and Haiti is on track with the IMF supported Three-Year Arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility program. Essential state functions have been restored and
prudent macroeconomic policies have helped support growth and contain inflation. Most of the
second operation conditions were met. Several other reform measures originally covered by the
Government's program supported by EGRO III have been transferred to the Bank supported
Emergency Development Policy Operation.



77.     Experience points to the need for adopting a simple approach in most fragile countries, in
particular in a country with high risk of occurrence of major natural disasters as Haiti. The



                                                27
decision to do a single-tranche operation was adequate in view of the possible risks affecting the
operation, the period required by the Government to implement the reforms, and the need to test
the Government's sustained commitment to the reform program. However, n a country with an
extremely low capacity, there is the need for future projects of this kind to specify better the
responsibility of every agency in achieving the stated objectives.


78.      The policy actions supported by this operation on the one hand reflect the recognition of
the post-conflict environment from which Haiti had only recently emerged, (following the food
and fuel price riots, Haiti was hit by four back-to-back hurricanes and tropical storms in 2008,
which caused damages and losses estimated at about 15 percent of GDP), and on the other hand,
the progress made over the past years with the support of the preceding EGRO operations.
Institutional building and strengthening of legal and regulatory frameworks are key factors
underpinning budget support operations. A key immediate challenge for the government was to
continue strengthening the legal framework for public finance management and public
procurement to ensure proper management of aid inflows.

79.    Countries that have experienced major natural disasters need strong institutional support
to back up critical reforms aimed at restoring the state functions quickly. Public expenditure
management and procurement are of great importance as aid inflows are expected for
reconstruction programs. This is a lesson drawn from experience in post-natural disaster
countries.

80.     Close coordination among development partners within a simple, commonly agreed
reform’s framework is important. Such an approach requires a prioritization of reforms with a
reasonable milestone framework based on commonly agreed targets. Drawing from that lesson,
this operation was based on the government’s matrix supported by a harmonized budget support
framework involving all key donors.




Borrower/Implementing agencies

81.     Since January 12, 2010, the attention of the Borrower and all external partners has been
entirely focused on the earthquake and its aftermath. At the time of the QER meeting the
Borrower has not prepared its implementation completion report, nor has provided comments on
this Implementation and Completion Report (ICR).
