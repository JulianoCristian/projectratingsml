Economic\n            Governance Reform Operation Project for Haiti were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Experience\n            points to the need for adopting a simple approach in most\n            fragile countries, in particular in a country with high risk\n            of occurrence of major natural disasters as Haiti. The\n            decision to do a single-tranche operation was adequate in\n            view of the possible risks affecting the operation, the\n            period required by the Government to implement the reforms,\n            and the need to test the Government's sustained\n            commitment to the reform program. However, in a country with\n            an extremely low capacity, there is the need for future\n            projects of this kind to specify better the responsibility\n            of every agency in achieving the stated objectives.  A key\n            immediate challenge for the government was to continue\n            strengthening the legal framework for public finance\n            management and public procurement to ensure proper\n            management of aid inflows. Public expenditure management and\n            procurement are of great importance as aid inflows are\n            expected for reconstruction programs. This is a lesson drawn\n            from experience in post-natural disaster countries. Close\n            coordination among development partners within a simple,\n            commonly agreed reform\u2019s framework is important. Such an\n            approach requires a prioritization of reforms with a\n            reasonable milestone framework based on commonly agreed targets."}, "docdt": "2011-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
