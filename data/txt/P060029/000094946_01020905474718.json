Negative\n            environmental and social impacts and their mitigations are\n            addressed. The risk of serious social risks will be\n            minimized by setting up conflict resolution and appeal\n            mechanisms; and establishing principles and procedures for\n            awarding fair compensation for involuntary loss of land. The\n            possibility of friction between participating villages and\n            non-participating villages in and adjacent to nature\n            reserves has been raised in the social assessment. Initial\n            assistance will be given to those communities most affected\n            by management programs or, conversely, those who have the\n            most direct impact on natural resources within the nature\n            reserve. To avoid conflicts, decisions will be transparent\n            and the reasons explained to all interested communities.\n            Planning services and community conservation funding may be\n            extended in time to other priority communities according to\n            understood selection criteria. To reduce the susceptibility\n            of horticultural crops to insect and microbiological attack\n            and the concomitant excess use of pesticides, fungicides,\n            etc., a diversity of crops will be offered; crop selection\n            will consider farmer preferences, site conditions and market\n            prospects; farmer training and extension services will be\n            provided; and a pest management plan supported."}, "docdt": "2000-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
