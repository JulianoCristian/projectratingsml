adaptive\n            research with the objective of achieving early and sustained\n            improvements in agricultural production, particularly of\n            foodgrains. The main project benefit will be an increase in\n            production benefitting an estimated 7.6 million farm\n            families. Small farmers with limited financial resources but\n            excess labor will be the primary beneficiaries of the\n            project's emphasis on efficientuse of existing\n            resources. The most significant risk lies in the fact that\n            the effectiveness of the new extension methodology is highly\n            dependent on an efficient organization and management of\n            extension and research services, as well as on farmers'\n            response. Experience with ongoing projects has already\n            demonstrated, however, that the new system can work\n            efficiently in formulation and delivery of messages, and in\n            motivating farmers. Project components include the provision\n            of: additional staff, housing, equipment, vehicles and staff\n            training for the extension service; additional staff,\n            vehicles, simple farm buildings and equipment in order to\n            strengthen adaptive research; and staff, equipment, vehicles\n            and funds for project monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1977-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
