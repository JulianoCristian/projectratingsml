INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPHENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIDN OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED IDAN TO
PAPUA NEW GUINEA FOR A
SECOND TELECOMMNICATDDNS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Papua New Guinea with the guarantee of the Commonwealth of Australia
for the equivalent of $10 million to help finance a second-telecommunications
project. The loan would have a term of twenty years, including four years of
grace, with interest at 7½ percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Recent political developments in Papua New Guinea, and the Bank
Group's past and planned activities in the country, are described in Part I
of my Report and Recommendation (P-1058) dated April 12, 1972 which was
distributed in connection with a proposed IDA credit for a ports project.
PART II - THE EONOMY
3.        Recent information on Papua New Guinea's economic experience and
prospects, which continue to be satisfactory, is included in my Report and
Recommendation referred to above. Although on its own Papua New Guinea is
not creditworthy for Bank loans, Bank lending in limited amounts for suitable
projects is justified as long as Australia, which makes available the foreign
exchange needed to service Bank loans, provides its guarantee.
PART III - THE PROJECT
The Telecommunications Sector
4.        Rapid and reliable telecommunications services are essential to the
development of Papua New Guinea. In the face of extremely rugged terrain,
widely scattered population and very limited surface transportation, they
provide a means of exchanging information between the producers and the
achinistrative and commercial centers of the country. The Australian Post
Office, realizing the need for coordinated development of telecommunications
in Papua New Guinea, prepared a national development plan in 1965. National
numbering, switching and tranamission plans were selected, and radio was
chosen as the only practicable means of providing long Aistance service. The
first development plan of the Poats and Telegraphs Department (P & T), for
which the Ebnk made a loan of $7 million in 1968, was desiaged within this
basic framework. However, even with the equipment provided under that loan,
the telephone density in the country is still only 1.0 per 100 persons, quite
low by international standards, and the current telecommunications facilities
are inadequate in quality and capacity to meet the country's development needs.
The second development plan (Fr 1973-75) ii estimated to cost US$20.7 million.
The plan is designed to meet the most urgent needs of the country given the
limited personnel and financial resources avii4able.

Description of the Project
5.        The Bank project is the P & T program for FY 1973-75 with two
main exceptions, the ongoing works under the previous Bank loan and
construction of a new Headquarters building for which detailed plans have
not been completed. The project to be financed by the Bank consists of
(i) installation of 13,500 lines of local automatic exchange equipment;
(ii) local exchange cable network and equipment to connect an additional
6,100 direct exchange lines; (iii) installation of multiplex equipment on
long distance routes to provide about 650 additional circuits; (iv) instal-
lation of UHF/VHF radio systems and outstation radio equipment to connect
U base stations; and (v) installation of telex exchanges with a total of
600 lines and provision of 500 teleprinters. The total cost of the project
is US$17.2 million with an off-shore component of US$12.0 million. Certain
of the off-shore items, principally switching equipment, with a total value
of US$2 million are to be financed from P & T's own resources since some of
these goods are in the process of installation and others are being procured.
A Bank loan of $10 million would finance the rest of the off-shore items.
Internally generated funds of the P & T Department and a mall Treasury
advance during FY 1973 would finanoe the balance of the project. A detailed
cost breakdown is given in Annex I.
6.        The project is intended to extend and improve local and long
distance services and to meet as much as possible of the latent demand,
which is believed to be considerable. Ongoing works wi1l result in improved
long distance service which is expected to generate a marked upsurge in
demand; P & T has planned for an average subscriber growth rate of 13 percent
per annum up to 1975 and long-distance traffic is expected to increase by an
annual average of 45 percent.
7.        Telex services have had a similar rapid growth. During .the period
1968-71 the annual rate of growth of telex subscribers averaged 40 percent and
the equipment is now working at almost full capacity. P & T plans to replace
existing manual telex exchanges at Lae and Port Moresby with automatic equip-
ment. The improvements and provisions for adequate long distance circuits
are expected to result in an annual subscriber growth rate of 45 percent
through FY 1975.
The Pbsts and Telegraphs Department
8.        The Pbsts and Telegraphs Department, which operates under the
Administration of Papua New Guinea, would be responsible for the execution
of the project. It operates all telecommunications and postal faoilities
within the country and has a total telecommunioations staff of 1,150 of
which 400 are Australian expatriates. During the project period the numbera
of both local and expatriate staff would increase, but as a result of intensified
local recruiting and training efforts, the number of expatriates is expected
to decrease from 1976. While the Department can operate and maintain the faci-
lities satisfactorily, it does not have the capability to plan major works and
supervise construction of the proposed expansion. To assist P & T in carrying
it out, engineering consultants, to be financed by the loan, WlMl be employed



to help in the preparation of specifications and bid documents, evaluation
of bids, and planning and maintenance procedures.
9.        Until 1970, when commercial accounting and a greater degree of
financial autonomy were introduced, P & T received allocations from the
budget for operational expenses and capital development. In FY 1971 the
Departnent achieved its first operating surplus, and it is estimated that
no further subsidies from the Treasury will be required after FY 1973.
In the past grants from the Administration have been used to cover operating
losses, but advances for capital development have been considered as equity.
Although the Administration haa the right to recall its capital contribution,
with interest, it has undertaken not to do so prior to June 30, 1975. To
ensure an adequate contribution to future expansion and to meet other financial
requirements, P & T has uudertaken to earn an annual rate of return on net
telecommunications assets of at least 10 percent by FY 1975 and 12 percent
thereafter. Projections indicate that theme rates of return can be achieved
with current tariffs; if traffic increases as expected, P & T should be in a
position by FY 1976 to finance a substantial portion of future development
and pay dividends on the Administration's capital contribution without raising
rates.
Procurement
10.       All equipment to be financed by the Bank will be procured through
international competitive bidding except certain additions to existing automatic
exchanges (total value US$0.8 million) which will be ordered from the same
suppliers to ensure compatibility and standardization.
Financial Ivaluation
U.        Based on current tariffs the internal economic rate of return of the
project is estimated at 17 percent.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORTIY
12.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Administration
of Papua New Guinea, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Commonwealth
of Australia and the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided :or under
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
13.       The draft Loan Agreement follows the pattern of agrewmentis for loans
of this type when the borrower is a Government depart1nent.
14.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - REOMENUATICN
15.       I recouend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
