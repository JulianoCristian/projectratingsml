       satisfactory, sustainability likely, and the institutional\n            development impact substantial. Experience from the project\n            convey the following lessons. In a post conflict\n            environment, a clear strategic framework, and rapid\n            restoration of security provides a solid foundation for\n            project development. The broad nature of the project\n            objectives - implement major structural reforms, both in the\n            financial sector and public administration - was important,\n            as it allowed the project to respond to evolving government\n            needs, and in addition, the project's advisory services\n            provided an anchor of stability, and continuity during\n            successive governments. The strong Government commitment to\n            reform resulted in major sectoral changes in a relatively\n            short period of time, that is within about two years, the\n            Government, with Bank assistance, was able to achieve a\n            major transformation of all three state-owned banks, and\n            establish the foundation for a sound, commercially-based\n            banking system. The strong Government commitment to reform,\n            and ownership of the project, despite several changes in\n            government, were critical elements in the project's\n            success. Moreover, the continuity of the project team, and\n            close Bank supervision in a broad-based technical assistance\n            operation were critical factors in maintaining the momentum\n            of the reform program. The intensity of supervision was\n            particularly important given the lack of experience of the\n            new government, and further helped maintain the momentum of\n            the project during governmental changes. Most important, the\n            continuity of the project team-during appraisal,\n            supervision, and the preparation of follow-up projects -\n            allowed for significant levels of consolidation, and\n            consistency in the implementation of the financial sector\n            reform strategy."}, "docdt": "2003-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
