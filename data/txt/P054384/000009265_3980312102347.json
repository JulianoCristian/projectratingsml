growth by\n            supporting high priority activities under the\n            Government's economic recovery program (ERP). The\n            project will also, as part of a broader effort, support\n            institution-building and policy/program formulation,\n            facilitating efficient adoption of future assistance from\n            the international donor community. On a lesser context the\n            project will support elements of civil service reform and\n            strengthening the judiciary. The project has three\n            components: 1) The financial sector component will a)\n            support the restructuring/divestiture of state-owned-banks,\n            and b) strengthen banking infrastructure. 2) The public\n            policy and economic management component, will include,\n            public policy formulation, debt management, public\n            administration reform, and judicial system support. 3) The\n            project management and implementation component."}, "docdt": "1997-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
