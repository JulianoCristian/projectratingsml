unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            projects should be appropriately dimensioned, taking into\n            account the number of activities, the number of implementing\n            agencies and their implementing, and especially\n            coordinating, capacity. With few exceptions, project\n            preparation should ensure that projects are ready for\n            implementation as soon as they are approved. Needed\n            implementation manuals, inter-agency agreements, and terms\n            of reference for important activities, among others, should\n            all be ready before loan approval. Also, careful preparation\n            of individual activities is important to eliminate\n            inefficiencies that could otherwise be reduced with upfront\n            planning. Projects' expected outcome indicators should\n            be realistic, and should relate directly to the activities\n            financed by the respective project. They should be reviewed\n            carefully to avoid over ambitiousness, especially given the\n            lag between intermediate outcomes and their impact on\n            expected outcomes, and the many other exogenous variables\n            that may have an impact upon their achievement. Most\n            activities such as those supported by the project require\n            time and continued efforts to show results."}, "docdt": "2008-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
