1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Poverty has been historically acute in the State of Ceará (the State). At the time of appraisal of
the Ceará Basic Education Quality Improvement Project (the Project), 49.4 % of the State's 6.8
million population was considered poor using a "food only" poverty line of US$34 (R$65) per
month per capita, compared with a rate of 23 % for Brazil as a whole. A World Bank study
had indicated that the level of education was the most important determinant of poverty in the
State, where 84 % of the poor lived in homes where the head of household had less than four
years of schooling. Improvements in education were considered a top priority to reduce
poverty in Ceará.

At the time, the State Government had been pursuing programs to reduce poverty and
underdevelopment, with encouraging results.        From 1970 to 1997 the State's GDP had
increased at an average annual rate of 5.8 %, and the coverage rates for fundamental1 education
(net enrollment rates) had increased from 56.8 % in 1990 to 98.3 % in 1999.

Despite this progress, the Government of Ceará faced important challenges to ensure the
State's sustainable economic development. The most important of these challenges was to
improve the quality of its human resources. Improving the low quality of its education system,
and reducing inefficiencies and inequalities were considered fundamental to address this
challenge to the State's development. Specifically, the issues described below posed particular
challenges:

High Repetition and Age-Grade Distortion. Repetition and dropout rates in primary education
were still very high and only 46% of the students completed the 8th grade within the expected
eight years of schooling. In 2000, about 56% of students were two or more years older than
they should be for their respective grades. Age-grade distortion was the cumulative result of
late entry to school and chronic grade repetition.

Low Level of Teacher Qualification and Skills. A 1998 census carried out by SEDUC
indicated that, of a total of 39,225 active fundamental teachers in Ceará, 11,406, or 29.1%,
were considered "lay teachers" who did not meet the National Education Law (LDB)
requirements. Approximately 10% of them had not completed the eight-year fundamental
education level. Despite previous efforts to improve this situation, low teacher qualifications
was still a problem, especially at the municipal level, and was considered to be an important
factor explaining low student achievement and high repetition and dropout rates.




1The Brazilian education system offers non-mandatory early childhood (0 to 3 initial and 4 to
6 preschool) education programs (Educação Infantil); a mandatory eight-year "fundamental"
education segment (Ensino Fundamental); and a three-year secondary school level (Ensino
Médio).    Brazilian law defines "basic education" as meaning Educação Infantil, Ensino
Fundamental and Ensino Medio.



                                                                                                7

Low Student Achievement. Results of the 1997 National SAEB evaluation showed that in
Ceará the average achievement level in Portuguese was 46.5% for 4th graders and 59.4% for 8th
graders, compared with 49.4% and 65.8%, respectively, at the national level. In Mathematics,
the average achievement level for 4th graders was 27.1%, and 32.2% for 8th graders, while
national levels were 29.5% and 35.8%, respectively. The State Government was concerned
that these low rates of student achievement could affect negatively the State's prospects for
economic development, especially outside the capital.

Low Enrollment and Poor Quality of Initial and Preschool Education (0 to 6 years old).
There was increasing awareness of the crucial role played by early childhood education in
reducing repetition and evasion, and increasing student achievement. Yet, the early childhood
education programs in Ceará fell short of desired levels of coverage, quality and management.
As of 1999, overall enrollment of children aged 4 to 6 totaled 355,161, or 72.4% of the
population group; the corresponding figure for children aged 0 to 3 was 56,371, or 11.4%,
respectively. The low quality was mainly due to insufficient training of teachers and lack of
standards and materials. Of the total 18,858 preschool teachers, 7,298, or 38.7% had not
completed secondary education.

Inadequate Municipal-State System Coordination. Municipal education systems functioned
in parallel to the State's education system, complicating the process of modernization and
advancement of education in Ceará. At the 1st to 8th grade level, 184 municipal systems
attended to approximately 1.1 million students, representing 68% of public school enrollment.
State schools served approximately 520,000 students, or about 32% of total enrollment. Both
state and municipal systems operated independently with municipalities, contributing to
inefficiencies in the use of resources, inequity of opportunities and difficulties in improving
quality. SEDUC had begun several joint initiatives with the municipalities, and the Regional
Education Development Centers (CREDEs) were expected to play a crucial role in improving
state-municipal coordination.

Low Enrollment Rates and Poor Quality of Secondary Education. In 1999, enrollment in
fundamental education approached universal coverage, while only 30% of the 15 to 19 year old
age group was enrolled in secondary education. The distribution of secondary school places
was highly unequal, resulting in striking disparities among and between income groups, the
capital city and the rest of the state, and urban and rural areas. There was also an important
mismatch between secondary school curricula and labor market demand. Despite efforts to
improve their qualifications, 17% of secondary teachers did not meet the National Education
Law (LDB) requirements.

Poverty-Related Factors. Several studies had demonstrated that poverty strongly affected
children's chance of successfully completing an eight grade education. Parents' demand for
schooling for their children correlated with their own level of education, and approximately
84% of Ceará's poor (poverty, according to a "food only" poverty line, was estimated at almost
half of the State's population) households were headed by someone with less than four years of
schooling. Poor children generally had access to poorer quality schools, whether quality was
measure by the adequacy of the facility itself, the availability of textbooks and other learning
materials, or by teachers' qualifications. Poor school quality was directly linked with high
repetition and low attendance, and there was strong evidence that poverty and parents' level of
education were also key determinants of learning outcomes.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project's main objective was to promote greater quality, efficiency and equity in the
provision of education services by: (a) improving education quality in both academic
achievement (output) and learning environment (education inputs); (b) expanding access to
drop-outs and excluded youth through the use of alternative methodologies; (c) fostering equity
in the provision of education services in the poorest municipalities; and (d) strengthening the
managerial and administrative capacity of the central, regional and municipal levels to deliver
public education services efficiently.

The impact of the Project's activities was to be measured by State program and project-specific
indicators. The principle performance indicator for the Project was the percentage of 4th and
8th grade students that performed at a satisfactory level in Portuguese and Mathematics, as
measured by the standardized tests of the nationwide Basic Education Evaluation System
(SAEB). It was expected that the Project would result in a 15 percentage increase for this
indicator by December 2005.

Other key project-specific indicators were:

    · Completion rates in fundamental education (Grades 1-8) which were to be increased
        from 72 percent to 80 %, on average, in state and municipal schools;
    · Net enrollment rates in early childhood development programs which were to be raised
        from 11.4 % to 22 % for the 0-3 age group and from 72.4 % to 80 % for the 4-6 age
        group, including the non-formal programs;
    · Age-grade distortion in fundamental education which was to be reduced from 56 % to
        35 %; and
    · Access to fundamental education for drop-outs and younger workers (15- to 39-year
        olds) which was to be increased from 36 % to 41 % so that 25 % (or 90,000) of this
        population would have completed at least the first four grades of schooling.

The targets for these indicators were expected to be achieved by December 2005.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The Project Development Objectives were not revised throughout implementation. The Project
was, however, restructured in a Second Order Project Restructuring approved by the Regional
Vice President on February 9, 2007 to expand the State's Literacy Program, eliminate the
television mode of distance education and revise some outcome and performance indicators
and targets (see Annex 2).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project's main beneficiaries were to be the school-aged children enrolled in or expected to
be enrolled in public fundamental schools, who would benefit from a more efficient, equitable
and higher quality education system. In 1998, this included 1.1 million children 0 to 6 years
old and 1.3 million children 7 to 14 years old. Of these, the Project through the activities
described in Section 1.5 below was expected to benefit about 122,000 children 0 to 3 years old,
188,000 children 4 to 6 years old and 672,000 children 7 to 14 years old who would count on
access to better managed schools, adequate learning materials and programs, better prepared



                                                                                              9

and motivated teachers and higher quality education. The Project was to specifically address
the needs of native ethnic groups by providing group-appropriate construction and
rehabilitation of small schools, including equipment and materials tailored to their needs. The
Project was to address the needs of the State's over-aged students which at the time represented
58 % of its basic education population. Through accelerated programs, the Project would
benefit over-aged students in Grades 1 to 4. A piloted Telecurso program was to benefit about
150,000 older students in Grades 5 to 8. Expanded TV Education (Telensino) and Tailored
Education Programs were to benefit about 90,000 dropouts, parents and young workers aged
15 to 39 that had recently become literate. Telensino would also provide increased access to
students in Grades 1 to 8. The Project was to target Ceará's 54 poorest municipalities selected
on the basis of: (a) the Municipal Development Index (IDM), developed by the Planning
Institute of Ceará and based on 32 indicators used to rank the development standing of the
municipalities; and (b) the UNICEF typology, that identifies Ceará municipalities with the
poorest education and other social indicators. To achieve its objectives, the Project would also
provide training for 1st to 8th grade teachers, and community Health Agents and parents and
community workers that would support non-formal initial education programs.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project included five components, as follows:

Component 1:           Improving School Quality and Efficiency (US$65.7 million project
cost, without contigencies) supported activities that aimed to improve school quality and
efficiency by:    (a) carrying out in-service and continuing teacher development programs
through different modalities to raise the academic qualifications of teachers in both state and
municipal schools and to introduce more effective teaching practices; (b) supporting non-
formal early childhood development (ECD) programs by upgrading the Health Agents' (State
Health Secretariat) skills to promote these activities at the local level; (c) assuring basic
operational standards (BOS) for state schools; (d) developing "accelerated programs" to help
over-aged students accomplish two or three grades in a single school year; and (e) supporting
and upgrading the existing Pedagogical Monitoring and Support System (SAP).

The objectives of Component 1 were to be achieved through four subcomponents, as described
below.

Subcomponent 1.1, Enhancing Teacher Development and Early Childhood Development
(ECD) was designed to upgrade teachers' professional performance and ECD programs by
providing: (a) higher education programs for approximately 6,700 5th to 8th grade teachers; (b)
secondary    education    programs    for  approximately    6,400 teachers responsible for
early/preschool and 1st to 4th grade education; (c) in-service training programs to update,
expand and enrich teachers' performance; and (d) the expansion of non-formal ECD activities
through training of the community Health Agents, who would then train parents and
community workers to provide non-formal initial education.

Subcomponent 1.2, Assuring Basic Operational Standards for Schools was designed to help
upgrade state schools to attain basic operational standards (Padrões Básicos de
Funcionamento-PBF), to ensure that each school could count on the resources, conditions and
inputs that are conducive to better teaching and learning processes and outcomes. Building on
the Ministry of Education's (MEC) minimum operational standards for schools and
incorporating lessons from implementation of the Federal Government's FUNDESCOLA



                                                                                              10

(School Improvement) Program, SEDUC developed a set of Basic Operational Standards (BOS
or PBF). SEDUC's PBF model would ensure that schools had qualified teachers, adequate
physical facilities, appropriate furniture and equipment, functional learning-teaching materials,
a school or classroom library, and library books and pedagogical equipment, all adjusted to the
size, education modalities and programs of each school. It was expected to be introduced in all
of the 709 state schools by the end of the Project. Municipal systems were to be encouraged to
meet PBF by using resources from the Municipal Education Development Program
(PRODEM) under Component 3.                  Special attention was to be given to the
construction/rehabilitation of small schools, including equipment and materials, for
Portuguese-speaking local ethnic groups, which were to define their own standards.

Subcomponent 1.3, Reducing Age-grade Distortions through Accelerated Programs, was
designed to help the State's basic education students who were overage due to either late entry
into formal schooling or repetition, dropout and reentry problems catch up academically
thereby reducing the State's serious age-grade distortion in fundamental education. Following
successful experiences of other states in Brazil, this subcomponent would support the
implementation of innovative accelerated programs and TV education programs that the State
was developing to meet the needs of older students, and the training for teachers in more
effective and supportive pedagogical techniques that were designed to build students' self-
esteem and encourage the performance of over-age students. The programs and methodologies
were designed to allow motivated over-age students to accomplish two or three grades in one
year. The Project included several activities that were needed to implement an accelerated
program for over-age students in Grades 1 to 4 and an accelerated program for students in
Grades 5 to 8 as well as secondary education.

Subcomponent 1.4, Strengthening the Pedagogical Monitoring and Support System (SAP), was
designed to increase education and school quality, efficiency, and accountability through the
introduction of a new, integrated system of school supervision called the Pedagogical
Monitoring and Support System (SAP), which SEDUC had begun developing in 1996. The
SAP (later changed to SADRE) was expected to improve school supervision arrangements in
several aspects: (a) logistics, i.e., timing for visits and reviews; (b) results-based orientation
through the development and tracking of objective measures of school performance; (c) "whole
school" development feedback, involving detailed performance feedback from interdisciplinary
teams on pedagogical and managerial issues by SEDUC, directors, teachers, parents, students
and School Councils, which would then feed into the development of schools' development
plans (PDE) setting out clear goals for improvement.

Component 2:           Expanding       Access    (US$22.1     million   project   cost,   without
contingencies) supported activities that aimed at: (a) increasing access through TV education
programs (Telensino)for students in Grades 5 to 8 where no schooling at this level was
available; and (b) increasing access to education for dropouts, parents and young workers in
the 15 to 39 age group who had recently become literate through an 18-month program,
including television modules, especially designed to combine general basic education content
with activities that would help students to develop skills and abilities useful for entering the
labor market.

Component 3:           Upgrading Education in Poorer Municipalities through a Municipal
Education Development Program (PRODEM) (US$20.6 million project cost, without
contingencies) supported activities that aimed to improve educational results in the 54 poorest
municipalities in Ceará by supporting the implementation of two education programs: (a) non-



                                                                                                11

formal initial education; and (b) innovative fundamental education activities to increase the
learning achievements of students in municipal schools.

A major objective of this component was to leverage desirable policy changes at the municipal
level, where school performance was considered weakest and the state system could not exert
direct control. The PRODEM was expected to provide a strong incentive for municipalities to
modernize their education management process and bring key policies (governing, recruitment,
student assessment, basic operational standards and school autonomy, etc.) into line with those
of the state system, thereby leading to a more integrated, consistent and equitable education
system across state and municipal systems in the State.

Component 4:           Promoting Decentralization and Institutional Development (US$27.6
million project cost, without contingencies) supported activities to further the then ongoing
decentralization process at the school, regional, municipal and central levels by: (a) enhancing
school-based management activities to increase school autonomy; (b) modernizing the
processes, procedures and monitoring and evaluation capacity at all levels of the education
sector to increase accountability and efficiency in service delivery; and (c) establishing a
systematic and effective communication strategy to obtain public support for education reform
and innovation, and receive feedback from parents, teachers, students and other key
stakeholders.

The objectives of Component 4 were to be achieved through four subcomponents, as described
below.

Subcomponent 4.1, Fostering School Autonomy Strategies, supported activities aimed at
improving school management and efficiency through: (a) the design and implementation of
School Development Plans (PDE) which embodied the needs, demands and expectations of the
school and its community members; School Innovation Projects (SIPs) based on the PDEs
would then be eligible for financing under the Project. And (b) a concerted effort to redesign
and reinvigorate school councils, parent associations and student organizations through the
design and delivery of leadership training programs, design of respective operations manuals
and the establishment of mechanisms to mobilize school and community support to school
efforts, including the development of their PDEs.

Subcomponent 4.2, Strengthening Institutional Modernization, supported activities aimed to
carry out institutional modernization and strengthening of the education sector at the central,
regional and municipal levels. Specifically, it aimed to: (a) upgrade and consolidate the State
Education Evaluation System (SPAECE); (b) improve the planning and information systems to
support the reorganization of the public (both state and municipal) school systems; (c) establish
and implement staff development programs at the central, regional and municipal levels; and
(d) develop evaluation studies to determine the impact of the Project and of selected project
interventions.

Subcomponent 4.3, Building up Social Participation and Mobilization, supported activities
aimed at: (a) raising social awareness of the socio-economic and developmental value of basic
education and local schools; and (b) promoting key stakeholder participation in and support to
education and school-associated reform initiatives.




                                                                                               12

Component 5:            Project    Management       US$9.0     million   project   cost,   without
contingencies) was to finance: (a) the Project's administrative expenses; and (b) equipment,
vehicles, office supplies and technical assistance for supporting project administration.

1.6 Revised Components

Although the Project's objectives remained valid throughout implementation, and its
components were not revised, there were several adjustments in the Project's focus and its
intermediate targets that were reflected in three loan amendments, and two reallocations of loan
funds. These amendments are described below.

The first amendment to the Loan Agreement was signed on December 16, 2003, a little over
two years after loan effectiveness. At the time, the Project had been under implementation for
about 18 months, but was already facing serious problems. Due to limited counterpart funding,
implementation focused mostly on activities that were financed entirely by the Bank's loan
and/or those included in the Accelerated Results Together (ART) exercise2. The Project was
also facing problems with project management, disbursements and monitoring and evaluation,
as described in Section 2.2.        The amendment included several modifications aimed at
improving implementation arrangements and adjusting the Project towards the State's
changing priorities, as follows: (a) an increase of the overall percentage of Bank financing
from 60% to 80%, with a parallel decrease in project costs from $150 million to $112.5
million; (b) adjustments to the Project's output indicators and corresponding amendment to the
Implementation Letter (see Table 1 and Annex 2); (c) replacement of the Project's Executive
Group responsible for its coordination with a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with staff
experienced in implementing Bank-financed projects; (d) an expansion of the tailored
programs to support the Literacy Program under Component 2, which had become a high
priority for the State, and an increased allocation of funds for this program; (e) the inclusion of
the School of Public Health as a co-implementing agency that would train teachers to
complement the training of the community Health Agents, both aimed at expanding non-formal
ECD activities under Component 1; and (f) an extension of the loan's Closing Date by one year,
from June 30, 2006 to June 30, 2007.

The second amendment to the Loan Agreement was signed on March 30, 2005. Despite
expectations that project implementation would improve after signature of the first amendment,
implementation had deteriorated significantly towards the end of 2004. Along with other
actions taken to improve implementation (Section 2.2), the second amendment aimed to allow
more flexible implementation arrangements for the Literacy Program under Component 2 and
for the Municipal Education Development Program (PRODEM) under Component 3, by
allowing other institutions to participate as implementing agencies for these activities.

These two amendments did not address serious structural institutional constraints to project
implementation, particularly the lack of coordination between the PIU and the rest of SEDUC,
the weak capacity of SEDUC to guide project activities or even draft TORs and technical



2The Accelerated Results Together (ART) was an exercise delivered jointly by the State, with
the participation of all sectors, and the Bank. As a result of the ART, the State's priority areas
were identified. In order to address those priorities, ART participants determined the need for
an integrated effort by the State Government to improve the performance of its social programs.



                                                                                                 13

specifications to procure consultants and educational infrastructure and goods, the long
bureaucratic chain of approvals and clearances that often did not add value to the process, but
certainly added processing time.         Finally, these amendments did not take into account
weaknesses in the decision making process within SEDUC, which meant that even when a
problem was identified and a solution encountered, it could take many months before it was
acted upon. In 2005, these constraints were identified and corrective actions were taken
successfully.    Simultaneously, a state-wide SWAP operation was being prepared, which
included support for programs in the education sector, thus providing the right incentives for
swifter decision making.

The third amendment to the Loan Agreement processed as a Second Order Project
Restructuring was approved by the Regional Vice President on February 9, 2007. By then,
project implementation had improved. The restructuring focused on revising project outcome
and output indicators and targets to reflect the State's priorities and what was considered
achievable during implementation. The main modifications were: (a) a further expansion of
the Literacy Program under Component 2; (b) the elimination of the television mode of
distance education also under Component 2; (c) the adjustment of selected outcome and output
indicators and targets (Table 1 and Annex 2); (d) the adoption of the Bank's May 2004 revised
Procurement Guidelines; and (e) a second extension of the Loan's Closing Date from June 30,
2007 to June 30, 2008.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

A reallocation of loan proceeds was approved on December 28, 2007 which increased
allocations to Works, Literacy Grants, Consultants' Services, Training and PRODEM Grants,
and reducing allocations to Goods, School Grants, and Incremental Operating Expenses. This
reallocation was mainly to reflect actual disbursements claimed until then, and projected
requests based on activities then under implementation. A second loan reallocation was
processed in the Project's final stages, to reflect a final allocation of loan proceeds.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Project preparation was lengthy, with the Bank's support undergoing several changes in task
management. Throughout this process many expectations had been created as to activities that
were to be included. In the final phases of project preparation and loan approval, it became
difficult to exclude many of the already identified activities to streamline the Project's design
with the result that the Project became overly complex. A formal Quality at Entry Assessment
was not carried out for this Project. The factors described below are relevant in evaluating the
Project's Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry.            The Project's quality at entry was
positively influenced by several criteria:        its' strategic relevance, its poverty focus and
participatory design, and its focus on activities aimed at improving educational monitoring and
evaluation. However, because of the overwhelming importance of issues surrounding the
Project's design, risk assessment and readiness for implementation on the Project's subsequent




                                                                                                     14

implementation, the Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately
unsatisfactory:

(i) Strategic Relevance and Approach - The Project responded directly to the goals of the
existing Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and to recommendations of the Bank's Education
Sector Strategy for Brazil3. The CAS aimed to promote sustainable long-term growth, alleviate
poverty and reduce income inequity in Brazil, and gave special emphasis to support for
education. The Project responded directly to the CAS' education sector goals of achieving
universal completion of the eight-year fundamental education cycle by 2007 and improving
educational performance in basic subjects, particularly Portuguese and Mathematics. The
Bank's Education Sector Strategy for Brazil further emphasized focusing efforts to address
these goals, especially among the poor, and recommended investments in pre-school,
fundamental and middle education in the poorest states of Brazil. The Project responded
directly to these goals by: (a) focusing on interventions to improve the quality and efficiency
of basic education, both at the state and municipal level; and (b) supporting efforts aimed at
poverty alleviation and the reduction of income inequality by targeting one of the poorest states
in Brazil, and especially 54 of the state's poorest municipalities.

Project design incorporated lessons learned through a long partnership of support to Brazil's
education sector, both at the federal and state level. Specific lessons from the design and
implementation of three Northeast Basic Education Projects (Loans 1867-BR, 3604-BR, and
3663-BR), two federal FUNDESCOLA Projects (Loans 4311-BR and 4487-BR), and several
other Bank-financed projects implemented by other states guided the Project's preparation,
including the need to: (a) place emphasis on school development strategies; (b) promote the
use of Basic Standards (BOS); (c) incorporate the use of participatory processes for the
elaboration of School Development Plans; (d) promote strong cooperation between state and
municipal education systems; (e) strengthen monitoring and evaluation activities; and (f) place
emphasis on social mobilization and communications among involved parties. Instead of
focusing only on improvements at the primary level as a means of decreasing repetition and
reducing dropout rates (as previous projects had been designed), the Project addressed directly
the issue of late entry to school and lack of adequate preparation through activities to promote
and improve early childhood and preschool activities in order to reduce the number of overage
students. Project design placed a special importance on the institutional strengthening of
SEDUC in several key areas, as experience from previous projects highlighted the importance
of strong institutional capacity as a determinant of project success.

(ii) Project Design, Risk Assessment and Readiness for Implementation ­ Despite its attempt
to incorporate lessons from previous operations, the Project's design was overly ambitious.
While several project alternatives were considered in the Project Appraisal Document, the
alternatives weighed the value of different strategies for addressing proposed activities as
opposed to whether to include only some or all of the activities in the same project. The
Project's multiple activities included in five components (with various subcomponents), its
complex institutional arrangements involving implementation across multiple municipalities
(whose capacity was usually less than that of the State) and different levels of education, and
its ambitious objectives resulted in the need for intensive supervision to adjust the Project to
the Borrower's actual implementation capacity and priorities.        The issue of the Project's

complexity had been identified before Appraisal, as reflected in the Minutes of the PAD
Review Meeting on January 28, 2000, but even the resulting project design remained overly
ambitious. The Project's complexity was especially complicating in an environment where the
importance of strong institutional capacity had been identified as a key determinant of success.

The Project's risk assessment, as outlined in the PAD's table of critical risks failed to highlight
the main risks that in the end affected the Project throughout its implementation: counterpart
funding, implementation capacity, staffing changes and lack of capacity at the State level,
procurement and financial management issues, the State's bureaucratic processes, and the
macroeconomic factor, i.e. the appreciation of the Real vis-à-vis the US$, which resulted in
lack of loan funding for the completion of some project activities. As a result, overall, the
Project's risk assessment, at moderate, was underestimated.

The Project was not ready for immediate implementation when it was approved, especially
given its ambitious design and the perceived weak capacity of the implementing agency. This
was reflected in the early PSRs (now ISRs). As an example, the Summary Issues and Actions
section of the first PSR dated June 1, 2001 (six months after Board approval), highlights the
need for the Borrower to:        contract with a project administration agency, contract for
procurement support and review staffing needs. These actions were likely pre-conditions to
get the Project off to a smooth start. Terms of reference for key activities needed to get project
implementation off the ground had yet to be prepared. The second PSR dated November 29,
2001 mentioned that the "action plan for the next school year will be sent to the Bank no later
than December 30", more than one year after approval of the loan by the Bank's Board. By the
time the third PSR was prepared, Project Management was already rated as Unsatisfactory.
This was likely the direct result of the Project's implementation team not counting on the
technical assistance and skills needed to get implementation underway. Furthermore, the
Borrower was already questioning the future of the Telensino program under Component 2
since an evaluation study on the program had just been completed. Ideally, project preparation
should have counted on the finding of that evaluation, as had been suggested in the PAD
Review Meeting.       Finally, preparation of the Operational Manual containing criteria for the
selection of the municipalities and the operational mechanism for PRODEM only began in
2002.

(iii) Poverty, Social Development and Environmental Aspects ­ Almost by definition, the
Project was a Poverty Targeted Intervention. While the Project's benefits were to include the
entire school-age population, some of its interventions were to be targeted to the 54 poorest
municipalities in the State.        These included:       school Basic Operational Standards,
implementation of school development plans, expansion of early childhood development
activities, innovation in rural education and other activities supported by PRODEM.

When the Project was prepared, at least 49.4% of the population of Ceará lived below the
"food only" poverty line. Studies had demonstrated that poverty strongly affected children's
chances of successfully completing an eight-grade education. Parents' demand for schooling
for their children also correlated with their own level of education and 84% of the poor
households in Ceará were headed by someone with less than four years of schooling. The 1998
PNAD Household Survey had revealed that 29.6% of the population over 15 years of age was
illiterate, with a higher percentage among men and a heavy concentration in rural areas. There
was also strong evidence that poverty and parent's level of education were also key
determinants of learning outcomes.        Hence, the Project's focus on education access for




                                                                                                16

excluded population segments such as young workers that dropped out of school was an
important complement to its other activities.

The Project was also designed to focus on the needs of indigenous peoples of Ceará. They
were to receive special attention to address their special needs, including: culturally-relevant
courses, 20 school buildings and equipment, training of 90 indigenous teachers at the middle
school level and the provision of 24 multi-media centers in their schools.

A beneficiary assessment based on interviews with community leaders, parents, young people,
teachers and principals guided project preparation and design. The assessment confirmed the
value of education and revealed that the poor quality of education was seen as the primary
reason for school failure and dropouts (and not economic pressures). It also showed that the
links between the school and the community needed to be strengthened.                     Finally, the
assessment identified areas that required further study such as the use of television programs
that were already generating mixed reviews. The results of the beneficiary assessment and its
background studies were incorporated in the Project's design.

Since the Project did not envisage the construction of major infrastructure, it was not seen to
pose a significant environmental risk. Hence, new school construction and rehabilitation was
to follow state and municipal construction guidelines. Despite this, the Project eventually
faced delays in construction of indigenous schools since problems arose regarding the titling of
land for those schools which eventually required the approval of architectural designs by a
federal agency responsible for indigenous matters (FUNAI).

(iv) Monitoring and Evaluation - The Project's design incorporated several activities aimed
at improving monitoring and evaluation. The Project included the development of a new,
integrated system of school supervision called the Pedagogical Monitoring and Support System
(SAP), which SEDUC had begun developing in 1996. The SAP was meant to improve on
previous school supervision arrangement by improving the logistics for school supervision,
promoting an increasingly results-based orientation that focused on student achievement,
repetition, dropout and completion rates, and organizing interdisciplinary teams that would
visit and observe the school and provide comprehensive and detailed performance feedback.
The Project also provided for the upgrading and statewide implementation of SPAECE, the
State's Education Evaluation System. SPAECE was to include cognitive achievement by
subject matter, to be measured across variable such as age, type of school and education,
modality, grade, gender and geographical area. Data relative to school inputs, family and
community characteristics, and social and economic environment was to control for school and
non-school factors. SPAECE was to be implemented in close collaboration with the Federal
Ministry of Education which had developed SAEB, a national system of evaluation based on a
national sample of schools and students. SPAECE was expected to be applied in years in
which the SAEB was not carried out. Project design also contemplated the development of
impact evaluation studies of selected activities and of the Project. Monitoring and evaluation
of project activities is described in Section 2.3 below.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)

Mostly because of its ambitious design, complex institutional environment and lack of
readiness, the Project's implementation was difficult. Project Development Objective and
Implementation Performance ratings, as well as those of individual components, fluctuated


                                                                                                      17

constantly throughout implementation ranging from Satisfactory to Unsatisfactory. In reading
the Project Status Reports, it is apparent that implementation did not begin in earnest until late-
2005, or nearly five years after loan approval. By then, the Project was already facing issues
with project management, with procurement processes, with the State Government's
bureaucratic processes that required other Secretariats' approval for acquisition of goods, and
with the timely provision of adequate counterpart funds. A change in state administration in
January 2003 only aggravated implementation problems when existing project staff was
replaced with staff that lacked experience in implementing projects financed by the Bank. Still,
some progress was being made in selected activities, especially, teacher development, building
and upgrading state schools, reducing age-grade distortion and the literacy program (which had
been made a priority in the ART exercise), the implementation of PDEs, and training in school
management strategies.      In 2003, the Bank addressed some of the early implementation
obstacles, by processing the first amendment to the Loan Agreement (Section 1.6). This
amendment also adjusted the Project to the State's revised priorities.

Despite this amendment and a second amendment in 2004 the Project continued to face
important challenges.      The second loan amendment (Section 1.6) was intended to make
implementation more flexible, inter alia, by including other institutions as possible executing
agencies for PRODEM and the Literacy Program.                However, implementation had not
accelerated, and only the teacher development and literacy programs were making notable
progress. The Literacy Program was noteworthy in that its design provided for payment based
on the number of students that obtained their certification. In 2005, the Bank carried out an in-
depth review of procedural steps taken in each major activity as a statistical tool to support the
existing institutional analysis. That review identified significant institutional impediments to
implementation, in which procurement required 87 days in SEDUC, another 50 days in other
State-level agencies, before returning to SEDUC for procurement. A detailed analysis of each
of the Project's 28 main activities found a generalized state of inertia, mostly due to non-
observance of the Project's Operations Manual and/or lack of institutional capacity.            In
response to these findings, the Bank recommended: (a) the establishment of standards of
process performance within SEDUC; (b) a review of functions necessary for good project
implementation relative to existing staff; (c) differentiated treatment of the 28 main project
activities; (d) direct approval of the entire annual work program (PTA) by the State Secretariat
of Administration, instead of piecemeal approvals; (d) contracting support for project
administration and procurement; and (e) intensive supervision until supervision ratings
improved.

Around that time, given the still low pace of implementation relative to disbursement
projections, the Bank mission even recommended that the Borrower consider whether partial
cancellation of loan proceeds would be desirable.

PRODEM was finally launched and the first 60 agreements were signed at the end of 2005, six
months before the loan's original Closing Date. This, together with progress in other activities,
led to a significant improvement in the pace of implementation, despite ongoing issues in the
fiduciary area.       Disbursements began to pick up markedly, and SEDUC's success in
streamlining its internal procedures led to an increase in the procurement processes under way.

Several project activities were included in the trigger matrices of the Ceará Multi-Sector Social
Inclusion Development APL, approved in 2005 (Report No. 32487-BR dated June 20, 2005.
The Ceará SWAp, as it is known, aimed to support social inclusion objectives across six
sectors, while preserving fiscal sustainability. The Ceará SWAp included efforts aimed at



                                                                                                18

ensuring prudent fiscal management and institutional strengthening both in central and line
secretaries through results-based management and several activities in the education and other
sectors.   In education, the Ceará SWAp conditioned loan disbursements on satisfactory
implementation of the Ceará Basic Education Development Project, and established annual
disbursement-linked indicators to pace disbursements for education. These indicators included
to:     (a) improve learning achievement through the implementation of a testing
(SPAECE/SAEB) cycle building on diagnostics, action plans and implementation; (b) improve
cost effectiveness of SEDUC's operations focusing on administration, staffing, regional units
(CREDEs) beginning with studies and elaboration of recommendations and legal frameworks
followed by 2005-6 implementation of recommendations, monitoring and evaluation of results;
and (c) reduce illiterate population 15 years and older by 100,000/year for 2005-2006. Many
of the implementation difficulties the Project faced were seen to be outside of SEDUC, and it
was expected that the SWAp could assist in bringing about broad institutional improvements,
as well as support sectoral improvements that would also benefit implementation of the Project.

By the time of the Mid-Term Review in March, 2006, implementation had improved
significantly, and disbursements were accelerating. The Review noted the determination of a
new, more dynamic Project Implementation Unit (PIU) Director, as well as the strengthening
of the procurement and financial management function in the PIU . Yet, the Review also
highlighted that SEDUC faced important challenges, especially, the execution of a large
number of complex activities, involving time consuming procurement and legal issues (e.g.,
land titling for indigenous schools). Given the improved implementation performance, and the
need to reflect what the Project would be able to accomplish in its final phase of
implementation, the Mid-Term Review mission agreed to consider a Project Restructuring
which would, inter alia, extend the Loan's Closing Date by one additional year and adjust
project indicators to that which could be reasonably accomplished during the remaining
implementation period (Section 1.6).

Despite the serious implementation problems it faced throughout its life, the Project made
significant progress in its final phase. However, SEDUC still faced additional challenges, even
during the Project's final phase of implementation: (a) a significant appreciation of the Real
vis-à-vis the US$ which reduced that activities that could be financed by the Bank's loan,
especially given the higher cost-sharing that had been allowed in the third Loan Amendment;
(b) a temporary suspension of all State procurement processes until they could be analyzed by
officials of the new State Administration that had taken office in January 2007; (c) the
replacement of project staff by the new Administration; and (d) the need to conclude ongoing
construction of schools that were already in process; and (e) selection of consultants to carry
out assessments of key project-financed activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The Project's design incorporated several activities aimed at improving the State's capacity for
monitoring and evaluation of its education programs (Section 2.2). This included redesigning
the Pedagogical Monitoring and Support System (SAP) which was part of an integrated
monitoring and evaluation system, including both qualitative and quantitative indicators to
better assess/monitor schools' performance. The Project Executive Group, later replaced by a
PIU, was responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the Project, in accordance with a set of
State-level program, outcome indicators and project-specific intermediate outcome indicators
(Section 1.2). This dual approach was designed in response to concern raised during the PAD
Review Meeting regarding the use of overall state program targets and indicators to measure



                                                                                             19

the Project's implementation progress and impact. SEDUC was to present the Bank with
Annual Progress Reports on project implementation, including the targets achieved and the
proposed budgetary requirements for implementation in the subsequent year. The Project's
ISRs show that project indicators were updated periodically. They were carefully reviewed
during the Mid-Term Review, since it was important to have up-to-date information to prepare
the Project Restructuring which included a revision of the Project's expected targets. However,
despite progress in strengthening SEDUC's monitoring, the Bank's supervision team reported
continuous difficulties with obtaining up-to-date monitoring information on project activities.
Even upon completion of the Project, it was difficult to obtain reliable data and information to
include in this ICR. The State's Student Evaluation System (SPAECE) that was to be
implemented state-wide under the Project was carried out in 2005, complementing the Federal
SAEB which had been carried out in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2005.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

The Project's fiduciary arrangements were problematic practically from the very start of its
implementation. More often than not, both procurement and financial management were rated
Unsatisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory. Problems were due mostly to the absence of staff
with the knowledge of Bank procurement guidelines and financial management requirements,
including disbursement procedures. To give an example, at one point a Bank mission found
that despite continuous problems with counterpart funding, the State had spent about $10
million of its own resources on project activities without seeking reimbursement from the Bank.
These problems were exacerbated by the frequent turn-over of staff in the Project Executive
Group (later the PIU). The numerous procedural steps required to procure goods, works and
consultants' services were identified in the procedural review carried out by the Bank in 2004,
and included issues within SEDUC, between the PIU and its other units responsible for
implementation. Unfortunately, SEDUC's very success in streamlining its internal procedures
led to an increase in the number of procurement processes ready to be carried out by the PIU,
creating a bottleneck of qualified staff to carry out the procurement. At one point a supervision
mission found that only 15 out of 71 procurement processes in an annual procurement plan had
been concluded, and those that were concluded were seriously delayed.                   In the end,
procurement and financial management functions improved, but not without significant
external support, including the hiring of external consultants of international caliber.

Safeguards compliance, specifically with respect to the Project's focus on the indigenous was
relatively smooth.      The Project financed teacher training and materials tailored for the
Indigenous schools.       The main issues that constrained implementation concerned the
construction of indigenous schools which was delayed due to the need for approval of land
titling and to a lesser extent, as negotiations with FUNAI on architectural and engineering
details of the works.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and
next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

A follow-on project is not being considered. Bank assistance to the State of Ceará is being
channeled almost exclusively through the Ceará Multi-Sector Development APL. The first
phase of the APL closed on December 31, 2007, and the achievement of its development
objectives was considered Satisfactory. In education, the Implementation Completion Report


                                                                                                  20

for the Ceará SWAp notes that: (a) implementation of national and state education testing
cycles was completed; and (b) the illiterate population aged 15 and over was reduced by over
100,000. The second phase of the Ceará SWAp was approved on September 30, 2008 (Report
No. 45084-BR, dated August 29, 2008). Like the first, the second phase of this APL includes
support for expenditure programs related to basic school standards (BOS); basic educational
quality in rural and urban school zones; and cooperation between the state and municipalities,
and included disbursement-linked indicators conditioning sectoral assistance to progress in
carrying out annual student exams in the 2nd, 5th, 9th and 12th grades and expanding literacy
program to municipalities.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The Project's objectives were relevant at the time it was prepared, and continue to be very
relevant today. They are fully consistent with the Bank's 2008 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for Brazil which aims to sharpen the focus on human development contribution to the
"equity agenda" and broaden that focus to concurrently recognize the importance of human
capital and innovations for the "growth agenda". Specifically, the CPS mentions: "challenges
remain on the equity agenda, in terms of expanding job and income opportunities for the poor
by strengthening their human capital and in terms of strengthening the affordability, quality
and efficiency of service delivery. Significant regional disparities also remain, in poverty,
educational attainment, and infant- and child-mortality. Similarly, strengthening human capital
crucial to the growth agenda, in terms of developing a higher-skilled, healthier and more agile
labor force that is able to innovate and adapt innovations to boost total factor productivity".
Specifically with respect to education, the CPS noted "despite progress in expanding coverage,
Brazil must face the challenges of improving quality, performance and outcomes---or miss the
opportunities for growth and poverty reduction". It noted that Brazil suffered from the highest
repetition rate in Latin America (some 20 % of students repeated), and low educational
attainment---the population over 15 years of age had on average only 4.8 years of schooling.
The CPS also highlighted that the situation was worse for the poor who entered the system late,
left early and repeated more, citing specifically that by age 15, poor youths had completed
three years less schooling than the non-poor. Future Bank assistance for the education sector is
to focus on two levels: (a) at the strategic and policy level in the Federal Government; and (b)
at the state level (most likely through multi-sectoral SWAps) to help strengthen the
implementation of the education strategy and quality improvements in service delivery.

The Project addressed, throughout its implementation, most of the issues that are still today
seen as priorities, and the Government and the Bank showed flexibility in adjusting the Project
to those activities that had produced results.         Perhaps the best example of this was the
Government's decision, and the Bank's support, to scale up substantially the tailored education
programs for adults and youth between 15 and 39 years of age, while dropping the Telensino
mode of delivery. This adjustment alone allowed more than four times originally planned
number of adults and youth to pass literacy tests.




                                                                                             21

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)

The Project had mixed results in the achievement of its Development Objectives, despite
important progress towards meeting most of its output targets. Table 1 presents a summary of
the Project's outcome indicators, targets, adjustments in targets and final progress towards
outcomes.       For its broadest outcome indicator, educational achievement for students in
fundamental education, the Project showed generally good progress, except for achievement of
4th grade students in Portuguese. Progress in this subject/grade level actually deteriorated.
Results for achievement of Mathematics for both 4th and 8th graders, and of Portuguese for 8th
graders greatly exceeded expectations. It should be noted that while the Project's scope was
broad throughout the State, the achievement indicators based on results of the 2005 SAEB
reflect state-wide results which include results for schools that did not benefit directly from the
Project. Furthermore, SAEB has been undergoing a series of institutional and methodological
changes since its creation in 1990. Since 1997, the test measurement scale has been in a
process of improvement. This, along with significant increases in primary school enrollment
and greater effort on behalf of local governments to promote underachieving students in the
three target regions have forced SAEB to interpret student achievement across years. Given
the above than expected improvements in learning achievements in some areas and the marked
deterioration in learning achievement in another, the methodological changes call into question
the reliability of the results for purposes of comparison.

Progress towards other outcome indicators reflects activities that benefited directly from the
Project. Again, however, results are mixed, and in some cases, even contradictory. By far the
Project's most successful outcome was that of improving the literacy rate through offering
youth and adults the opportunity to further their education, which has not only a direct impact
on their opportunities but is also expected to influence their demand for education for their
children.    Dropout rates were affected differently among state and municipal schools,
declining somewhat (but not as much as expected) in municipal schools, and actually
increasing in state schools. Fundamental education completion rates increased in both state
and municipal schools, but not as much as had been expected. Repetition rates increased
markedly in both state and municipal schools. Finally, age-grade distortion in fundamental
education was reduced both as a result of children entering the early years of Fundamental
Education at the proper age. The results for age-grade distortion, which improved less than
expected, were impacted by the inclusion of overage students in the Tempo de Avançar
accelerated program in the 8th grade of fundamental education.

The Project's progress towards achievement of its expected output targets is described below,
by component. Annex 2, Outputs by Component, provides a breakdown by indicator, original
and revised targets, and actual results.


COMPONENT 1: Improving School Quality and Efficiency
(US$38.89 million total project costs, 33.6 % project cost, and 59% appraisal estimate)

ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

1.1 Enhancing Teacher Development and Early Childhood Development (ECD). Due to early
delays in the selection of methodologies and contracting, implementation of this subcomponent
was delayed and, in the end, SEDUC was unable to recover the time lost. As a result, in the
Project's restructuring, the original targets of teachers and health agents to be trained were
revised downwards (Annex 2). SEDUC established a program of university-level training for
state teachers that had already completed the secondary level. The program, called Magister,
was carried out in partnership with four public universities5 in Ceará. Teachers of several
municipal school systems also participated in the program, although their training was not
financed by the Project. A total of 4,743 state and municipal teachers were enrolled among the
four universities, although only 3,657 graduated from the program. An evaluation of the
Magister program, carried out under the Project, revealed that it brought positive results for the
teachers that participated, who gave a positive evaluation to the program, and emphasized the
theoretical and practical skills that they acquired that influenced their personal and professional
qualities. However, project design did not include an evaluation of the impact of the program
on actual classroom teaching. Upon completing the program, teachers' salaries were increased
to reflect their higher skills. A study by SEDUC revealed that 65% of the teachers that
graduated from this program were between the ages of 36 and 55 years, and counted on over
21 years of teaching experience (i.e., many of these teachers were very close to retirement).
Because of this, the high investment cost and the program's five year lag to produce returns,
SEDUC decided to discontinue the program.

The in-service training program to upgrade teachers' pedagogical skills was dropped because
of the introduction of a federal program with the same objectives. The Project provided
secondary school training to teachers in 102 municipalities under a four module, two year
program developed by the Federal Ministry of Education (MEC), called PROFORMAÇÃO,
aimed at providing secondary education diplomas to teachers in the early years of fundamental
education. A total of 3,974 teachers received their secondary school diplomas. SEDUC also
established a program to provide secondary education diplomas to preschool teachers, creating
a fifth module based on PROFORMAÇÃO. A total of 692 teachers were qualified under this
program of which 331 had already participated in PROFORMAÇÃO and 361 already had their
secondary education diploma. MEC later established formally a preschool education module




5The universities that participated were: Universidade Federal do Ceará, Universidade
Estadual do Ceará, Universidade Regional do Cariri and Universidade Vale do Acaraú



                                                                                                24

to PROFORMAÇÃO, and 134 teachers from among 11 of the poorest municipalities in Ceará
participated. These were not financed by the Project, however.

The Project had anticipated training a total of 9,000 Health Agents in educational strategies
designed to upgrade their skills in early childhood development, who would then train parents
and community workers to provide non-formal education. This target was later revised when a
mapping of the 40 participating municipalities revealed that there were only 1,627 Health
Agents and 5,605 preschool teachers in those municipalities. The original target had been
based on the overall number of Health Agent and preschool teachers throughout the entire
State. In the end, 1,325 Health Agents and 5,397 preschool teachers received training to
upgrade their skills in early childhood development.

The Project also provided 1,283 scholarships for teachers in secondary education at an average
cost of R$4,500.

1.2 Assuring Basic Operational Standards for Schools (BOS).

Based upon an exercise carried out by SEDUC that considered population growth, growth in
secondary enrollment, and pre-defined criteria of basic parameters, the Project expected to
finance a total of 35 schools, of which nine would be indigenous. To date, 21 fundamental and
secondary schools have been completed, totaling 180 classrooms, in addition to nine
indigenous schools.      Construction of two additional schools faced problems with the
construction contractor. They are expected to be completed in late 2008 with government
funding. In addition the Project financed 16 science and 180 information technology
laboratories, furniture and equipment for 27 of the completed schools (of which four were
indigenous) and textbooks and other pedagogical materials for schools at the fundamental and
secondary levels. Furniture and equipment, laboratories and textbooks for the remaining
schools had not been delivered by the Project's completion date. The Project also financed
upgrading 35 schools, either through rehabilitation or expansion, to bring them in compliance
with the BOS. Additional activities to assure BOS in state schools were included in the
schools' PDE/GIDE under Subcomponent 4.1.

1.3 Reducing Age-grade Distortion through Accelerated Programs.

Due to the delays in early implementation, the accelerated class programs for 1st to 4th grade
students, aimed at reducing the age-grade distortion, was not able to achieve its original target,
reaching only 121,551 children under the Project. The shortfall was also due to the transfer of
a large number of state fundamental education schools to the municipal governments (which
were not covered by the Program) and because of delays in the implementation of PRODEM
since this program would be used as an incentive to make the municipalities adopt SEDUC's
education policies and programs, such as the accelerated program.             Because of this
decentralization, age-grade distortion is much higher in municipal schools. In 2004, it is
estimated that 9,297 children in the 1st through 4th grades in state schools had an age/grade
distortion compared with 198,764 in the same grades in municipal schools.

The Tempo de Avançar program, an accelerated program for over-age youth (and adults
interested in completing fundamental education) reached 187,734 between 2002 and 2005.
Despite having an initial positive impact on age-grade distortion, the Program stopped
following the well tested methodology agreed during project design and results deteriorated.
This program was discontinued following a change in the State's administration, when



                                                                                               25

responsibility for this accelerated program was assumed by the municipalities. Still, it was a
strong factor in reducing the age-grade distortion in Ceará from 55.7% in 2000 to 38.5% in
2005.

1.4 Strengthening the Pedagogical Monitoring and Support System

The Project contemplated the introduction of an integrated school supervision system called
SAP (Pedagogical Monitoring and Support System) that SEDUC had begun developing in
1996. A review of the functioning of SAP carried out by SEDUC in 2003 revealed that the
system was not producing quantitative improvements or improvements in school performance,
especially in view of its high financial and human investments. In late 2003, SEDUC designed
a new system based on results-based management. The resulting Sistema de Acompanhamento
e Desenvolvimento da Rotina Escolar (SADRE) is a web-based system that provided real-time
information on, inter alia, enrollments, completions, repetitions, drop-outs, and class size by
grade level to guide decision-making by individual schools, CREDE and SEDUC. Together
with the PDEs (and now GIDEs), allow officials to monitor schools efficiently in terms of
learning achievement, school management and administrative and financial efficiency. Teams
from SEDUC, CREDE and schools were trained in how to use SADRE and all State schools in
Ceará now have information available in the system.

COMPONENT 2: Expanding Access
(US$36.53 million total project costs, 31.6 % project cost and 165.9% appraisal estimate)

ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Training through the Telensino Program aimed at students in the 5th to 8th grades was not
carried out. SEDUC carried out two different evaluation of the Telensino Program, in 2001
and 2004, which revealed that the materials used for the program, including manuals, televised
classes and technological aspects required major upgrading. An impact evaluation showed that
any upgrading of these would need to be accompanied by the hiring of qualified teachers to
implement the program. The State did not count on sufficient qualified teachers for this
purpose. Furthermore, there were issues with respect to the State's television channel through
with the program was aired, and any upgrading of the program would have required
technological improvements as well. The Telensino Program was discontinued in its then
existing state, and no financing was provided under the Project.

Given the State's high rates of illiteracy, programs to improve literacy became a priority upon
the change in the State's administration in 2003. The program to enhance the marketable
abilities and skills of youth and adults in the 15 to 39 age bracket was converted to a Literacy
Program covering those aged 15 and over (without an age limit). Under the first amendment to
the Loan Agreement and then later under the Project's restructuring, the target for the number
of youth and adults expected to pass a literacy test under this program was increased more that
four-fold.    In coordination with the municipalities, institutions of higher education, non-
governmental organizations and civil society, the Project aimed to certify 400,000 previously
illiterate citizens (against an original target of 90,000). The Project financed the educational
materials for both student and teachers to support implementation of the Literacy Program. By
mid-2007, 382,891 youth and adult had been certified, and another 42,084 were enrolled. In
the end, a total of 423,500 youth and adults were certified under the Project. This was perhaps
the most successful of the Project's activities. In addition, this activity should have longer-




                                                                                              26

term benefits as the now larger literate population should hopefully result in a greater demand
for education for their children.


COMPONENT 3: Upgrading Education in Poorer Municipalities
(US$11.8 million total project costs, 10.2 % project cost and 57.6% appraisal estimate)

ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This component aimed to improve educational results in the 54 poorest municipalities in Ceará
through non-formal initial education and innovative fundamental education activities to
increase the learning achievements of students in municipal schools.              To participate,
municipalities were selected on the basis of eligibility criteria that included: (a) relatively
recent emancipation; (b) a relatively small territory; (c) low administrative capacity; (d) poor
social infrastructure; (e) scattered rural population and (f) high ingrained poverty. The poorest
municipalities were not beneficiaries of most social programs funded by the State or the
Federal Government, and PRODEM was a compensatory strategy aimed a strengthening their
education systems. To participate, municipalities needed to: (a) recruit and appoint all
educational personnel under a transparent process; (b) participate in the SPAECE; (c) establish
or enforce the Municipal Council for Children and Youth Protection; (d) provide evidence of
compliance with the national children's rights statute; (e) establish school-level governing
councils in all schools, with representation of parent and community members; and (f) use the
Education Development and Teacher's Incentive Fund's (Fundo de Manutenção e
Desenvolvimento do Ensino Fundamental e de Valorização do Magistério or FUNDEF)
resources satisfactorily.    Once qualified through a process that was to be defined in the
PRODEM Guidelines, the municipalities would be eligible for funding for: (a) formal and
non-formal initial education and pre-school programs; (b) rehabilitation and furnishing of
primary schools to ensure BOS; (c) teacher training and teaching-learning materials for
multigrade and accelerated classes; (d) staff development training programs; and (f) technical
assistance to implement their School Development Plans (PDE).

The implementation of PRODEM got off to a slow start. In part this appeared due to a lack of
preparedness when the Loan was approved. The guidelines that would define the operational
aspects of PRODEM were finalized, and the program only began implementation after
elections in 2004. Once it became operational, the government requested to increase the
number of municipalities that would be eligible to 60 (from 54). The CREDEs assumed an
important role in promoting the program, representing SEDUC at the regional level. The 60
eligible municipalities were supported with technical assistance and submitted a total of 157
PDEs and 143 projects for financing. Implementation of BOS by these 60 municipalities
(against a target of 92, or 50% of municipalities) was an integral part of their PDEs. By 2005,
SEDUC had signed the agreements with the 60 participating municipalities. Of these, 55
municipalities had completed their projects by the completion date, and the remaining five had
completed 50% of their projects.

The Project had expected to increase the number of students in early childhood education
programs for children aged 0 to 3 from 11% to 22% (or increase enrolment to an additional
56,000 children). This target was reduced substantially through loan amendments and the
Project's restructuring, as the State decided to prioritize the early childhood programs for
children aged 4 to 6.       In the end, the Project, through PRODEM, in the 60 eligible




                                                                                              27

municipalities has enrolled about 11,030 children aged 0 to 3 in early childhood programs,
bringing the total state enrollment in this age group to 58,489 children.

The Project had expected to increase the number of students in early childhood education
programs for children aged 4 to 6 from 72% to 80% (or increase enrolment to an additional
39.000 children). As this age group became a priority for the State, the Project, through
PRODEM, increased its target to about 70,000 children aged 4 to 6 in early childhood
programs. In the end, the Project, through PRODEM, has enrolled 33,871 children aged 4 to 5
in early childhood programs, bringing the total state enrollment in this age group to 181,290
children. It was not possible to evaluate the progress towards accomplishment of the target
towards enrolment of children aged 4 to 6 in early childhood programs due to a change in age
classification of the programs during implementation. In 2003, children aged 4 to 6 were
considered enrolled in early childhood programs whereas in 2007, the year for which data is
available to evaluate the Project's progress towards its objectives, children six years of age are
included in the numbers for fundamental education (i.e., the data for 2007 early childhood
programs includes only children aged 4 and 5).6

COMPONENT 4: Promoting Decentralization and Institutional Development
(US$25.85 million total project costs, 22.4% project cost and 93.6% appraisal estimate)

ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

4.1 Fostering School Autonomy Strategies.

The Project aimed to support the design and implementation of the School Development Plan
(PDE) strategy in approximately 1,370 schools (half state, half municipal, all with at least 250
students), and, in the process, enhance community/parent participation in the decision-making
process at the school level.    In 2004, SEDUC carried out a study aimed at eliminating the
duplication of the existing school management programs. As a result of this study, SEDUC
introduced a new, single school management tool, the Gestão Integrada da Escola (GIDE) in
December 2004. SEDUC carried out intensive training of 635 school directors, technical staff
of the CREDEs (316) and of SEDUC (39), to spearhead the preparation of the 2005-2008
GIDEs. All of the state schools delivered their GIDE by July 2005. Under the new process,
schools and other units are to be evaluated annually on the basis of progress towards targets in
their respective GIDE and their actual results. By project completion, 100% of state schools
and 30% of municipal schools had developed and were implementing their GIDEs.

4.2 Strengthening Institutional Modernization.

Several activities were envisaged and implemented under this subcomponent, to help achieve
the objectives of Component 4, namely, to consolidate the decentralization process among
central, regional, municipal and school levels, while strengthening school autonomy and
involving the school and social community in the process.        SEDUC's 2003-2006 Education



6In 2007, all of the municipalities in Ceará enrolled a total of 181,290 children aged 4 and 5 in
early childhood programs against 197,572 children aged 4 to 6 enrolled in 2003. Similarly, the
60 PRODEM municipalities enrolled a total of 33,871 chidlren aged 4 and 5 in early childhood
program against 352,222 children aged 4 to 6 enrolled in 2003.



                                                                                               28

Plan, contemplated a training program for the of educational and school administration staff of
the CREDEs, and the schools' administrative units. In all, this program included training for
40 school directors in a pilot program developed by MEC on school administration, for 178
school administrative staff in a program aimed at administrative practices geared towards
educational achievement (implemented in coordination with a non-governmental organization),
and for 4,308 staff of school administrative units and of the CREDEs in continuous education
programs on educational and school administration. Technical and managerial training was
provided not only to those to whom responsibility was being transferred (CREDEs and
municipal school officials, mainly) but also to SEDUC officials who needed to have clear
knowledge on how to support those levels more effectively.

State and municipal level technical and managerial staff also received training under
PROGESTÃO (Programa de Capacitação a Distância para Gestores Escolares), a program
aimed at improving their performance and the quality of services in the educational system.
An impact evaluation of PROGESTÃO revealed that there were significant changes in the
practices of this group and of their teams, in their understanding of school administration,
especially in the public sphere and in coordinated efforts to achieve improvements in school
quality and the teaching-learning process. A total of 9,996 managers were trained, and
additionally 3,654 concluded their specialization. Seventy school directors in the Fortaleza
metropolitan area that had not participated in PROGESTÃO were awarded six month
scholarships in school management. The Project also financed scholarships for 19 staff of
SEDUC and the CREDEs in public policy at the Universidade Estadual do Ceará, and
scholarships for 5 technical staff in curriculum development, educational sociology, and other
subjects. To complement the implementation of PRODEM in the 60 targeted municipalities,
officials of the municipal secretariats of education were provided with technical assistance and
training in technical/administrative and pedagogical areas.

The 60 municipalities under PRODEM were provided technical assistance through the
CREDEs to develop and implement their PMEs and their early childhood and fundamental
education programs. In all, 107 out of 184 municipal Secretaries of Education and 2,805
directors of schools with enrolment over 150 students were trained in educational and school
management, through a decentralized program administered by the CREDEs.

In 2004, SPAECE, the State's educational evaluation system, was implemented in all state
schools, and for the first time, extended to the municipal level. In all, 2,631 public schools
(666 state schools and 1,965 municipal schools) and 187,577 students (72,787 in state schools
and 114,790 in municipal schools) were evaluated. In addition, 2,600 school directors and
9,550 teachers responded to questionnaires. Like the national SAEB, the SPAECE evaluated
performance of 4th and 8th graders in fundamental education, and those in the 3rd level of
secondary education, in both Portuguese and Mathematics. As a follow up, technical reports,
school bulletins and dissemination materials were prepared for distribution. The dissemination
materials highlighted schools that had the best results.

Between 2001 and 2004 SEDUC piloted SPAECE-NET, a large scale evaluation system
utilizing computer aided testing. In 2006, the SPAECE was again implemented, this time
covering not only all state schools, but virtually all municipal schools as well. The results of
this latest test revealed a significant improvement in achievement in 8th grade Portuguese. The
strongest improvement was in 4th grade Mathematics. The difference in SAEB and SPAECE
results might be due to the smaller universe of SAEB which does not cover rural schools or
schools with less than 200 students.



                                                                                              29

The Project also had an important emphasis on evaluation: SEDUC, CREDE and state school
directors were trained in evaluation processes, and evaluations of the CREDEs and
administrative units of selected state schools were carried out. These sought to evaluate
performance on the basis of progress towards the accomplishment of results and targets. The
Project also supported the carrying out of evaluations of three of the programs it supported:
Magister, the teacher training program; PROGESTÃO, the training program for administrative
skills; and Projeto Alfabetização é Cidadania, the literacy program.

The evaluation of Magister found that the program brought positive results to the teachers that
were trained, especially in view of the way in which the program was designed and organized
by SEDUC and the theoretical-methodological strengths brought by the participating
universities. It concluded that the program was an effective vehicle for continuous learning
programs for teachers at all levels. However, in the early years of implementation, Magister
was offered to all teachers regardless of age. Later on, acting on Bank advice, the government
began to restrict the program to teachers that would stay teaching long enough to recover the
investment.    A significant number of beneficiary teachers retired soon after completing
Magister (and received a higher pension for having completed it).

The evaluation of PROGESTÃO found that participation in the program resulted in greatly
improved performance by managers and their teams. This program is considered to have
facilitated the process of transformation of the educational system to one centered more on the
schools and their social environment.

Similarly, the evaluation of the Literacy Program, which focuses on the performance of the
various institutions and teams; the carrying out of the program, and the achievement of its
targets, was generally positive. An impact evaluation of the Project is currently being carried
out.


4.3 Building up Social Participation and Mobilization.

In order to involve municipalities and communities in the process of developing their PMEs,
the Project supported the dissemination of PRODEM. In June 2005, SEDUC and the CREDEs
organized in all 14 regional and macroregional fora involving mayors, Municipal Secretaries of
Education and their technical staff, to raise awareness of and promote support for the program.
It plans to organize similar events with the participation of community members in
participating municipalities to monitor the implementation of the PMEs. An additional seven
macroregional fora were organized around the Literacy Program between June and July 2005,
involving 146 municipalities and 378 participants. In April and June 2005 two fora on early
childhood education were organized for Municipal Secretaries of Education, the CREDEs'
Pedagogical Coordinators and specialists in early childhood programs, for a total of 600
participants.

Several activities were carried out aimed at promoting key stakeholder participation in and
support to education and school-associated reform initiatives. These included, for example:
(a) Mathematics and Portuguese Olympics; (b) school games geared at introducing state-wide
school athletics (504 schools in 142 municipalities participated); (c) College preparatory
programs targeted at 60 high-performing students; (d) SEDUC publications, to organize and
publish institutional publications; (e) green school initiative, aimed at improving the school



                                                                                             30

appearance and integrating the school with the environment; (f) SAEB Learning agents, a
program where 228 Portuguese and Mathematics teachers were trained to improve the
performance of secondary students in the 2005 SAEB; (g) extended day environments, aiming
at developing intersectoral programs, focused on the socio-cultural, economic and
environmental aspects, so that the schools could be seen as pleasant environments, conducive
to improved learning and strengthened integration between families and the communities; and
(h) international seminar on quality school transport, through seminars on the subject,
demonstration of products and services through promotional activities and round tables with
the participation of the Ministry of Transport, and other public transport agencies.


COMPONENT 5: Project Management
(US$2.48 million total project costs including front end fee, 2.1% project cost and 25%
appraisal estimate including front end fee)

ICR Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The loan financed significantly less consultants' services for Project Management than had
been anticipated during preparation. Project management was largely carried out by SEDUC
staff.  The loan financed mainly consultants to assist and train UGP staff in planning,
procurement and contracting of goods and services, and financial management and
disbursement processing.      The loan also financed the contracting of UNDP to assist in
contracting consultants, both individuals and firms.         Because of difficulties in procuring
consulting firms, UNDP mostly assisted in contracting teachers and inputs for the training
programs, paying per diems and providing teaching materials.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The Project's Appraisal Document presented a detailed economic and financial analysis. The
Project was expected to have an economic rate of return of 23% based on several assumptions
regarding its costs and benefits. The economic analysis has not been updated for this ICR.
However, a qualitative judgment of the Project's efficiency based on the assumptions in the
economic analysis in the PAD is described below.

The Project was expected to have several impacts. First, the speeding up of student flows was
expected to accelerate the entry of students in the labor market. The Tempo de Avançar
accelerated learning program for students in grades 5 to 8, who would complete secondary
school in one year was expected to bring important benefits in the short term. In the medium
term, the main impact was expected to come from the expansion of access that would be
expected to generate a substantial increase in the number of students finishing fundamental and
secondary education. In the medium to long term, the Project was expected to produce an
improvement in the efficiency of Ceará's education system through, in particular, reduced
repetition and dropout rates, and increased completion rates. The Tempo de Avançar program
performed above expectations in terms of enrollments, presumably contributing to the Project's
overall efficiency in the short term. However, it would be necessary to look at the repetition
rates of this program, as this variable was one of the most critical variables in the sensitivity
analysis. Unfortunately, however, the Project's actual outcomes on dropout and, especially,
repetition rates do not contribute positively to the Project's overall efficiency.



                                                                                                      31

As to the Project's operational efficiency, expenses for Project Management under Component
5 were significantly below original estimates. Only US$ 2.5 million equivalent, out of the
originally projected US$9.0 million were allocated to expenditures for Project Management.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and
efficiency)

The Project's overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Project's relevance
continues to be strong. It is consistent with the Brazil's current development priorities, with
the Bank's recently-completed Country Partnership Strategy, with sectoral priorities and with
those of the State of Ceará. Although the Project did make important contributions to improve
education processes and some outcomes and strengthen SEDUC and its capacity to improve
education outcomes in the State, there were important shortcomings in the achievement of its
objectives, most notably educational achievement. The less than expected decrease in dropout
rates and especially the marked increase in repetition rates in Project-supported schools
reduced the Project's expected efficiency. Although it is easier to track results attributable to
the Project's investments with these indicators (than for example to track educational
achievements), dropout, repetition and completion rates are still influenced by a number of
factors exogenous to the Project.

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

See Section 1.4

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The Project had a significant impact on strengthening the institutional environment for
education in Ceará.       Slightly over 20% of the Project's cost was devoted to activities
specifically focused on supporting the ongoing decentralization process at the school, regional,
municipal and central levels. Its focus on promoting school autonomy while upgrading the
systems and procedures, and monitoring and evaluation strengthened the capacity of
institutions at all in Ceará to continue pursuing its objectives of providing higher quality,
efficient education programs for its citizens. Despite this, continued strong efforts will be
needed to continue to improve monitoring and evaluation and ensure that the momentum
created by the Project, especially in its final phase, will be continued.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to the Project's Development Outcome is considered Moderate. While education
undoubtedly continues to be a high priority for the State, the pace and ability with which the
State can continue to address this priority will be a challenge. The Project succeeded in
generating stakeholder support at all levels for its implementation modality, and made an
important start in introducing and developing a culture of increasing accountability and
efficiency in educational service delivery and introducing monitoring and evaluation. Still, as
evidenced in the Project's outcome indicators, a sustained effort over the medium- and long-
term will likely be needed before the several activities supported by the Project---and others
beyond its scope that undoubtedly impact learning---translate into higher learning achievement
and more efficient educational systems. The institutional capacity and resources for sustaining
this effort are already stretched.

On the positive side, Bank support under the second phase of the Ceará SWAp should provide
continued assistance to the State's education sector. Still, it is not clear that this assistance
modality, where the Bank's hands-on technical assistance through supervision is limited, will
be sufficient to maintain the continuous advice and support that had been provided under the
Project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Unsatisfactory

The Bank's performance in ensuring Quality at Entry is considered Unsatisfactory. Project
preparation was supported by a US$280,000 PHRD approved on December 16, 1999. Despite
continuous support during its two-year preparation phase, Bank assistance in the preparation
process did not ensure that the Project was well designed for the following reasons. First, the
Project was over-dimensioned, contained a multitude of components some of which were not
directly related, especially in view of the Borrower's then limited institutional capacity and the
multiple levels of government administration and other implementing agencies that would be
involved. Preparation did not take into account the high degree of centralization in the State
and the multiple bureaucratic processes that this represented for the Project. Second, as
mentioned in Section 2.1 (ii), the Project was far from ready for implementation when the
Bank's loan was approved. In fact, it took a good three years from Loan approval for the
Project's implementation to begin in earnest. Third, and also as mentioned in Section 2.1 (ii),
the PAD severely underestimated the risks the Project would face; in fact, it never even
mentioned the most pressing issues it came to face throughout its implementation such as the
change in the administration which adjusted the State's priorities.           Finally, the PAD


                                                                                                33

overestimated the Project's expected outcomes, especially given the activities that were to be
financed--several of which would not have a direct impact on the learning outcomes---and the
lag with which the indicators selected could be expected to show improvement. Each of the
reasons mentioned above influenced in a different way the Project's moderately unsatisfactory
outcome.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

Given the Project's unsatisfactory Quality at Entry, the Bank's supervision effort, especially
during the latter years where implementation was in full swing, is considered Satisfactory.
After a slow start in which little activity took place and supervision did little more than provide
support so that implementation could begin, the Project began facing important challenges
(Section 2.2). From then on, Bank supervision teams attempted to play catch-up addressing
issues as they arose in an attempt to get implementation underway and on track. Its two first
amendments were an attempt to address issues that arose (but that had not been identified as
risks at entry), and focus the Project on the State's changing priorities. Fiduciary problems
plagued the Project throughout its implementation, and the Bank strived to address the issues
as and when they arose by stepping up the hands-on support provided to the Borrower. A
major effort by the Bank's supervision team at identifying procedural steps at every
administrative level of SEDUC, leading to procuring goods and services identified unnecessary
steps and bottlenecks that were subsequently eliminated to the Project's benefit.             When
implementation was finally underway for most project components, it became clear that
reaching the Project's objectives and expected outcomes was an increasingly difficult
challenge. In a last ditch effort to get the Project to maximize its results given the already large
implementation delays, the Bank worked closely with the Borrower to restructure and re-scale
the Project to address its changing priorities (i.e., emphasis for the Literacy Program) and to
limit the expected targets. Unfortunately, even a strong supervision effort was insufficient to
compensate the Project's many design flaws.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating for the Bank's overall performance is considered Moderately Satisfactory. Despite
issue with Bank's Role in Ensuring Quality at Entry, the strong, focused and pragmatic
supervision effort was willing to emphasize project activities on the State's current priorities,
providing hands-on support to get implementation underway and providing realism as to what
was realistically achievable. It was this effort that allowed the Project to achieve several of its
intermediate, output targets, although it still fell short of several of its expected outcomes.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The State's overall performance is considered Moderately Unsatisfactory for the following
reasons. First, despite its commitment to the Project, counterpart funding became an issue
affecting implementation almost from the very start. It was only with the approval and
implementation of the Ceará SWAp, which required satisfactory budgetary allocations to and
implementation of the Project, that sectoral programs became adequately funded and


                                                                                                  34

implemented. (Even so, by then the Bank had increased its disbursement percentage for most
project components.)      Similarly, the extensive and bureaucratic requirements for most
procurement processes, that involved required approvals by agencies besides SEDUC, placed
an unnecessary burden on the Project in its initial phases. These were streamlined significantly
after the Bank's supervision worked in close coordination with the State Government, and after
approval of the SWAp which also addressed these issues. Finally, while elections and their
results are outside the control of the State's Executive, the two changes of administration that
the State faced during the Project's implementation resulted in a wide-spread change in staff
responsible for implementation of its various activities. This created problems, especially with
procurement, for which staff knowledgeable in procurement became scarce at several points
during implementation. The main criticism that could be made of SEDUC's performance
relates to the large delays in taking action, once problems had been identified by supervision
missions. There was also a lack of capacity in the State Secretariat of Planning and other
central agencies that slowed all of the Project's administrative processes, including
procurement. Aide Memoires show that the alarms sounded by these missions, including
precise prescriptions, were nearly always observed by the client, but with a very long lag.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

SEDUC's performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Despite its institutional constraints,
SEDUC worked closely with the Bank on the Project's implementation. The several staffing
constraints of the PIU and SEDUC proper and other issues that arose were addressed, albeit
often with long delays. SEDUC reached out to the CREDEs to assist in implementation, and
worked well with municipalities in a new, decentralized environment. The sheer magnitude of
the demands that the Project placed on SEDUC was large, but the implementing agencies
worked closely in cooperation also with universities, non-governmental organizations and
foundations to carry out project activities.     At the same time, the Literacy Program and
PRODEM introduced many agencies involved with the implementation of parts of the Project.
This imposed an enormous burden on SEDUC's already weak capacity to monitor its activities.
Bank supervision supported SEDUC's effort to monitor the quality of the various agencies,
with the Bank's fiduciary team often playing a vital role of overseeing activities in situs until
SEDUC hired qualified staff to take over.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Although it faced tough
challenges in implementing a complex project in an often adverse environment, SEDUC did
manage to pursue many activities well, often exceeding expected output targets.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Projects should be appropriately dimensioned, taking into account the number of activities,
the number of implementing agencies and their implementing, and especially coordinating,
capacity.

With few exceptions, project preparation should ensure that projects are ready for
implementation as soon as they are approved. Needed implementation manuals, inter-agency


                                                                                             35

agreements, and Terms of Reference for important activities, among others, should all be ready
before Loan approval.       Also, careful preparation of individual activities is important to
eliminate inefficiencies that could otherwise be reduced with upfront planning.

Projects' expected outcome indicators should be realistic, and should relate directly to the
activities financed by the respective project. They should be reviewed carefully to avoid over-
ambitiousness, especially given the lag between intermediate outcomes and their impact on
expected outcomes, and the many other exogenous variables that may have an impact upon
their achievement. Most activities such as those supported by the Project require time and
continued efforts to show results.

Program-type operations, like the Ceará SWAp, can be effective vehicles to complement the
implementation provided under SILs operating in the same environment, especially insofar as
the overall regulatory and budgetary processes are concerned. They can ensure the allocation
of budget to priority programs, execution of programmed budget and streamlining processes
and taking other administrative actions. They do not, however, replace the hands-on technical
advisory support that the Bank can provide to sectoral authorities during the ordinary course of
supervision of SILs, or provide an instrument to that will lead to actual outcomes (as opposed
to inputs and outputs). Ideally, the Bank should be able to provide both types of support to
maximize the complementary nature of both, especially in a weak or changing institutional
environment where the Bank's hands-on technical advice can be considered important. Mono-
sectoral SWAps (as SWAPs were originally intended to be) could be an alternative model to
satisfy these complementary implementation objectives.

When the establishment of a PIU is justified, it is important to ensure very close cooperation
among the various agencies involved with a project's implementation.                  Part of the
difficulties faced in implementing the Project on time had to do with lack of responsiveness of
the State institutions to the demands of the Project. This, in turn, resulted in delays in decision
making by SEDUC with often disastrous consequences. For instance, delays in taking action
to correct the unnecessary bureaucratic steps leading to procurement process delays and in
staffing the PIU at critical junctures (e.g., in fiduciary functions as well as in monitoring and
evaluation functions and in vital positions of coordination between the Project and SEDUC)
were decisive factors in the difficulties in implementation faced by the Project.

New Millennium School Project ­ Executive Summary


2.   General Remarks

The New Millennium School Project - PENM is the outcome of Loan Agreement Nº 4591 ­ BR, signed by the
International Reconstruction and Development Bank (IRDB) and the Ceará State Government, worth US$ 90.0
million, with a State counterpart of US$ 22.5 million. Beginning in August 2001, its implementation period was
extended to June 30, 2008 through the Third Deed of Amendment to the Loan Agreement.

In the course of this Project, variations have occurred in the financing provided by the World Bank and the State
Government (counterpart). Under the initial terms of the Loan Agreement, the financing provided by the IRDB
accounted for 60% of the total amount proposed for the Project (US$ 150.0 million), equivalent to US$ 90.0 million,
while the counterpart financing totaled 40% (US$ 60 million). With the advent of the First Amendment and the
reduction in the amount corresponding to the State counterpart, the parity split was established at 80% for the
IRDB, equivalent to US$ 90.0 million and 20% for the State, representing US$ 22.5 million, of the total value of the
Loan, altered to US$ 112.5 million. The State complied and exceeded the proposed counterpart goal well before
the termination of the Loan Agreement.

The main objectives of the Project were:

(a) To assure quality, efficiency and equity standards for rendering education services, in terms of aspects that
     will upgrade the learning processes of the pupils, extending to all sectors of the schooling system.
(b) To extend access to the Literacy Training Programs and Basic Education for drop-outs, young workers and
     excluded young people through the use of alternative teaching and learning methodologies.
(c) To foster the equitative supply of good quality services in Basic Education.
(d) To strengthen in-school managerial and educational capacities at the central, regional, municipal and levels, in
     order to ensure efficient supplies of Basic Education services.


3.   Implementation of Components and Sub-Components and the Main Outcomes


The processes required to implement these activities were defined in order to attain the objectives established for
each Component and Sub-Component, with financing strategies that respected the procedures required for each
expenditure in order to ensure the feasibility of acquiring goods, contracting works and commissioning consulting
services within the pertinent outlay categories. The implementation of each Project Activity was related to one of
the following expenditure categories:

(a) Works;
(b) Goods;
(c) Consulting Services;
(d) Training;
(e) School Sub-Projects;
(f) PRODEM Sub-Projects;
(g) Operating Costs or Administrative Expenditures;
(h) Literacy Training Sub-Projects.

The following Table presents the outcomes attained through the main activities and programs implemented during
the Project, inherent to its various Components and Sub-Components.

New Millennium School Project - Final Project Report

The following Tables present the status of the Implementation and Outcome Indicators, referenced to the final
Project Goals planned in the PAD and in the Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement. Although several goals
have been reached from the quantitative standpoint, it is apparent that there are no conclusive data for assessing
impacts on the quality of the outcomes attained. For this purpose, a consulting agreement is in place for
conducting this assessment, particularly for the main programs implemented.

5.  Disbursements

From the effective implementation of the Project on November 6, 2001, through to the expiry of the grace period on
October 31, 2008, SEDUC submitted 45 requests for disbursements to the IRDB, totaling US$ 90,000,000.00 for
financing under the Loan Agreement. Consequently, the full amount of the loan has already been paid out into the
Special Project Account.

A proposal was presented by SEDUC on final reallocations among the Project Categories and the substitution of
amounts returned, which has already been approved by the Bank as well as by the International Affairs Bureau -
SEAIN. The following Table presents the final situation for the placement of the IRDB funds by category, after
approval of the above-mentioned final reallocation.

6.   Audits

The Audit Report on the Project for each previous financial year must be presented to the Bank by June 30
each year. The final audit of the Project Accounts (2008 financial year) was conducted by the Pelegrini e
Rodrigues Auditores Independentes audit firm in late October, with the resulting Report being forwarded in a
timely manner to the Bank for its approval by the end of this financial year.


7.   Technical Cooperation Project - UNPD

A Technical Cooperation Project was signed under the aegis of the PENM and the United Nations
Development Program ­ UNPD: BRA/04/001 Project, coming into effect on August 4, 2004 through to June
30, 2007, worth US$ 8,337,000.00, of which approximately US$ 3.3 million were effectively paid out.

The BRA/04/001 Technical Cooperation Project ­ New Millennium School (UNPD) was signed in order to
speed up the implementation of the New Millennium School Project, covered by Loan Agreement Nº 4591-
BR, financed by the World Bank, particularly for activities related to the "Consulting" and "Training"
categories.

The Project Document ­ PRODOC contained the Outcomes and Resources Matrix, addressing the main
lines of the Project (IRDB), meaning the set of activities encompassed by the various Project Components.
Due to operating difficulties, particularly with regard to diverging procedures for the acquisition and selection
of consultants for these two entities UNPD and IRDB - the SEDUC Management decided to implement
activities related only to hiring individual consultants (individual persons) especially capacity-building
instructors, as well as all input materials required for the training activities, such as hiring a logistics support
company, acquisition of educational materials, allowances and per diems for participants, among other
aspects. As the flow of funds released by the UNPD is streamlined, it was convenient and appropriate to
undertake these activities.

Additionally, many consulting agreements were signed with individual persons for a wide variety of crucial
tasks, while also ensuring the feasibility of obtaining the input materials required for the capacity-building
activities, underpinning the satisfactory implementation of the PENM activities, which will have positive
effects on the general outcomes of the Project / IRDB.


8.   Final Remarks ­ Lessons Learned

With the termination of the Project, it is appropriate to examine the lessons learned and difficulties
encountered during its implementation.

The launch of the Project was hampered by a series of difficulties and misunderstandings, which have been
remedied in the course of its activities. A factor warranting particular attention was the attempt to implement
the Project with financing similar to that of other projects under way at this Bureau, without setting up a
specific management group for its administration. The main idea was to engage the various sectors in
charge of implementing the actions, although without setting up a group trained in the management of a
Project of this type, with direct financing from the World Bank, as earlier experiences were grounded on the
implementation of subsidiary agreements through the Ministry of Education.

One of the main difficulties detected during this initial experience of implementing a project with international
financing was precisely in the human resources area. The SEDUC did not have any technical staff with
experience in implementing this type of project. In order to quality the technical staff of this Bureau, some
specific capacity-building actions were undertaken, although too brief and with insufficient detail, lacking the
necessary follow-up required to bridge these gaps. On the other hand, the capacity-building experience of
the SEDUC personnel developed on the job (from December 2005 through to late 2007) with the

satisfactory, although covering only the last two years when the Project was being implemented.

Taking decisions on hiring consultants whose profiles are more managerial and executive in order to provide
support and streamlining some procedures related to the Project was a crucial step. The Bank has been
conducting ongoing diagnoses of the weak points of the institution and drawing up forecasts of the future
needs for technical staff, although the situation had to reach a critical state before the decision on hiring was
taken.

The composition of the Project Management Unit (UGP) in the organizational model was satisfactory for the
Bank was attained only in mid-2003, continuing through to the end of the Project, although with a smaller
staff. The main characteristic of this model was the full use of the SEDUC structure, coordinated by a
technical and operating staff ­ UGP, set up close to the center where decisions are taken (Offices of the
Secretary, the Deputy Secretary and the Executive Secretary).

A noteworthy factor was the bureaucratic system and the slow implementation of activities by SEDUC,
meaning that some Project activities required more than 150 days to reach the point of being tendered out.
During the last three years of the Project, the hurdles presented by this system were noted, implementing
measures designed to enhance its efficiency.

In addition to the difficulties already mentioned above, others arose, prompted by alterations in the approach
adopted by the State Education Policy. As this Project lasted seven years, changes in the Administration
and consequently in the work teams resulted in major alterations to the Loan Agreement, as occurred with
the inclusion of the Literacy Training is Citizenship Project, which was among the main changes covered by
the First Amendment to the Loan Agreement. The process of allocating the Project content by each group
taking over the administration of the SEDUC staff resulted in significant delays in the performance of the
activities.

Some difficulties were encountered by SEDUC in the progress of some actions at the Bank, especially in the
field of competitive bidding procedures, causing delays in signing the Agreements. Outstanding among the
matters prompting the widest repercussions was the requirement for outside inspections and testing for
equipment procurement (Science and IT Laboratories and Special Education equipment); and resistance in
accepting the procedures suggested by the Bureau for acquiring books for school libraries (procurement by
batch rather than by title, as stipulated by the Bank), which resulted in a failed competitive bidding
procedure.

The supervision missions were rated as extremely important by SEDUC for tailoring the implementation of
the actions, although acknowledging that neither the Bank nor SEDUC assigned high priority to establishing
more efficient oversight and monitoring strategies for the actions, especially those implemented in a
decentralized manner. It is suggested that new teams be set up (or hired) by SEDUC for future projects in
order to oversee and assess actions under way, monitoring their outcomes.

In fact, in terms of the difficulties encountered, it must be acknowledged that the PENM reached a
satisfactory level of implementation for the planned actions. In many cases, the Government provided
funding or drew on other sources of income in order to attain the objectives established by the Project, when
it was not possible to finance the planned activities by the Bank, for some reason. The level of commitment
to the Project in the Government, rating issues related to its operationalization as top priority, also
contributed to the scope of the outcomes resulting from its implementation.

The Project Impact Assessment Report, which is now in its final phase, will pinpoint the educational
improvements arising from these investments, listing the main social benefits attained and modifications to
the Education Indicators for Ceará State.

Finally, the implementation of projects with foreign funding handled directly by the State may be considered
as quite positive, especially in sector specific terms, as this enriches the expertise of the working teams at
the central and regional levels, despite the difficulties encountered.
