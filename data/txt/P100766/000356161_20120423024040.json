for\n            Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and grantee performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: a more\n            realistic schedule will have been advisable, especially\n            since there were considerable, and properly identified,\n            risks; it may have avoided the need for an 18-month closing\n            date extension. An impending project closing date can bring\n            about the necessary actions to get a problem project back on\n            track. Frequent and intensive supervision by small\n            specialist teams can help greatly to resolve problems and\n            bottlenecks at the field level. It is important for the Bank\n            to be supportive when a project is delayed and may be closed\n            before its completion so that any commitments made by\n            Government to the communities can be met, and the\n            Government's credibility is not affected. A problem\n            identified early at appraisal can lead to a constructive\n            solution in the course of project implementation."}, "docdt": "2011-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
