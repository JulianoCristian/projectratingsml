I.TheProject

1.       The earthquakes and tsunamis which struck Indonesia and several other countries in the Indian
Ocean region on December 26, 2004, resulted in one of the worst natural disasters in recorded human
history. Across Indonesia, Aceh and Nias bore the major brunt of the disasters. In addition, another
earthquake struck Nias on March28,2005, killed more than 700 people, leveled or badly damaged some
10,000-12,000 houses, and significantlychangedthe very physicallayoutofthe island.

2.       DamageinNias is not as straightforwardlyvisible as it is inAceh. Housingdamage causedby the
earthquake struck large numbers of villages, but only a fraction o f buildings collapsed in each village.
Largernumbers were swept away on the western coast, which was also affected by the tsunami, but even
there significantnumbers of buildings remainstanding. Hence, while issues such as clarifying land titles
are much less significant in Nias than they are in Aceh, the challenge o f covering large numbers of
partiallyaffectedvillages invery isolatedareas is muchgreater.

3.       Community-based recovery planning has been at the core of the AcehNas reconstruction
planningprocessvirtually since the disaster struck on December26, 2004. It is not difficult to understand
why. Global as well as Indonesian experience show that community-basedrecovery strategies are under
most circumstances quicker, involve more affected people in their own recovery, and are more likely to
leadto sustainable solutions thantop-downstrategiescan achieve.

4.       Community-based approaches are also likely to promote local solutions to problems of social
conflict, which is extremely common in reconstructionsituations where differential damages translate
into different entitlements. Studies elsewhere in Indonesia document that community-levelnegotiations
can overcome the most common sources of conflict, and conflict-sensitivereconstructionplanning can
helpensure that in mostcases, other, incipientsources of conflicts are monitoredandmitigated.

5.       The proposed USD 51.5 million project will be built on the existing Kecamatan Development
Project(KDP), which was already operating in Nias prior to the tsunami and earthquake and now covers
the entire island. KDP consists of a facilitated planningprocess that lets communities identify their own
priorities,which are then funded througha blockgrant transferred directlyto a bank account owned by all
of the villages within the kecamatan. Fifty percent of the funding for the proposed project will come
throughan MDTF grant, andthe other 50% will be providedby GO1from national(APBN) funding.

6.       Buildingon an existingproject allows the programto get off to a fast start. To keepthe program
manageable, it is divided into 4 windows. The first window, the housing window, will be initially
confined to the four or five affected kecamatans in each of Nias's two kabupaten, for a total of 9
kecamatans and approximately 84 villages (see Annex l),although some slight adjustment to these
numbers is likely to happen during final design allocations. Project facilitators will work with
communities to prepare full village maps that show damage, reconstructionprograms, and uncovered
needs; These will be the basis for each reconstructionplan. Fundingcovers 5,000 housingunits in these
8-9 kecamatans.

7.       The second window is for schools, UNICEF has already targeted reconstruction for the 120
priority schools that were affected by the tsunami. This project will work with UNICEF and BRR to
define the next 100 priority schools (primary andjunior secondary) usingthe same needs criteria. It will
includean associatedschool quality improvementprogram.

8.       The third window will help village and kecamatan governments rebuild and equip their offices,
many of which have collapsed. It will includetraining in participatoryplanningwith a special focus on
achievingpovertyreductionby providinga basic levelof public service delivery. Ifthe proposed Support

for Poor and DisadvantagedAreas Project(SPADA) is expanded into Nias, this programwould be linked
to SPADA's district levelcapacity improvementprograms.

9.                   The fourth window is for public infrastructure that is linked to the settlement reconstruction
program.Basedon the village maps, the projectwill finance the public access and drainage infrastructure
that is neededby community.

10.                  Each window will have its own project cycle. For infrastructure, the project cycle will be the
same as that of KDP, which already includes provisions for engineering assistance and oversight. An
adjustment to the standard KDP project cycle is neededfor housing, school, and local government office
andthese changeswere introducedto the operational manual appraisedby the IDA and donor team.

11 I                 All four windows are mainly about additional construction. The project will reinforce KDP's
technical oversight and support teams. Each KRRP technical team will consist o f 4 persons. A team is
responsible for monitoring the construction of approximately 100 houses, 4 schools, 4 offices and
infrastructure.A team will cover 1to 4 villages, depending on the constructionneed. The members o f the
team have a collective responsibility for ensuring quality outputs. The detailed scope of works and
qualificationare described inthe TOR that was reviewedat appraisal.

13.                  Risks and mitigation measures - By all accounts, Nias is one of the most challenging
environments for the post-tsunami reconstructionprogram. Distances are large; communications and
logistics are poor; the availability of skills is limited; and management capacities are low. A large-scale
reconstructionprogramthat must reach isolated, traditional communities faces additionalchallenges, both
social and technical. The sudden demands for materials and the influx of significant amounts of money
will place an unprecedented demandon overallproject management.General inflation is likely to rise as
the projectaccelerates, and localizedshortageso f materialsare also likely to take place.

14.                  The proposed project includes a number of measures to mitigate these risks (see Table 4).
Nevertheless, from an overall risk management perspective this is a high-risk operation. The project
design includes periodic reviews where all stakeholders, includingthe MDTF, should step back and re-
assess progress so that any necessaryadjustments and correctiveactions can be made in time. The project
includes an enhancedsupervision framework and a heightenedrole for BRRNias.

15.                  Coordination with other donor programs - This project was prepared in close consultation
with BRR and several of the other donors working to help Nias reconstruction.AusAid in particular is
preparing an AUSD 10 million parallel operation, which is closely coordinated with the proposed
operation. ADB's water supply and sanitationproject is also workingclosely with the KDPteam; boththe
AusAid and ADB managementgroups share an office with the MDTF/IDA team and planto mountjoint
supervision visitsto field sites.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2

16.     Of special concern for this project is that, as shown inthe KRRP concept note, the original Nias
housingcommitments were sufficient to meet the needs. However, realizationof these commitments has
been a small fraction of the total, and many organizations now recognize that they will not be able to
provide the scope of assistance that they originally envisaged. BRR coordinates an effective housing
working group on Nias which is in the process of re-negotiatingmore realistic commitments. BRR,
together with the housinggroup, will confirm the final housingplan as measured by startups by no later
than December31,2006.

11. ProjectComponents

17.     The total proposedproject costs for KDP Nias is USD51.5 million. Fifty percent of the funding
for the proposedproject will come through an MDTF grant, and the other 50% will be provided by Go1
from national(APBN) funding. The Projectwill consist ofthe following components and activities:

    A. KecamatanGrants:US$46,000,000

        Housinggrants US$30,000,000
                           -
        This grant aims to cover housing reconstructioncosts basedon a structure of about 36 sq. meters.
        The housing reconstructiongrants are estimated at US$6,000 per house.' The funding under this
        component is estimatedto provideupto approximately 5,000 housinggrants.

        Schoolgrants US$7,000,000
                        -
        The grant will cover school reconstruction/repairand a linkedschool improvement program. The
        proposed project would work closely with Diknas, UNICEF, sectoral NGOs and BRR. The
        school reconstruction grant is estimated at US$50,000 per school and the cost of the school
        improvement program grants is US$2,000,000. This budget will be used to equip the school,
        providetraining, and finance other school-basedactivitiesthat will improvethe education quality
        (e.g. cultural awareness which can work with Nias Museum environmentaleducation for school
        children, etc).

    0   LocalGovernment Officegrants           - US$5,000,000
        This grant can be usedto rebuild and equip the Local Government Offices. Both subdistrict and
        village offices are eligible. Decisions on specific allocationswill be made in conjunction with a
        proposedAusAid program.

    0   Publicinfrastructuregrants US$4,000,000
                                          -
        These consist of unearmarked block grants that are transferred directly to communities for
        investing in village development linked to reconstruction. Project menus are open - with the
        exception o f a short negative list that bans civil servant salary payments, weapons, and
        environmentally destructive activities, villagers can invest the money across the full gamut of
        local priorities. It is expectedthat most o f this money will be usedto support drainage and access
        infrastructure.

    B. KecamatanPlanningGrants: US$2,000,000

        The activitiesthat will be funded are:

' Theseunit pricesare subjectto fluctuations, and would needto be kept under constantreview. The unit prices for
bothhousing, school and local governmentoffice, and infrastructurereconstructionand rehabilitationwould be
adjustedperiodically,as appropriate, basedon a review to be undertakenby the ExecutingAgency, and subject to
endorsementby BRR and approvalby IDA.

         b. Training:Consultant & Community
         c.   SocializationKabupaten

18.     The block grants support a participatory planning process that includes special measures to
involve women andthe poor.This componentprovides the village-leveltraining, facilitation, and capacity
development to carry out inclusiveplanningand to providevillage-based oversight through cross-audits,
complaints management, and quality control.

    C. Consultant Services: US$3,100,000

         a. ProjectImplementationSupport

         To expedite the settlement reconstructionand rehabilitation program, implementation support
         will be critical for mobilizingteams, preparingtraining programs, and hiring consultants. This
         component will finance immediate and medium-term technical assistance activities for (a)
         establishment and implementationof the shelter support, school, local government office grants
         and priority infrastructureblock grant schemes and financial management systems acceptable to
         IDA; (b) overall project implementation, including the hiring of field facilitators and the
         safeguards specialists; and (c) strengtheningthe capacity o f PMU and PIUs includingadditional
         operational costs to purchase office equipment.

         b. Monitoringand Evaluation

         M&E includes both quantitative and qualitative impact evaluations, participatory monitoring
         methods, corruption assessments, and independent monitoring by NGOs. KRRP's M&E
         framework is built on the overall M&E system for KDP Aceh/Nias.Additional evaluations will
         deal with the quality of housing; social conflict; and culturalsensitivities.

    D. IncrementalOperatingCosts: US$400,000

        Incrementalcost means costs arising under the Project on account of local contractual support,
        staff salaries, travel and other travel related expenses, equipment rentaland maintenance, vehicle
        operation, maintenance and repair, office rental and maintenance, material and supplies, and
        utilitiesand communications' expenses. It does not cover government salaries.

19.     The project will be attached to the existingKDP. This means that the executing agency and the
Satker are the same and they will be Iocated in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), Direktorat
PemberdayaanMasyarakat Desa (see Annex 3 for Management Structure and Annex 4 for the Project
ImplementationPlan). The MOHA satker performed well under the MDTF-financedKDP Acemias
program.

20.     The Badan Rehabilitasidan Rekonstruksi(BRR) will monitor the project's implementation.On
Nias itself, MOHA will work with BRR, the provisional and kabupaten working groups to coordinate
rehabilitation and reconstructionin Nias. InternationalNGOs are also part of this working group, and
there is a growing consensus that a consolidated village planning process, supported by various donors
and MDTFANS will be the most efficient way to work at the village level. The two other Nias project
concepts endorsed by the MDTFANS Steering Committee being the Support for Poor and Disadvantage

IV. Project Costs

21.                               Total estimated costs for the thirty six month program are $US5 1S O million. The contribution
sought from MDTFANSis $25.75 million andthe balance (50%) is financed by BRR.

                                                each district, who will appoint a Satker at the Kecamatanlevelto release and monitorthe fund.

23.                               The projectwill use KDP's flow of fundmechanismfor the infrastructurecomponent.Meanwhile
some modification will use for other three components (houses, schools and offices) whereby the
ImplementationTeam (TPKKP) will receive and manage the sub-grant directly. This reduces the risk of
excessively large grants pooling in the kecamatan accounts. Annex 5 shows the project flow of fund
mechanismproposedfor KRRP.

V. Procurement

24.     Procurement ImplementationArrangements. This project is basically an "extension" of the
existing Third Kecamatan Development Project (KDP 3) and the management o f this project will be
attachedto that of KDP 3. Existingcontrol systems that are applicable under KDP 3 will also be adopted
for this Project. The constructionof schools, village infrastructure, and public facility buildings (which
comprises the majority of the funds under this Project) will be implemented by local communities. The
selection of all consultant services for the project and the channeling of the community funds is the
responsibilityof the DirectorateGeneral(DG) for Community and Village Empowerment of the Ministry
of HomeAffairs (PMD-MOHA).

25.     Procurement Arrangements. Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurementunder IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated
                                                                                                            I
May 2004; "Guidelines: Selection and Employmentof Consultants by IDA Borrowers"dated May 2004.
The various items under different expenditure categories are described in general below. For each
contract financed by this Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods,
estimated costs, prior review requirements, and timeframe, are all defined in the Procurement Plan. The
Procurement Plan will be updated annually, or as required, to reflect the actual project implementation
needsand improvements in institutionalcapacity.

26.     Special ProcurementProvisions. Due to the project's emergency status for Nias operation and
the urgent demand for constructing public housing in Nias, the following special arrangement will be
pursued:

    0   Extending the services of the existing National Management Consultant (NMC) firm and the
        DistrictManagementConsultantto includethe necessary inputs for Nias.

27.     Procurement of Works: Works under this project would include rehabilitation and
reconstructionworks of 5,000 houses, 100 school buildings, 100 Kecamatadvillageoffices, and public
infrastructure.Community groups will receive communitygrants for an amount of Rp 54,000,000 million
per house(US$6,000 equivalent) basedon communityproposals for the above areas of works. There will
be output based contracts between PMD-MOHA and the community groups (through the Kecamatan
PMUOffice) inthe form of subproject agreements. The standardform of subproject agreement will be in
the Project Operational Manual and will include information on: (i)the total amount o f community
grants; and (ii)the implementationschedule and the targeted works to be completed by the particular
CommunityGroups by the end of contract period.

28.     Works may be conductedthroughcontributionsfrom communities, which may be in the form of
labor and materials. In this case, procedures will be in accordance with paragraph 3.17 of the
Procurement Guidelines on "Community Participationin Procurement", as also detailed in the updated
Project Operation Manualfor KDP 3. For contributionof labor, communities may choose to includefull
or partiallabor cost inthe proposalsand/or pay salariesfor work done onthe project.

29.     Inareas where the community does not havethe capacity to construct works themselves, or where
the community groups so decide, the community may choose to hire contractors to build the houses.
These contractors will be contracted under lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of
quotations obtained from at least three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation. The
invitation includes standard specifications, required start and completion dates, an agreement format
acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings. The award will be made to the contractor who offers the
lowest price quotation for the works. No restriction on participation in the bidding is allowed. To
enhance transparency, the list o f vendors and their corresponding committed/paid amount will be


                                                   6

disclosed in the public domain, at a minimum on the information board and in the village and/or
kecamatan public accountability meetings. Customized forms that will be followed by communities to
performthis procedureare found inthe ProjectOperationManual.

30.      Selectionof Consultants. The projectwill require consultant services (a total of US$5.5 million
for the entire durationofthe Project)for the following:

    (i)      A National Management Consultant (NMC, an administration firm working at the national
              level, estimatedcontract amount ofUS$ 2,900,000 ), to administer the individualconsultants2
             & manageDistrictManagementConsultants;
    (ii)     One District Management Consultant teams (DMC - US$2,100,000 , administration firms
             working at regionallevels); to administer the individualconsultants (see footnote 1); and
    (iii)    Monitoringand evaluationconsultants (US$500,000), hiredintermittentlythroughout project
             duration (small contract for each phase of monitoring/evaluation, and therefore the selection
             wouldfollow CQS)

31.      As this is the first pilot interventionon the Nias housingreconstruction, it is very critical that a
significant number of houses are built within a short period of time within this Government FY 06. For
this purpose, the existing capacity of the Ministry of Home Affairs would provide more advantage.
Therefore, under the project implementationarrangement, the BRR (which is the ExecutingAgency for
this project) would requestthe MOHA to undertakethis Projecton its behalf.This would require that the
existing NMC and DMC consultants currently working under KDP 3 (contracted and managed by
MOHA) to be mobilized soon, especially considering the fact that this Project would follow similar
mechanism that has been in place for KDP.For this purpose, the NMC and DMC under this Project will
be single-sourcedto the existingKDP 3 NMC and DMC. These firms are already familiar with the KDP
type projects and have the management systems in place. This makes them uniquely qualifiedfor rapid
mobilizationfor this emergency project inNias.

32.      Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement. The executing agency for
the project is the DG Human Village Community Development of the Ministry of Home Affairs (PMD-
MOHA). This Project will be attached to the management of KDP 3, usingthe existing KDP 3 Central
PMU, includingthe same procurementcommittee. The large consultancy contracts under this Project will
mostly involve Single Sourcing and CQS procedures, andtherefore, the existingPMUhas the capacity to
carry out this as they are familiar with the selection of consultants under KDP 1 up to KDP 3/3B.
However, the reputation of the overall agency, coupled with the systemic environment for corruption
throughout the country, as well as the large-scale, rapidprocurement involvedin this operation, have put
the procurement risk at high. To mitigate this risk, and as part of continuous initiativesthat have been
implementedinKDP 1 upto KDP 3/3B, consultant accounts will be divided into 3 separate budget lines.
One is for payment against the salaries of individualconsultants, one is for the consultant firms' overhead
and fees, and the other one is for all operating expenses that the consultingfirms have to manage.These
accounts will be available for monitoring/audit.In additionto that, the informationrelated to the use of
community funds will be available for public access.

33.      Procurement Plan.          The Grant Recipient developed a Procurement Plan for project
implementationthat provides the basis for the procurement methods.This planwas agreed upon between
the Grant Recipientandthe ProjectTeam duringappraisal. The plan will be available at www.p2kp.or.id,
in the projects database and on the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated
annually, or as required, in agreement with the Bank's task team to reflect the actual project
implementationneeds and improvements in institutionalcapacity.

* These individual consultants arehired and contracted by PMDMOHA, but the administrationof the contracts,
hence the payment of their salaries will be under the responsibility of the NMC and DMC

                                                          7

34.    Prior Review - Prior reviewthresholds will be determined inthe ProcurementPlan. However, for
the time being, all NMCandDMC contract packagesare subjectto prior review.

35.    Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision. Inadditionto the prior reviewsupervision carried out
by the Bank offices, the capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency recommends an annual
supervisionmissionto carry out post review of procurement actions.

VI. FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements

36.    The project faces major risks with respect to how effectively grant beneficiariesuse and account
for the block grant funds. A second risk concerns the capacity of local government (kabupaten and
kecamatan) to assist and supervise project implementation. Some risk mitigation steps have been
proposed, as follows:

       To transfer project funds directly from the KPPNto the communitybank account; basedonjoint
       approval;
       To providetechnicalsupportto the nationaland localprojectmanagementteams;
       Provisionof independentreportingand monitoringby trainedfacilitators;
       Adoption proven CDD management tools and systems used under existing KDP and Housing
       projects.

37.    Overall, the project financial managementrisk is assessedas beingsubstantial. This assessment
has concluded, however, that with the implementation o f the action plan, and the risks will be
substantially mitigated. The proposed financial management arrangements will satisfy the Bank's
minimum requirements under OPBP10.02 and are adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance,
accurate and timely information on the status of the grant required by the Bank. More details of the
financialmanagementassessmentare given below.

Strengths and Weaknesses

38.    The project has several strengths and weaknesses. The project design has strengths gained by
usingCDD mechanismas follows:
       Community participate in sub-project preparation and implementation that will give better
       selection of sub-projects.
       Communities receive the fund directly in their bank account and manage the project
       implementation,limitingthe number of risky transactions;
       Communityhas stronger ownership, which may promote community control;
       Independentmonitoringand reportingby trainedfacilitators;
       Adoption of proven CDD managementtools and systems used under existingKDP and Housing
       projects, such as the proposedflow of fundmechanism, projectmonitoring.

       Someweakness notedinthe assessmentas follows:
       The capacity of community to manage and implement the sub-project may be low.
       The capacity of localgovernmentsto supervise and assist the communitygroup is low.
       Sub-project locations may overlap with other village-level projects which may create risk of
       double counting.

       The project's weaknessesmay create some risks in project implementation. The project includes
severalmechanismsto mitigatethe risks.Amongthem are:




                                                   8

        Coordination with other agencies through BRR as a coordinating agency, especially with
        kabupatenand kecamatanto assist and supervise the project implementation.However, the BRR
        Nias branch is amongthe strongest BRR offices.
        Providingtechnicalsupport to the national and local project management teams. The consultants
        will assist PMU as well as kabupaten and kecamatan (PJOK) on project administration and
        implementation.Project provisions allow for the addition of additionalexpertise, particularly for
        housingquality, shouldmonitoringshow this to be a concern.

41.     The mitigation actions to reduce the above risks include providing technical assistance and
independent monitoring to the project management operation. The project consultants will provide
technical assistance and training in project screening, financial management, procurement included
budget document preparation, disbursement mechanism, accounting and reporting. The project also
provides technical assistance for oversight and monitoring at the local level. The PMD central project
management unit (PMU) will issue the project's operational manual, includedthe above mitigationrisks.
The draft ofthe operationmanualshouldbe ready beforeprojectnegotiations.

ProjectFinancialManagementStaff

42.     DG PMD, MOHA has adequate financial management staff to manage the project. Under the
KDP project, an international financial management consultant trained a core financial management
supervision team for Nias. This team has performed well. For the new project, the team should be
consolidated andstrengthenedto cover the additionalresponsibilities.

43.     At the local level, some kecamatan that have previous KDP experience will have staff already
endowed with adequate experience and knowledge. Some other kecamatan do not have staffs that have
KDP experience or other Bank financed project. These will require an intensified training program in
financialmanagement.

Accounting and Reporting

44.     All financialtransactionfor the projectwill be recordedinthe government accounting system and
included in the government accountability reports. However, the project will prepare a separate set of
project financial reports that are suitable for project monitoring. The specific accounting procedures for
the projectfinancial reportwill be includedinthe Project Manual.The ProjectManagement Unit (PMU)
in DG PMD, MOHA and PJOK in kecamatan level will maintainseparate accounting records, on cash
basis.

45.     The community group (UPK) is also requiredto have simple accounting and financial reports.
Project consultants will assist all implementingagencies on financial administration. PMU in DG PMD,
MOHA will be responsible to preparean aggregate InterimFinancialReports(IFR) and submit this to the
Bank on quarterly basis, in formats to be agreedwith the bank. This will include informationon financial,
physicalprogress as well as procurement activities. Special purpose financial statements for this project
will be preparedannually for audit purposes.

Audit Arrangements

46.     The audit for the financial statement will be carried out by an independent auditor acceptable to
the Bank. The annual audit report will be furnishedto the Bank no later than six months after the end of
the government's fiscal year. The acceptability of auditors will take into account specific audit
methodologies that are needed to audit widely dispersed community based activities, as has been



                                                     9

established under other on-going KDP projects in the country. Project funds include support for a
heightenedaudit sample.

47.      The audit assignment will be in accordance with Terms o f Reference agreed with the Bank. The
TOR will basically includean assertion on the reliability of the project financialstatements, and will also
include a verification of accounting information at community level on the sample basis. The annual
audited financial statement will include a review and reconciliationo f Special Account transactions and
quarterlyIFR.The auditreports will be made accessibleto the public.

Disbursement Arrangement

48.      In order to facilitate disbursements, a Designated (Special) Account (DA) denominated in US
dollars will be opened by DG Treasury in the Central Bank (BI) or a commercialbank acceptable to the
Bank under the name of Ministry of Finance. DG Treasury will authorize its relevant Treasury Offices
(KPPNs) located nearby the implementationunits to authorize payments o f eligible project expenditures
by issuance of SP2D (remittance order) charging the DA. For this purpose, DG Treasury shall issue a
circular letter to the relevant KPPN Offices providing guidelines and criteria for eligible project
expenditures inaccordance with the Grant Agreement.

49.      When expenditures are due for payment, the PMUPJOK will prepare the SPP (payment
request) to the payment officer within the Satker. After documents verification, the payment officer
will issue SPM (payment order) together with the supporting documentation for submission to the
relevant KPPN. The KPPNwill checkthe budgeteligibility and issue SP2Dto the operational bank. The
operational bank will transfer the fund directly to the consultant or UPK's account and debit for the
MDF's portionto the DA

50.      The applicable disbursement methods include: 1) Advance, and 2) Reimbursement. The DA will
be solely used to finance eligible project expenditures. Although management of the DA will be under
the responsibilityof DGTreasury MOF, the CPMUat MOHA will be the one responsible to reconcile the
DA and to prepare the application for withdrawal for advances and reporting the use of the DA, duly
approved by DG Treasury before their submissions to the Bank. Copies of the DA's bank statement will
be providedto the CPMU by DGTreasury, MOF.

5 1.     The ceilingofthe advanceto DA will be variable, andthe advance(s) will be madeon the basis of
the six month projected expenditures. At early stage of project implementationan initial advance o f the
DA at $3 million would suffice. Applicationsfor reportingof use of the DA funds would be supported
by: (i)list paymentsfor contracts under Bank'sprior-reviewand records evidencingsuch expenditures, or
(ii)statementofexpenditures(SOEs)forallotherexpenses. ApplicationsfortheadvancetotheDAwill
consist of (a) proj,ectedexpenditures for six months; and (b) DA reconciliation statement. Reportingof
useof DA funds and applicationfor an advanceto DA may be submitted in a single application.

52.      Reportingon the use of funds would be based on the quarterly Interim FinancialReport (IFR)
produced by CPMU. All documentation for expenditures submitted for disbursement will be retained at
the implementingunit and would be made available to the auditors for the annual audit, and to the Bank
and its representativesifrequested.

VII. Environmentand SocialSafeguard Policies

EnvironmentalSafeguards

56.                                     KDP's standard operating procedures and engineering guidelines provideadequate mitigationfor
the main site-specific environmental risks. Special training and enhanced oversight improve site
placement and, especially drainage. The primary- and for KDP, the new - environmental risk concerns
access to sustainable harvestedtimber for reconstruction. The project's full timber risk management plan
is describedinAnnex 7.

Social Safeguards

57.                                     The main principle of KDP is that local stakeholders are the main actors who decide village
planning and manage its implementation.Using participatory planning for reconstructionhas already
been demonstrated to be an effective way to mitigate risks of heightened social conflict in Nias
communities, though the risk nevertheless remains a cause for concern. KDP's safeguard policiesalready
applied to Aceh, which has been a KDP participant for the past 5 years. Fieldreviews do not report any

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    11

significant safeguard issues. For the current project, selected safeguard issues require additional
elaboration. Inparticular, environmentalimpactassessmentand management is more likely to be relevant
becauseof pressureson timber resourcesand protectedareas duringreconstruction.Land issues may also
become relevant should any land acquisition or community restructuring take place because of the
physicalimpacts ofthe tsunami and its aftermath.

58.     The full, environmentaland social safeguard framework and Timber Management Plan for the
Nias KDP can be seen in Annexes 8 and 9. In general, safeguard policies will be addressed in the
followingmanner:

        0    Land and Asset Acquisition. Subprojects are not expected to require acquisition of
             significant amounts of land. The community is expected to use existing spaces. Housing
             reconstructionwill be only built on the existing land belongs the owner of land. School
            reconstructionhepairwill be only built in the existing land where the school buildings are.
            Public infrastructuredevelopment as much as possible will be developed by the village land
             or will be kept to a minimum and no person will be physically displaced by a sub-project
             financed under the project. Smallamounts of land, crops, trees, houses or other assets might
             needto be acquiredto allow the most effective, efficient and beneficialuse of resources. For
             example, existingvillage paths are oftenupgradedto become all-weatherroads with slightly
            wider runningsurfaces, plus shouldersand drainage ditches.

        0   Any project affected people have the right to receive compensation. The village must
             guarantee that one of the following methods is used in timely fashion to compensate the
            persons who are affected by the project/subproject (project funds absolutely cannot be used
             for compensation):
             a. Acquired land is replaced with other land of equal productivity,or with other productive
                  assets of equalvalue.
             b. Materialsand labor are givento replacepermanentstructures that are removed.
             c. Plants destroyed or missing or damaged because of construction are compensated in
                  accordance with their value.
             d. Other acceptable compensationis given.

        0    Voluntary contribution of land and /or other assets is quite common in Indonesianvillages,
            assuming that no individual loses too significant a portion of their land. Land donation is
             acceptableonly if:a) the land donator gets directbenefitfrom the projecthubprojectandthey
             are not poor people; b) project affected peoples have been informed clearly their right on
            compensation as stated in the guidelines at a public meeting and they are still willing to
            donate without any pressure. Formalminutes of the meeting shall be made and must include
            the mainpoints of discussion as well as any decisionreached, including:

            a. For voluntary contributions,the name of the donor and detailed donation
            b. For compensated assets, the names of the persons receivingcompensation, such as seen
                 inthe table-summary of compensationbelow.
            c. Inaddition,the minuteswill contain the signatures of the affected persons andthe village
                 chief. There will be notes about complaints made by the affected persons.And there will
                 be a mapshowingthe locationof the affected assets.

59.                    The kecamatan facilitator will deliver a copy of the above notes to all those people who are
affected by the project, to determine directly their wishes in regards to compensation, their perception of
whatever agreementswere reached, andtheir complaints (ifany).

                                                        The kecamatan facilitator must delay final approval until all project affected persons are
                                                        satisfied with the compensation they are to receive, even if this causes a stalemate, the

                                    0                   The kecamatan facilitator must sure that all project affected people receive compensation

        a. Right to Voice Complaints and Take Legal Action. All complaints should be handled and
                            solved at the village level. Ifthe problem cannot be solved in the village, complaints and legal
                            actionagainst these guidelines, the implementationo f agreements found inthe minutes, or other
                            grievances can be filed by the person affected or his or her representativeto the kecamatan. If
                            still not solved, it can be further submitted for a decision by the Bupati. Complaints also can be
                            sent to the Complaints HandlingUnit of KDP at the regionalor national level, where they will
                            be analyzedand an investigationorganized.

        b. Verification. At any time, all records regarding compensation, including minutes of the
                            meeting and proofof receivingcompensationmust be availablefor inspectionby the kecamatan
                            facilitator, kabupaten management consultants, auditors, and persons assigned to monitor
                            aspects o f the project by the project Secretariat or National Management Consultants. The
                           Village Minutes and evidence of compensation having been made shall be provided to the
                           kecamatan empowerment facilitator assisting the village, to supervisingengineers, auditors and
                            socio-economicmonitorswhen they undertakereviews underthe project.

       C.                  Indigenous People. In Nias, KDP has recognized that there is a risk of the exclusion of
                           vulnerable groups, includingindigenous people groups. The framework objectives will be met
                           through project design, which provide the means for participating communities to receive
                           culturally compatible benefits from the sub-projects through their informed participation. In
                           areas where indigenous people may be affected, an Indigenous People framework has been
                           developed in accordance OP 4.10 to ensure applicationof the appropriate safeguard policies. In
                           this project,the IndigenousPeople are project beneficiaries.The project framework ensures that
                           Indigenous People participate in decision making throughout project planning, implementation
                           and evaluation, and ensures that Indigenous People get benefits equal to the non- Indigenous
                           People. Inclusion of vulnerable groups (women, the poor, ethnic minority and indigenous
                           people) has been a problematicissue indevelopment projects.

      d. In CDD projects such as this one, the tendency of elite groups to dominate throughout the
                          project cycle still remains a major challenge. The socialization of the project needs to be
                          extensive to achieve greater community participation by providing full access for vulnerable

          groups to be involvedin the decision makingprocess in all project steps. The community level
          processes for KDP have tools and mechanisms in-built to make participation of marginal and
          vulnerable groups verifiable, which will guide funding decisions. Previous KDP experience
          shows that a requirement for women to be physically present in decision meetings has been
          effective in increasing women's participation in meetings, although a special effort is usually
          needed to prepare them for the meetings. Project budgets include funding for specialized
         training by qualifiedspecialists, gender and anthropologicalspecialists, and evaluations of how
          effectively women and indigenous people are participating in the reconstruction program.
          Project monitoring includes reviews with a special focus on cultural issues in indigenous
          communities, and IDA'Sprojectsupervision will includeanthropologicaloversight.

      e.  Cultural Property.The highly participatorynature of the project will ensure that communities
          would be able to identify if any proposed subproject will have an impact on cultural property
          and to ensure that the activity does not adversely affect cultural property. Subproject proposals
          will require the identification of any such activities and require the group proposing the
          subproject to specify adequate mitigationmeasures. The project will work closely with the Nias
          ethnographic museumthrough its education component, and these activities will help to ensure
          proper identificationandmitigationofany culturalrisks.

      f. The above frameworks will be made available to the public through the Bank's Project
          Information Center in Jakarta and Info Shop in Washington. The project manuals will be
         publishedand be made available to the community organizations (kecamatan and village level).
         FK and FDand other projectstaffwill be trainedinthe applicationof the safeguards manuals.

VIII. ComplaintsHandlingand Anti CorruptionStrategy

60,      Anti corruptionstrategy for the KRRP is based on the six key elements that have been identified
by the Bank's Anti-corruptionCommitteefor Indonesia(ACI) as beingcrucialto preventingcorruptionat
the project level, namely:
         0   Enhanceddisclosureprovisionandtransparency
         0   Mitigationof collusionrisks
         0   Mitigationof forgery and fraud risks
         0   Civil society oversight

         0   Complaints handlingsystem
         0   Clear definitionof sanctions andremedies

61.      The Government and the Bank have agreed that the framework and actions outlined in the Anti-
corruptionAction Plan (ACAP) shall be implementedunder the KRRP in order to reduce the possibility
of corruption, collusionandnepotism.

62.     KRRP's design is based on lessons learned and experience acquired from projects such as the
Rekompak - a post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstructionhousing projects in the province of Aceh
that is funded by the MDTF - and the KDP. Both projects use a community-based approach. KRRP
incorporatesrelevant aspects of Rekompak's and KDP's ACAP design into its own design. .

63.     Since most of the decision making on how the money will be spent will take place at the
community level, the ACAP is tailored in the way that it would deliver operational yet effective
prevention and monitoring through community participation. KRRP will benefit from the relatively
limited area coverage and also the existence of the BRR by tapping into its extensive communication
channelto enhancetransparency ofthe project.

 Risks

 65.                                    Past project experience in Nias shows that this is both a difficult and a risky environment for
 carrying out development activities. The proposed project has attempted to identify the principal risks
 and, where possible, proposemitigatoryactions incases where positiveactionis feasible. The projectalso
 includes a number of opportunitiesto "step back" and re-assess implementationso that adjustments can
 be madeas needed.

 66.                                    These are described in Table 4. Overall, the biggest implementationrisk faced by the project
 concerns the problems of managing logistics across Nias, whose infrastructurewas not very good even
 before the tsunami. BRR is usingits own budgetto identify and address critical gaps in the transportation
 infrastructure by providing emergency bridges, repairs, and other such measures. Linked to the
 transportationproblem will be the risks posed by inflation if large amounts of money are released to
 communities all building similar items. Rather than try to coordinate and manage a large-scale supply
 system, however, KRRPwill provideplanninginformationto privateand public suppliers so that they can
 pre-positionmaterials; facilitators will also be trainedto help communities contacts warehouses and seek
 out alternative sources.

67.     The project will be financed by the Multi Donor Fundfor Aceh and Nias over a three year period.
The central project management unit is the directorate general of PMD, MOHA. PMD has substantial
experience in managing similar projects in the rest of Indonesia. The purpose of the project's financial
management assessment is to determine whether the financial management system of the implementing
agency, DG PMD,MOHA has the capacity to producetimely, relevant and reliablefinancial information
onthe project activities, and ifthe accounting systemsfor the projectexpenditures and underlyinginternal
controlsare adequate to meet fiduciary objectives and allow the Bank to monitor compliance with agreed
implementation procedures and appraise progress towards its objectives.          The Bank's Financial
Management Specialist visitedNias Selatanfor the assessment.

68.     The project faces major risks with block grants implementation to sub-districts and villages,
particularly with respect to how effectively grant beneficiaries use and account for the funds that have
been used for intended purposes. There is another risk because the capacity of local government
(kabupatenandkecamatan)to assist and supervisethe project implementationis very low.

69. The followingsteps havebeenproposedto mitigatethese risks:

        To transfer the project funds directly from KPPNto the communitybank account; based onjoin
        approval
    0   To providetechnicalsupport to the nationaland local projectmanagementteams;
    0   Provisionof independentreportingandmonitoringby trainedfacilitators;
    0   Adoption proven CDD management tools and systems used under existing KDP and Housing
        projects.

70.     Overall, the project financial management risk is assessed as beingsubstantial. This assessment
has concluded that with the implementationof the action plan, the risks will be substantiallymitigated,
and the proposed financial management arrangements will satisfy the Bank's minimum requirements
under OP/BP10.02 and are adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely
information on the status of the grant required by the Bank. More details of the financial management
assessment are given below.

Summary ofProjectDescription

71.     The total proposedproject cost for KDPNias amountedto USD51.5 million. Fifty percent of the
funding for the proposed project will come through an MDF Grant and the rest will be financed by GO1
from national funding (APBN). The project will be executed through DG PMD, MOHA. The Project
covers 2 kabupaten, 9 kecamatanand 84 villages. The project will consist of the following components
and activities:

    0   Housinggrants-US$30,000,000
        This grant aims to cover housingreconstructioncosts basedon a structure of about 36 sq. meters.
        The housing reconstructiongrant is US$6,000 per house3.The funding under this component is
        estimatedto provideupto approximately 5,000 housinggrants.

        School grants -US$7,000,000
        The grant will cover school reconstructionhepair and school improvement program. The
        proposed project would work closely with Diknas, UNICEF, and sectoral NGOs. The school
        reconstructiongrants is US$50,000 per school and the school improvement program grants is
        us$2,000,000.

    0   LocalGovernmentOfficegrants US$5,000,000 -
        This grant can be usedto rebuildand equip the Local Government Office.

        Publicinfrastructuregrants-US$4,000,000
        These consist of unearmarked block grants that are transferred directly to communities for
        investingin village development. The block grants support a participatoryplanningprocess that
        includes special measures to involve women and the poor. Project menus are open - with the
        exception of a sort negative list that bans civil servant salary payments, weapons, and
        environmentally destructive activities, villagers can invest the money across the full gamut of
        local priorities.

        KecamatanPlanningGrants US$2,000,000 -
        The project will finance DOK (operational cost) of kecamatadvillages participatory planning,
        trainingof consultants andcommunity andkabupatensocializationactivities.

    0   ProjectImplementationSupport -US$3,100,000
        To expedite the settlement reconstructionand rehabilitation program, implementationsupport
        will be critical for mobilizingteams, preparingtraining programs, and hiring consultants. This
        component will finance immediate and medium-term technical assistance (TA) activities for (a)
        establishment and implementationo f the shelter support, school, local government office grants
        and priority infrastructureblock grant schemes and financial managementsystems acceptable to
        IDA; (b) overall project implementation, including the hiring and training of 100 field
        facilitators; (c) capacity building at the community level to manage project activities (i.e,,
        training of communities and local artisan on construction, disaster mitigation planning, and
        bookkeeping); and (d) strengthening the capacity of PMU and PJOKs including additional
        operational costs to purchaseoffice equipment.

        This component will include training and monitoringevaluationof the project.The Monitoring
        and Evaluation(M&E) will includequantitativeand qualitative impact evaluations, participatory
        monitoringmethods, and corruption assessments, independent monitoringby NGOs and interim
        performance audits.

        Incrementalcost will finance costs arisingunder localcontractual support, staff allowance, travel,
        other relatedexpenses. It does not includegovernmentsalaries.

 These unit prices are subject to fluctuations, and would need to be kept under constantreview. The unit prices for
housing, school and localgovernmentoffice, and infrastructurereconstruction and rehabilitationwould be adjusted
periodically, as appropriate, based on a reviewto be undertakenby the ExecutingAgency, and subject to
endorsementby BRR and approval by IDA.

Strengths and Weaknesses

72.     The project has several strengths and weaknesses. Past experience with KDP in Nias has been
positive, which suggests that the overall strengths of the community approach outweighthe weaknesses.
The projectdesignhas strengthsby usinga CDDmechanism:
    a   Community participation in sub-project preparation and implementation that will give better
        selection of sub-project,
    a   Community receive the find directly in their bank account and manage the project
        implementation,minimizingthe number of intermediate transactions;
    a   Communities have stronger ownershipwhich may create communitycontrol
    a   Independentmonitoringandreportingby trainedfacilitators
    a   Adoption of provenCDD managementtools and systems used under existingKDP and Housing
        projects, such as flow of fundmechanism, projectmonitoring,and local oversight.

73.     Someweakness noted inthe assessmentas follows:
    a   Capacity of community to manageand implement the sub-project may be weak.
    a   Capacity of local governmentto supervise and assist the communitygroup may be weak.
    e   The sub-project location on the village level may overlap with other project which may create
        risk o fdouble counting.

74.     The project's weaknesses may create some risks in the project implementation. The project
includes severalmechanismsto mitigatethe risks.Amongthem are-
    a   Coordinationwith other agencieswith BRR as a coordinatoragency in local level, especially with
        kabupatenand kecamatanto assist and supervise the project implementation.
    a   Providingtechnicalsupport to the nationaland local project managementteams. The consultants
        will assist PMU as well as kabupaten and kecamatan (PJOK) on project administration and
        implementation.

75.     The central project managementunit (PMU) will issue the project operational manual, included
on the above mitigation risks. The draft of the operation manual should be ready before the project
negotiation.

ImplementingEntity

77.     DG PMD o f MOHA is the executing agency for the project, whereas BRR will take the role as
coordinator in rehabilitationand reconstructionproject inNias and Aceh. Dueto the GOI's requirements
that budget for rehabilitations and reconstructions in Acemias needbe recorded through BRR's budget
item, BRR would delegate the execution of the budget for village grants to the local governments. The
budget for project implementation supports would be under the DG-PMD as this will be part of the
overall budget for the KDP program. Kabupaten will involve in supervision and assistance to relevant
infrastructureproject, while Kecamatan will be a Satker (PJOK) for the sub-grant implementation.DG
PMDwill responsibleto accountthe project inthe central level, while PJOK in kecamatanleveland UPK
inthe community level.

78.     There is a growing consensus that a consolidated village planningprocess, supported by various
donors and MDTFANS will be the most efficient way to work at the village level. The two other Nias
project concepts already endorsed by the MDFANS Steering Committee, the Support for Poor and
Disadvantage Areas (SPADA), and Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) will also work with, and
buildonthe platformof community facilitatorsandcommittees.

79.      The field facilitator will assist the community to set up the community who will manage and
implementthe project.The facilitatorwill also assist the communitygroup to preparethe projectfinancial
report of the sub-grant implementation. The facilitator should control and monitor a risk of overlap
activity inthe same village under differentproject.

ProjectFinancialManagementStaff

80.     DGPMD,MOHA has adequate financial managementstaffto managethe Bank financed project,
includingKecamatan Development Project (KDP). The MDTF Community Recovery through the KDP
project provided an internationalfinancial management consultant to train KDP's financial management
group. The Nias team has benefited extensively from this training. They should be retained and
strengthened to be able to cover the additional responsibilities. It is recommendedthat (a) 3 additional
financialmanagementspecialists be recruitedandtrained, which would give a total of 6 specialists for the
two kabupaten; (b) PMD retain the part-timeservices of an internationalfinancial trainerhpervisor to
providecontinuedonthejob support.

81.     At the local level, some kecamatan which have previous KDP experience will have staff with
adequate experience and knowledge. Some other kecamatando not have staffs that have KDP experience
or other Bank finance project.

82.     The mitigation actions to reduce the above risk include providing technical assistance and
independent monitoring to the project management operation. The project consultants will provide
technical assistance and training in project screening, financial management, procurement included
budget document preparation, disbursement mechanism, accounting and reporting. The project also
providestechnicalassistance for oversight and monitoringat the local level.

Accounting and Reporting

83.     All financialtransaction for the projectwill be recorded inthe government accounting systemand
included in the government accountability reports. However, the project will prepare a separate set of
project financial report which suitable for project monitoring purposes. The specific accounting
procedures for the project financial report will be included in the Project Manual. The Project



                                                     27

Management Unit (PMU) in DG PMD, MOHA and PJOK in kecamatan level will maintain separate
accounting records, on cashbasis.

84.     The community group (UPK) is also required to have simple accounting and financial reports.
Project consultants will assist all implementingagencies on financial administration. PMU in DG PMD,
MOHA will be responsible to preparean aggregate InterimFinancialReports (IFR) and submit this to the
Bank on quarterlybasis, in formats to be agreedwith the bank. This will includeinformationon financial,
physicalprogress as well as procurement activities. Special purpose financial statements for this project
will be preparedannually for audit purposes.

Audit Arrangement

85.     The audit for the financial statement will be carried out by independent auditor acceptable to the
Bank. The annual audit reportwill be furnishedto the Bank no later than six months after the end of the
government's fiscal year.       The acceptability of auditors will take into account specific audit
methodologies that are needed to audit widely dispersed community based activities, as has been
established under other on-goingKDPprojects inthe country.

86.     The audit assignment will be in accordance with the agreed Terms of Reference. The TOR will
basically include an assertion on the reliability of the project financial statements, and will also include a
verification of accounting information at community level on the sample basis. The annual audited
financialstatement will includea reviewand reconciliationof Special Account transactions and quarterly
IFR.The audit reports will be made accessibleto the public.

DisbursementArrangement

87.     In order to facilitate disbursements, a Designated (Special) Account (DA) denominated in US
dollars will be opened by DG Treasury in the CentralBank (BI) or a commercial bank acceptable to the
Bank under the name of Ministry of Finance. DG Treasury will authorize its relevant Treasury Offices
(KPPNs) located nearby the implementationunits to authorize payments of eligible project expenditures
by issuance of SP2D (remittance order) charging the DA. For this purpose, DG Treasury shall issue a
circular letter to the relevant KPPN Offices providing guidelines and criteria for eligible project
expenditures in accordance with the Grant Agreement.

88.     When expenditures are due for payment, PMUPJOK will prepare SPP (payment request) to
the payment officer within the Satker. After documents verification, the payment officer will issue
SPM (payment order) together with the supporting documentation for submission to the relevant KPPN.
The KPPN will check the budget eligibility and issue SP2D to the operational bank. The operational
bank will transfer the funddirectlyto the consultant or UPK's account and debit for the MDF's portionto
the DA.

89.     The applicable disbursement methods include: 1) Advance, and 2) Reimbursement. The DA will
be solely used to finance eligible project expenditures. Although management of the DA will be under
the responsibilityof DGTreasury MOF, the CPMU at MOHA will be the one responsibleto reconcilethe
DA and to prepare the application for withdrawal for advances and reporting the use of the DA, duly
approved by DG Treasury before their submissions to the Bank. Copies of the DA's bank statement will
be providedto the CPMUby DGTreasury, MOF.

90.     The ceilingof the advance to DA will be variable, andthe advance(s) will be made on the basis of
the six month projected expenditures. At early stage of project implementationan initial advance of the
DA at $3 million would suffice. Applications for reportingof use o f the DA funds would be supported

                       list
(ii)     statement of expenditures (SOEs) for all other expenses. Applications for the advance to the DA will
consist of (a) projected expenditures for six months; and (b) DA reconciliation statement. Reporting of
use of DA funds and applicationfor an advanceto DA may be submittedin a single application.

91.                           Reporting on the use of funds would be based on the quarterly Interim Financial Report (IFR)
producedby the CPMU. All documentationfor expenditures submittedfor disbursement will be retained
at the implementingunit and shall be made available to the auditors for the annual audit and to the Bank
and its representativesifrequested.

                                        Timber ManagementPlan

Introduction

95.       Timber supply on Nias is currently at a premium due to the intense reconstructionactivitiesthat
are occurringon the island. At present there is a limited quantity of legal timber available from Nias or
from within North SumatraNADprovinces, which has driven local market prices up. Most legal timber
comes from outside these provinces, although there has been pressure on the Forest Ministry to open or
reopen local timber harvesting areas, Huk Penguusuun Hutun (HPH). There continues to be an
unregulatedand largely unmonitoredillegaltimber market.

96.       The UNHCR has been involved in the purchase and transportation of timber and wood from
Kalimantan, delivering it free of charge to agencies and organizations involved in the rebuildingefforts
on Nias. Permittingdifficultieshave caused some delays to the timely arrival of this wood to Nias in the
recentpast, but the wood is now arriving. UNHCR's mandate for the deliveryof this wood expires at the
end of September2006, andthe UNHCRhas indicatedthat it cannot store the wood for future users. The
BRR (Boardfor the Reconstructionand Rehabilitationof Aceh and Nias) will be assumingresponsibility
for the purchase and transportation o f the timber products to Nias after the UNHCR departs. It is
presently unknownwhether or not BRRwill be obligedto seek market-rate prices for the timber.

97.       A representative of the KDP Nias management team has researched the availability of timber
resourcesin the target villages. It has beenconfirmedthat there are no sizable trees that can be harvested
for this project.

Timber ManagementPlan

Objectives

0    To support the construction of good quality, earthquake-resistant houses, schools and government
     buildingsthat will last a longtime.

     To use goodquality, legaltimber and goodquality other materials produced in a sustainablemanner

0    To reduce the average timber requirementper house significantly, where possible, and to continue to
     explore alternative constructionmaterials to achieve greater reductions in the use of wood products
     over the mediumto long-term.

0    To be sensitiveto localtraditionalbuildingtechniques, practicesand beliefs.

Proposed Building Plans

98.      KRRP building plans will be based on standard designs derived from a number of sources,
primarily from the KDPAceh engineeringlibrary.

99.      Housingdesigns will be based on a 36 mzstandard floor plan, with interior latrineand sanitation
facilities. Columns and beams will be of reinforcedconcrete, andthe raisedground slab will be concrete.
100.     Walls will use a variety of materials, depending on local sentiments and requirements. Some
areas of Nias have developed a fear of walls that are constructedentirely of mortared bricks (due to loss



                                                    30

of life during the March 2005 earthquake), and have requested that the upper portion of walls be
constructedo ftimber andwood.

101.    Roof structure designs for both reinforced concrete trusses and timber are in the library of
standarddesigns. Light steel trusses are also an option, if available and affordable. Reinforcedconcrete
trusses requirehighlyskilledlabor and quality controlthat may not be available in some parts ofNias.

102.    Village hall designs are also available. Standard designs for these buildings normally have an
open-air design, and do notfeature walls.

Forest Ministry Timber Regulations

103.    The Indonesian forestry department employs a chain of custody record system that enables the
government to track timber products from harvestinglocations to the point where the wood reaches the
consumers. The chain of custody requires stakeholders to have an SKSHH (Surat Keterangan Sahnya
Hasil Hutan) whenever the logwood/timber passes to another's hands. The field staff of the Dinas
Kehutanan (Forestry Department) in the location of the timber harvestingis responsible for issuing the
SKSHH. The S K S H H provides a recordof the origin of the timber as it progresses along the chain, from
the forest to the ultimateconsumer.

Timber and WoodProduct ProcurementMethods

104.    Timber andwood products will be acquiredinone oftwo ways:

    (a) BRRsupplied

    0   BRR is proposingto take over the responsibility,from UNHCR, of the acquisitionof timber and
        wood materials from government-sanctionedsites in other parts of Indonesia, transportationof
        these products to Nias, and transfedsale to organizations and agencies involved in the
        reconstructionefforts onNias.

    0   The KRRP will work with the BRR to make projections of how much wood will be needed for
        this project and over what time frame. BRR/KRRP technical facilitators will assess the local
        timber market in order to gauge current market conditionsand likelihoodof timber shortages or
        priceescalationsbeyondbudgetedestimates. BRRandKRRPstaff will cooperate as necessaryto
        avoidproblems with timber supply.

    (b) PurchasedinMarket

        Insome instancesthe village implementationcommitteewill chooseto purchasetimber andwood
        products in the local market. The project will require demonstration of the legal nature of this
        wood, with receiptsand SKSHH forms completedaccordingto DinasKehutananrequirements.

105.    The KRRP should assemble a list of businesses (Kilang and Panglong) in the local markets that
supply legaltimber products alongwith the requireddocumentation.




                                                  31

Monitoring andAccountability

106.    The projectwill carefully monitorthe use of timber for housingreconstruction,in order to ensure
that only legal timber procurement procedures as outlined in this plan are followed. The following
provides the essentialelementsofthe monitoringplan.

    (a) Village committees or individualhouse owners are requiredto get receipts for all purchases from
        the Panglong, Kilang or other timber outlets. The receipts should provide the following
        informationfor each shipment oftimber procured:

        0   S K S H H number, place anddate of issuance;
        0   the officer who signedthe SKSHH;
        0   the volume andtype oftimber procured; and
        0   priceofthe timber procured.

        Village committees or house owners will needto report on more than one SKSHH ifthe timber
        procured comes from more than one source or time period. Where finished door frames/A-
        frames are beingprocured from outlets other than PanglongNilangusingtimber procured within
        the same district, a `factur' only is required (indicating where the timber was purchased from).
        Where finished doors/frames are madefrom timber purchasedfrom a PanglongKilangoutside o f
        the districdcity, steps (i)to (iv) above apply.


        Responsibility:Village procurement committees or individual house owners with support from
        the Technical Facilitator.
        Timing: Ongoing

    (b) Receiptsfor timber procuredwill be attached inthe requestfor secondandthird tranches.

        Responsibility: Village Committee or individual home owner, with assistance from Technical
        Facilitator
        Timing: Duringthe submission for the secondandthirdtranches.

    (c) The TechnicalFacilitatorswill check the receipts and classify as follows:

        0   `Complete' - SKSHWFactur4number(s), date(s) of issuance and officer(s) signing clearly
            provided;
        0   `partially complete' inadequate information on the SKSHWFactur number(s), date(s) of
            issuance, and officer(s) signing; or
        0   `no information' - no SKSHWFactur informationprovided.

        Responsibility:Technical Facilitator
        Timing: Priorto submission of approvalfor the second andthirdtranches.

    (d) If (ii)or (iii)above, the Technical Facilitator will ask for further clarification from the village
        committee or house owner in order to complete required information. Incase a village committee
        or house owner is unable to provide adequate informationon the SKSHWFactur, the Technical
        Facilitator will report this to the KRRP Technical Reconstruction Facilitator. The KRRP TRF

       will trace the legality o f the timber, in consultationwith the Dinas KehutananKabupaten and/or
       Dinas KehutananPropinsi.

       Responsibility:Technical Facilitators
       Timing: Beforethe secondandthirdtranches.

Enforcement

107.   Ifmonitoringinformationindicatesthat significantamountsofillegaltimber arebeingpurchased,
the KRRPwill apply the followingapproach:

       inform the Provincial and Kabupaten Forestry Departments of the frequency of illegal timber
       procurement;
       carry out further awarenessraisingto the village committees throughthe TechnicalFacilitators;
       inthe case of persistent occurrences of illegaltimber procurement, the K W may choose not to
       pay the amount that has been spent to buy such timber. As the Project gives advance payment to
       the village committees, this amountwill be deductedfrom the nextdisbursement tranche.

                            Environmentaland Social SafeguardsFramework

Introduction


108.     KRRP supports rehabilitation and reconstructionof settlements (both rural and urban) on Nias
affected by the December 2004 tsunami and March2005 earthquake, through a block grant program for
housingand in-situinfrastructure. The projectwill buildon the existingcommunity-drivendevelopment
(CDD) mechanism evolved throughthe on-goingIDA-financedKecamatanDevelopment Project(KDP),
which has operated on Nias for several years preceding the tsunami. Based on local assessments and
eligibility criteria, the project will provide block grants to reconstruct up to approximately 5,000 new
houses, 100elementary andjunior highschools and 100 local government buildingsacross 9 kecamatans.

Objectives of the Framework

109.     The environmental and social safeguards framework provides general policies and guidelines to
serve the followingobjectives:
     a. Protecthumanhealth;
     b. Preventor compensateany loss of livelihood;
     c. Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual investments or their
          cumulativeeffects;
     d. Enhancepositiveenvironmental outcomes;
         0   Avoid or minimizeinvoluntaryresettlement;
         0   Avoid conflict among community members and strengthen the community's social
             cohesiveness;
         0   Prevent or compensate for any loss of livelihood from the loss of land or access to natural
             resourcesincludinglandbecauseofthe project; and
         0   Restorethe livingconditionsofthe affectedcommunities.

110.     Implementationof these guidelines is built into the Monitoring& Evaluationand the Technical
Reconstruction Facilitator terms o f reference, and the project provides external audits of their
implementation. The framework takes into account also Green Reconstruction Guidelines: for Policy
Makers, and Best Practice Implementation Guidance in Green Reconstruction: for Implementing
Agencies, preparedby WWF Indonesia(Feb 2005).

111.     The Project is consideredto be equivalent to World Bank "Category B", recognizingthat it will
largely involve reconstructionof pre-existing houses and infrastructure and that the average size of
individualinvestments is small.

112.     KRRPtriggersthe followingIDA environmental and social safeguards policies.

Environmental and Social Issues

Environmental Issues

113.    The project will not lead to land conversion, the destructionof environmentally sensitive areas,
historically significant sites or other cultural resources. The vast majority o f the sub-projects supported
by this projectwill be the reconstructionof houses, schools or government buildingsontheir originalsites
or very nearby.

114.    The project is built uponthe foundations laidby the KecamatanDevelopment Projects. The KDP
I11ProjectAppraisalDocument makes notethat these investments are very small, andthat they are below
the minimumsize requiredfor a formal IndonesiaEnvironmentalAssessment. The KRRP will make use
of the large body of technical and operational manuals developed by the KDP and Rekompak Aceh. A
range of environmental and engineering specialists have reviewedthese manuals, and they meet all WB
standards. The mainresourcesthat the KRRPwill use are:

        Petunjuk Teknis OperasionalPPK (TechnicalOperations Manual- KDP)
        Formulir Petunjuk Teknis Operasional PPK (Environmental Assessment Form, from the
        Technical Operation Manual- KDP)

                andphotographic manualof good andbadconstructiontechniques)

        Petunjuk Operasional UnumRekompak (General Operations Manual-Recompak)
        Petunjuk Operasional Teknis Recompak(TechnicalOperationsManual-Recompak)

115.    The acquisitionand use o f timber and wood during these reconstructions is consideredto be one
of the most significantissues facingthis project. Nias has a very limitedsupply o ftimber available and a
loggingban is currently in force. During the early stage of the reconstructionprocess on Nias, timber
availabilitybecamea majorconstraint for all organizationsactive onthe island. UNHCRhas successfully
delivered shipments of free (legal) timber to the island, but this program will be finished at the end of
September. BRRhasproposedto assume responsibilityfor the purchase and delivery o f timber and wood
productsto Nias. This issue is more fully explained in the Timber Management Plan, attached as Annex
A to this framework.



                                                     35

116.     Constructionimpacts associatedwith the public infrastructure grants and other works can include
the following items:
         inappropriatesitting (from an environmental and socio/culturalperspective, as well as possible
         future disaster events);
         inappropriatedesign andmanagementof associatedsurface water drainage;
    0    inappropriate designand managementof sanitation measures;
         improper designofwater supply systems;
         poor handlingand disposal of debris andrubble;
         poor onsite managementand constructiontechniques;
         use of hazardousconstructionmaterials (such as asbestos);
    0    Inappropriatesourcingof sand, gravel, bricksandtimber for reconstruction.

117.     Due to the very small nature of the sub-projectsthat will be sponsoredby this project, a separate
EnvironmentalManagement Planwill not be prepared. Potentialconstructionimpacts, as outlinedabove,
will be very limited in scope and will be containedto each specific sub-project site. Since homeowners
will be directly involved with the house constructions and neighboringvillagers with school rebuilding
sub-projects, poor environmental practices will generally be avoided. KRRP field and M&E personnel
will be regularlyattending sites, and will offer villager implementationcommittees guidance with respect
to proper techniques for drainage, waste handling, sanitationand constructionmanagement.

118.     KRRP staff will receive appropriate environmentalmanagement instruction during the standard
coursesprovidedto all staff, similar to the trainingprogramsprovidedto KDP I11technicalfield staff.

SocialIssues

119.     Sub-projects associated with this initiative are not expected to require acquisition of significant
amounts of land. The community is expected to use existing spaces, and the majority o f the housing
reconstructionwill be on the land belongingto the owner o f the house. School reconstructionhepairwill
be conductedon the existingland where the originalschool buildingsstoodprior to the earthquake, unless
the communitycan demonstrate a compellingreasonfor relocationand public ownership of the proposed
relocationsite. Public infrastructuredevelopment will as much as possible be developed on village land
and will be kept to a minimum. No person will be physically displaced by a sub-project financed under
the project.

120.     It could be that some land, crops, trees, houses or other assets might needto be acquiredto allow
the most effective,efficient and beneficialuse of resources. For example, existingvillage paths are often
upgradedto become all-weather roads with slightly wider runningsurfaces, plus shoulders and drainage
ditches. The so-calledright-of-waytherefore needs to be increasedone or two meters, and this can only
happen if the lands borderingthe road are acquired. Similarly, it is not always possible or desirable to
locate water supplies, latrines, bridges, markets or jetties on communally held land. The village
committee will obtain signed letters of agreement from property owners for all lands that are to be used
for public infrastructure. No sub-project funds are allowedto betransferred for landacquisition.

121.     Inclusion of vulnerable groups (women and the poor) has been a problematic issue in
development projects in Nias. In CDD projects, the tendency of elite groups to dominate throughout the
project cycle remains a major challenge. Previous supervision missions have made note of these
tendencies on Nias (ref. BTO KDP Supervision Mission and Indigenous Peoples ' Issues Review, Visit to
Kabupaten Nias, 17-25April 2001). The local KDP office's procedures and policieshave beenamended
to suit the unique social conditionson Nias, based on the recommendations arising from the April 2001

supervision mission. The KRRP will employ and build upon these Nias-basedcommunity development
techniques. Some o fthe mainexamples ofthese uniqueNias initiativesare as follows:
         institutionof a small, independent, professionalombudsman team to resolve the numerous local
         disputes andensurethat sanctionsare followedthrough.
    0    Public postings of notices of disputes, along with ombudsman's reportfindings.
    0    Hiring of a Nias-based independent monitor, along with the development o f a Nias KDP
         newsletter.
    0    Preparation of a culturally-specific communications strategy based on considerations of the
         options preferredby the communities inNias.
         Nias Islandinter-clanmeetingof respectedadat leaders.

122.     The KRRPwill conformto the indigenous people's considerationsofthe IDA SafeguardPolicies.
Transmigrationto Nias has not been an issue, since the island has traditionally been marginalized and
poor, with few unsettled areas that could be developed by migrants. However, there are discrete
indigenouspeopleliving inNias requiringspecific measuresto be undertakenby the projectto ensurethat
they are meaningfully engaged in consultation processes associated with the planning, design and
constructionof proposed infrastructure.

123.     The March2005 earthquakethat destroyedmany homesonNias has causedsome ofthe peopleto
fear living within a house that is completely constructed from bricks. A preliminary Needs Assessment
done in a village in Kecamatan Lahusa in South Nias District has brought forward at least one village
where residents have requested new houses to be constructed with walls of lower-halfbrick and upper-
half wood. The KRRP will offer a choice of housing styles from which villagers will be able to choose,
to accommodate this fear.

Environmentaland Social ManagementFramework

Environmental Framework

124.     Environmentalsafeguards policieswill be addressedinthe following manner:

    a.   KRRP technicaland field staff will receive environmental awareness instructionas part of their
         skills-trainingcourses, and will make use o f existing KDP social and environmentalchecklists,
         manuals and mitigation techniques. The checklist provides a readily-availableand easy-to-use
         form on which data can be recorded, and ensures that all items are covered during the village
         interviews. The checklist contains social        questions ranging from village population and
         demographics to the local economy and village infrastructure. Environmentalquestions include
         local water resources,potablewater supply, waste disposaland other items.


    b. Environmental screening of villages will take place as part of the Needs Assessment. The
         environmental screening will make note of such aspects of the village as topography (steep, flat,
         susceptible to landslides, etc.), local water bodies, waste handling practices, sanitation, potable
         water supply, etc. The environmentalscreening will allow KRRP senior personnel to quickly
         identify hazards or concerns, bring them to the attention of field personnel for further
         investigation,or highlight items for considerationduringsub-project design.

Social Framework

  125.                                   The Kecamatan-based Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project is conceived as a community
development driven (CDD) project, where the local stakeholders are the main actors in the decision
process during village planningof the project as well as during its implementation.Safeguards policies
will be addressedinthe following manner:

  126.                                   Land Acquisition. Sub-projects will primarily be reconstructions of housing, schools and
governmentbuildingson the original land. No land acquisitionwill be requiredfor these to take place.

  127.                                   If a homeowner or a village implementationcommittee desires to change the location of a
building that is to be reconstructed, it must be demonstrated that the property owner is in agreement.
Signedletters of agreement for the new constructionto take placeon different propertiesmust be obtained

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              38

128.     Some public infrastructure sub-projects, such as road improvements, water supply systems,
sanitation, etc., may needto be situated on or passthrough private lands. The private landowners must be
in agreement with the proposedinfrastructureworks, and must provide signed letters o f agreement to the
village implementation committee. No sub-project funds shall be disbursed nor other compensation
providedfor the right-of-wayo f public infrastructureto pass throughor be situated on private lands. The
agreements will provide for access to the private lands in order that public operations and maintenance
activitiescantake placeas required.

129.     Right to Voice Complaints and Take Legal Action. All complaints should be handled and
solved at the village level. Ifthe problem cannot be solved inthe village, complaints and grievances can
be filed by the personaffected to the kecamatan. Ifit is still not solved, it can be further submitted for a
decision by the Bupati. Complaints also can be sent to the Complaints HandlingUnit of KRRP at the
regionallevelwhere they will be analyzed and an investigationorganized.

130.     Indigenous People. KRRP has recognized that there is a risk of the exclusion of vulnerable
groups in Nias. The safeguard policy objectives will be met through project design, which provide the
means for participating communities to receive culturally compatible benefits from the sub-projects
throughtheir informedparticipation. The socialization phase of the project process will be extensive to
achieve greater communityparticipation. It will provide full access for vulnerable groups to be involved
inthe decisionmakingprocessin all projectsteps.

131.     Furthermore, KRRP's community level processes include built-in tools and mechanisms to
promote the participationof verifiable marginal and vulnerable groups, used to guide funding decisions.
For example, previous experience shows that a requirement for women to be physically present in
decision meetings has been effective in increasing women's participation in meetings, although special
effort is usually neededto prepare them for the meetings. The general strategy is to improvethe quality
o f informationthroughbetter facilitationand local language material.

132.     Cultural Property. The highly participatorynature of the project will ensure that communities
will be able to identify ifany proposedsub-project will have an impact on cultural propertyandto ensure
that the activity does not adversely affect cultural property. Sub-project proposals will require the
identificationof any such activities and require the group proposingthe sub-project to specify adequate
mitigationmeasures.

Consultationand Disclosure

133.     This environmentaland safeguards framework has been discussed with BRR, MoHA and other
relevant authoritiesat the provincialand local government levels. The Go1will disclose this framework
according to its regular procedures, e.g. project web-site. The IDA will ensure that the framework is
publishedin Info shop and the IDA Indonesia Public InformationCenter. The project manuals will be
publishedand be made available to the community organizations (kecamatan and village level) preparing
proposals. KRRP project staff will be informed in the applicationof the safeguards manuals as part of
K W ' s standardtrainingprogram.


Monitoringand Evaluation

Environmental monitoring

134.     Environmental monitoringwill be the responsibility of KRRP personnel and external auditors,
and will be as generally outlinedabove, in Section C1. The Monitoring and Evaluationsenior technical

advisors will be responsible for developingthe detailedmonitoringprogram, which will periodicallyaudit
a selection of the sub-projectsfor adherenceto the project's standards.

135.                              Environmentalaudits will typically assess a random sampling o f sub-projects, with at least one in
each kecamatan and a range of sub-project type. Since almost all of the sub-projects will be buildings,
special selection of the roads, water systems and other unique sub-projects should be included in the
audits.

136.                              Environmental monitoring will normally comprise an office review of the sub-project
documentation (preliminary needs assessments, environmental checklist, construction plans, etc.),
examination of the site and infrastructureand its environmentalsetting, and questioningof the users. A
critical eye should be used to identify environmentalhazards that may have been incurred through the
execution of the sub-project, in order that lessons-learnedcan be gained form experience and applied to
future sub-projects.

137.                              Finalsub-project inspections, prior to KRRP sign-off, shouldfeature a careful review of the local
environment by KRRPtechnicalstaff. Environmentaldegradationcaused by the sub-projectconstruction
must be promptlybrought to the attentionofthe village implementationcommittee, with instructionsas to
how clean-upor remediation shouldtake place. Ideallythe KRRPwill have a mechanismto withholdthe
final payment of sub-project funds until such time as the localenvironment hasbeenrestoredto its former
conditionor better.

Social monitoring

138.                              Social monitoringwill bethe responsibilityof K W personneland external auditors, and will be
as generally outlined above, in Section C2. The Monitoring and Evaluation unit of the World Bank
Office Jakartawill be developinga detailed summary o fthese activities, and will overseethis project.

                                   IndigenousPeoplesFramework


Background

139.    The KRRPNias is a community driven development project that will be attached to the existing
KDP project in Nias. Most decisions on investment will be made democratically,through a step by step
process within the community. Control from the project is basically only through the facilitator and
monitoring unit. Therefore, facilitators play a key role in making sure that the right process will be
followedand properlymonitored.

140.    The mainissuesrelatedto indigenouspeople andvulnerable groups inNias are:
    (a) The local elite, though they come from the same ethnic group, often dominate and exploit the
        vulnerable andmarginalgroups.
    (b) Many land conflicts relate to customary land. The common conflict can be divided into three
        categories:
            Conflict over boundariesbetweensub-clans;
            Sub-clan family land that is located outside the village has been taken over by the
            government (i.e. for public areas) or by other villages where the land is located(claimowned
            by other sub-clan land)
            Cases where sub-clan land was used by outsiders under customary agreement but was then
            claimed as government land or which become disputed land(mostly inthe southofNias)

    (c) The relevanceto this project is only in relation with land that i s planned to be used for schools.
        Schools should not be built on land that is in dispute. There is a need for a simple verification
        process built within the project to make sure that the weak sub clan that historically owned that
        landwill not be adversely affected by the locationdecision.

    (d) Women have very weak positions in the society; have a very limited role on public decision
        makingand have no right to landownership. Special processeshave to be built to make sure that
        women would get equal benefitfrom the project.

The principles
    (a) Vulnerable groups: women and low-level sub clan family should get equal benefit from the
        project
    (b) Familyfrom low levelsub-clansshouldnot be worse off becauseofthis project

The processfor impactmitigation
141.    Community decisionmakingshould includethe processessummarizedbelow:

    (a) Facilitators ensure that planning fully and appropriately engage vulnerable groups:
        Facilitatorsshould consult vulnerable individualsand groups inthe appropriate forum or meeting
       place. Results of these discussions should be reportedthroughthe monthly report and includedin
       the projectmonitoringreports

    (b) Special meetings with women and marginalized groups on their view of what infrastructure
       should be developed, location of the school and their concerns on housing development. The
       minutes shouldbe reportedto the social person inthe monitoringunit.



                                                   41

   (c) Once the new location of the school has been determined, the facilitator should check
       informally with the surrounding people the history of the land and whether the land is in
       conflict.

Strengthen facilitation
   0   There should be a social person experienced in assistingwomen and vulnerable groups in village
       level in the monitoring unit in Nias to analyze the report of the facilitator and provide field
       guidance andtraining.
   0   There should be a special session and syllabus in the facilitator training curricula on how to
       facilitate vulnerable groups;.
   0   There shouldbe a special chapter andprocess inthe facilitatormanual;
   0   There shouldbe a standardfeedback mechanism.

                                      Anti CorruptionAction Plan


142.     The followingtext highlightssome ofthe measuresto betaken to prevent corruption:

             Enhanceddisclosureprovisionandtransparency
             Mitigationof collusionrisks

         0   Clear definitionof sanctions andremedies

143.     KRRP's design is based on lessons learned and experience acquired from projects such as the
Rekompak - a post-tsunami rehabilitationand reconstructionhousingprojects in the province of Aceh
funded by the MDTF - and the KDP.This Anti-CorruptionAction Plan (ACAP) is constructedbased on
the designofpost-tsunamiand earthquake projectofthe KDP inAceh andNorth Sumatraand Rekompak,
bothof which are CDDplatformprojectsandfit intothe institutionalarrangement o fKRRP.

144.     Changes and revisions may be made to this action plan during the term of the project with the
agreement of bothparties.Annualjoint reviews will be madeto reviewthe effectiveness ofthe ACAP.

Detailedexplanation

EnhancedDisclosureProvisionand Transparency

145.     Public documents related to the project will be made availableon an internet web belongs to the
BRR through a dedicated link for the project and/or a dedicated web-site of the project that is linkedto
the BRR's web-site.

146.     Special attention is given to ensure adequate transparency. This will be done through specially
trained information facilitators, through small group accountability meetings, and through publically
postedinformationboardsthat disclose detailed financial information.

147.     The BRR in Nias will ensure that the website includes monthly updated information on project
activities,including:
         for each project location (kecamatan): work plan and budget in the previous, on-going, and
         upcomingfiscal year;
         bimonthly update of nature of any contracts or grants awarded (estimated cost, scope of works,
        providerdetails);
    0    baseline price of common materials used for community infrastructure at the latest two month
        prior the publicationbasedon the market review done inthe area ofNias;
        current estimate ofthe progress o f implementation(e.g. estimate o fcompletionas a percentageof
        works to be carriedout);
    0   concise informationfrom other projectrelatedactivitiessuch as training, workshops, etc.;
    0   Monthly up-to-date informationconcerningany problems, complaints and remedialactions.

148.    Access to this website must be unrestricted.



                                                   43

149.     In close consultation with the Bank, the BRR and the ImplementingAgency will establish a
mechanism whereby community, media and civil society groups can become involved in monitoringthe
progress of the project. All monitoring would only be effective if it operates under an adequately
transparent environment. Therefore, projects will ensure that the beneficiaries, the communities, and
stakeholders, the'media and civil society groups and else, could access the documents and information
neededfor the projectto be accountable. As Nias is an area where accessibility is really an issue and the
community is predominantly grouped according to the village they belongs to, communication at the
community level will be relied at the village level. Therefore, at each concerned village, there will be
informationboards containinginformationof:

         Technical specification and cost of the building on the concerned location, contractor or
         community involvedinthe buildingprocess
         Monthlyprogress of implementation
         All names and contact o f facilitators, including an explanationthat community could go to the
         informationfacilitator for any informationconcerningthe projectthey need

150.     At the national level, transparency will be focused on disclosingconsolidated information, such
as the procurement planfor non-communitypackages,biddingdocumentshequests for proposal, and audit
reports. Public disclosure will cover butnot be limitedto:

    0    the mid-termreviewreportandthe aide memoir preparedfor this purpose.
    0    all final audit reports (financial or otherwise, and including qualified audit reports) prepared in
         accordance with the loan agreement and all formal responses of the government in relationto
         suchreports.
         annualprocurement plans and schedules, includingall updatesthereto;
    0    uponrequest;
    0    all contract shortlistsand awards (subject to fees to cover costs of reproduction)
    0    Make available the projectmanagementmanualto the public
    0    the Indonesianversionofthe project's anti-corruptionplan;

151.     Disclosure o f information will be supervised mainly through (a) checking the frequency and
comprehensiveness of website updates and, (b) checking the distribution of materials to and within
communities on a sample basis, particularly in relation to end-users, and adequacy of information
contained in the informationboard at the village level, which the informationfacilitator is required to put
intheir regular report.

Mitigation of Collusion Risks

152.     Collusionhasbeen identifiedas a serious source o fcorruptionproblems in Indonesia, particularly
in relationto procurement.For KRRP, the prime concerns in relationto collusionwill be the consultancy
contracts and any local contracts for works (Le. schools). The procurementprocess will be detailed inthe
Project Manuals and further guidance may be provided from WBOJ procurement section whenever
necessary. Project supervision will include specialists with the competence and TOR to concentrate on
these issues.

153.     Effortsto reduceelite capture at all levels, includingat the communitylevel, will be built into the
program, with the special attention to the process of channeling the block grants and include multiple
channels for complaint (see complaint handlingbelow), strong transparency at the community level and
strict auditingo f accounts.




                                                      44

154.    Mitigation of collusion risks will be supervised mainly through (a) tracking key data relatedto
procurement(e.g. unit costs, schedules, etc.) and (b) periodic analysis of all bids that have suffered from
collusionwith an aim to identifyingweaknesses inthe system.

Mitigation ofFraudand ForgeryRisks

155.    The project will establish and follow procedures to maintainproper filing of project documents
including those related to procurement, inter alia correspondence, advertisements, bidding documents,
evaluationreports, contract awardand final contract documents.

156.    Rigorous payment validation procedures will be specified, and linked to the M&E system. The
Project Manuals will detail agreed procedures that are in addition to normal government accounting
practices (such as the need to provide boarding passes when claiming travel by air). For trainings,
workshops and other activities alike, enhanced accounting evidence will be sought before payments are
authorized. This requirement will include signed lists of all those who attended funded training events
with names and addresses. Similar activitieshave tended to be highly vulnerable to fraud in the past and
so these additionalmeasuresare deemedprudent. Provider invoices will be requiredto be formal invoices
on letterheads with clear documentary trails and tax registration numbers; for goods procured
transportationdocumentssuch as bills of ladingfor imports will also be required.

157.    Mitigationof forgery and fraud riskswill be supervisedmainly through(a) reviewingthe findings
of strongtechnicaland financialaudits, to be heldduring(interimaudits) and after (post audits) each year
for a significant sample and (b) encouraging third party observation, with a possible focus on "soft"
investments such as training, workshops and campaigns,

Civil SocietyOversight

158.    The KDPhas beenimplementingprovincialbasedmonitoringby NGOsand monitoringby
journalist inseveralareas throughout Indonesia.To a great extent that experienceprovidea good basis for
the KRRPinestablishing future engagementwith civil society.

159.    As a supplement to the community socializationmeetings, to help ensure that informationis
widely disseminated, andto encourage civil society oversight Public Accountability Meetingswill be
heldin each district before and after cycle o fconstructioneachfiscal year. Eachmeetingmust be properly
organized in accordanceto standards that will be laiddown inthe Project Manuals, The agendafor the
meetingwill be widely distributedat leasttwo weeks beforehandto interestedcivil society groups, such
as the local NGO/CSOforum andUniversities.At these meetingsthe projectconsultants and staff will
give a detailedpresentationconcerningthe scope, cost and progressofthe projectwithin the provinceand
sufficientopportunitywill be given for attendeesto pose questions directlyto the projectmanagement.
These meetingswill be opento all adults fromthe generalpublic,without exception.

160.    Civil society oversight will be supervised mainly through (a) reviewing the attendance of civil
society groups in Public Accountability Meetings and (b) reviewing intensity of involvement of civil
society organization in monitoring projects as reflectedby the news publishedin the local newspaper;
numbers of hearing conducted with the local legislative; number of complaintheport to the complaint
handlingunit ofthe projectregarding implementationofthe project




                                                    45

Complaints HandlingSystem

161.     A complaints handlingsystem, which includes maintaininga projectcomplaintlogand filing to
monitor status and follow up of each complaint, will be establishedby the ImplementingAgency
(MoHA).

162.     The systemwill be centeredon a ComplaintHandlingUnit (CHU) establishedwithin the KDP
structure (kabupatenmanagement) KabupatenManagement.The Complaint HandlingUnit must provide
routinereports concerningnumber, locationandtypology of complaintsin a format acceptableto the
Bank.The processingof complaints must incorporatethe actions mentionedbelow.Multiple channelsfor
complaintwill be established, includingtelephone and fax numbers, SMS number, emailaddress, Post
Office Box and direct complain. All ofthese channelswill leaddirectlyto the CHU.

163.     The processingof complaints will follow this sequence:


     0 Record incomingcomplaint and codify with reference number that indicates date, type and status
        (complainant may be given a reference number so that he/she can track the progress of their
        complaintthroughthe system);

       Refer complaintto most appropriate, qualifiedentity (e.g. notthe entity to be investigated);


    0  Check progressof eachcomplainton a monthlybasis;

       Provide a written report on complaint processing on a monthly basis to the head of the PMU and
       BRR inNias;


    0  The Management for two kabupatens is responsible to coordinate response to all complaints done
       by the management at kabupaten level and refer them to the higher relevant unit when that appear
       to be takingtoo longto process or where outcomes do not appear appropriate;


    0  Provide statistical analysis of complaint processing each month on the project website, showing
       clearly which types ofcomplaints havebeenreceivedand current processingstatus for eachtype.

164.     All complaints receivedshall be respondedto by the kabupatenmanagementwithin 10working
days of receipt, with copy to PMUfiles, the World Bank and BRR inNias.

165.     The complaints handling system will be supervised mainly through (a) periodic review of
statistics basedon problemtypology, severity and location,as publishedin the website and (b) field level
checksto ensurethat problems are beingreportedand acteduponthroughperiodicmonitoringconducted.

Clear Definitionof Sanctions and Remedies

166.      The agenciesresponsible for projectimplementationwill ensure adequate internalsupervision on
all project activities.These agencies will establish remedial actions and sanctions for cases of fraud and
corruption that are reported and for which evidence is found. This will include sanctions to staff,
providers and community member proven to be involved in such cases. One section of the Project
Manuals will be devoted to a clear description of such sanctions. Funds for the review of cases, case
managementandtrackingwill be includedinthe projectbudget.



                                                    46

   167.                                   Inall procurementcontracts, proofof fraud, corruption,collusionor coercive practices will result
 in termination of the relevant contract, possibly with additional penalties imposed (such as fines,
 blacklisting,etc.) inaccordance with Bank and Governmentregulations.

   168.                                   Disbursement of funds to any levelof the project may be suspendedin cases where there appear
 to be significant problems, especially ifthe government at the concerned level has not taken appropriate
 actions to rectify the problems in their area. Any entity that is found to have misused funds, or not
 effectively carried out key elements of the anti-corruption plan, may be excluded from subsequent
 funding. Information regarding such cases, where lessons are learnt and funds are retrieved, will be
 widely disseminated.

   169.                                   The system of sanctions and remedies will be supervised mainly through (a) periodic review of
 the sanctions that have been enforced by the project based on typology, severity and location, and (b)
 periodic review of sanctions enforced by agencies external to the project such as the Police, Attorney
 General and CorruptionEradicationCommission.

 CorruptionMappingMatrix

   170.                                   Limitingthe occurrence of corruptioninthis projectstarts with identifyingpotentialrisk areas
 throughcorruptionmapping.This exercisewill berepeatedat least once every year as the project
 progresses and lessons are learned.

     CDD Procurement

       The Sub-District Grants will finance beneficiary subprojects which are demand driven in
       nature, makingit difficult to determine ex-ante what is to be procured. Sub-district Grants can
       be used for services, consultants, goods, training, scholarships, and works Proposals for all
       subprojects are approvedby the oversight consultants and two members of the village and sub-
       district council. All proposals are attached to an Implementation Agreement signed by the
       member o fthe subproject proponent andthe facilitator.

       Procurement under the Sub-district Grant subprojects will be conducted by the Sub-district
       Activity ImplementationTeams (Tim Pelaksana Kegiatan - TPK ) and will use Community
        Participation.Communities take ownership of all aspect of the subproject, from planningand
        decision making to implementation. Community participation is emphasized in particular
        among the poor and women. Participationshould be broad based, not just of the village elite,
       butthroughlocal decisionmakingby all villagers.

        The communities will be required to ensure that procurement of works/goods/services is
        purchased with an acceptable quality and reasonable price that warrants the principle of
        economy and efficiency, competition and transparency. The methods of procurement will be
        determined by the community and the implementationof the procurement process, evaluation,
        award and obtained price o f purchase by the TPKs will be disclosed in regular public
        accountability meetings in the village and inter village forums. Procurement of works for
        instance, may use community participation to mobilize and pay local labors and the
        constructionmaterials may be procuredto local `home industry' suppliers at a reasonableprice.
        Goods, such as furniture for school, can be procured by purchasing only the raw materials
        (wood, tools, etc.) and then pay the cost of labor for the productione.g. pay local carpenters to
        make the furniture. The community may also opt to procure the works/goods through a
        competition process with the following arrangements similar to the KDP project: for
        procurement with an estimated contract value of less than IDR 15 million (around USD 1,765
        equivalent), a price comparison of at least three quotations is conducted prior to awarding the
        contract to the offer with acceptablequality and lowest in price; for procurement of above IDR
        15 million, the TPK invites at least three suppliers to submit written proposals at a certaintime
        and date. A public proposalopening is arranged at the Village Forumor Inter-villageForumat
       the Kecamatanlevel.The methods and relatedforms to be usedwill be described in the project
       manual. The Project TechnicalOperations manual will by large adopt the KDP manuals with
        some adjustments to suit the MDTFNS Project. Details of procedures under community
       participationare defined inthe Project Operation Manual.
