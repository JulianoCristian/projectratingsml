KDP consists of a facilitated\n            planning process that lets communities identify their own\n            priorities, which are then funded through a block grant\n            transferred directly to a bank account owned by all of the\n            villages within the kecamatan. Fifty percent of the funding\n            for the proposed project will come through an Multi-Donor\n            Trust Fund (MDTF) grant, and the other 50 percent will be\n            provided by the Government of Indonesia from national (APBN)\n            funding. Building on an existing project allows the program\n            to get off to a fast start. To keep the program manageable,\n            it is divided into 4 windows. The first window, the housing\n            window, will be initially confined to the four or five\n            affected kecamatans in each of Nias's two kabupaten,\n            for a total of 9 kecamatans and approximately 84 villages\n            (see Annex l), although some slight adjustment to these\n            numbers is likely to happen during final design allocations.\n            Project facilitators will work with communities to prepare\n            full village maps that show damage, reconstruction programs,\n            and uncovered needs; These will be the basis for each\n            reconstruction plan. Funding covers 5,000 housing units in\n            these 8-9 kecamatans. The second window is for schools,\n            UNICEF has already targeted reconstruction for the 120\n            priority schools that were affected by the tsunami. This\n            project will work with UNICEF and the Reconstruction and\n            Rehabilitation Agency for NAD & Nias (BRR) to define the\n            next 100 priority schools (primary and junior secondary)\n            using the same needs criteria. It will include an associated\n            school quality improvement program. The third window will\n            help village and kecamatan governments rebuild and equip\n            their offices, many of which have collapsed. It will include\n            training in participatory planning with a special focus on\n            achieving poverty reduction by providing a basic level of\n            public service delivery. The fourth window is for public\n            infrastructure that is linked to the settlement\n            reconstruction program. Based on the village maps, the\n            project will finance the public access and drainage\n            infrastructure that is needed by communities."}, "docdt": "2006-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
