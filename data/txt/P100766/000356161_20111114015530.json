The outpouring of solidarity and compassion at the\n            time was unprecedented. Pledges to contribute to the overall\n            recovery efforts of these two regions totaled about US$7\n            billion. The Multi-Donor Fund (MDF) for Aceh and Nias was\n            established to support the Government of Indonesia\n            (GOI)'s efforts in the reconstruction. With a total of\n            US$678 million pooled from fifteen donors, the MDF has\n            contributed close to 10 percent of the overall\n            reconstruction funds. The MDF donors are the European Union,\n            Netherlands, United Kingdom, World Bank, Sweden, Denmark,\n            Norway, Canada, Asia Development Bank, United States of\n            America, Germany, Belgium, Finland, New Zealand and Ireland.\n            Through its 23 projects, the MDF is delivering quality\n            results in line with GoI priorities in the areas of\n            community recovery, infrastructure and transport, governance\n            and capacity building, enhancing the overall recovery\n            process, sustaining the environment and supporting economic\n            development and livelihoods. This book celebrates these\n            achievements and is a tribute to the people of Nias who have\n            played the key role in the recovery of their communities."}, "docdt": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
