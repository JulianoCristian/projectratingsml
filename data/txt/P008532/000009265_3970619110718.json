The main components of the project are: a)\n            periodic road maintenance; b) bridge repair and\n            reconstruction; c) road safety improvement; d) gravel road\n            maintenance and low cost bitumenization techniques; e)\n            equipment for the central laboratory; and f) institutional strengthening."}, "docdt": "1997-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
