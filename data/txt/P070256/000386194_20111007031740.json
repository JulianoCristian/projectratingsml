    Africa were as follows outcomes were satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: The\n            Sustainable Development Action Program (SDAP) consisted of\n            nine development scenarios enabling the Council of Ministers\n            (CoM) to select the best scenario based on tangible\n            indicators. While the shared vision process was successful,\n            using a Multi Donor Trust Fund (MTDF) could have simplified\n            the design and the measure of progress. Many development\n            partners funded the shared vision process and each partner\n            came with its requirement and procedures. The establishment\n            of a strongly coordinated development partners group and the\n            regular interaction of the group with the Niger Basin\n            Authority (NBA) proved to be very effective. In the context\n            of the Niger Basin, the development partner group is part of\n            the organ gram of the NBA. Global Environmental Facility\n            (GEF) Grant funding can play a catalytic role in\n            strengthening a regional organization and leveraging\n            additional funds and preparing the institution to the next\n            level of capacity building. The processes of joint planning,\n            good practice sharing, and implication of all stakeholders\n            proved crucial in abiding by the principles of the Shared\n            Vision. Indeed, the GEF project was catalytic in\n            strengthening the NBA in its role as a regional river basin\n            organization. The Bank should be realistic regarding project\n            implementation planning and difficult supervision of\n            regional projects. There is a need for realism in operations\n            that combine relatively low capacity of the Recipient with\n            multiple players at the regional, national and local levels.\n            The project implemented many broadly scattered activities in\n            nine countries at multiple institutional levels, compounded\n            by the strongly centralized and cumbersome disbursement\n            procedures for grass-root level activities."}, "docdt": "2011-08-25T00:00:00Z"}
