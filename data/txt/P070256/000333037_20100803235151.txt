2. Status of Implementation and Project objectives: The objectives of the Project are: (a) to
   strengthen the capacity of the Recipient to promote and improve coordinated and
   sustainable land and water management in the Basin; (b) to strengthen institutional
   mechanisms in Member Countries for the management of transboundary land and water
   issues; (c) to develop a strategic action program to improve the conservation and
   management of land and water resources in the Basin; and (d) to assist the Recipient in
   coordinating donor support for implementation of the strategic action program and
   effective transboundary management. Project activities began in May 2005, with the
   installation of the Project Management Units in the Executive Secretary of the Niger Basin
   Authority (NBA) and in the nine participating countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso,
   Cameroon, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. This represents a loss
   of about a year, from the approval of the Board in May 2004. The Mid-Term-Review
   (MTR) was carried out in June 2009 and confirmed that the project is moderately
   satisfactory as the main remaining output to be delivered was finalizing the Strategic
   Action Plan (SAP). The consultancy for the SAP has started in December 2009 and a
   draft report is already available. Based on current progress, it is expected that the final
   report that needs to be endorsed by the Council of Ministers will be ready before the
   current Closing Date of August 31, 2010. However, the next ordinary Council of
   Ministers will take place in October 2010 and hence the endorsement of the SAP cannot
   take place before October 2010.

3. Reallocation. The requested reallocation of GEF Grant proceeds between the categories of
   the Grant Agreement results from an underestimation of the operation cost at the
   preparation stage and a negative fluctuation of the dollar, which has worsened the
   situation. The proposed reallocation involves more than 5% of the total grant proceeds but
   does not introduce significant changes in the Project, nor does it affect the Project
   Development Objective or associated outcomes. A brief justification for each of the
   proposed reallocations is given below.

       Goods (including vehicles) Most of the goods originally envisaged have been
       procured, resulting in confirmation of cost allocations to this component and
       realization of substantial savings due to an efficient packaging of goods purchases.

       Consulting Services There is a decrease in the "Consulting Services" since the last
       reallocation because the last consultancies cost contracts were below the estimated
       cost. In addition, since the beginning of the Project, when feasible, the PMU was able
       to find synergies with other ongoing projects in the NBA. These synergies allowed
       savings mainly in component 3, and allowed keeping the cost of this category within
       the budget planned during the preparation.

       Training Savings within this category are due to cost sharing with other
       projects/initiatives on the regional project steering committees and on regional and
       national workshops for validation of studies.

       Operating Costs The increased allocation of this category is due to the fact that the
       Operating Costs were under-estimated during Project preparation (and the situation
       was worsened by the negative fluctuation of the dollar); hence, this category has
       already been fully used. The additional six months will fund all the Operating Costs
       for that half a year. The Operating Costs cover office rental, fuel and maintenance for
       vehicles, equipment operation and maintenance, utilities, office supplies,
       communication expenses, staff travel and associated subsistence allowances, salaries
       for contractual and temporary staff, and management fees.

                             Extension of Closing Date

     AFRICA -- REVERSING LAND AND WATER DEGRADATION TRENDS IN THE
                            NIGER RIVER BASIN

                                       Restructuring Paper

1. The Closing Date for Africa, Reversing Land AND WATER DEGRADATION
   TRENDS IN THE NIGER RIVER BASIN, P070256/TF053233 will be extended
   from August 31, 2010 until February 28, 2011.

2. Status of Implementation and Project objectives: The objectives of the Project are: (a) to
   strengthen the capacity of the Recipient to promote and improve coordinated and sustainable
   land and water management in the Basin; (b) to strengthen institutional mechanisms in
   Member Countries for the management of transboundary land and water issues; (c) to
   develop a strategic action program to improve the conservation and management of land and
   water resources in the Basin; and (d) to assist the Recipient in coordinating donor support for
   implementation of the strategic action program and effective transboundary management.
   Project activities began in May 2005, with the installation of the Project Management Units
   in the Executive Secretary of the Niger Basin Authority (NBA) and in the nine participating
   countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger,
   and Nigeria. This represents a loss of about a year, from the approval of the Board in May
   2004. The Mid-Term-Review (MTR) was carried out in June 2009 and confirmed that the
   Project is moderately satisfactory as the main remaining output to be delivered was finalizing
   the Strategic Action Plan (SAP). The consultancy for the SAP has started in December 2009
   and a draft report is already available. Based on current progress, it is expected that the final
   report that needs to be endorsed by the Council of Ministers will be ready before the current
   Closing Date of August 31, 2010. However, the next ordinary Council of Ministers will take
   place in October 2010 and hence the endorsement of the SAP cannot take place before
   October 2010.

3.           Rationale This proposed extension is to facilitate the completion of all Project
      components as envisioned in the Project Appraisal Document, namely the endorsement by the
      Council of Ministers of a Transboundary Strategic Action Plan (SAP). The report of the SAP
      will be delivered by the second week of July 2010. However the SAP needs to be endorsed
      by a Council of Ministers. This Council of Minister is expected to be held in October 2010
      (i.e. after the current Closing Date of the Project (August 31st, 2010). This endorsement is
      critical and on this basis we would like to request an extension of the Closing Date of the
      Project for six months.

   August      31,     2009      but      extended     to      August      31,       2010.
