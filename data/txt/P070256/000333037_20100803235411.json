Project\n            activities began in May 2005, with the installation of the\n            project management units in the Executive Secretary of the\n            Niger Basin Authority (NBA) and in the nine participating\n            countries, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote\n            d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. This\n            represents a loss of about a year, from the approval of the\n            Board in May 2004. The Mid-Term-Review (MTR) was carried out\n            in June 2009 and confirmed that the project is moderately\n            satisfactory as the main remaining output to be delivered\n            was finalizing the Strategic Action Plan (SAP). The\n            consultancy for the SAP has started in December 2009 and a\n            draft report is already available. Based on current\n            progress, it is expected that the final report that needs to\n            be endorsed by the Council of Ministers will be ready before\n            the current closing date of August 31, 2010. However, the\n            next ordinary Council of Ministers will take place in\n            October 2010 and hence the endorsement of the SAP cannot\n            take place before October 2010."}, "docdt": "2010-08-02T00:00:00Z"}
