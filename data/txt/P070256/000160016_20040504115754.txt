A.      STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1.      Countryand sector issues

1.      The Niger River Basin. Nine countries-Benin,       Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, C8te
d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria-share      the Niger River Basin's hydrological re-
sources. At 4,200 km, it i s the third longest river in Africa, with an average annual flow of
180 km3,and a Basin that covers 2.2 million km2.The Niger River i s formed by two branches,
which constitute its hydrological system. The main branch rises in the Guinean Dorsale and i s
reinforced by abundant tributaries coming from the Fouta Djallon Highlands in Guinea.
Tributaries coming from C8te d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Beninjoin the River before it enters
Nigeria. The Benue, second branch of the Niger River, rises from Cameroon and Chad and
drains the eastern part of Nigeria before joining the Niger in Lokoja. The Niger River i s so-
cioeconomically and environmentally important to the more than 100million people who cur-
rently live in its Basin. The River supports navigation, fisheries, irrigation, hydropower, and
municipal and environmental uses. The dependency of the riparian countries on the River var-
ies with geographic location. The Basin countries can be divided into three groups: Mali and
Niger comprise large portions of the Basin and rely heavily upon the Niger for water. This
applies also to Nigeria even though some abundant national tributaries contribute to the Niger
River. Benin, Cameroon and Guinea comprise only 14 percent of the land area in the Basin
but provide more than 80 percent of the waters; BurkinaFaso, Chad and C8te d'Ivoire are the
least dependent upon the Niger for water but would benefit from inclusive management of
Basin resources. The Niger River also constitutes an important economic driver for the sur-
rounding non-Basin countries, which are connected to the riparian countries by trade and mi-
gration routes, and rely upon products from the Basin.

2.      Developmentand thefragile environment. The water resource crisis faced by most of
the Basin countries i s a result of water scarcity as well as problems with quality and manage-
ment. Growing demand for water i s leading to increased competition between sector-level us-
ers, and between the countries themselves. The Basin contains different topographies and
rainfall patterns that lead to a complex and variable flow pattern. Seasonal variability often
results in extremes in flow, either as droughts or floods, placing constraints on economic de-
velopment. Over the past 20 years, the combination of environmental degradation (due to ero-
sion, siltation, droughts, deforestation, etc.) and increasing water demand has modified and
reduced average flows. The resulting pressure upon the Basin's resources cannot be addressed
in isolation either by country or by sector. The lack of an adequate land and water manage-
ment framework has contributed to significant degradation o f renewable resources, from the
decreases in fish stock, with the near disappearance of certain species due to disturbances in
the River's flow regime and over-fishing; to inappropriate agricultural land management prac-
tices such as bushclearing, overgrazing, fertility loss, poor drainage systems and utilization of
zones close to the River. Deforestation continues throughout the Basin for domestic, agricul-
tural or commercial purposes.

3.      Population and increasedpoverty. The Basin's population, most of whom live along
the River system, i s expected to double to 200 million by 2020. Poverty, stressed water re-
sources, and environmental degradation threaten rural livelihoods and continue to drive ur-




                                                                                                2

banization. Coupled with a water crisis, a vicious circle has formed that i s hindering the Ba-
sin's development.

4.      Competitive unilateral development. To date, the countries of the Basin have focused
on developing their portion of the available resources. Following the devastating droughts of
the 1970s the emphasis has been on controlling the River's flow and on unilateral planning,
which has resulted in uncoordinated development, often in sub-optimal locations, and weak
regional institutions.

5.      National priorities - PRSP and CAS. Nine Basin countries means nine different as-
sistance strategies to address priority issues. Water resources are central to each country's
policies on economic growth, poverty alleviation, and sustainable livelihoods. All nine Basin
countries have developed a national water code/policy, with varying degrees of success in ap-
plication and relevance to different water uses and water quality. Most have finalized their
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which recognize the importance of environment
for economic development, and are now working to implement these first-generation strate-
gies through multifaceted finance packages. In response to the PRSPs, the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategies (CASs) acknowledge the link between environmental degradation and
poverty, in particular the impact of inadequate water supply. Annex 1 provides further discus-
sion on the sector issues, the countries' PRSPs and CASs.

6.      Basin-wide challenges at the local national and regional levels. Existing national and
regional environmental management frameworks and regional, national, and local capacity
are inadequate to meet the challenge o f effectively managing the Basin's land and water re-
sources. Although National Environmental Action Plans (NEAP) have been developed in
some countries, the national focus has been short-term and sector-specific. Some countries do
not have or have not implemented a land and water resources management policy. Public par-
ticipation in decision-makmg is low, and environment-centered public education and aware-
ness programs are virtually nonexistent. At the regional level, there i s a lack o f harmonization
of legal and policy frameworks and national and regional institutions lack capacity to effec-
tively and equitably manage the shared water resources. Water and environment have not
been mainstreamed into economic policies and yet there i s no adequate mechanism in place to
foster such an approach. The Basin's potential for development i s also being hampered by
gaps in regional information exchange. Data collection, management, and dissemination at the
regional and national level are uneven, and linkages between national and regional monitoring
networks are unclear, limiting effective water quality monitoring and protection programs.

2.      Rationale for Bank involvement

7.      A Shared Vision. The Niger Basin Authority (Autoriti du Bassin du Niger, NBA), es-
tablished more than forty years ago by the nine riparian countries, has an institutional mandate
to manage the Niger River resources in a joint and cooperative manner. The NBA promotes
cooperation between the member countries in developing the Basin's natural resources and
harmonizing national development policies. At the NBA's 7thHeads o f State Summit on Feb-
ruary 16, 2002, the riparian countries acknowledged the threats from unilateral planning, and
committed themselves to pursuing a regional dialogue and seeking support for cooperative,
sustainable development of the Niger River. They agreed upon developing a Shared Vision



                                                                                                 3

for the Basin, a "political statement" which defines long-term objectives and a commitment to
a program of action.' A Sustainable Development Action Program for the Niger River Basin
(Programme d'Action de De`veloppement Durable, SDAP) will provide strategic guidance and
support a dialogue on shared interest, through which specific mechanisms and tools are de-
veloped to reach the common goals for sustainable management described in the Shared Vi-
sion, and identify optimal means and processes for sustainable multi-sectoral development
and investments.

8.      Requestfor assistance - pursuing a Shared Vision and regional cooperation. The
Niger River Basin countries have requested the Bank's assistance to enable them to coopera-
tively manage their Basin resources in line with a shared multi-sectoral vision for the Basin's
development, and thus requiring in-depth sectoral and technical analysis, the strength of con-
vening power, and access to the international financial markets. In addition, with an extensive
portfolio of projects in the region (refer to Annex 2), including the Global Environment Facil-
ity (GEF) international waters project, the Bank can facilitate coordination between these
various activities. The GEF Project i s one of several projects contributing to the SDAP, pro-
viding support to strengthen institutional capacities for cooperative land and water manage-
ment of the Basin's resources, and thus contributing to the efforts of the Shared Vision. To
further support regional cooperation, the NBA has identified possible institutional and project
activity synergies between the GEF Project, the African Development Bank's (AfDB) "Pro-
gramme Cadre de Protection contre I'Erosion Hydrique et de Lutte Contre I'Ensablement du
Bassin du Fleuve Niger, " and the project of the Bank and Netherlands Water Partnership
(BNWPP), "Preparing the Niger Basin Authority Water Resource Knowledge Base for Effec-
tive River Basin Management." It i s envisioned that these projects will complement one an-
other to optimize effort and effectiveness. Outcomes from the Project's Transboundary Diag-
nostic Analysis (TDA) and the framework for sustainable development in its Strategic Action
Program (SAP) will provide further detail on priority environmental and water resource is-
sues, thus contributing to the SDAP. The SAP will pilot mechanisms through which a broad
range o f stakeholders can participate in the decision-mahng process as it pertains to these is-
sues. Within the NBA's institutional restructuring, capacities will be put in place through the
GEFProject at the national and regional levels, to manage resources and engage stakeholders
inthe framework of the SharedVision and its investment portfolio as they unfold.

3.      Higher-level objectives to which the Project contributes

9.      GZobaZ environmental objectives. The GEF Project falls under GEF Operational Pro-
gram 9, "Integrated Land and Water Multiple Focal Area" which has a long term objective to
"achieve multiple global environmental benefits through implementation of International Wa-
ters (IW) projects which utilize integrated land and water management strategies that help
achieve changes in sectoral policies and activities while promoting sustainable development."
The Project's giobal environmental objective i s to reduce and prevent transboundary water-
related environmental degradation; prevent land degradation; and protect globally significant
biodiversity, through sustainable, informed, and cooperative integrated management of the
Basin, while ensuring greater public involvement in the Basin's decision-malung process.

10.     Meeting the MDGs, NEPAD and WSSD objectives. As outlined above, the Niger
River Basin countries are willing to jointly access and share the benefits from sustainable de-
velopment of the Basin's resources, in line with the Shared Vision. The Shared Vision will
provide a framework to address some of the key United Nations Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), and objectives of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)
and the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). MDG No.7 promotes integra-
tion of the principles of sustainable development into country polices to reverse the loss of
environmental resources. Similarly, the NEPAD framework places importance on including
the environment, especially water, in plans for sustainable socioeconomic development. The
NEPAD objective i s to create a "framework for regional cooperation in integrated sustainable
water resources management, harmonization of water polices and regulations." The WSSD's
goals of Water and Sanitation, Energy, Health, Agriculture, and Biodiversity (WEHAB) pro-
mote greater efficiency (quality and quantity) in water use, shared water resource manage-
ment, protection of freshwater resources and related ecosystems, and development and pro-
motion o f equitable and sustainable water management strategies at the regional, national and
local levels.

1.      Lendinginstrument

11.     GEF grant. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World
Bank jointly implement the GEF Project. In line with other GEF projects on international wa-
ters such as the Nile River, Senegal and Lake Chad basins, the Project i s a grant to the Basin
countries. The NBA, as the regional representative of the nine Niger River Basin countries, i s
designated by its member countries to be the recipient and executing agency of this grant.

2.      Project development objectivesand key indicators

12.     Project development objectives. The Project development objective i s to provide the
nine riparians an opportunity to define a transboundary framework for the sustainable devel-
opment of the Niger River Basin, through strengthened capacity and better understanding of
the Basin's land and water resources. The Bank implemented components aim to strengthen
NBA's regional management capacity and improve data management capacity. With a better
understanding of the land and water transboundary issues gained through the preparation of
the TDA and SAP, the Bank implemented components will also support formalization of an
inclusive decision-malung processes for basin-level transboundary environmental planning to
reverse land and water degradation inthe Basin.

 13.    Performance indicators. The development objective's achievement will be monitored
through the three outcome indicators, which are further detailed in Annex 3:

    0   Permanent collaboration and dialogue established between NBA and the nine riparians

         HydroNiger has established a harmonized system for real time data, knowledge and
         good practice (collection, compilation, analysis, and dissemination) sharing with the
         nine hydrological inter-state forecasting centers to support appropriate decisions.

         The SAP identifies future sustainable development investments in the Basin, as formu-
         lated and validated by the nine riparians and NBA.

3.       Project components

14.      Introduction. Within the framework of the Shared Vision, the GEF Project addresses
the land and water aspects of managing the Niger River Basin and focuses primarily on insti-
tutional capacity building, data management and stakeholder involvement in tackling land and
water degradation. This nine-country, five-year, single-phase, USD 13 million GEF-funded
Project, implementedjointly b y UNDP and the World Bank, will engage stakeholders at the
local, national and regional levels to ensure that activities occur at the appropriate levels fol-
lowing the principle of subsidiarity. Notably, the Project works extensively with the NBA in
order to strengthen its ability to better serve the Basin countries, and fulfill NBA's mandate
"to promote cooperation among the member countries and to ensure integrated development
in all fields." The six Project components, the total costs, and the Implementing Agency (IA)
support for the components are summarized below. Annex 4 provides details of the compo-
nent activities, and Annex 5 summarizes the Projectbudget:

         Component 1: Institution Building (USD 3.52 million, Bank implementation support):
         The component activities augment existing regional and national institutional capacity
         to manage and implement concurrent regional projects. Activities will focus on
         strengthening the regional and national institutional capacity throughout the duration
         of the five-year GEF Project, to promote good management practices and good gov-
         ernance. At the regional level, a Program Management and Coordination Unit (Unite`
         de gestion et de coordination des programmes, PMCU) will be established jointly
         with the concurrent AfDB program to optimize human and financial resources.
         Component 2: Capacity Building and Public Awareness (USD 1.62 million, UNDP
         implementation support): The component activities are designed to raise environ-
         mental awareness in target communities, facilitate consultations, and build capacity on
         issues relating to environmental management at the local, national and regional levels.
         The capacity buildingactivities will synergize with the AfDB national- and local-level
         program activities and the national and local capacity buildingefforts of Component 5.
         The component includes a public education and awareness program and focused train-
         ing.
         Component 3: Data and Knowledge Management (USD 1.13 million, Bank implemen-
         tation support): T o complement the ongoing work on water and environment data col-
         lection that i s being done in the Basin's countries, the component will evaluate the
         status of the Basin's hydrologic, environmental, and socioeconomic data, and identify
         the institutional modalities needed for data collection, sharing and dissemination for
         decision-makers. The component includes developing an Environmental Information
         System framework.
         Component 4: Regional Forum (USD 0.38 million, UNDP implementation support):
         This component will facilitate the exchange of lessons and good practices from other


                                                                                                  6

      regional projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, expand on IW:Learn, and strengthen the rela-
      tionship with existing Pan-African and international networks of Basin organizations,
      such as the Secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
       (UNCCD/Sub-Regional Action Program), the Southern African Development Com-
      munity (SADC) Water Sector Coordination Unit, etc. With guidance from the two im-
      plementing agencies and support from the PMCU, the NBA will organize a forum to
      promote and strengthen these network relationships.
   0   Component 5: Demonstration Pilots and Microgrant Program. (USD5.0 million,
       UNDP implementation support): This component aims to support two paralleling ef-
      forts in all nine Basin countries. The first assists communities in tackling environ-
      mental problems, through the implementation of nine priority demonstration pilots.
      This will demonstrate good practices in managing land and water resources. Inparallel
      to the demonstration pilots, a series of community-based, microgrant-supported inter-
       ventions will be implemented, talung advantage o f lessons emerging from the pilots'
      demonstrations activities. This component will be managed by the national Project
      teams with relevant support and supervision from local organizations based in the field
      experienced in resource management activities, and will lead to immediate action on
       the ground.
   0   Component 6: TDA and SAP Preparation (USD 1.3.5 million, Bank implementation
      support): The component activities will finalize the preliminary TDA conducted dur-
       ing Project preparation in the main stem countries (Benin, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and
       Nigeria) by extending the diagnostic analysis process to the remaining four riparian
       countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad and C8te d'Ivoire). Through, and on the ba-
       sis of, this extended priority identification process, countries will prepare a SAP, coor-
       dinatedb y NBA.The SAP will focus on the land and water issues and complement the
       Shared Vision's multi-sectoral SDAP.

4.     Lessonslearned and reflected in the Project design

15.    Lesson learned. The principal lessons learned from other regional GEF IW Projects
and other non-GEF projects are taken into consideration in this Project's design:

   0   Ownership and constituency. Fostering the notion that the whole is greater than the
       sum of the parts, Project activities will engage vertically the regional, national and lo-
       cal constituency, and horizontally the water and land resource sectors.
   0   Conveningpower and shared vision. The Basin countries have agreed that cooperation
       could eventually foster regional integration through the optimization of common in-
       vestments and joint ownership of shared resources. The Project design places empha-
       sis on strengthening the institutional capacities for improving convening powers to
       achieve a shared vision.
   0   Sustainability, inclusivity, and participation. Engaging local communities through ac-
       cess to micro-finance, whether as grants or credit, will stimulate local ownership, con-
       tribute to cost-effectiveness and support sustainability b y involving beneficiaries in
       design, implementation, and evaluation of Project activities on the ground.
   0   Partnerships. Buildingbroad partnerships i s essential for a coordinated process and to
       support the long-term sustainability of the shared resource base. A concerted effort



                                                                                                7

        was made to identify the institutional and component synergies between the GEF Pro-
        ject and the AfDB program in order to optimize human and financial resources.
    0   Institutional capacity. The challenge i s to bring about effective implementation, to en-
        sure sustainability and to achieve benefits for the most needy. This i s particularly dif-
        ficult but all the more necessary when dealing with regional-scale issues and a re-
        gional organization. The Project includes actions to build capacity on the regional, na-
        tional, and local level.
    0   Project design lessons. Project planning, schedules, and assumptions must be realistic,
        and take into account beneficiaries' needs. Local capacity strengthening must form a
        part of the Project design process. National activities should take into account the po-
        tential impacts on neighbors. Activities such as establishing wildlife reserves o f global
        significance should be carefully designed to ensure that they are adequately under-
        stood by the local communities and that there are local as well as global benefits.
    0   Monitoring and evaluation. The GEF International Waters conference in 2002 was at-
        tended by team members and several important lessons were highlighted, among them
        the importance of ensuring a stronger and more participatory monitoring and evalua-
        tion component, including collection of baseline data; and the inclusion of the local
        scientific, academic and research community in the Project so as to close the "loop" on
        scientific data underpinning environmental and hydrological decision-malung.
     0  Demonstration of good practices for integrated land and water management. Success-
        ful water resources management depends on good land management practices since a
        watershed's elements are inter-related. Actions need to be coordinated basin-wide and
        in concert with the slulls and culture of the different peoples living throughout the Ba-
        sin. Demonstration of innovative, locally appropriate and cost-effective best practices
        i s an effective way to disseminate best practices for community adoption and replica-
        tion through micro-finance.

5.      Analysis of alternatives

16.     Project rationale.Given the size of the Niger River Basin, and the state of its land and
water resources, management actions must be coordinated at the regional level. One o f the
first steps i s to improve the capacity of the institutions involved in managing the resources at
all levels, and to enlarge the "team" addressing the problem by engaging the local communi-
ties who face these issues daily.

17.     Project alternatives. The following alternatives to the present Project's design were
considered and rejected:

     0  Multi-phase approach to Project design and implementation. The originally conceived
         multi-phase project, with five countries in phase one, and the addition of another four
         in phase two, was determined to be inappropriate given expanded opportunities and
         greater capacities in the Basin. With the implementation of the GEF Project concur-
         rently with the SDAP, it was determined that a single project would be an optimal ap-
         proach in order to address the paralleling activities and outcomes.
     0   Preparation of national programs. T o address environmentally sustainable develop-
         ment of Niger River Basin resources, a transnational approach i s needed. National
         programs alone would not address the Basin's transboundary issues or the need for


                                                                                                  8

        coordinated management of the Basin's land and water resources. Moreover, prepara-
        tion o f nine separate national programs would be costly and require significant re-
        sources for coordination.
    e  Afew large-scale demonstration pilot projects. This option was considered but modi-
        fied, so that the Project will now assist countries in demonstrating available best prac-
        tices in the priority themes and sites identified through microgrant funding, for adop-
        tion and replication by local communities. The reason for such a modified approach i s
        that it will allow greater participation and ownership by local stakeholders in land and
        water management, while benefiting from lessons learned.
    e  Modality of project administration and management. Duringearlier phases of Project
        preparation, the Project considered and rejectedboth an external execution agency and
        a traditional project implementation unit. However, in light of NBA's recent institu-
       tional audit, and the Project's objective to strengthen the NBA's institutional capacity
        and promote ownership, consultancy/technical assistance will be provided to the
        NBA-Executive Secretariat (NBA/ES) for the administrative and management modal-
        ity o f Project administration.

C.      IMPLEMENTATION

1.      Partnershiparrangements

18.    Partnerships. The Bank i s working with several institutions in differing degrees of
collaboration for the Project. The Bank i s jointly implementing the Project with UNDP in or-
der to harness each agency's comparative advantage for the benefit of the Basin countries.
UNDPcomplements the Bank by bringingits on-the-ground presence, close partnership with
governments, capacity building experience and work with community-based organizations.
The Project has developed a strong partnership with the AfDB's program in building syner-
gies at various levels. These include: a common institutional setting where relevant between
the two projects; and sharing staff in specific activities and harmonizing rules and procedures
on issues pertaining to financial management, procurement and reporting. In addition, syner-
gies with AfDB will be enhanced throughjoint team supervision missions as well as exchange
of lessons and best practice in the implementation phase of the two projects. Furthermore, the
Project will ensure close coordination with other partner program such as the French capacity
building project to be implemented by the Agence Frangaise de De`veloppement (AFD) and
the Niger River Basin program currently being defined b y the Canadian Agency for Interna-
tional Development (CIDA).

2.      Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

19.     NBA's institutional restructuring. The newly adopted NBA institutional chart pro-
vides an adequate basis for the Project implementation body to fully operate inside NBA. A
new technical department within NBA, once fully staffed, will serve as an operational basis
for the institution to fully focus on operations and results delivery.

20.     Szipervision and guidance. At the regional level, final responsibility for the Project
rests with the NBA's governing bodies-the        NBA/ES, the Council of Ministers, and subse-
quently the Heads of State. However, practical supervision o f the Project i s the responsibility



                                                                                                9

o f two consultative bodies, the Regional Steering Committee (Comite' Re'gional de Pilotage,
RSC) and the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee for the GEFProject (Sous-comitbScien-
tifique et Technique, STS). As the primary supervisory, decision-making entity, the RSC will
be responsible for providing oversight and guidance to the Project; reviewing annual budgets,
quarterly expenditure reports, and procurement short-lists as appropriate; and monitoring Pro-
ject progress in meeting key performance results indicators. The STS will act in a technical
advisory capacity to support the environmental management themes, through the capacity
building, microgrant, and TDNSAP components. The Project's nine National Steering Com-
mittees (Comite' National de Pilotage, NSC) will supervise the Project at the national and lo-
cal level, while ensuring linkages with ministries and NBA Focal Points.

21.     Project implementation. Both the GEFand AfDB activities are executedjointly by the
PMCU. The P M C U will be housed within the operations unit of the NBA Technical Depart-
ment. The NBA/ES will be responsible for financial management, procurement, and admini-
stration, and the PMCU will support the NBA administratively and for technical aspects o f
Project execution. In order to augment NBA/ES capacity to facilitate regional projects, the
P M C U will assume responsibility for knowledge transfer in financial management and pro-
curement until the N B A E S can meet the Procurement Capacity Assessment thresholds de-
fined during appraisal. It i s expected that at the end of the GEF Project, the NBA/ES will be
well placed to coordinate execution of an investment. Aside from core staff recruited by the
Project, consultants will be hired as needed. At the national level, Project implementation will
be executed by National Project Teams (Equipes Nationales de Projet, NPT). Local-level Pro-
ject execution will be overseen by the Local Coordination and Follow-up Committees (Comi-
te's Locaux de Coordination et de Suivi, LCC). The beneficiaries o f Component 5, the Demon-
stration Pilots and Microgrant Program, will be actively involved in the execution of activi-
ties.

22.     Procurement, financial management, and disbursement. As noted above, the
P M C U will provide support to NBA specific to the financial management, procurement, and
administrative details of the Project. In addition to NBA's chief accountant and finance offi-
cer, the NBA/PMCU will be staffed with a procurement specialist and a Project Financial
Officer (PFO). The NPTs will have an administrative/accounting assistant, to support activi-
ties at the national level. The preliminary procurement (March 2002) and financial manage-
ment capacity (January 2002) assessments o f the NBA were updated during appraisal and
recommended actions will be completed prior to effectiveness. The financial management
and disbursement arrangements are detailed in Annex 7 and the procurement arrangements in
Annex 8.

3.       Monitoring and evaluation of outcomedresults

 23.    M&E. The NBA, through the PMCU, is responsible for ensuring that the Project's
implementation complies with its development objective and the performance and monitoring
indicators outlined in the results framework (see Annex 3). A Monitoring and Evaluation
Plan, based on the results and monitoring framework, an annual work plan and annual pro-
curement plan, and reporting requirement details, i s included as part o f the Project Implemen-
tation Manual (PIM). The client-prepared Environmental and Social Management Frame-
 work, (Cadre de Gestion Environnementale et Sociale, ESMF), as an integral part o f the Mi-



                                                                                              10

crogrant Operational Manual (Manuel de Proce`dures du Programme de Microsubventions,
MOM) provides guidance to ensure that the Demonstration Pilots and Microgrant Program
activities comply with environmental and social safeguards. Duringimplementation, emphasis
will be on development of process and environmental status indicators for long-term benefits
and impacts, and on monitoring of SAP implementation. At the national level, the NPTs, to-
gether with the LCCs, will design M&E indicators and collection methods adapted to local
conditions, to be included in the country's MOM. This will enable local and community
stakeholders to efficiently monitor and evaluate the microgrant interventions in their own lo-
cality. The M&E format will be revised by local and national teams with inputs from commu-
nities, in the course of the Project as appropriate. The components' implementation and any
emerging issues will be reviewed regularly, and evaluated annually, by the RSC. The STS
will contribute to ensuring the technical quality of the Project's implementation and reporting.

4.      Sustainability

24.     Recipient commitment and ownership. The Niger River Basin countries recognize
that they cannot rely upon unilateral approaches to development if they are to meet the chal-
lenge of providing for a growing population from a reduced resource base. Funding o f the
Project and support from bilateral donors will serve a catalytic role to augment cooperation
and the range o f donor-supported initiatives for the NBA over the years. The Niger River Ba-
sin countries' commitment i s evident in their long-term participation in the NBA, support of
the Shared Vision and their endorsement of the GEF Project. Part of this new cooperative ap-
proach i s to revitalize the NBA and to seek support as they move towards cooperative man-
agement at the regional, national, and local levels. The SAP will provide an environmental
management framework and integrated platform with the SDAP for sustainable economic de-
velopment and future investments in the Basin. The five stem countries participated in Project
design, which was broadened to the other four riparian countries, thus allowing basin-wide
participation, with the organizing of national and regional workshops, workgroups, and steer-
ing committees. Annex 15 will provide the individual letters of endorsement from the ripari-
ans' IBRD governors.

25.      Financial Sustainability. The Basin countries' financial commitment is largely re-
flected through their NBA contributions; current national commitments are confirmed at
USD 2.14 million. More importantly, as national water policy reform work i s integrated into a
developing regional policy for the Basin's resources, through the SDAP, it will further con-
solidate and ensure the long-term financial sustainability o f GEF Project outcomes. In addi-
tion, a number of donors are actively supporting work in the Niger River Basin either through
the riparian countries or in the NBA.

26.      Replicability. The demonstration pilot and microgrant-supported interventions are in-
tended to be replicated throughout the Basin and therefore include the training of local com-
munities in good practices to address priority themes and increase their level o f environmental
awareness.




                                                                                               11

5.      Critical risksand possible controversial aspects

27.     Minimizing development, political, financial, and safeguard risks. The long-term
success of regional scale, multi-country programs depends upon the participating countries'
willingness to jointly continue practicing the Project's lessons and approaches beyond the life
of the GEF Project, and the extent to which the local communities are engaged in decision-
malung, implementation and M&E of activities. Because the Project is coordinated with other
compatible activities in the Basin, and the countries continue to be politically committed to
cooperation, it i s reasonable to expect successful and sustainable implementation. To mini-
mize the business and financial risks, the Project's institutional arrangements have been kept
simple, as has the flow of funds, which passes through the NBA and the PMCU, while taking
advantage o f the Small Grants Programme (SGP) mechanism as for the microgrant disburse-
ments. As identified in Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS), the Bank social and envi-
ronmental safeguards will be addressed through the ESMF and the Microgrant Program's
MOMto mitigate potential safeguard risks. The NBA/ES has ultimate responsibility to ensure
accountability and effective and efficient Project implementation to reduce risks.

28.     Risks and risk mitigation measures. The Basin countries have agreed, and are com-
mitted, to achieving the Project's development objectives. They are also committed to sustain-
ing its activities and implementing the lessons learned after Project completion. Annex 3, the
Results and MonitoringFramework, outlines the critical asiumptions to be heeded duringPro-
ject implementation to minimize risks; and Annex 12 details the evaluation of the critical risks
as they correspond to the outcome indicators. The risk of launching an unsustainable project i s
rated as moderate (M- moderate).

1.       Economic and financial analyses

30.      The Project builds on UNDP, Bank, and other donor-supported national activities in
the Basin countries, by addressing the transboundary increment to these national activities.
The Project will only finance component activities, which are co-financed by the countries
through in-kind contributions to the NBA. The Project will fund only those increments needed
to operationalize Project activities, and not NBA's operations. Through its SAP, the Project
will serve as a catalyst for further investments in the Basin. The Project's funding, including
its co-financing, both national in-kind contributions and donor-supported parallel funds as re-
lating to the Project's components, i s summarized below:




                                                                                               12

31.      Incremental costs. The incremental benefits and subsequent incremental costs needed
to overcome transboundary barriers to regional and global benefits have specific capacity
buildingimplications and associated costs that lie beyond the domestic actions of the Basin
countries. Annex 9 provides the incremental assessment and benefits of the GEF Project and
the table below provides a summary o f the Project's incremental costs:

32.      Cost effectiveness. The Project's design and scope is consistent with GEF guidelines,
 and its development objective corresponds to OP#9. The economic, social, and environmental
integrity o f the nine Basin countries depends upon the vitality and productivity o f the Niger
River. It i s within the objective of the Project design to invest in the Basin's regional and na-
tional institutions and local stakeholders in order to strengthen their capacity for cooperative
 and sound decision-malung. The value of such an investment can only be determined at Pro-
ject completion with successful achievement of the outcome indicators. Regional and national
 contributions to sustained dialogue, communications, and decision-malung constitute the
 long-term costs and benefits for sustainable investments in the Basin.

 2.      Technical

 33.     Technical issues. Technical issues are discussed in Annex 4, DetailedProject Descrip-
 tion. Technical implementation details are also contained in the PIM drafted by the NBA be-
 fore appraisal and finalized before negotiations. Implementation details for Component 5 are
 found separately in the MOM.


                                                                                                13

3.      Fiduciary

34.     Financial management issues. As part of Project preparation, a Financial Manage-
ment Assessment of the NBA was prepared in January 2002 by a Bank Financial Manage-
ment Specialist. The assessment concluded that there was a need to recruit a procurement spe-
cialist and PFO to assist the NBA. The Project's institutional design and terms of reference
explicitly identify the financial management requirements and responsibilities of the
N B N P M C U staff as they pertain to Project financial management during implementation. It
was confirmed during appraisal that the PMCU, housed at NBA, would support the NBA fi-
nancial management team in reporting on the GEF Project (UNDP and Bank components),
the AfDB, and other NBA programs. For financial management issues, the Project will sup-
port the Project Coordinator, a procurement specialist, and PFO. All Terms of Reference have
been confirmed during appraisal, with regionally competitive salaries estimated, and a train-
ingschedule established.

35.     Procurement issues. A Bank Procurement Analyst conducted a Procurement Capacity
Assessment of the NBA in March 2002 (updated in January 2004) and during appraisal con-
firmed that the following would be undertaken: (i)       recruiting a procurement specialist to the
PMCU; (ii)    training NBA staff and nine (national-level) administrative assistants in procure-
ment; (iii) a procurement planning and contract management system integrated in the comput-
erized financial management system to be installed at the PMCU, and (iv) reorganization of
the filing of procurement-related documents.

36.     Bank implemented activities are expected to consist of consultant services, including
workshops and training. Procurement of goods will follow the Bank's "Guidelines for Pro-
curement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995, and revised January and
August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999. Procurement of services will follow the
Bank's "Guidelines for Selection and Employment o f Consultants by Bank Borrowers" dated
January 1997 and revised September 1997, January 1999, and May 2002. The Bank's latest
editions of standard bidding documents and contracts will be used. Annexes 7 and 8 further
detail the fiduciary elements of the Project.

4.       Social

37.      Communityparticipation. The Project aims to have positive social and economic im-
pacts by engaging local communities to use sustainable land and water management practices
in their localities. It is essential that regional development actions endorse the positive aspects
of each riparian's values, cultures and local environments, as well as basin-level societal con-
cerns, while ensuring that the transboundary use o f land and water resources does not result in
downstream environmental degradation. Building upon the public involvement and consulta-
tions duringProject preparation, productive stakeholder participation will continue throughout
Project implementation by engaging a range of organizations at all appropriate levels, such as
community-based organizations, local authorities, the private sector, academic institutions,
and NGOs in the Project's outreach activities and the search for negotiated solutions to envi-
ronmental degradation.




                                                                                                  14

38.     Community-basedactivities. Community-based activities will include capacity build-
ing, outreach, and microgrants to support good resource management practices. The Demon-
stration Pilots and the Microgrant Program specifically target local communities in the Basin
countries through demand-driven micro-interventions and a range of capacity and awareness
building activities. With support from local specialists, the component will largely be imple-
mented b y local stakeholders who will also be actively involved in the evaluation the micro-
project outcomes and lessons learned. Frequent workshops at the local, national and regional
levels will serve as tools for broad participation of various stakeholders in the decision-
malung process on effective integrated land and water management.

39.     The NBA, under the RSC's supervision, will be responsible for ensuring the Project
achieves its social development outcomes. As the Project addresses the need for improved
management o f the Basin's resources through increased capacity, social development out-
comes are mostly indirect and long-term. The short-term impacts of the priority demonstration
pilots and microgrant interventions, however, have specific positive outcome and outputs on
the community level, which will be identified as part of Component 5's preparation, imple-
mentation, and evaluation. Project objectives, outputs and emerging issues will be regularly
reviewed and evaluated through the monitoring and evaluation process, in the annual report,
and by the supervision missions. Specifically, the monitoring and evaluation plan for Compo-
nent 5 will contain precise indicators to measure the microgrants' results and outcomes in
communities and will include an impact evaluation. Likewise, the capacity buildingand pub-
lic communication program in Component 2, will act as a gauge of the public's ownership
and perception of the Project's performance and environmental and social impact.

5.       Environment

40.     Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF).The ESMFprovides a
logical, understandable overview of the environmental and social review process in the con-
text o f the Microgrant Program. As part of the Project preparation process, the preliminary
TDA in the first five stem countries provided the basis for ESMF. Key environmental issues
were reviewed, symptoms/impacts identified, biodiversity and water resource priorities rec-
ognized, and the root causes and extent determined, through the participation of regional, na-
tional and local-level stakeholders in consultative workshops. The ESMF was designed and
prepared by the NBA and local consultants. It i s consistent with the requirements of OP 4.01,
"Environmental Assessment." Demonstration Pilots will be based on improving local com-
munity-based practices that can be replicated in other countries. Based on GEF microgrant
procedures, the demonstration pilots will not finance land acquisition or activities that restrict
access or assets of beneficiaries. The MOM and ESMF will be the tools for screening and
clearing community-driven microgrant application in compliance with Bank safeguards poli-
cies. The MOM'Spublic information and education campaign on good management practices
i s included in the Microgrant Program. Project details were provided to the NBA and to all
riparians.

41.      Microgrant Operational Manual (MOM). The MOM will provide selection and
screening criteria, notification, procedural rules for implementation, and institutional respon-
sibilities for the Microgrant Program. At the same time, the MOM will provide guidance and
tools for best practices and social and environmental mitigating measures, and at the regional

level, the MOM will be a reference for the national screening process of cumulative impacts.
Microgrant-supported interventions that do not meet the microgrant objectives and design cri-
teria outlined in the MOM will not be approved. The ESMF and MOM are complementary
documents. The M O M will also provide a mechanism to assess both individual and cumula-
tive impacts of these interventions at the national level. To safeguard against any negative en-
vironmental and social impacts from the microgrant-supported interventions, the ESMF will
provide guidance within the parameters of NBA procedures, riparian environmental policies,
and Bank safeguard policies.

6.      Safeguard policies

42.     ZSDS. The ESMF was designed and prepared by the NBA and local consultants. It is
consistent with the requirements of OP 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" and will ensure
appropriate approval conditions and public disclosure. It i s understood that the Project will
not trigger Dam Safety OP 4.37. The Project will not support or trigger the OP for any activi-
ties that include pest management (OP 4.09), nor i s it expected that Project activities would
disturb/affect cultural property (OPN 11.03), natural habitats (OP 4.04), or forests (OP 4.36).
The Project i s not expected to trigger involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12), according to GEF
SGP criteria, nor it will finance activities related: (i)to land acquisition; or (ii) of assets
                                                                                    loss
and resources. The Project will involve the use of an international waterway, and OP/BP 7.50,
Projects on International Waterways, i s triggered; however, the requirement of notification of
riparians does not apply since the nine riparian countries of the Niger River (Benin, Burkina
Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria) are all members of the
Niger Basin Authority. Each o f these countries has agreed for the Niger Basin Authority to
implement the GEF Grant, and institutional arrangements have been made to establish a NPT
in each riparian country under NBA's overall guidance and coordination for Project imple-
mentation. Social and environmental safeguard compliance i s summarized in the table below:

                                             Annex 1:
                          Country and SectorProgramBackground

Hydrologic and socioeconomiccontext

1.      The River. The Niger River i s the third longest river in Africa4,200 km with an av-
erage annual flow of 180 km3.Its Basin covers 2.2 million km2,spread over nine countries-
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, C8te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. The
hydrologically active part of the Basin i s approximately 1.5 million km2.The Niger River i s
formed by two branches, which constitute its hydrological system. The main branch rises in
the Guinea Dorsale and i s reinforced by abundant tributaries coming from the Fouta Djallon
Highlands in Guinea. Before the River enters the Inner Delta in Mali, its average annual flow
i s 45 km3.The Benue, second branch of the Niger River, rises from Cameroon and Chad and
drains the eastern part of Nigeria before joining the Niger in Lokoja. Though the Benue con-
tributes 50 percent of the Niger's flow, the hydrological significance across the Basin i s lower
as it only flows through one country before joining the Niger River. The Project Map illus-
trates the physical characteristics o f the Basin. The Basin encompasses several climatic zones,
and can be divided into four distinct hydro-geographic sub-systems:

        Upper Niger extends over approximately 140,000 km2and contains three main tribu-
        taries-the  Tinkisso, Milo and Nianadan Rivers.
        Znner Delta in Mali comprises a complex and geographically extensive system of in-
        fluents, lakes, and floodplains that have undergone significant development.
        Middle Niger covers 900,000 km2.Upstream of the Niger Republic, the River receives
        inflow from tributaries in Burkma Faso, which include the Garouol, Dargol, and Sirba
        Rivers.
        Lower Niger has a catchment area of 450,000 km2and receives several major tributar-
        ies including the Sokoto, Kaduna, and Benue Rivers.

2.      Rainfall and drought. Since the severe droughts o f the 1970s, the riparian countries
have sought to protect themselves from the negative impacts of drought. The additional com-
plexities of international boundaries transecting the Basin compound the management of the
River's natural variability. Seasonal variability alone results in frequent extremes in flow, ei-
ther as droughts or floods. However, for the past three decades the Sahel has been experienc-
ing persistent drought, resulting in drastically changed annual mean rainfall patterns and a
southward shift of rainfall zones by 100 km. Drought and reduced water availability have
forced rural communities, such as farmers and cattle herders, to migrate south to more humid
conditions, increasing pressure on the remaining floodplains and wetlands. With this migra-
tion, traditional resources management has given way to survival needs that are ecologically
unsustainable and lead to declining biodiversity and productivity of natural habitats.

3.      Socioeconomic situation. The Basin population is y o u n g 4 4 percent o f inhabitants
are younger than 15 and growth rates are just less than 3 percent. Low life expectancy (rang-
ing from 43 to 49 in the five main stem countries) means that the workforce continually loses
members who are at their prime in terms of experience and productivity. The population is
concentrated along the Niger River and its tributaries. The Basin's rural economy depends
heavily upon natural resources. However, the environment i s under severe stress, threatening



                                                                                                18

livelihoods and increasing the rural population's social and economic vulnerability. Poverty
and environmental degradation are leading to increasing urbanization as rural populations mi-
grate in search of employment. In many parts of the Basin, inland navigation provides essen-
tial transport for people and goods and i s important economically. Navigability i s dependent
on flow regulation by the dams and i s influenced by the level of sedimentation as well as the
presence o f aquatic weeds. Energy production i s primarily derived from two dams, the Kainji
and Jebba. Annex 13 provides a socioeconomic summary o f the Basin.

4.      CAS and PRSPs. Most of the Niger River Basin countries have finalized their PRSPs
and are now working to implement these first-generation strategies through multifaceted fi-
nance packages. The Project is consistent with the PRSP and CAS general sector goals to in-
crease sustainable management practices, strengthen institutional capacity and reduce poverty.
The Project's development objective i s to strengthen the capacity for sustainable management
of the Basin's resources, most directly addressing poverty through the capacity building and
microgrant components, which involve local communities and environmental priorities identi-
fied through the preliminary TDA. The status of the CAS and PSRP for each country i s de-
tailed below and summarized inTable l.

    0   Benin. The CAS identifies environmental degradation and inadequate water supply as
        one focal area to fight poverty in Benin. Under the Public Expenditure Reform Ad-
        justment Credit an integrated water resources strategy has commenced, and within the
        environmental sector, there i s an opportunity to consolidate investments in environ-
        mental management and align them with priorities of the Minister o f Environment.
        The CAS supports the GEF Project's objective to improve environmental management
        capacity.
    0   Burkina Faso. The 2000 CAS and CAS Progress Report (2003) support Burluna Faso

        e Niger. The CAS supports strengthening institutional and individual capacity within
          and outside the govemment at the regional and local levels. The CAS also earmarks
          water as one of the three pillars of Niger's development strategy (the other two are
          human capital development and exploitation of regional growth opportunities). Three
          Projects - Water Resource Management Review, Water Supply, and Private Irrigation
          Promotion - were recently launched and are in line with the objectives of the GEF
          Project.

5.      Key sector issues. The main sector issues in the Basin include:

      a Inadequate land and water managementpolicy framework and institutional capacity.
        Currently national institutions have a short-term and sector-specific focus, and in some
        cases have yet to develop or implement a policy on land and water resources manage-
        ment. An integrated regionally-basedland and water management policy framework i s
        needed, together with the institutional capacity to work in an integrated fashion at the
        regional, national, and local levels. Public participation in decision-making i s low, and
        environment-centered public education and awareness programs are infrequent. Legal
        and policy frameworks need to be harmonized at the regional level and information
        flows established so that the potential for development in the Basin can be realized.
        Degradation of renewable resources. The lack of an adequate land and water man-
        agement policy framework has contributed to significant degradation of renewable re-
        sources, from the decreases in fish stock-with                the near disappearance of certain spe-
        cies, due to disturbances in the River's flow regime and over-fishing-to               inappropriate
        agricultural land management practices such as bush clearing, overgrazing, fertility
        loss, poor drainage systems and utilization of zones close to the River, which have led
        to extensive land and water degradation. Though there i s insufficient data on timber
        exploitation in the upper Basin, in the Sahelian countries deforestation continues due
        to the demand for wood for domestic purposes, and in the lower Basin, extensive
        woodlands have been cleared for farming.
      0 Energy issues. Firewood and charcoal meet approximately 80 percent of the Basin's
        energy requirements. Together with demands for commercial logging, this has resulted
        in extensive deforestation and erosion in the Basin, particularly in the more arid zones
        inMali and Niger. Though the Niger River Basin has a highhydroelectricity potential,
        and some infrastructure i s already in place to tap this potential, most notably in Nige-
        ria where hydroelectricity generated. by Kainji and Jebba dams comprises 22 percent
        of the national electricity supply, this potential is not fully realized. In the Lower Ni-
        ger Delta in Nigeria, oil exploration i s threatening mangroves. Alternative sources of
        energy in general have received insufficient attention in the Basin.

 6.     Sector issues to be addressed. The key sector issues contribute to escalating and nega-
 tive consequences on land and water resources. At present, several major barriers need to be
 removed in the participating countries if the NBA i s to make progress in its attempts to secure
 a sustainable future for the Niger River Basin ecosystem. The NBA member countries recog-
 nize that future development will require more effective cooperation and coordination. To be-
 gin to address the key sector issues, the Project design for the Bank implemented components
 includes a series of integrated activities to establish an operational baseline for improved
 management of the land and water resources. These include:




                                                                                                          21

0      Enhancing existing capacity regionally, nationally, and locally. Strengthened regional,
       national, and local capacity to address the key sector issues and sustainable resource
       management will reinforce the principle of subsidiarity.
0      Zmproving data management and understanding of the Basin's resources. It i s essential
       for the data from all these basin-wide activities to be harmonized and consolidated, so
       that data collected nationally and regionally has a common "language." A coordinated,
       harmonized effort i s necessary in terms of collection at the national level and dissemi-
       nation to end-users to ensure informed decision-making.
0      Finalizing the TDAand preparing the SAP.The preliminary TDA identified the priority
       transboundary environmental issues. The TDA will be finalized to include the remain-
       ing four countries not originally provided for within the PDF-B analyses and regional
       workshop: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, and C8te d'Ivoire. A plan o f strategic ac-
       tions, the SAP, pertaining to legal, policy and institutional reforms and investments for
       sustainable land and water management will be developed; in coordination with the
       SDAP, it will provide a framework for integrated sustainable development of the entire
       Basin.

7.       Project origins. The origin of the GEF Project was a request to UNDP and the Bank
from the Niger River Basin countries, through the NBA, to provide assistance in preparing,
with GEF support, an integrated framework for the Basin's land and water resources. The
NBA's request for this Project builds on a number of donor-supported projects and initiatives,
which have often occurred in isolation of each other, and without recognition o f the value of
cumulative benefits. Project preparation provided an opportunity to begin identifying the root
causes of resource degradation as well as coordination mechanisms for future development in
the Basin. Initial consultations began at the regional, national, and local level in the five stem
countries (Benin, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria). Initially, these five countries were se-
lected with a two-phased Full Sized Project in mind-to       include the five main stem countries
in the first FSP of four years, and then add the remaining four off-stem countries (Burkina
Faso, Cameroon, Chad, and C8te d'Ivoire) in a second Full Sized Project. As the Strategic
Vision/SDAP has included all nine countries in a parallel process of preparing the Basin for
future economic development planning at the Basin level, the PDF-B process decided to
enlarge the scale and funding envelope of the first FSP to include all nine countries, and to
eliminate the second proposedFull Sized Project.

8.       Project preparation. Project preparation and design has been based on a series of se-
quential activities, a series of diagnostic studies, and the PDF-A and PDF-B-supported activi-
ties. Initially, outcomes from a set of diagnostic studies that have been undertaken in the last 5
years by the NBA include:


    0  Five country diagnostic assessments compiled by ten independent national consultants
       during 2001in line with common terms of reference to ensure systematic identification
       of key transboundary environmental issues.
    0  Five national workshops held in 2001 to discuss findings o f national consultants and is-
       sues raised by stakeholders dependent on resources of the Niger River Basin. These
       workshops also tabled ideas for demonstration pilot activities.




                                                                                                 22

    0  Two regional meetings to discuss transboundary issues and the TDA and proposed Pro-
      ject Brief.
       Numerous studies compiled over the last two decades (e.g., studies by JALDA, USAID,
       ORSTOM, and SOGREAH, etc).

9.      The GEF Project has been designed to collaborate with other initiatives within and
outside the Niger River Basin, and will focus on the environmental aspects of transboundary
management o f the Basin's resources, through strengthened capacity building on land and wa-
ter issues. The Project will complement the broader international waters work the nine Basin
countries are undertakmg assisted by the Bank, with special attention to the Africa Integrated
Land and Water Initiative (ALWMI) and other GEF international waters projects in the region
inthe Lake Chad, and Volta, Senegal andNile River Basins.

10.     Public involvement. The current Project proposal will build on the public involvement
that began during the preparatory process under the PDF-A and PDF-B.Through the PDF-B,
Basin stakeholders-including      the NBA, national governments, local communities, NGOs,
and international agencies-contributed towards finalizing the Project Brief. Duringprepara-
tion, provision of facilities for e-mail exchange, national and regional workshops, meetings,
and interviews during visits to all the Basin states by the NBA's Chief Technical Advisor, the
GEF Focal Point, and NBA representation were all part of stakeholder participation. This in-
cluded a broad array of stakeholders from local communities, local and sub-national govern-
ments and institutions, and the NGO community. The participation effort was met with vary-
ing degrees of success in the five main stem countries. In some, it was difficult to involve lo-
cal communities at workshops; however, many of the communities were visited during the
interviews carried out by the national consultants.

                                              Annex 4:
                                    Detailed Project Description

1.      Introduction. The GEF Project i s designed to address transboundary issues, improve
land and water resources management, and strengthen capacity. The GEF Project will collabo-
rate with other initiatives internal and external to the Niger River Basin, complementing the
broader international waters work currently being undertaken by the nine Basin countries with
the assistance from the Bank. To this end, the GEF Project focuses on improving environ-
mental resource management in the Basin. The Project i s anticipated to be a five-year, single
phase Project of USD 13 million (GEFfunding) spread over six components. The World Bank
will provide implementation support for Components 1, 3, and 6 (USD6 million), and UNDP
will provide implementation support for Components 2, 4 and 5 (USD 7.0 million). Comple-
mentary activities and donor support detailed within the component descriptions.

2.      Donor coordination and basin-wide synergies. The GEF Project secured substantial
donor support primarily from the French Government and the AfDB to complement the com-
ponent activities. This new cooperative approach with the donors i s to revitalize the NBA, as
a river basin organization, to move towards cooperative management at the regional, national,
and local levels. The GEF Project activities are also complemented by the broader `Shared
Vision' a long-term development and investment program in the Basin. The synergy between
the GEF Project and the Shared Vision program i s timely, in that they both capture the com-
patibility o f issues, and identify solutions and opportunities to address sustainable develop-
ment in the Basin. The upcoming Heads of State Summit3, hosted by President Jacques
Chirac, will lay out the Shared Vision for the Niger Basin in a similar way to the Nile ICCON
meeting (July, 2001). President Chirac will chair the summit with attendance of the nine
Heads of State, senior officials, and all donors engaged in the Basin. The Paris Declaration
will: a) reaffirm the Shared Vision for sound environmental management and sustainable de-
velopment, b) support continued strengthened framework of cooperation for coordinated do-
nor engagement in the basin, and c) validate out the methodological approach for the Shared
Vision. The inter-relationship of the GEF components reinforces the integrated and interde-
pendent approach to the project design, coupled with donor support and cooperation optimizes
the opportunities for sustainable management and development of the Basin's resources.

3.       Component 1: Institution Building (USD3.52 million, WB implementation support).
Within the context of the restructuring of the Niger Basin Authority4, through the course of
the five-year Project, the component's activities will augment and strengthen the regional and
national institutional capacities of the NBA and affect the broader inter-ministerial network
engaged in the decision making process to enable sustainable management and development
of the Basin. Specific to the GEF Project, with support from the AfDB the core personnel of
the PMCU and personnel from existing institutions at the regional and national levels will re-
ceive training on project management, including but not limited to procurement, disburse-
ment, project cycles, implementation process and decision-malung process, and monitoring
and evaluation. A core group of specialists will be built within regional and national institu-
tions that already have some experience in managing regional environmental projects. This

level of effort will not only strengthen the NBAs capacity to function as regional river basin
organization, but provide opportunities for inter-ministerial collaboration and cooperation on
transboundary issues.
4.      Componentfunding and donor support. Originally, the component activities focused
just on project management, however it was important to take into account the institutional
changes discussed above, and the need to strengthen regional and national capacities. The
NBA determined that the GEF budget component was initially under estimated for the level
of effort that is needed and the funds were increased from USD 1.50 million to U S D 3.52 mil-
lion. To complement the GEF Project the AfDB's Component B (USD$ 4.17 million) will in
part support some of the personnel for the PMCU, but also support national level capacity
buildingby providing training and technical assistance in workshops and exchange programs
for good management practices to fight against erosion and coordinate with GEF project on
monitoring and evaluation. To support strengthening technical capacity within the NBA the
French Government contribution i s USD 0.25 million.
5.      Institutional structure. The PMCU will be established within the NBA to strengthen
the NBA's Project management capacity. The PMCU will hire a select staff with key envi-
ronmental and water resource management, financial management and procurement skills,
with specific inputs from specialists as needed. At the national level, the GEF project supports
the National Project Teams, strengthening the national level capacity. Annex 6 details the in-
stitutional structure and implementation arrangements.

6.      GEFProject Component 1activities and tasks include:

    e   Activity 1.1:Establish and Operate the Project Implementation Structure at Regional
        Level
        -   Task 1-Establish and operate the PMCU
        -   Task 2 -Develop and approve the regional Annual Work Plans
    e   Activity 1.2: Establish and Operate the Project Implementation Structure at the Na-
        tional Level

        Activity 1.3: Project Management Training
        -   Task 1- Implement launch workshop
        -   Task 2 - Project regional and national management training program

7.      Component 2: Capacity Building and Public Awareness (USD 1.62 million, UNDP
implementation support). The component's objective is to increase stakeholders' capacity to
address the Basin's environmental problems and their ownership of Project interventions, thus
achieving the desired long-term change in resource management practice and sector decision-
malung. Consultation, exchange, inclusive decision-making, and coordination at the local, na-
tional and regional levels will be enabled through the strengthening of capacity and informa-
tion channels, providing communication tools for dialogue and exchange of good practices.
The component will notably be essential for the successful formulation and implementation of
the TDMSAP for the Basin. The GEF Project will augment current capacity building in two
ways: a) by focusing primarily on the environmental aspects of Basin management; and b) by


                                                                                              34

including local organizations in the capacity building program. It i s anticipated that these lo-
cal organizations will also be involved in the TDA/SAP process. The public education and
awareness campaign will focus on the need for shared natural resource management. It will be
delivered in target communities eligible for the Microgrant Program through appropriate lo-
cal-level channels of communication. The campaign will include messages and information
on integrated Basin water and land management principles, policy and governance; assess-
ment of ongoing natural resources management activities; dialogue buildingamong the differ-
ent actors through platforms and local networks; and the conditions of access to, and opportu-
nities offered by, the Microgrant Program for community development. Youth, who comprise
over 40 percent o f the Basin's inhabitants, will be specifically targeted by the Component.

8.      Component funding and donor support. Recognizing the importance of public
awareness, information, and stakeholder engagement, GEF funds were slight increased from
the initial funds of USD 1.5 million. Additional donor support from the UNDP-TRIB funds
are intendedto promote dialogue for capacity buildingin the Basin.

9.      GEFProject Component 2 activities andtasks include:

    0   Activity 2.1: Public Education and Awareness Programs for All Relevant Stakeholders
        -    Task 1-Prepare and implement a regional-level public awareness program
        -    Task 2 - Prepare and implement a National-level public education and awareness
             program
        -    Task 3 - Prepare a local-level public education and awareness program

         -   Task 2 -Prepare and implement a national training program
         -   Task 3 -Prepare and implement local trainingprogram.

10.     Component 3: Data and Knowledge Management (USD 1.13 million, Bank imple-
mentation support). This component's objective i s to enable the riparians to build a robust
partnership to manage land and water data at the Basin level. The component activities will
draw on the work being done by the GEF Project in the Senegal Basin, to establish an infor-
mation system framework for improved data collection, exchange, and monitoring and
evaluation mechanisms in all nine countries. Though good management practices require
knowledge of existing water and environmental conditions, collecting raw data b y itself i s in-
sufficient to solve the Basin's problems. It i s essential to use the data for evaluation and in-
formation purposes for decision-making.

 11.     Basin-wide effort. Given the complexity of the task involved, the division of labor
suggests that the riparian countries collect and process the data within the national jurisdiction
and the NBA provides the basin-wide analysis and aggregation. Therefore, it is important to
define and establish procedures and protocols that ensure data compatibility, processing, and
dissemination and promote a mutual understanding between the riparian countries, and among
decision-makers. To improve dissemination across the Basin, the NBA will work together
with the riparian countries to augment existing data-sharing mechanisms. Training and work-
shops will be conducted to strengthen existing communication between the technical and PO-




                                                                                                35

litical communities at the national and regional levels. Technical information, knowledge and
expertise will be effectively utilized in the preparation of the TDNSAP.

12.      Componentfunding and donor support. The GEF funding for this effort was slightly
reduced due to the substantial support from the French Govemment (USD 4.417 million),
three activities will contribute to the Component first, half of the funds (USD 2.24 million)
will support the first-phase of the Niger-HYCOS program, the procurement of data collection
and treatment equipment. The second activity, preparation of a river basin model (US$ 1.177
million) will support a Needs Assessment for the Niger River Mathematical Model for the
analysis of hydrological data and subsequent implementation of the model, this level of effort
will substantially contribute to Component 6 T D N S A P process; the model will be key for
analyzing and addressing transboundary water management issues. The third activity (USD
1.O million ) will support a feasibility study on establishing the Environmental Observatory,
and funds will establish the laboratories within the observatory.

14.    Component 4: Regional Forum (USD0.38 million, UNDP implementation support).
The component objective i s to facilitate the exchange of lessons and good practices from
other regional projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. Component activities will expand on lW:Learn,
and strengthen the relationship with the Pan-African and international network of Basin or-
ganizations (ANBO, INBO, AMCOW). T o facilitate the exchange of lessons and expand on
these networks, a study tour in the region will take place. A Worlung Group will draw lessons
from the GEF Projects in the Senegal, Nile and Volta River basins, Okavango Delta and Lake
Chad, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Victoria, and Lake Malawi. With guidance from the two im-
plementing agencies and support from the PMCU, the NBA will organize a forum to promote
and strengthen these network relationships and interactions so that they become viable effec-
tive and substantial organizations that benefit and support their members and clients. The Re-
gional Forum i s entirely supported by the GEF.

           -    Task 2 Conduct and evaluate Regional Forum.

  16.      Component 5: Demonstration Pilots and Microgrant Program. (USD5.0 million,
  UNDP implementation support): The component's objective is to provide a mechanism to
 support community-driven interventions and improve livelihoods at the local level, while also
 providing opportunities to exchange, through training?the lessons learned from good man-
 agement practices at the national and local levels. Component activities draw on the issues
 and actions identified through the Project preparation and TDNSAP process, and will re-
 spond to communities' priorities identified through participatory diagnostic exercises, while
 linlung with potential existing activities, thus providing communities with opportunities to
 assume control and authority over decisions and resources while promoting the ownership and
 care of local assets and resources. Most importantly, component activities will provide a lo-
 cal-level platform for lessons learned on good management practices in the Basin.

  17.      Sector themes and demonstration pilots. The initial TDA identified a range of trans-
 boundary sector issues through a collaborative process with the five main stem countries. The
  sector themes identified in Table 1, for Demonstration Pilots, were developed b y member
 countries and NBA duringthe April 2002 Regional Workshop in Niamey. The workshop out-
 comes, proposed by the countries, included seven thematic priorities for the demonstration
  activities. The hodlead country and the participating countries have already stated an interest
 inreplicating similar interventions, which will subsequently extend throughout all nine Basin
  countries. Interventions that are transboundary in nature are eligible for GEF funding. Those
  interventions that are ineligible for GEF funding will be addressed in other ways, including
  the broader international waters work being facilitated by the Bank or other appropriate do-
  nors. In addition to the seven thematic priorities that can be supported by the GEF, countries
  have identified three other themes. The Demonstration Pilots will complement the training
  and capacity building conducted under Component 2. Capacity building efforts will include
  development of models and approaches for each of the priority themes, and engage the rele-
  vant public authorities at the national and local levels, along with relevant NGOs and other
  civil organizations. With assistance from the PMCU, the national NSC and NPT, and the
  LCC, a demonstration pilot for each selected theme will be executed at a target site, and will
  complement the AfDB program. The lessons learned from these Demonstration Pilots on
  good management practices will be shared with the broader Basin and national community,
  providing the basis for the Microgrant Program.

18.     Microgrant-supported interventions. In an effort to engage the basin-wide commu-
nity, the Microgrant Program will build on lessons learned from the demonstration pilots, and
extend to the local communities, the beneficiaries. Table 2 below identifies the seven priority
themes and indicative community-basedinterventions and sites in the various countries. Sup-
port will not be limited to these; it will also be considered for gender-based efforts to broaden
women's capacity in managing resources. Drawing on the success and lessons learned from a
number of regional, national and local NGOs, community-driven development programs; and
the SGP in the Basin, this component will optimize the use o f existing community institutions
to lead to immediate action on the ground to assist in replicating good management practices.
In coordination with Component 2, the Microgrant Program provides-for a broad range of
public education and awareness on the issues in the Basin, including lessons learned from the
Demonstration Pilots, and information on participation in the Program. The MOM details the
process, and the ESMF ensures compliance with environmental and social safeguards. The
monitoring and evaluation of the progress and success o f the microgrant-supported interven-
tions will be the responsibility of the Project's local, national and regional institutions, with
the engagement of the local communities implementing these activities.

19.     Outcomes. The anticipated outcomes and benefits o f the Demonstration Pilots and
Microgrant Program will be: (i)     the accumulated benefits o f the nine Demonstration Pilots
together with the microgrant-supported interventions in addressing the Basin countries' prior-
ity themes; (ii) community involvement and participation in decision-makmg for managing
change in the Basin by improving local stakeholders' practice; improving local socioeco-
nomic conditions; improving local skills; and promoting ownership and care of local re-
sources; (iii)closer linkages and collaborative work between government entities and civil
society and networks; and (iv) immediate action and social and environmental benefits on the
ground.

20.     Componentfunding and donor support. GEF funding for this component remains as
initially proposed, with over two thirds of the GEF funds supporting the Microgrant Program.
The AfDB program, complements the GEF project in that it promotes sustainable manage-
ment practices of basin resources by implementing measures against desertification and soil
erosion. Substantial support from the AfDB (USD 17.7 million) will primarily focus on na-
tional and local level capacity building and implementing sustainable interventions. The
AfDB level of effort will focus on three central countries of the Sahel', for which funding will
support a) strengthening national and local capacities and institutional support, b) conducting
feasibility studies, and training; c) purchasing equipment and plants and implementing sus-
tainable interventions, to include but not limited to dune fixation, riverbank restoration, ero-
sion and gulley correction, and agro-sylvo-pastoral land recuperation; and d) monitoring and
evaluation follow-up activities. An additional estimated of USD 1.4 million will fund the
preparation of a basin-wide Environmental Master Plan focusing on specific aspects such as
siltation, erosion, and sedimentation across the basin identifying strategic actions to be ad-
dressed, contributing significantly to the priority issues within the TDA/SAP component.

22.      Component 6: TDA and SAP Preparation (USD1.35 million, Bank implementation
;upport). The T D N S A P process i s the foundation of the international waters program, and
the process i s critical in understanding and addressing the transboundary issues of the Basin.
This component, while closely worlung with the donor supported activities of the AfDB and
French Government, will also work in complement to the broader international waters effort
currently being developed as a basin-wide Shared Vision/SDAP for the Niger River Basin
through in-depth consultations that will lead to large multi-sector investments. To comple-
ment the SDAP which will addressthe key development sectors inthe Basin', the SAP, being
developed under the GEF Project, will take into consideration the environmental aspects o f
land and water issues as they pertain to these sectors. These issues will consider and include
existing conditions, sources of problems and issues, current polices and proposed polices, and
the institutional framework these sectors operate in and the inter-sectoral coordination needed
to sustainably manage the resources.

23.       TDA. Both the TDA and SAP will serve as critical documents to improve environ-
mental management in the Basin; introduce relevant environmental protection policies; pro-
vide opportunities for innovative community-based microgrant funded investments; and in-
form the public on the issues in the Basin. A preliminary TDA has been prepared in five o f
the nine countries in the Niger Basin (Benin, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria) with the PDFB
funds managed by UNDP and, included as part of the Project Brief. This preliminary effort
provides a strategic basis o f information, which needs to be updated and complement with the


 Sectors will include but not be limited to agriculture, energy, transport, environment, water resources, fisheries,
forestry tourism and gender issues.



                                                                                                                           41

remaining four riparian countries - Burkma Faso, Cameroon, Chad and C8te d'Ivoire. The
preliminary TDA will be updated and completed current existing conditions and develop a
comprehensive understanding of the priority transboundary issues, threats to the Basin, and
root causes, which then will be the basis for preparingthe SAP.

24.     TDA process. The component will specifically support the facilitation of a series of
technical national and local level consultations to engage national counterparts and technical
experts, and the final draft of the TDA will be approved in a regional workshop with national
level participation. The diagnostic analysis will include an in-depth identification and analysis
o f environmental problems and issues throughout the Basin and their linkages with trans-
boundary dynamics will be assessed. The sources of the problems, their impacts on the natural
and human environments as well as their root causes will be assessed and prioritized in order
to highlight the most affected areas in the Basin and the transboundary priorities which need
to be addressed as a result.

25.     SAP. The final SAP is a strategic document for decision-makers for future actions and
sustainable development and investments in the Basin. Local and national counterparts pre-
paring the SAP will be required to identify, for the proposed priority activities, the possible
environmental and social impacts, and any future investments and actions that may be re-
quired to comply with the riparian's environmental policies and any future regional policies
established in the Basin. The SAP will have full support and endorsement from the inter-
ministerial review and regional review. Actions will be taken in conjunction with the Shared
Vision/SDAP.

26.     SAP process. The component will specifically support the facilitation o f a series of
technical national and regional level consultations to engage and promote an inter-ministerial
dialogue and cooperation, and the final draft of the SAP will be approved in a regional work-
shop with regional and national level participation. Then the final SAP document will be ap-
proved, with inter-ministerial support, in each of the nine riparian countries, conforming to
GEF requirements will include: (i)a clear definition of national and transboundary priorities
based on the TDA outcomes; (ii)a concise summary of the identified threats and their root
causes; (iii)a description of public perceptions of environmental threats and development ac-
tions at the basin-wide level, and the related transboundary management issues; (iv) identifi-
cation, definition and ranking of priority national and transboundary actions according to the
findings of the SAP process; (v) identification of responsible parties; (vi) identification of the
tools and mechanisms for good management practices t o reverse land and water degradation
in the Niger River; and (vii) identification of additional capacity buildingnecessary to facili-
tate SAP implementation. Linkages of the SAP process to other components and aspects of
the Project as it unfolds will be identified. Also, the sector studies on institutional scope and
reforms in the Basin would provide further opportunities for identifying institutional linkages
at different levels-local,  national and regional-and    suggest modalities for institutional en-
hancement.

27.     Component funding and donor support. Both the TDA and SAP serve as critical
documents for sustainable management o f the Basin, despite the small reductions in the Com-
ponent 6 budget, the T D N S A P component objective will be met. Strengthened institutional
capacity of the NBA, through the increased efforts of Component 1, will ensure a more effec-



                                                                                                42

tive and comprehensive product. The paralleling efforts of the Shared Vision process and do-
nor-supported activities will provide input to the TDNSAP process. As noted in the Compo-
nent 5 discussion, the AfDB will prepare a basin wide environmentalMaster Plan focusing on
specific aspects such as siltation, erosion and sedimentation across the basin with strategic
actions to be planned, this i s a signification contribution to the T D N S A P process. The sup-
port from the French Government, for Component 3, will provide funds for a mathematical
model for the Niger River and its main tributaries, contributing to increased knowledge on the
basin water availability and allocation across sectors and borders.

1.      History and structure ofthe NBA. The NBA i s one of the oldest intergovernmental or-
ganizations in West Africa. Its creation dates back to 1964 when it was called the River Niger
Commission. After seventeen years in existence, the results achieved by the Commission were
deemed insufficient and its member states decided to replace it with a new organization, the
NBA, which became heir to all the assets, liabilities, and programs of the River Niger Commis-
sion. The long term goal of the NBA i s to "promote cooperation among the member countries
and to ensure integrated development in all fields through development of its resources, notably
in the fields of energy, water resources, agriculture, forestry, transport and communication and
industry." Specifically the aim and objectives of the NBA are to:

    0   Harmonize and coordinate national policies for development of the resources in the Ba-
        sin;
    0   Plan the development of the Basin by preparing and executing an "Integrated Develop-
        ment Plan of the Basin;" and
    0   Design, realize, exploit, and maintain common works and projects.

2.      The present structure of the NBA is based on three institutions:

    0   The Summit of Heads of State and Government;
    0   The Council of Ministers including the Technical Committee of Experts; and
    0   The NBAES.

3.      Based on the newly adopted institutional chart the NBA/ES has two departments:

    0   The Technical Directorate;
    0   The Administrative and Financial Directorate.

4.      The NBA i s supported by its member states. Each year a balanced income and expendi-
ture budget i s prepared based on a sharing formula determined by the member states. Foreign
assistance to the NBA i s received from external donors. In 1998, the NBA launched a new effort
at the 17th Ordinary Session of the Council of Ministers. The real dangers threatening the Niger
River were acknowledged, together with the importance o f member states paying their contribu-
tions to the NBA. Total annual contributions of all nine member states for the year 2003 have
been set at CFA 400,000 000 (USD 717,231) with the following shares: Benin (5%), Burkina
(4%), Cameroon (7%), Chad (l%), C8te d'Ivoire (5%), Guinea (lo%), Mali (20%),Niger (18%)
and Nigeria (30%). Arrears are still high relative to the annual total but decisions were taken at
the YaoundC Council of Ministers to resolve this issue. Furthermore, countries are committed,
through their participation in the NBA, to involve the appropriate ministries, government agen-
cies and NGOs to fulfill the mandate o f the NBA and successfully implement the proposed GEF
Project.




                                                                                               45

Project facilitator

5.      Niger Basin Authority. Given the NBA's mandate "to promote cooperation among the
member countries and to ensure integrateddevelopment in all fields," it will undertake a facilita-
tive role as a coordination and executing agency during the full Project. The N B A B S will be the
lead counterpart agency on behalf of the member states that will host the implementation of this
Project. The respective UNDP, Bank, and Executing Agency task team leaders will be in direct
and ongoing contact to facilitate the work of the Project and to ensure maximum levels of coop-
eration to bring about Project success.

6.      The NBA identified possible institutional and Project activity synergies between the GEF
and AfDB projects to optimize effort and effectiveness. This has been an important part o f the
collaboration and cooperation process for both the NBA and the implementing agencies.

Regional and national guidance and supervision

7.      NBA Council of Ministers. The NBA Council of Ministers will provide guidance for is-
sues related to the Basin, approve strategic actions by supporting the RSC, and discuss when
needed specific issues pertaining to Basin management. The NBA Council of Ministers' mem-
bers are representatives from the water resources and related ministries. The NBA Council of
Ministers reports to the Head of State ineach country.

8.      Regional Steering Committee (RSC). In assisting in facilitation of Project implementa-
tion, the RSC will be the primary decision-malung body and serve in a technical and institutional
advisory capacity during implementation and review of Project activities. Key members will
meet at minimum three times a year to review Project implementation progress, for activity-
specific guidance and review, and will: (i)coordinate with the AfDB project steering committee
and align the Project with other basin-wide initiatives; (ii)monitor Project progress and take
timely actions to resolve implementation constraints; (iii)liaise with different National Focal
Points and National Project Teams within the riparian countries to ensure that the national units
and the PMCU act in harmony; (iv) receive and review annual substantive and financial reports
on Project activities; (v) review and approve Annual Work Plans; and (vi) ensure monitoring and
evaluation of Project activities. Proposed RSC members would include the N B m S as the Chair,
and high-level NBA member state representatives. The Bank will participate in an observer
status. Upper-level PMCU staff would report to RSC meetings as needed, but would otherwise
not serve.

9.      Scientific and Technical Subcommittee (STS). Within the RSC, a technical subcommit-
tee, STS, will act in a technical advisory capacity to support each environmental management
theme. Composed of technical specialists, institutional specialists, and other relevant experts re-
lated to environmental management, it will contribute to the scientific quality of Project imple-
mentation. The STS will advise on technical matters duringProject implementation, i.e., capacity
building as it pertains to Components 2, 3, 5, and 6, microgrant-supported activity design and
implementation, and the T D N S A P development process. The STS will review and critique pro-
gress reports and interview relevant Project participants, distilling and conveying lessons learned
on good management practices in the Basin, which will then be disseminated back at the national
and local levels.



                                                                                                 46

10.     National Steering Committee (NSC). National- and local-level Project implementation
will be advised by the NSC. The NSC, chaired by the national NBA Focal Point and participants
from the relevant Ministries and civil society, will provide quality assurance for the national-
level activities, worlung directly with the PMCU and the NPT. The NSC will have a special role
in selecting the microgrant proposals from communities. It will support the NPT indeveloping a
format of the MOM, which would be accessible to communities and grassroots organizations
seeking grant funding. In this task, the NSC will work closely with the UNDP SGP's program
coordinator and the SGP national steering committee in the countries where the SGP exists
(Burkina Faso, C6te d'Ivoire, Mali and Niger) and elsewhere, with the new national steering
committees to be created by SGP/UNDP under the Project inthe five non-SGP countries.

Regional,nationalandlocalimplementation

11.     Program Management and Coordination Unit (PMCU). The P M C U will support the
NBA in Project management; financial, procurement, and administrative responsibilities; and
supervision and management of the technical components of Project implementation. The PMCU
will work together with the NBA/ES in implementing the Project. Co-located at the NBA, the
PMCU will work closely with the regional institutions, the RSC, the STS, and the NPTs to en-
sure timely Project implementation and effective capacity building. The P M C U will be primarily
responsible for reporting to the RSC, the NBA and the implementing agencies-through       harmo-
nized reporting procedures-on      Project progress, financial management, procurement and dis-
bursement, identification of implementation gaps and bottlenecks, and Project accounts and
budget. Administrative, accounting, financial and auditing arrangements were finalized during
appraisal and included: (i) assessmento f the financial management system with timetable for any
improvements required; (ii)   agreement on Project financial and accounting standards; (iii)audit
arrangements, to ensure independent audits will be undertaken on an annual basis according to
standard IA requirements; (iv) procurement plan based on IA requirements; (v) all administrative
reporting, monitoring and evaluation requirements and procedures as required by the IAs; and
(vi) supervision and management of Project implementation. The PMCU will also serve as the
program management unit of the AfDB project.

 12.    National Project Teams (NPT). Buildingon appropriate existing institutionsor establish-
ingnew ones, as needed, NPTs will be based in each NBA Focal Point office. The NPTs will be
responsible for managing, coordinating, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the Project at
the national level, primarily as it pertains to the Demonstration Pilots, the Microgrant Program
and capacity building. They will work at the national and local levels, notably with decentralized
services and locally-based organizations, but also closely with the NSC and PMCU. One o f the
NPTs' key roles will be the pre-selection and transmission of community microgrant proposals
to the NSC for approval and the establishment of a national microgrant strategy together with the
SGP, the SGP Steering Committee and/or UNDP partners depending on the country. The NPTs'
other key responsibilities include: (i) implementation of the communication campaign at the lo-
cal level; (ii)organization and supervision of all training and workshops to promote the Micro-
 grant Program at the local level, and its execution in compliance with the M O M and the ESMF;
 (iii)
     development of tools and materials to enable grassroots organizations to access microgrants;
 and (iv) supervision of consultants and firms for the implementation of activities.




                                                                                                47

Local-level implementation

13.     Local Coordination Committees (LCC). The collaborative effort of local institutions
(both public and civil) i s vital for program success. It will provide opportunities for communities
to communicate amongst themselves and with local government, and be responsible for assisting
inthe implementation and monitoring and evaluation of the demonstration programs. At the local
level, worlung closely with the NPT for administrative support, the LCCs, as community-based
implementation units, will be key in educating the local community on the specifics o f local-
level component activities, the demonstration pilots and the Microgrant Program (e.g., through
local language materials; updating of the MOM). They will work with local authorities and
communities in developing, regularly monitoring, and evaluating the site-specific demonstration
activities. Other key responsibilities will be to: (i) assist communities in the formulation of the
microgrant proposals, including the application o f the environmental and social assessment; and
transmit communities' proposals to the NPT according to an agreed timetable; (ii)        develop sim-
ple M&E systems for community projects; (iii)       identify and respond to community training and
technical assistance needs in collaboration with the AfDB program teams based locally; (iv) or-
ganize and implement beneficiaries' workshops on lessons leamed from microgrant activities;
(v) identify local partners (e.g., private sector), facilitate contracting and equipment purchase,
and supervise works in community sites; (vi) encourage linkages and synergy with local and na-
tional networks and other related local programs, especially with AfDB activities and resources;
(vii) provide information on field activities through reports, and contribute to preparation of the
SAP through data collection; and (viii) manage a small petty cash for day-to-day related ex-
penses.

14.     Beneficiaries. Community groups (women's groups, agricultural groups, resource man-
agement groups, etc.) will work closely with the local authorities, the LCCs and the NPTs. They
will: (i)identify site-specific micro-projects; (ii)assess environmental and social impacts; (iii)
submit proposals to the LCC for micro-projects to be funded; (iv) sensitize and involve their lo-
cal communities on the specifics of the Microgrant Program and capacity building activities; (v)
monitor and evaluate pilot and micro-projects usinglocally adapted M&E systems; (vii) establish
or train existing management committees directly responsible for Project monitoring and evalua-
tion; and (viii) identify and articulate priority issues and solutions in their locality as they affect
the Basin's sustainable management.

Implementing Agencies

 15.    Implementing Agencies. UNDP and the Bank are the co-implementing agencies for this
Project. The UNDProle will be to contribute its on-the-ground strength and the resulting trust it
has built with national govemments; directly facilitate workshops and the convening of key
stakeholders consistent with its comparative advantage in capacity building; work to secure na-
tional country-based financial resources to complement Project activities; and provide important
links to other UNAgencies. Bank participation will have a leveraging effect, and the Bank will
continue to play a key role for realization of the MDGs.

Monitoring and evaluation

16.    The NBA is responsible for ensuring that all GEF funded activities are carried out in
compliance with the Project's design, and the performance and monitoring indicators outlined in
the results and monitoring framework (see Annex 3). The Project will comply with M&E proce-
dures based upon the IAs' institutional guidelines and will ensure compliance with social and
environmental safeguards. UNDP and the Bank will evaluate and review Project progress ac-
cording to their institutional requirements. As part of the PIM, which will detail all the reporting
requirements, an M&E Plan will be prepared to evaluate Project progress; this will be supple-
mented with the ESMF, which will provide a framework for ensuring compliance with environ-
mental and social safeguards.

17.    In conducting Project reviews, emphasis will be given to emerging GEF policies regard-
ing monitoring and evaluation of GEFinternational waters projects, particularly the development
of process, stress reduction, and environmental status indicators for long-term impact monitoring
of SAP implementation. The PMCU will be responsible for Project reporting according to insti-
tutional procedures. The components and emerging issues will be reviewed regularly, and evalu-
ated annually by the RSC, as noted above. Reporting requirements that are part of the monitoring
and evaluation and supervision process are listed inTable 1below.

   Disbursement

   1.        Allocations of grant proceeds. The proposed allocation of grant proceeds i s shown in
   Table 1. Disbursements o f GEF funds will finance 100 percent o f all expenditures in foreign
   and local currency: (i)100 percent of local and international consultant services including
   personnel; (ii)100 percent of training/workshop; (iii)100 percent of equipment and; (iv) 100
   percent of operating costs. The NBA has International Organization status in Niger and there-
   fore i s exempt from the Standard Disbursement Percentage (SDP) requirement. NBA has pro-
   vided documentation on tax-exemption. This exemption will be documented in Section Iof
   the Grant Agreement: "Compliance with Bank Policies." All withdrawal applications must be
   fully documented, except for expenses claimed against contracts not subject to prior review
   by the Bank. For the rest of the contracts, disbursements will be made against Statements of
   Expenses (SOEs) certified by the PFO at the PMCU.

   2.        Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Requests for funds withdrawals will be
   properly documented for all expenditures to be paid out of the GEF Grant, except for the fol-
   lowing contracts for which disbursements will be made against SOEs certified by both the
   P M C U Regional Project Coordinator and the National Project Coordinator: (i)contracts for
   goods with a unitary value below USD 250,000 equivalent; (ii)contracts with consulting
   f i r m s with a unitary value below USD 100,000 equivalent and with individual consultants for
   an amount below USD 50,000 equivalent; (iii)       additional operating expenses; and (iv) train-
   ing. Documentation of such SOEs will be retained by the PMCU and made available for re-
   view, on request, to procurement and financial auditors and to WB/GEF supervision missions.

   3.        Special Account. In order to facilitate Project implementation and reduce the volume
   of withdrawal applications, the NBA will open a Special Account in U S D Dollars in a com-
   mercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to WB/GEF. The authorized allocation will
   be currency US Dollars and will cover about four months of eligible expenditures. Upon Pro-
   ject effectiveness, WB/GEF will deposit the amount in US Dollars representing 50 percent of
   the authorized allocation into the Special Account. The remaining balance will be made avail-
   able when the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the GEF Grant account, plus the total
   amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the WB/GEF, shall be ap-
   proximately or exceed the equivalent o f U S D 1,000,000. The Special Account should be re-
   plenishedeach month. To facilitate the management of the Project at a national level a 90-day


                                                                                                  51

                         .
Advance Account procedure will be used. The 90-day Advance Account procedure, designed
for decentralized accounts, would be used to facilitate the operation of PMCU and to ensure
prompt payment of consultants and suppliers. Following the procedures of IBRD, the Project
would advance funds covering no more than 90 days estimated expenditures (in local cur-
rency) to NPTs. Each national NPT will submit quarterly expenditure reports indicating
sources and uses of funds, and accompanied by reconciled bank statements. The PMCU
would then aggregate this data, prepare a reconciliation statement for the NBA Special Ac-
count, and prepare replenishment applications accompanied by the bank statement for the
Special Account. All expenditures under the 90-day Advance Accounts will need to be sup-
ported by an SOE or regular summary sheets, depending on the prior review contract thresh-
olds.

5.      A financial management assessment of NBA was carried out by the World Bank. The
objective of the assessment was to determine whether the Project has in place an adequate fi-
nancial management system as required under Bank guidelines and to recommend financial
management arrangements for the mitigation of the fiduciary risk components identified. The
assessment resulted in an action plan and a schedule of the financial management arrange-
ments and confirmed the need to establish the PMCU at the NBA.

6.      Implementation arrangements. A financial management of NBA was carried out by
the World Bank. The objectives of the assessment was to determine whether the project has
in place an adequate financial management system as required under Bank guidelines and to
recommend FM arrangements for the mitigation of the fiduciary risk components identified.
The conclusion of the assessment brought to the action plan disclosing the schedule o f FM
arrangements installment and confirmed the need to establish the P M C U at NBA.

The financial management of this Project i s the responsibility o f the PMCU. The related du-
ties of the P M C Ucover budget and cash managements, accounting, internal control, financial
reporting and external audit preparation. The system, acceptable to IDA, to carry out these
duties will be fully in place prior to Project effectiveness based on the action plan drawn be-
low. The P M C U will be housed at NBA offices and will be, under the supervision o f NBA,
in charge of all aspects of financial management of the Project. The PMCU will thus benefit
from NBA experience in term of managing funds. The main recommendations below related
to the staff, to the information system and to the organization should be implemented before:
(b) negotiations and (a and c) the effectiveness of the Project.

    0    (a) At a regional level, PMCU will have, among other staff, a Regional Project Coor-
         dinator, a Project Financial Officer (PFO), and a procurement specialist.

    0    (b) Upon NBA's financial management assessment, NBA will second to the Project an
         accountant, a financial controller and an internal auditor.

    0    (c) At a national level, the Project will be managed by an NPT. The NPT will recruit a
         National Project Coordinator, a microgrant specialist and an accountant/support staff.

7.      Accounting policies and procedures. NBA has been applying satisfactory procedures
since it was set up. However, these procedures have not been formalized in a reference
document such as a manual and they will probably differ from the procedures o f the current
Project. A draft a Manual of Procedures must be developed and finalized by the Project be-
fore effectiveness. This Manual must include accounting policies and procedures; clear defi-
nition of respective duties; budgeting system; all relevant administrative, accounting and fi-
nancial procedures; relation between the components of the Project, and reporting mecha-
nisms at each level (regional, national and local). The terms of reference for preparation of
the Manual should be submitted for the Bank's approval. Relevant staff involved in the Pro-
ject must be trained in accounting and procurement procedures.




                                                                                               53

   8.       Reporting and monitoring. The PMCU will prepare quarterly Financial Management
   Reports (FMR) based on an Annual Work Plan. The format of the FMR will be discussed and
   agreed before effectiveness.          The quarterly reports will cover financial management, pro-
   curement, and physical progress monitoring, and will take into consideration all activities fi-
   nanced under the Project regardless of the source of funding. No major problem i s expected
   with the financial and procurement reports. An area of concern i s with the physical progress
   monitoring report, where P M C U lacks experience; this would require additional effort. The
   physical progress reports will be based on the outcome indicators.

   9.       Financial management information system. A computerized financial management
   system must be installed for the PMCU. The chart of accounts (expenses categories and ac-
   tivities) of the Project and the report formats must be customized prior to effectiveness in or-
   der to ease the production of the FMR and the annual financial statements.

   10.      Audit arrangements. The Project's accounts will be subject to annual external audit
   by a reputable auditing firm based on terms of reference appropriate for the Project's scope, to
   be approved by the Bank. These terms of reference will cover the Project's accounts and in-
   ternal control framework. The selection of the auditor for the Project will be a condition of
   effectiveness. The annual audit reports will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the
   end of each fiscal year (Le., June 30th).

   11.      Conditionsfor effectiveness and negotiations. The conditions for effectiveness are
   detailed in the GEF Project Document, Section D.7. As part of the financial management as-
   sessment, Table 2 reflects the action plan that was agreed on with NBA and that was part of
   the negotiation package, and financial management assessment.

                                             Annex 8:
                                          Procurement

Guidelines

1.      The Bank will finance goods, consultancies, training, and other local activities neces-
sary to implement the Project. The procurement of goods, works, and services will be done in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits
(January 1995, Revised January and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999) and
the Guidelines on Selection and Employment of Consultants by Bank Borrowers (January
1997, revised September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002). The Bank's standard bidding
documents for goods and the standard forms of contract and request for proposals for consult-
ing services will be used under the Project. Any goods or services not financed by the Bank
will be procured in accordance with the public procurement regulations o f the riparian coun-
tries or the co-financing institution's procurement regulations.

Advertising of procurement opportunities

2.      GPN. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) has been prepared and issued inthe UN
Development Business (UNDB), immediately after negotiations to advertise for any I C B for
goods and for major consulting assignments. Sufficient time will be allowed (minimum o f 30
days) before preparing the short list.

3.      SPN. Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) for goods to be procured under ICB and
Expressions of Interest for Consultants' Services estimated to cost the equivalent o f
USD 200,000 and above will also be published in Development Business (UNDB on-line) as
well as in the national press of the Niger River Basin riparian countries. Assignments esti-
mated to cost less than USD 200,000 may be advertised regionally in riparian countries; the
shortlist for assignments estimated to cost the equivalent amount of USD 100,000 or less may
be made up entirely o f consultants from the Niger River Basin riparian countries, provided
that no more than two qualified firms from any one of the Niger River Basin riparian coun-
tries are on the shortlist, and foreign consultants who wish to participate are not excluded
from consideration.

Procurement capacity assessment

4.       A procurement capacity assessment of the NBA was carried out as part of the institu-
tional analysis in March 2002. During appraisal, an action plan was agreed to address areas
where the existing structures still need to be strengthened to meet performance criteria. The
action plan includes:

         (i)    The recruiting o f a procurement specialist for the PMCU at the regional level;
         (ii)    The training of counterpart staff of NBA;
         (iii)   The installation of a procurement planning and contract management system
                 integrated in the computerized financial management system at the PMCU;
         (iv)    The reorganization o f the filing o f procurement-related documents;
         (v)     The supplyingof NBA with filing material (filing cabinets andfolders); and
         (vi)    The preparation o f a procurement plan.


                                                                                               55

The P M C U will be installed within the NBA and the procurement capacity o f the P M C U will
be assessedlater when all its members have been recruited.

Procurement planning

5.      Procurement Plans. Draft procurement plans for the Project's first year o f implemen-
tation were prepared during appraisal. These plans will be finalized by effectiveness and will
be included in the PIM. The plans are based on the initial needs of the Project and the work
plans submitted by the NBA. The proposed procurement plans will be updated every 6
months and furnished to the Bank for review and approval. The exact mix of procurement
will be determined on an annual basis during the annual joint reviews between NBA, the
Bank and other partners, when procurement plans for the following financial year will be pre-
sented and agreed upon. The plans will include relevant information on goods and consulting
services under the Project, indicating the procurement method as well as the timing of each
milestone in the procurement process.

6.      Procurement Arrangements. The Niger River Basin Project is a stand-alone GEF
Project. The Bank financed portion will be executed on behalf of the Niger River Basin ripar-
ian countries by the NBA and i s funded from one single source: the GEF Trust Fund in the
amount of USD 6.0 million equivalent. This Annex outlines procurement arrangements for
GEFfunded activities.

7.       The NBNSE will be responsible for Project management, including financial man-
agement and procurement. The PMCU will work closely with the NBA/SE and with the re-
gional institutions and NPTs to ensure timely Project implementation. The P M C U will also
be primarily responsible for reporting on Project progress, financial management and pro-
curement and disbursement, identifying implementation gaps and bottlenecks, and managing
Project accounts and budget.

8.       The PMCU will recruit a procurement specialist (regional-level) who will be responsi-
ble for handling procurement activities. The procurement specialist will be expected to: (i)
prepare bidding documents; (ii) ensure quality; (iii) on specific procurement prob-
                                  help                     focus
lems and issues; (iv) make a significant contribution to ensuring that procurement takes place
as rapidly and effectively as possible; and (v) coordinate with the PFO to ensure overall inte-

c/
gration of procurement plans and financial reports; work closely and coach the NBA counter-
part.

9.       Manual of Procedures. The Manual of Procedures, a financial and administrative
manual, will be prepared. It will serve as a practical guide describing procedures agreed upon
in negotiations. It will include: (i)procedures for calling for bids, selecting consultants, and


                                                                                              56

awarding contracts; (ii)internal organization for supervision and control, including opera-
tional guidelines defining the role of the executing agency and reporting requirements; and
(iii)disbursement procedures. A draft Manual of Procedures will be sent to the Bank for re-
view and clearance before effectiveness.

10.     Procurement package preparation. All procurement packages will be prepared either
by NBA directly or by the procurement specialist at the PMCU. All procurement will be car-
ried out in accordance with the procurement plan and as agreed with the Bank.                The
PMCU/NBA will forward the procurement packages to the Bank for prior review and no ob-
jection, as required.

Procurement methods

11.     Procurement methods. The Project elements by disbursement category, their esti-
mated costs, and procurement methods are summarized in Table A below. Thresholds for
procurement methods and prior review are summarized inTable B.

    (a)     Goodsand equipment (USD0.37 million)

            Goods financed under the Project would include light vehicles, computers, and
            miscellaneous equipment. The total value of goods i s estimated at about USD 0.37
            million equivalent for the Project.

            Technical equipment and other goods costing U S D 250,000 and more per contract
            will be subject to International Competitive Bidding (ICB) requirements. Goods
            estimated to cost less than USD 250,000 or equivalent may be awarded on the ba-
             sis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB). It should be noted that for this Pro-
            ject, NCB includes all of the participating riparian countries and bidding opportu-
            nities will therefore be publishedin all riparian countries for NCB.

            For goods, contracts below USD 50,000 will be procured through prudent Shop-
            Ping in accordance with provisions of paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines and the
             Bank's guidance procurement note on handling procurement under shopping
             method (June 8, 2000). Solicitations will be issued in writing to at least three
             reputable suppliers (preferably more) in order to receive at least three competitive
             quotations. Solicitations will give specifications, and if not immediately available,
             the delivery time. Written quotations will be opened at the same time for evalua-
             tion and records of award decisions will be kept for Bank supervision missions and
             audits.

             Direct contracting may be exceptionally used with the prior no-objection of the
             Bank for the procurement of spare parts, operating expenditures, minor off-the-
             shelf items, and other specialized equipment and proprietary items costing less
             than USD 20,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate of the equivalent
             value of USD 200,000.




                                                                                                57

(b)  Consultants' services (USD1.32million)


   0 As the majority of work undertaken in this Project i s capacity building and techni-
     cal assistance to the Niger River Basin riparian countries, a large percentage of the
     expenditures will be for Consultants' Services, much of which will be based in the
     Niger River Basin. Following agreed upon criteria, the P M C U will maintain and
     update a list of consultants that will be used to establish shortlists. The shortlists
     will be established based on expressions of interests received through GPNs and
     Specific Advertisements placed in the UNDB and/or regional newspapers, depend-
     ing upon the estimated value of such assignments. Consultant firms financed un-
     der the Project will be selected in accordance with Bank Consultant Guidelines.
     The following selection procedures will be used for Consultants' Services:

     (i)  Oualitv-and-Cost-based (QCBS): All consulting service contracts for firms
          valued at more than USD 100,000 equivalent would be awarded through the
          Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method. To ensure that priority i s
          given to the identification of suitable and qualified national consulting firms,
          shortlists for QCBS contracts estimated at or less than U S D 100,000 equiva-
          lent may be comprised entirely of national consultants from the Niger River
          Basin riparian countries, with-no more than two firms on the shortlist from
          any one riparian country, (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7
          o f the Consultant Guidelines), provided that a sufficient number of qualified
          f i r m s (at least three) are available. However, if foreign firms have expressed
          interest, they would not be excluded from consideration.

     (ii) Selection based on Consultant's Qualification (CQ) may be used for consult-
          ing service contracts below an estimated contract amount of USD 100,000
          equivalent, for research and targeted interventions for which organizations
          with specialized expertise, strong capacities to work with multinational
           groups and proven track records would be recruited. CQ may also be used
          for the selection of training institutions for contracts to provide training ser-
           vices that are estimated to cost up to USD 100,000 equivalent per contract.

     (iii) financialaudits,theLeastCostSelection(LCS) methodwillbethemost
          For
           appropriate method.

     (iv) Single Source Selection (SSS) may be used exceptionally for training, for
           specific tasks in a case where only one firm has specific qualified experience,
           and for consulting assignments costing less than USD 50,000 per contract up
          to an aggregate amount of the equivalent value of USD 300,000.

     (v)   Selection of Individual Consultants Services (IC): Consultants for services
           meeting the requirements of Section V of the Consultant Guidelines will be
           selected under the provisions for the Selection of Individual Consultants
          method. Individual Consultants (IC) will be selected through comparison of
          curriculum vitae of those expressing interest in the assignment against job
           description requirements, or o f those having been identified directly by the



                                                                                           58

               PMCU. Civil servants from the riparian countries cannot be hired as con-
               sultants under the Project.

   (c)   Training,workshop and conferences (USD2.06 million)

         Training, workshops, conference attendance and study tours will be carried out on
         the basis of approved annual programs that will identify the general framework of
         training and similar activities for the year, including the nature o f training'study
         tours/workshops, the number of participants, and cost estimates.            For national
         training and workshops, preference will be given to consultants from the country
         in which the training is being organized, provided that a sufficient number of
         qualified individuals or firms (at least three) are available. For regional training,
         preference will be given to consultants from the Niger River Basin riparian coun-
         tries, provided that no more than two consultants from any one riparian are short-
         listed and a sufficient number of qualified individuals or firms (at least three) i s
         available.

   (d)   Operational expenses (USD 1.86million)

         The NBA will establish and staff the PMCU office at the N B A B S in Niamey, Ni-
         ger. The P M C U will assist the NBA in Project management and implementation.
         Project staff employed under the Bank funded portion o f the Project will be hired
         in accordance with Section V of the Bank's Consultant Guidelines. Other opera-
         tional costs, such as utilities, printing, translation, office supplies, will be procured
         through Shopping. All the above positions will be advertised.

12.   Prior Review Thresholds (Table B). The Bank will conduct a prior review of the fol-
lowingprocurement documentation:

             Goods: All contracts estimated to cost the equivalent value of USD 250,000 or
             more will be submitted for prior review.

              Consultants' services:All contracts with firms estimated to cost the equivalent
             value of USD 100,000 or more, will be submitted for prior review as per para-
             graph 2, Appendix Iof the Guidelines. Individual consultant contracts above
             USD 50,000 will all be subject to prior review. Other procurement subject to
             Bank review would include: annual training plans for local and overseas train-
             ingand workshops, including terms of reference andestimated budgets. All
             out of country training will be subject to Bank approval.

              Operational expenses: All individual long-term contracts (greater than six
             months) for Project staff will be subject to prior review.

             Single source selection: All single source selection, regardless of value, for as-
              signments of a critical nature (as determined by the Bank) will be subject to
             Bank prior review.




                                                                                                 59

13.    Frequency of procurement support missionsproposed. It i s suggested that procure-
ment implementation support be provided to this Project once every four months inthe first
year and twice a year for the remaining period, including focus on post-review/audits as speci-
fied above. It i s also suggested that this procurement implementation support be given to
PMCU/NBA headquarters inNiamey.

14.    NBA will also give assurance at negotiations that it will take the necessary measures
to ensure that procurement phases do not exceed the following target time periods:

       Procurement Phases                                    Maximum number of weeks
       Preparationof biddingdocuments                        4 (6 for large contracts)
       Preparationof bids by bidders                         4 (6-10 for ICB)
       Bidevaluation                                         2 (4 for large contracts)
       Signature of Contracts                                2
       Payments                                              3

15.    Overallprocurement risk assessment. The risk identified inprocurement i s medium;
particular attention should be paid duringrecruitment of the consultant to be incharge of
these aspects o f Project execution.

                                    Incremental Cost Analysis

Introduction

1.      The riparian countries share a common concern to address the Basin issues beyond the
boundaries o f specific national interests and recognize that to address these transboundary issues
would include additional cost, the incremental cost. This cost i s the measure of the economic
burden that would be placed on the Niger River Basin countries for undertalung the sustainable
development of the Basin, beyondtheir current national baseline and capacity.

2.      Under the broader international waters work being carried out in the Niger River Basin,
there is significant emphasis on enhancing existing capacity at the national and regional level.
The Niger River Basin countries are developing a SDAP for the Niger River Basin with the sup-
port of the Bank. Whereas the GEF Project's SAP will focus on managing the Basin's environ-
ment, the SDAP will deal with the broader issues o f multi-sector sustainable development in the
Basin. The SAP and the SDAP can be managed as complementary processes, with the SAP as a
natural precursor. The GEF TDNSAP i s identifying, characterizing, and prioritizing water-
related, environmental issues and sectors across the Niger River Basin member states, as well
developing a framework for environmental management and development in the Basin. The
SDAP will envelope all possible sectors, both those with environmental externalities, as well as
those not before captured by the SAP process, and will build on the environmental management
framework developed for the SAP. The GEF Project will support strengthened regional, na-
tional, and local decision-malung capacity, providing a better understanding of the sector issues,
which contribute to land and water degradation, and mechanisms to manage these transboundary
issues in a more inclusive participatory decision-making process.

Globalenvironmental objective

3.      The Project's global environmental objectives are to reduce and prevent transboundary
water-related environmental degradation, prevent land degradation, and protect globally signifi-
cant biodiversity, through sustainable and cooperative integrated management of the Basin.

4.      The significance of the Basin has been highlighted by the international interest in its eco-
logical elements. If the transboundary issues are not addressed, the direct and indirect threats to
this international waterbody will result in the progressive breakdown of the hydrological and
ecological integrity o f the Niger River Basin system. This will cause the global community to
forfeit sizeable global conservation benefits; this includes direct and indirect use values, and ex-
istence and option values from the Basin.

Development objective

5.      To achieve the global environmental objectives, the Project's development objective is to
provide the nine riparians an opportunity to define a transboundary framework for the sustain-
able development o f the Niger River Basin, through strengthened capacity and better understand-
ingof the Basin's land andwater resources.




                                                                                                  63

6.      The development objective supports the nine riparian countries (Benin, Burkma Faso,
Cameroon, Chad, C8te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria) of the Niger River Basin in
their efforts to work together to assure the sustainable development and management of the Ba-
sin's land and water resources, including protection of its unique drylands environment and asso-
ciated biodiversity. These requirements are transboundary in nature, clearly transcending na-
tional capacities and priorities, and requiring financial and technical resources significantly be-
yond those that can be mobilized by each riparian state singly or in combination.

7.      The long-term goal of the GEF Project i s to achieve global benefits, as identified above,
through broad, basin-wide participation in the development and implementation of measures that
ensure that the integrity of the Niger River system i s protected by integrated management of the
Basin's resources. This requires orchestration o f both national and regional activities through
efficient Basin governance. Measures are targeted to mitigate the causes and effects o f desertifi-
cation in the region and building of capacity at regional, national, and local levels to create en-
hanced adaptive capacities.

Barriers to better land and water management

8.      The NBA has been involved in a number of diagnostic studies, which formed the basis
for the Project's preparation. During Project preparation it became evident that there are a num-
ber of issues which impact the Basin. These issues are part o f a greater concern about the multi-
sectoral contribution to escalating negative impacts on land and water resources. The main is-
sues in the Basin include:

    0   Inadequately coordinated land and water management frameworks;
    0   Continued degradation o f land, water, andrenewable resources;
    0   Insufficient and inadequate information and data for good management practices and to
        support the decision-making process; and
        Cumulative degradation from the hydropower sector.

Removing the barriers

9.      There are a number of initiatives in the Basin to develop appropriate linkages and coordi-
nate efforts to benefit from lessons learned, so that scarce financial resources can be used more
efficiently to improve national and basin-wide water resources management. In a shared river
basin, interests may conflict with each other, especially as national interests are often based upon
immediate needs rather than their long-term impact. Given the environmental degradation in the
Basin, resulting from cumulative impacts from the issues discussed above, it i s becoming in-
creasingly apparent that to tackle the causes will require a coordinated multi-country effort
across the Basin, with action takmg place at the appropriate level (i.e., subsidiarity). At present,
several major barriers need to be removed if NBA is to make progress in its attempts to secure a
sustainable future for the Niger River Basin ecosystem. Efforts to remove these barriers would
include:

        Introducing effective land and water management, to mitigate desertification and sedi-
        mentation problems;
    0   Establishing reliable water resources monitoring and data exchange;



                                                                                                  64

          Coordinating management of the Basin's infrastructure; and
          Promoting good management practices for biodiversity protection and conservation.

10.       In the longer term, through this Project and integration with the SDAP, the removal of
barriers to sustainable use of the Basin's resources will widen the menu of development options
available at the regional, national, and local level. However, in the short term, the program to
address transboundary issues will result in mainly non-pecuniary benefits. For the riparian coun-
tries, tangible costs exceed tangible benefits in the intermediate term, providing little incentive to
undertake this initiative without external assistance.

Baseline scenario

11.       The Niger River Basin resources have an intrinsic value to the riparian countries' future
development potential, and therefore almost all investments in the national development arena
have direct implications for the Basin's land and water resources. Currently, there i s an exten-
sive list of projects and programs taking place and proposed in the nine Basin countries, with
each contributing to improvement in national concerns. As part of the initial phase of Project
preparation, a range of ~ u r r e n tpast and proposed8Bank projects in the Basin were inventoried
                                            , ~
and evaluated, as they pertained to agriculture, forestry, environment or water sectors. Similar
effort was conducted for the current and future UNDP9country projects, as well as donor pro-
jects. With the knowledge that each relevant project in the Basin contributes to the fundamental
baseline of Basin development, it is necessary to make note of the range o f activities in the Ba-
sin.

 12.      However, for the sake o f clarity, to define the true value of the incremental benefit from
this Project, in its transboundary context, the baseline was defined by a specific parameter to in-
cludejust those activities which directly contribute to and support the Project's development ob-
jective.       Therefore, the baseline assessment considered the relevant donor-supported co-
financindparallel efforts proposed in the Basin, which directly contribute to and complement the
Project component activities. These funds, together with the in-kind national contributions, de-
fined the baseline amount as USD29.64 million. The NBA and national governments in-kind

13.     GEF Alternative. The GEF Alternative regional program, together with the SDAP and
other initiatives in the Basin, will support actions that are compatible with the economic and so-
cial interests of each country, while generating benefits to the Basin for the overall environment.
It would create new opportunities for regional development by enabling all players within the
Basin to be responsible for identifying priorities in the Basin and to engage in the decision-
making process.

14.     The GEF Project will provide support for improving management and protection o f the
Basin resources. It will also be a vital instrument, through the development o f the SAP, for mo-
bilizing, catalyzing, and generating sustainable national development projects which consider the
environment as an essential element for future development. Reciprocally, these national devel-
opment programs concerned with water and environment, and coordinated within a comprehen-
sive strategic approach basin-wide (i.e. within the context of the SAP) will be decisive in upgrad-
ing the capabilities that need to be mobilized collectively, throughout the region, to improve the
Niger River Basin ecosystem. Given the size and scope of the work that has to be organized and
carried out, no other project or initiative in the short or medium term can provide the assistance
needed to address the environmental problems of the Niger River Basin.

15.     To avoid the overall environmental risks identified above, in-kind support being provided
by the member states for regular NBA operations needs to be further extended and comple-
mented. Existing support i s insufficient to cope with the magnitude o f the problems at hand.
The gap in support will be financed under the proposed Project. In this regard, other priority re-
gional programs would benefit from being co-financed with other donors in order to generate
more wide-ranging actions and thus have a more rapid impact on the human and physical envi-
ronments. At the national level, the components financed by the GEF would also help to support
existing and future programs to become integrated into national sustainable development pro-
grams and into the SAP for the entire Basin.

Project financing and incremental cost matrix

16.     The GEF Altemutive increment.               Total Project costs are estimated to be
USD42.64millio1-1, with a total GEF contribution and costs of USD 13 million. The remaining
amount o f U S D 29.64 million will come from various co-financing sources such as: national
government in-kind contributions, and active donors in the Basin (USD 2.07 million from cur-
rent in-kmd, U S D 27.57 million from donors), summarized in Table 2.

17.     The incremental cost matrix (Table 3) shows the costs to achieve the stated domestic and
global benefits, the global environmental objectives, and the benefits associated with the GEF
Alternative. The increment i s differentiated from the baseline for the component activities.

18.     Overall domestic benefits From incremental costs:

        Countries are able to strengthen water and environment management without losing de-
        velopment funds for other critical short-term priorities and without losing competitive
        position.
        Interventions are more targeted at removing the root causes of threats, thus improving the
        efficacy and cost-effectiveness of management endeavors.
        National capacities to implement a holistic resources management method at all levels are
        strengthened.
        Civil society i s more responsive to environmental protection measures.
        Ecological sustainability of activities in the Basin will be better assured, for each country.

19.     The global environmental objectives will be achieved through broad basin-wide partici-
pation in and implementation o f cooperative decision-making and best practices, and sustainable
management o f the Basin's land and water resources. The long-term global environmental bene-
fits that would accrue from the successful completion of the Project activities and future imple-
mentation of the SAP include:

    0   Strengthened regional, national, and local institutional capacity in all nine-Basin coun-
        tries will support effective execution capacity for future regional project implementation.
        Strengthened regional, national, and local institutional capacity for sustainable land and
        water resource management in the Niger River Basin with an inclusive framework for re-
        gional cooperation will be supported through agreements on policy/institutional and legal
        adjustments at regional and national levels.
        Harmonized and coherent basin-wide national data collection, and effective data dissemi-
        nated will be a valuable capacity for national and regional decision-makers.
        Forums with other regional initiatives provide a mechanism to better collaborate and
        communicate the exchange of good practices and better management of Basin resources.
        Public participation in management o f local resources increases ownership of civil soci-
        ety through microgrant-supported community-based activities that will enable communi-
        ties to understand the cause and effect of environmental and land degradation, and tackle
        priority issues in the Basin directly.

                Reversing Landand Water DegradationTrends inthe Niger River Basin

FINAL,DOWNSTREAMREVIEW NO. 1:

1. Overall impression
   -  The Project Brief and Annexes (PB&A) have been revised to concur with comments made in the two earlier re-
      views. Apart from a modified version of the PB&A, responses to particular questions in the "upstream STAP Ros-
      ter Technical Reviews" have been given in Annex E. Some important issues have been clarified in Annex E, viz.
      the relations and complementarities of SAP and SDAP; the conditions under which the microgrant program is or-
      ganised; the role of the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC); and, that it is a four year project. Iam also pleased
      to note, "...Letters of endorsement are in preparation". In terms of substance, it is also appreciated that "... land
      and water tenure, urbanisation and other sector issues [are] to be addressed in the SAP SDAP process". The same
      applies to Rain Water Harvesting and other specific interventions.
   -  There are still some issues that need to be clarified, which will be presented in the sections below.
   -  An overall impression is that the Project addresses serious problems in the Niger River Basin, with grave implica-
      tions for present and future generations, in the basin as well as beyond. A second reading of the (revised) docu-
      ments reinforces the impression that the Project enjoys wide support from the riparian countries.
2. Relevance and priority
   -  A strengthening of the mechanisms that could forge a better co-ordination between national and community institu-
      tional arrangements, on the on hand, and regional structures on the other, is most important. Concurrence with

   -  NEPAD, ALWMI, LCBC, etc. adds relevance to the project.
      A most pertinent issue in the Niger Basin is the ongoing land and water degradation and the significant reduction,
      and regional shift, in the water resources in recent decades in combination with land degradation and increasing pol-
      lution. A dwindling resource base and a continuous rapid increase of the population i s most problematic combina-
      tion. If allowed to continue unabated, these alarming trends will have accelerating devastating effects on the envi-
      ronment as well as on society. They have already resulted in tensions in the basin. So far, it seems that tensions at
      the international level have not been severe, but they could very well mount. In addition, the link between poverty
      and environmental degradation could be cemented. The Project Components are of direct relevance in this regard:
      Efforts to strengthen institutional arrangements (Capacity building- Component 2), data and information collection
      and analyses (Data Management       - Component 3), Regional Forum (Component 4) and the Microgrants (Compo-
      nent 5).
   -  Many of the efforts to reverse the trends should be designed at a regional scale and then be translated into actions,
      dialogues and evaluations at the lower levels. At the same time, the importance of community-based approaches is
      underlined in the PB&A.
3. Approach
   -  Management of the Project is still not quite clear. In the Project Executive Summary (PES), it is mentioned
      that "The Project will be executed by an executing agency on behalf of the NBA Executive Secretariat who
      will be responsible for supporting NBA Executive Secretariat.. .."(Under: 5. Institutional Coordination & Sup-
      port). Apart from peculiarities of formulation, it is not shown how the responsibilities of the executing agency
      will be coordinated with the PMU, which will be `' ...primarily responsible for project implementation". The
      difference between "execution" and "implementation" needs to be made explicit. In Table 1, Annex J, the exe-
      cuting agency i s missing. According to the same Table and in the text, it seems that the PMU will have both
      implementing/executing obligations and be the key agent responsible for monitoring. Monitoring, in tum, is
      the basis for Project evaluation and, thus, for correction of policy. This implies a double role for PMU, which
      could be problematic.
   -  I n Annex E (Response to STAP Technical Review) it is noted, ". ., The staffing of the P M U will be of the high-
      est caliber, competitively selected staff to assist in Project implementation". That is well and good. What will
      happen at the end of the four-year period?




                                                                                                                     93

  -   The Niger River Basin Task Force is another unit proposed to be part of the management structure. It is sup-
      posed to serve as `.. A steering committee in an advisor capacity ...". The members are supposed to come
      from, among others, the executing agency. The member representing the executive agency would therefore be

  -   both an advisor and an executor.
      When reading the documents, it appearsthat there is a certain amount of overlap of functions between the units
      and that the roles given to the various units in the management structure should be more clearly identified and
      separated.
  -   In the previous Project Brief and Annexes, the role of legislation was highlighted and the importance of en-
      forcement. In the revised version, Ihave not been able to find a similar concern. Maybe this is due to the fact
      that legal issues are part of the institutional arrangements. I t is, however, relevant to make a special note about
      the significance o f the legal system or the legal principles. To the extent that the different riparian countries
      have legal systems, which do not match, it should be a matter of priority to address those differences that are
      contradictory. This is important in order to reduce possible conflicts between the riparians in the future and to
      have a system and an arena where potential conflicting demands may be dealt with. If, for example, country X
      intends to go ahead with a particular project, e.g. a dam or an imgation project, which country (-ies) Y, Z. op-
      pose, a common legal framework or some agreed upon principles, would be important. In the documents, it i s
      mentioned that Nigeria i s facing a critical situation in the energy sector and may want to increase its hydroelec-
      tric production. Hence, they do not want to have reductions in the flow in the river, which has implications for

  -   what Nigeria will support or accept in terms of water utilization in upstreamcountries.
      The creation of a Regional Forum (Component 4) is interesting. Iam sure it will be of great help. It might be
      useful to also create a "Regional NGO Forum", Le. a meeting place for the NGOs involved in the Project. Inthe
      light of the difficulties that have been faced to involve local communities (Project Brief, p. 25), it is vital that the
      NGOs are supported, since they are the direct links to communities. The selection of NGOs is also a crucial

  -   step.
      From the documents, it seems that there is, yet, no clear focus in water policy with regard to the sectors of soci-
      ety, which have a significant impact on water resources. On pages 7 - 8 in the Project Brief, it i s mentioned that
      "Water resources initiatives are mostly tied to new water supply and sanitation projects..." i.e. to the sector
      which has a low consumptive use of water. If this is so, there is a need for initiatives. which refer to the sectors
      of society with a heavy consumptive use and/or activities, which have effects on flow (regulation). The Global
      Water Partnership will be an important partner in this regard (see page 31, Project Brief).
4. Objectives
   -  The objectives are formulated in qualitative terms, which give a general picture of what might be accom-
      plished. Considering the character of the project, this is reasonable. The relation to other regional, national
      and local development efforts have become more clearly in the revised proposal. A valid motivation for the ar-
      rangement of data management has been added in the revised version.
5. Background andjustification
   -  As mentioned in my previous evaluation, the documents provide a good picture of the situation and important
      trends. Justification for this project i s a strong need for increased capacity at various levels in the Basin to reverse

   -  the trends. So far, capacity at regional level is weak. The presentation is clear and valid in these regards.
      Ialsonotethatthereisstillalackofinformationabouttherecentorcontemporarysituation,forinstance,inthe
      case of urbanisation. The same comment can be made about the NGO sector.
   -   Perhaps most important is the need for an elaborate discussion about poverty; how to reach the poor; how to facili-
      tate that programs will not only mean a certain relief in the daily struggle to survive, but that the poor would be
       given opportunities to play a bigger role in development of society. in production in service sectors etc. Again, it is
       important that legal provisions are used in a pro-active manner.
6. Government commitment and sustainability
   -   The documents give clear indications of Government commitment and Ibelieve that letters of endorsement are be-
       ing produced. Collectively, Governments will contribute with USD 2.14 million to the Incremental Cost budget,
       mainly in kind. World Bank and UNDP contributions in the baseline and GEF Alternative scenarios are substan-
       tially much higher. Isuppose that a large proportion of these have to be repaid and, thus, could be seen as govem-

   -   ment commitments.
       The intention of the Project to strengthen regional collaboration. Regional collaboration is essential for reduction of

   -   tensions, to foster exchange and it facilitates donor support.
       There are, of course, risks associated with the project. But the risks associated with a policy where no actions are
       taken to support declared ambitions to buildregional capacity would be greater.

FINAL,DOWNSTREAMREVIEW NO. 2:
    Upstream STAP reviews were undertaken by me and another STAP International Waters Expert in early January.
The project team based on comments received, including through these reviews, clarified and detailed elements of the
project design. Some modification of the Project has also been done, mainly concerning the significance and content of
the different components. Iwas invited to provide a final review based on the revised document.
     As the main project framework including the project objectives etc. has not changed to any considerably extent,
many of my comments in m y upstream review are still valid. Iwill therefore only provide comments related what is re-
sulting from the clarification and modification.

1.       Overall Impression
                  M y overall impression of the project remains positive. The stronger emphasis on capacity building, in-
         cluding at local level, by a more developed Component 5, which would help local communities understanding
         and combating land and water degradation is an improvement that would hopefully result in a more sustainable
         situation even after the four year project. Comparing the text describing the different activities under the differ-
         ent components in the project brief with that in the Annexes, however, sometimes is a bit confusing. It seems as
         the revised structure of activities is not fully reflected in the different annexes, such as Table 5 on Incremental
         costs in Annex A or in thz Project design summary in Annex B. This might be a technicality but to achieve ef-
         fective implementation the project documentation needs to show conformity.
                  M y current concems regard the fairly complex administrative structure for the project, which seems to
         have developed into something that is even more complex than in the previous version of the project. It is, if
         such a complex structure shall really serve the purpose to achieve effective project implementation, extremely
         important to have in place efficient reporting systems to ensure the issue of accountability. T o achieve trans-
         boundary results the links between local    - national - regional levels must be strong, efficient and well function-
         ing.
                   M y second concem is a technical issue. Technical terminology appearing in the text is sometimes con-
         fusing. It might be a result of misunderstanding but terms used in the text may call for activities that are not
         fully efficient to combat land and water degradation in the area. The text is, for instance consequently using the
         term "siltation" instead of "sedimentation". The latter would include deposition of &l     type of material, the first
         one only very fine-grain material and to prevent adverse impacts would require very different activities. The
         term "sand salutation" is an unknown term, which Iassume should be substituted by either "sand transport" or
         "sedimentation of sand", which of course have different implications. "Hydro-erosion'' i s another unknown
         term, which, would it exist, should imply erosion by any kindof water, ground- or surface water, moving or still
         water. This i s technically impossible and Iassume that the term to be used should be "fluvial erosion", which i s
         erosion by runningwater. Annex A i s in describing the Global Environmental Objective usingthe term "hydro-
         ecological", which again is a confusing unknown term implying ecology in pure water. It i s used to describe
         ecological elements (systems?) of the Basin and would rather refer to both freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems.

                                                                                                                            95

        The mis-use o f geomorphological terminology might just be a result of misunderstanding or ignorance but
        should not be allowed to influence the real activities of the project.
2.      Relevance and priority
        Icontinuetoseetheprojectastimelyandurgent.
3.      Approach
        As Istated in the upstream review, the real strength of the project is the strong local component, demonstrated in
        particularly by the strong Component 5, based on the principle of the very successful UNDP Small Grants Pro-
        gramme. Another strength is the linkage to other ongoing processes in the area such as the SDAP, which also
        needs to be linked to the NEPAD-process. This is a strength but could, if the complex administrative and im-
        plementing structure does not comply with its different roles, be a weakness.
4.      Objectives
        The objectives, in particularly in the light of the responses by the team given to the upstream STAP reviews, are
        clear and focused and should be able to achieve given the activities outlined.
5.      Background and Justification
        As Ivoiced in the upstream STAP review, the project background documentation, in particularly for those coun-
        tries where no TDA exists i s weak, in particularly regarding on existing institutions that will be accountable for
        the implementation at national level concerning all aspects. This will, however, according to the response be de-
        tailed through the appraisal process.
        What Iraised under item 1 on terminology i s hopefully just misuse of terminology and not a result of weak
        background documentation!
6.      Government commitment and sustainability
        Given the revised background documentation and the responses by the Project Team, the governments commit-
        ments to sustainability of the project seems fully secured. M y only concern regarding sustainability i s that it i s
        important that the complex project administration and implementation structure secures a strong base for the in-
        stitutional structure that will continue implementing activities in accordance with the project in post-project
        time.
7.      Activities
        The revised system of activities under the different components in particularly under component 5 as well as the
        continuous processes under SAP and SDAP would, according to the documentation, ensure that the activities are
        in compliance with the objectives.
8.      Project Funding
        The project funding structure has been modified to further emphasis the component 5, which is acknowledged
        with satisfaction but which makes it even more important to ensure effective results from that important compo-
        nent, including by the preparation of a manual for these processesandby the monitoring and evaluation process.
9.      Replicability
        The lessons-leamed from other regional initiatives is demonstrated as being important in the modified project
         documentation.
10.      Time frame
        Even though the time-frame of the project i s four years, i t i s important that it will generate sustainable activities
         that will continue in post-project time.
11.      Global EnvironmentalBenefits and goals of the GEF
         The Global Environment Benefits and the goals of the GEF are sufficiently addressed in the revised project
         document. where it is emphasised that the project will also be able to address issues linked to the Desertification
         Convention under the new Focal Area of Land Degradation.
12.      Rationalfor GEF support
         This is sufficiently covered in the revised project documentation.
13.      Secondary issues to be addressed
         The modified project document i s allowing for the addressing of issues such as mitigating desertification, the
         MDGs to the extent possible. and also compliance with objectives under NEPAD. The Team response to the
         upstream STAP reviews also ensured the identification of compliance with social and environmental safeguards.
         I t i s important to ensure that the project in this also include provisions that will include the poor people of the
         region.

Preliminary STAP Reviews
ReversingLandand Water Degradation Trends inthe Niger River Basin

PRELIMINARY UPSTREAMREVIEW NO. 1:

1.Overall impression
   -   The Niger River Basin i s a river system and basin that is shared by 9 countries, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon,
       Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria. A River Basin Organisation, Niger Basin Authority, ex-
       ists and i s creating a framework for cooperation in actions of mutual interest concerning the Niger River and its
       basin. All nine riparian countries are signatories to the convention that established the NBA out o f the former
       Niger River Commission in 1980. The NBA is financially supported by its member states, who are all commit-
       ted to involve the appropriate ministers and governmental and non-governmental organisations to fulfil the man-

    -  date of the NBA and also work towards implementation of the proposed GEF project.
       Several manageable threats hindering reversal of degradation trends of land and water resources o f the Niger
       River Basin have been identified. Even though the NBA i s to "harmonize and coordinate national policies for
       development, plan the development of the Basin; and, realize, exploit and maintain common works and pro-
       jects", still there i s no coordination between countries on environmental management policies, strategies, laws
       and programs. There are also limited avenues for public involvement and capturing of local knowledge and
       practices in land and water management. There is a lack of instruments and guidelines for determining envi-
       ronmental and social impacts of current decisions on regional land and water resources. And there is a lack of
       cross-border activities to provide for exchange of data and information for averting possible pollution and deg-

    -  radation threats to land and water.
       The Niger Basin Authority has developed a Strategic Vision for the Basin and is developing a Sustainable De-
       velopment Action Plan, SDAP, which i s to ensure socio-economic development through agricultural production,
       energy, industry, transportation, trade, and other related socio-economic activities. Activities as proposed in the
       outlined framework of activities are foreseen as being launched by the NBA and the World Bank.
    -  The proposed GEF project based in the GEF Strategic Action Plan, should be managed in a complementary
       process where the GEF SAP is prioritising environmentally-focussed issues and sectors across the Niger River
       Basin member states, as well as developing a framework for environmental management for all development in
       the Niger River Basin. The project is concentrated around six components; Project management to augment re-
        gional, national, and local institutional capacity in all nine Basin countries; Capacity building primarily by fo-
        cusing on environmental aspects and by including local organisations; Data management, mainly b y filling exist-
        ing gaps by providing for the ability to undertake integrated analysis of national and transboundary natural re-
        courses, including ground and surface water and socio-economic concern; Regional Forum to facilitate the ex-
        change of lessons learned and Basin management best practices in regional Projects in Sub-Saharan Africa;
        Demonstrate change in the Niger Basin Microgrant Programme to promote community involvement, ownership
        and care of local resources based on experience from the UNDP-GEF Small Grants Programme; and comple-
        ment the Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis and the Strategic Action Programme for those riparian countries

    -   where that is lacking.
        The overall impression idea of the GEF project is good. It will be a necessary complement in the area of achiev-
        ing inter-basin and regionaVgloba.1 environmental objectives, in working in a complementary process to the im-
        plementation process for the Niger Basin Sustainable Development Action Plan. The project will serve as an
        important framework to provide increased regional, national and local capacity to reduce and prevent trans-
        boundary land- and water-related degradation. A clear benefit is the strong emphasis on involving local com-
        munities within a river-basin framework. Further the strong coordination component would make the project re-
        sult in sustainable environmental management and help reversing land and water degradation trends in the Niger
        River Basin.
2. Relevance and priority
    -   The project will be a necessary complement to other projects both in the Niger River Basin and in Sahelian re-
        gion as such. In concentrating on reversing land- and water degradation trends in the Niger Basin it will address
        root causes as defined in the TDAs that already exist and ensure the speedy preparation of TDAs for the remain-
        ing countries. The issues thus to be addressed are not focussed in complementary projects which makes the pro-
       ject an important building block in the larger Strategic Vision for the Niger River Basin.
3. Approach
    -   The success of the project to achieve its objectives i s very much depending on to what extent the riparian coun-
        tries at national and local level can build the capacity at all levels and coordinate their efforts based on such ca-

                                                                                                                          97

        pacity towards reversing the land and water degradation trends. The approach presented in detail in the table to
        Annex A clearly demonstrates how the suggested interventions would contribute towards strengthening institu-
        tional capacity which would result in provisions for increased technical as well as human capacity.
    -   The project approach includes addressing the problems emanating from the root causes to land and water degra-
        dation at river basin as well as national and local level, and thereby also address the root causes. The linkage to
        the root causes is, however, not always clearly expressed in the main text but is implicit from studying the table
        in the Annex. The strong local component is the real strength of the project, and it is particularly important in
        those sections to demonstrate its contribution towards reversing the degradation trends.
4. Objectives
    -   The GEF Operational Programme "Integrated Land and Water Multiple Focal Area" objectives for this project
        are to reduce and prevent transboundary water-related environmental degradation, prevent land degradation, and
        to protect globally significant biodiversity. This would be achieved through sustainable and cooperative inte-
        grated management of the Basin, enhance existing capacity, informed decision-making and ensure the public's
        greater involvement in the Basin's decision-making process. The Project's specific development objective is to
        develop and implement sustainable measures for reversing trends in land and water degradation through collabo-
        rative decision-making in the Basin. The objectives are clear and focused and should be able to achieve given
        the activities outlined.
5. Backgroundandjustification
    -   The background material provided in the project documentation include documentation on the Niger Basin Au-
        thority, brief documentation on national policies including very briefly on national Country Assistance Strate-
        gies, CAS, based on the World Bank CAS, and Strategic Context and Sector issues, mainly at basin level.
        Documentation on Key Sector Issues i s mainly based on what exists out of the ongoing process on Transbound-
        ary Diagnostic Analysis, TDA, where some TDAs still remain to be done under the project. The material pro-
        vided gives sufficient information at River Basin level. However, information on the different riparian countries
        i s meagre. It i s understandable that information sometimes has been difficult to obtain, in particularly for those
        countries where no TDA exists but to be able see national conditions including existing institutions, that will be
        accountable for the implementation at national level more decomposed information at riparian state level would
        have been desirable.
6. Government commitment and sustainability
    -   The origin of the project was a request to UNDPand the World Bank from the Niger Basin Authority, supported
        by all nine riparian countries, to provide assistance in preparing an SAP for sustainable management of the Ni-
        ger Basin's land and water resources. The countries have thus expressed their commitment to regional actions
        and to support the regional mechanism. The project clearly address issues such as strengthening the regional
        mechanism, grassroot actions and localhational institutions to achieve sustainable land and water use and man-
        agement.
7. Activities
    -   The different components as defined in the project brief are not to be seen as a step-by-step process: but should
        be undertaken simultaneously. The activities under each component are often to be seen as steps in a sequence.
         So should the steps under component Project Management logically result in a strengthen capacity to fulfil the
         management, even though the use of consultants should be cautioned for project sustainability reasons. The ca-
        pacity building and data management components are both necessary to provide a sound basis of fitting land and
         water degradation projects into a better context and securing good results but also to get full support from vari-
         ous stakeholders. The data management component will secure a bases and instrument for land and water re-
         sources management. The Regional Forumcomponent will ensure comparative analysis of and cooperation with
         other international basins. The Microgrants component will, building on outcomes of the final TDA and SAP,
         ensure implementation of on-the-ground activities to consolidate experience in land and water management.
8. Project funding
    -    Thefinancing planfor the project, including the diflerent components, GEF project component, other prepara-
         tion costs, and co-financing is clearly defined as are associated activities. In the Incremental Cost Matrix the
         direrent components are defined and costed showing proposed levels of jiinding for the different components
         that s e e m very reasonable and adequate.
9. Replicability
    -    The project would, on top of increasing coordinated efforts to reverse land and water degradation for the Niger
         River Basin, also result inexchange of lessons leamed on root causes and demonstrating solutions and best prac-
         tices to address problems of reversing trends in land and water degradation that are applicable inside and outside


                                                                                                                          98

        of the Sahelian region. The project component Regional Forum intends to ensure provisions for such added
        value.
10. Time frame
    -   The clear commitments by the riparian governments and the Niger Basin Authority as well as the ensured par-
        ticipation at grassroot level should guarantee an impetus towards a swift implementation of the project. With the
        institutional framework in place the objectives should be possible to reach within the given time frame.
11.Globalenvironmental benefitsand goalsof the GEF
    -   The project is clearly addressing issues resulting in global environmental benefits in terms of International Wa-
        ters. that is integrated transboundary water resources management and activities. Even though the text refers to
        protection of globally significant biodiversity through sustainable and cooperative management of the Basin, this
        i s not specifically indicated in any definition of the activities, but may be a result of actions taken as a result of
        the increased capacity built within the project. The approach proposed for the project would, if carefully applied
        ensure avoidance of negative environmental effects.
12. Rationale for GEF support
    -   The project will serve to support "better use of land and water resource management practices on an area-wide
        basin", which i s the objective of the GEF OP9. It will further assist the countries to better understand the envi-
        ronmental concerns of shared intemational water and land resources and assist the countries to work collabora-
        tively to address these concerns. It will contribute to the building of capacity in existing institutions and imple-
        ment measures that addressthe priority transboundary environmental concerns.
13. Secondary issues to be addressed
    -   The project would by addressing the TDA also address other focal areas such as mitigate desertification. The
        objectives to be achieved as a result of the project implementation will fit under the Africa Integrated Land and
        Water Initiative of the GEF implementing agencies. It will further contribute toward the fulfilment o f the UN
        Millennium Development Goals, MDGs, and the objectives for the New Partnership for Africa's Development,

    -   NEPAD.
        Important aspects under the project are the strong degree of stakeholder participation at national, local and
        NGO-level under all components, in particularly under the Microgrant component where the main aspect is to
        secure the involvement of local stakeholders in the project. Implementation of the SAP would through increased
        capacity lead to mobilizing and generating of sustainable national development projects. Capacity building as-
        pects at all levels of decision making as well as implementation are important to the sustainable outcome of the
        project.
    -   The innovativeness of the project is that it addresses all levels regional, national and local and that it, through its
        GEF-Small Grants Programme designed Microgrant component provide for a strong involvement at the grasroot
        level.
15. Conclusions
    -   The project complements and builds on other initiatives and projects .both at River Basin level, such as the
        broader Strategic Shared Vision and Sustainable Development Action Plan, and at national level, such as World
        Bank, UNDP TRAC Fund or supported by bilateral donors. Its global environmental objective makes it com-
        plementary to these other initiatives. Its approach, to work at both river basin, national as well as local level, in-
        cluding by involving the grassroot level makes it contribute to coordination and cooperation that would result in
        increased sustainable development at all levels not only from an Intemational Waters perspective but from an
        environmental, economic and social perspective. I t is therefore recommended that the project be approved.

PRELIMINARY, UPSTREAMREVIEW N0.2 :
1.Overall impression
    -   The documents reveal grave imbalances between (i)aggregate human needs, (ii)technology and institutional capac-
        ity to meet these needs, and (iii)biophysical resource base.         A low level of understanding of the environmental
        consequences of resource use practices compounds the problem. A more inspiringimpression is a growing realisa-
        tion about the need for co-ordination of national efforts. The capacity and commitment in this regard are difficult
        to assess. Letters of endorsement are. for instance, missing. Institutional issues, including sensitising efforts, legal
        and enforcement issues and generation & management of datdinformation are highlighted. The documents are less
        clear on connections to concrete efforts in the various sectors. which could "yield more from less". It seem vital to
        enhance the productivity of land and water resources.

                                                                                                                             99

2.Relevance and priority
   -   The project forms one important component in the Strategic Vision for the NRB. However, "..a shared vision and
       the SDAP i s still being designed..." (Project Brief, p. 25). Projects with a similar orientation have been started:
       NEPAD, ALWMI, LCBC, etc. The GEFproject is timely.
3.Approach
   -    The approachfits with the current drives of regional collaboration and recognition of the need to include NEPAD,
        Millenium Development Goals, etc. in development efforts. The six components are all relevant.
   -    Thefocus on institutional issues is valid.     But the mix of integrated strategies and changes in sectoral policies
        could be elaborated.     The GEF Operational Programme 9 refers to "..integrated land and water management
        strategies that help achieve changes in sectoral policies and activities while promoting sustainable development".
        In the agricultural sector, for instance, it seems relevant to assess the potential of rainwater hawesting (rain-fed
        agriculture is mentioned in TDA, but not RWH).       Similarly, the TDA stresses the low level of water use efficiency
        and high usage of fertilisers and pesticides in irrigation systems. The recommendations refer to education, sensiti-
        sation and investments. In addition, it is relevant to review subsidies, which I suppose are liberal (for some), irri-
        gation technology options and, generally, combinations of technical options and institutional arrangements. Land
        and water tenure is not discussed.
   -    With regard to biodiversity, it is mentioned that problems could be tackled through ".. sustainable and cooperative
        integrated management of the Basin, enhance existing capacity, informed decision making and ensure the public's
        greater involvement in the Basin's decision-making process (Project Brief, p. 4). Measures at basin level are im-
        portant, but prime challenges, and "root causes" lie at another level. As far as Iknow, there are many "pockets" of
        relatively small areas where biodiversity is high, but where species are threatened through poachers, dire poverty,
        etc. Many of the `Lrootcauses" will not be effectively tackled only through a greater involvement in the Basin's de-

    -   cision-making process.
        Urbanization results in environmental stress and pollution.      InAnnex G,the section on urbanization is quite brief.
        Reference i s made to a document from 1975, which deals with erosion. The conclusions and recommendations are
        not very elaborate. Is, for instance, clean production technology a realistic alternative? Treatment plants are impor-

    -   tant, but they are associated with many shortcomings. How is urban and basin management coordinated?
        The division of responsibilities and the difference between execution and implementation of project management
        (Project Brief, 20 ff) are not clear. Will the private sector executing agency continue after the project i s over? I t
        seems as if the Scientific Advisory Committee i s only expected to be involved in "..project implementation and re-
        porting" (Project Brief. #76): i.e. not inproject identification and design.
    -   Are microgrants offered to communities but not to individuals (Project Brief, pp. 5, 16, 17, 19)?This might be an
        appropriate approach in the energy and transportation sectors, but would it work in the agricultural sector? And in
        the industrial sector?
4. Objectives
    -   -The objective is valid, but formulated in general terms (Project Brief, p. 5). The last sentence in # 10indicates that
        national and basin priorities have to be harmonized ". .. These elements are transboundary in nature and clearly
        transcend national capacities and pnorities.."(ibid.).     Have reasonable assurances have been obtained so that na-
        tional and transboundary priorities match?
    -   -The fourth bullet (#35), stresses that ".. national programmes would by their nature not address the Basin's
        transboundary issues.. .    preparation of nine separate national programmes would be costly and expend
        significant resources in coordinating activities".   A Basin project will, however, not be a substitute for national
        programmes.      An important question is rather: which tasks should be taken care of at the regional level and
        what tasks are suitable for national level? In the case of data management, it is proposed that         " ...riparian
        countries collect and process data within their nationaljurisdictions" (p. 15). If possible?the data management
        should be organised at the regional level.
5. Background and justification
    -   The documents give a good picture of the situation and important trends.       Justification for this project is a strong
        need for increased capacity at various levels in the Basin to reverse the trends. So far, capacity at regional level is

    -   .weak. The presentation is clear and valid in these regards.
        Some information i s old, e.g. in the case of urbanisation as noted.     There i s no information about the strength of
        NGO, who they are, their track record, etc. Another missing topic is land and water tenure. It is mentioned that
        growth rate i s now 5%, but there i s no discussion about allocation o f national budgets, how subsidies are decided
        and similar.



                                                                                                                          100

    -   A discussion on how to involve the poor and improve their lot is missing. Community involvement in decision-
        making does not automatically empower the poor. It is rather the vocal and better-off segments who make use of
         such opportunities. Specific actions are required.
6. Government commitment andsustainability
    -    -Collectively, Govemment will contribute with USD 2.14 million to the Incremental Cost budget, mainly in kind.
         World Bank and UNDP contributions in the baseline and GEF Alternative scenarios, are substantially much higher.

    -   Isupposethatalargeproportionofthesehavetoberepaidand,thus,couldbeseenasgovernmentcommitments.
         -The project could play an important role infacilitating sustainability. The intention to strengthen regional collabo-
         ration is very important. Like in all parts of the world, regional collaboration is essential for reduction of tensions,

    -    to foster exchange and it facilitates donor support.
         Risks must be interpreted in relation to political circumstances and how successful the project will be in engaging
         end-users (Project brief, p.18). There are serious political problems in West Africa, but most of them are currently
         outside the Niger basin countries.
7.Activities
    -    -Activities will be organized in relation to the six Project components. Sequence is logical. A few additional ac-
         tivities have been suggested above: testing the potential for Rain Water Harvesting; the potential o f clean produc-
         tion technologies; urban planning in a basin context.
8. Project funding
    -    -The task is huge, but the funding is also substantial. I t may be relevant to discuss if the budget for some activity
         should be increased, possibly at the expense of some other component?
9.Replicability
    -    -At this stage, it is rather this project that might replicate from experiences in other similar projects, e.g. the Nile
         River Basin Initiative and projects in West Africa. Worldwide, there is a growing experience of microgrants. The
         ambition to learn from other projects i s mentioned.
10. Time frame
- In Project Brief, a 3-year Action Plan of the NBA (p.26) is mentioned. In table 2 (Annex A),              it is stated "..full pro-
         gramme implementation during four years".        It i s important to have a timetable, with dates, duration of the various
         activities and when results are expected. A strategy for follow-ups after the project is essential.
11.Global environmental benefits and goals of the GEF
    -    -Yes, the project addresses global environmental benefits but these could be much more clearly described. InTable
         2 (Annex A), the column "Overall Global GEFAlternative Benefits" provides no insightsabout benefits. It is a list
         of activities and mechanisms.
12. Rationale for GEF support:
    -    On all four accounts, the answer is "yes".    Some comments above could be iterated here.
13. Secondary issues to be addressed
    -    Reference to related conventions is implicit rather than explicit. According to TDA ".. the energy situation is char-
         acterised by an abundance of resources". If new dams are given priority in the NRB, the likelihood of damaging
         environmental effects increases. I t is also possible that the microgrants could be used for projects that are not con-
         ducive to environmental objectives. Generally, it is conceivable that choices between poverty reduction and safe-
         guarding the environment could favour the former. It is a tricky issue!
14. Additional comments
    -    It is crucial that the institutional arrangements are designed with due regard to incentives and sanctions for the em-
         ployees. The motivation of project staff to contribute to project performance and their compliance with the idea of
         the project are of significant importance.

                                       RESPONSETO FINALAiSD PRELIMINARY STAP REVIEWS
                            ReversingLand and Water Degradation Trends inthe Niger River Basin

RESPONSETO THEFINAL STAP REVIEWS:

1.    Overall Impression:
      The Team i s pleased with the both of the final, STAP reviews, and that the comments from the preliminary, so-called
      upstream reviews have been satisfactorily addressed in the revised Brief. The Team hopes to further clarify the few
      additional comments from both reviews.
      There has been an attempt to clarify the component activities and institutional arrangements for consistency.        Further
      efforts during the Appraisal phase will finalize both the details of the activities and their detailed efforts, and similarly
      efforts to simplify the institutional arrangements for efficient implementation.
      Appropriate hydrologic and geomorphic terminology and the Basin processes are recognized and have been reflected in
      the final draft.
2.    Relevance.
      Current assessment acknowledged.
3.    Approach
      Acknowledging that the UNDP and World Bank interchange the use of executing and implementation agency relative
      to their institution. Clarification has been made in this terminology and during the Appraisal phase, clarifications will
      be made to all aspects of the institutional arrangements and process.       The institutional structure and responsibilities
      will be further detailed, to streamline for most effective and efficient implementation arrangements, for the regional,
      national and local levels. Though it's not the intention to promote changes in existing legislation, or propose new leg-
      islation, i t i s however envisioned that through both Component 2 and Component 3 policy frameworks could be drafted
      and developed in the future for a more comprehensive basin-wide management policies and legislation. The Global
      Water Partnership could be engaged through project implementation.
   4. Objective.
      -    Review acknowledged.
   5. Background andjustification
      -    Recognizing that this Project's objective will be achieved through strengthened regional, national and local capac-
           ity. It's the intent that through the Component 5 activities (where thirty-eight percent of the GEF funds are tar-
           geted for community-based microgrant supported interventions) hope to improve the livelihood o f the basin com-
           munities, thus making some effort to reduce poverty while promoting sustainable good management practices. The
           Beneficiaries section of the Brief addresses poverty alleviation. Terminology changed to reflect geomorphic proc-
           esses.
   6. Government Commitment and sustainability
      -    For the sake of clarity, to define the true value of the incremental benefit from this Project, the baseline was de-
           fined by a specific parameter to include just those baseline activities, which contribute directly to the Project; this
           would then include the national-level in-kind contribution. Through the SAP and SDAP process. the framework
           for sustainable economic development would provide the mechanism to minimize future risks.
   7. Activities
      -    Comment acknowledged.
   8. Projectfunding
      -    With further definition of the specific project subcomponent/activities, which will be completed during the Ap-
           praisal phase the Project financing and detailed budget, and allocations for each component will be defined.
   9. Replicability
       -   Comment acknowledged, Component 4 activities would provide a forum for the exchange of regional lessons.
   10. Timeframe
       -   It is envisaged that through the SAP and SDAP. which will establish a strategic development framework for the
           Basin, there will be opportunities for continued investments in the Basin.
   11. Global environmental benefits and goals ofthe GEF
       -   Comment acknowledged and the integration of sectoral activities and future policies would develop as part of the
           SAP and SDAP. The incremental cost matrix has been modified to reflect the incremental cost assessment.
   12. Rationale for GEFsupport
       -   Comment acknowledged.
   13. Secondary issuesto be addressed
       -   Comment acknowledged. The document has been developed to explain in greater detail the benefits of the Project
           activities, especially Component 5 activities, to improve rural livelihood.

                                                                                                                    103

    14. Additional Comments.
         -   The Team acknowledges that the responses to the comments from the upstream review were satisfactorily ad-
             dressed.

RESPONSE TO PRELIMINARY UPSTREAMREVIEWS NO 1& No2:
The Project preparation Team i s pleased with the two stage STAP review process and the critique of the Project objective and
design. The two upstream STAP reviews provided a fair critique during Project preparation providing the Team an opportunity
to clarify and detail elements of the project design; while the subsequent STAP review provided a final overview. The Team
appreciates the Reviewers comments and the documents were modified to best address the comments.            The following provides
a summary of Team's effort to respond and modify the Project document:

1.Overall Impression:
         -   The letters of endorsement are in preparation during the upstream review, and will be included in Annex C. The
             project focuses on institutional capacity buildingconfirming that the primary focus of the Project is to strengthen
             institutional capacity, not only to reinforce the NBA but also to strengthen the national and local level decision-
             making capacity.      This strengthened capacity hopes to address concrete efforts in the range of sectors impacting
             the Basin and to inevitably achieve local level sustainable livelihood.
2. Relevance and priority:
         -   The Team concurs the GEF Project is timely and urgent.
3. Approach
         -   In concert with the SDAP, the project focuses on strengthening the regional, national and local capacity; the scru-
             tiny of the array of opportunities is developed during the GEF SAP process. It is envisioned that the Project's out-
             come, the SAP, and subsequent funding to implement the SAP and SDAP will be the mechanism to address the
             primary sector issues to include but not limited to biodiversity, the agricultural sector, or urbanization impacts.
             Options for addressing the range of sectors, land and water tenure agricultural credit and/or cultivation loans, have
             a significant role in resource management and are anticipated to be addressedin the SAP process. Though it i s not
             the intent of the Project, to tackle all the root causes but through the TDA and SAP process identify the priorities
             and the mechanism to better address the root causes and sector issues.
         -   The Team has attempted to clarify the World Bank's and UNDPs "executing arrangements" and implementing ar-
             rangements, and concurs with the Reviewers that the staffing of the PMU will be of the highest caliber, competi-
             tively selected staff to assist in Project implementation.
         -   The Scientific Advisory Committee has a significant role in addition to advising on technical matters during Pro-
             ject implementation and reporting, but also supporting. at the national level project design as it pertains to Compo-
             nent 5, the microgrant supported activities, and all aspect of the further project design and preparation elements

         -   within the context of project implementation.
             Component 5 the microgrant supported Demonstration Program activities and community-based interventions are
             based on the principles of the UNDP Small Grants Programme which has local community based experience to a
             range of applicants, and through the public information and outreach program hopes to target those communities
             and stakeholders within the immediate context of the project design and project objectives. The UNDP-SGP has
             been successful in successfully implementing projects and disbursing funds, which this Project hopes to build-on

         -   and replicate.
             Though the Project activities are, for all practical means, generally implemented at the national level, though some
             regional efforts in strengthening the regional institutional capacity is targeted, so in terms o f project activities and
             disbursementof funds, the intent of the Project is to systematically address the transboundary issues and concems
             in the Basin.
4. Objectives
     -   The concurrent development of the SDAP with the SAP will help identify the linkages with the national and trans-
         boundary priorities, and not at the expense of national programs. but it is important to note national programs would by
         their nature not address the Basin's transboundary issues, and the need for coordinated management of the Basin's land
         and water resources. The intent of the project is to strengthen the subsidiarity of basin management, decentralizing
         from the regional level, and strengthen at the national and local efforts, in data collection, analysis to help contribute to
         the regional decision making process. The Project promotes subsidiarity, informed and strengthened local and national
         capacity is vital to the regional success.
5. Background and Justification
     -   The Project provides an overview, through Component 2. the implementation o f a public participation program as a
         means to engage and involve the local stakeholders and the NGO. Details of the public information, media, and out-


                                                                                                                      104

        reach program will be detailed through the appraisal process. As noted above other sector elements, land and water
         tenure, urbanization, and other sector issues to be addressedin the SAP SDAP process.
6. Government Commitment and Sustainability
    -    Reviewer's comments acknowledged and the language in this section was modified to stress the importance of the gov-
         emment's commitment to sustainability and the political and social risks.      The Brief provides a summary of the Ba-
         sin's commitment to the Project, SAP and SDAP, and letter of endorsement i s further commitment.
7. Activities:
    -    Through the SAP and SDAP process, the Rain Water Harvesting and other specific interventions could be taken into
         consideration.
8.Project Funding:
    -    The Project Brief provides an overview of the Project financing as determined during the preparation process, during
         the Appraisal phase the component activities and project budget will be detailed and adjusted accordingly.
9. Replicability
    -    The Team concurs and the Brief modified to noting the Project would benefit from the lessons-leamed from other re-
         gional initiatives.
10. Time Frame
    -    The Project i s a four-year project.
11.GlobalEnvironmentalBenefitsandgoalsofthe GEF:
    -    The Project benefits are addressedin terms of how they support and achieve the Project objective, though it is the intent
         through the strengthening of regional, national, and local institutional capacity anticipating through Component 2 ac-
         tivities those sectoral policies and activities will promote global environmental benefits.   Annex A, the incremental
         cost matrix was modified to clarify the global benefits, rather than just identifying the mechanisms to achieve the bene-
         fits.
12. Rationale for GEFsupport:
    -    Within the Project Brief, comments acknowledged
13. Secondary issuesto be addressed:
    -    The Team acknowledges the Reviewers comments.
    -    As part of the Component 5 microgrant-supportedinterventions, Activity 5.6 includes the preparation of the Microgrant
         Program Operational Manual, which will include the specifics of the selection criteria and compliance with environ-
         mental and social safeguards. As part of the Project Implementation Plan, the Environmental Management Framework
         will identify the framework for compliance with social and environmental safeguards.
14. Additional Comments:
    -    The Team acknowledges that it is crucial that the institutional arrangements are designed with due regard to incentives and
         sanctions for the employee. Duringthe Appraisal phase details of the institutional arrangements will be detailed to support
         technical integrity and ownership.
