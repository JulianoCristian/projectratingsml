                         This project, which is jointly managed with the UNDP, is progressing satisfactorily. Under the project, a project management team and a national project team in the nine countries of
                         the Niger Bassin are functional. The project has also strengthened the data and knowledge management in the Niger Basin Authority closely with the Niger Basin Authority
                         Observatory. The Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) has been endorsed and the Strategic Action Plan has been endorsed, in November 2010, by the Council of Ministers of
                         the Niger Basin Authority.
                         During the closing mission (December 2010/January 2011), the Bank team discussed with the Niger Basin Authority the results achieved under the project and on this basis
                         confirmed that the project closing date remains February 28, 2011 for the Bank-led components.

                         Components 2, 4, and 5 are led by UNDP. The extension that was granted until February 28, 2011, allowed implementation of the components including the component 5 (pilots on
                         the ground), which was the component that had initially delays in its implementation.
