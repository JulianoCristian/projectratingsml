2.      Overall project implementation is moderately satisfactory and has improved
following the re-prioritization of activities in May 2009. Specifically, the Human
Resource Management Information System, which was facing repeated delays, has been
simplified in size and scope. There were also some savings from a consultancy for
introducing an MTEF. These project funds have been reallocated to support the on-
going fiscal, budget and public investment planning reforms that are a high priority for
Mongolia and a focal area of Bank engagement (e.g. the Bank's Interim Strategy Note
and the DPC series in response to the economic crisis). It is now expected that the
project will fully disburse shortly after the closing date of September 2011 and no further
extensions will be required.


3.     The above reallocations do not change the Project Development Objectives, Key
Performance Indicators, or the key activities of the project.
