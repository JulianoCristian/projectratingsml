                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Major achievements of the Project include: (a) a full rollout of the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) which has greatly enhanced the Treasury's
                         expenditure controls and improved payment processing; (b) the successful passage of the Fiscal Stability Law that should significantly improve fiscal policy by requiring the MTFF
                         and the budget to adhere to fiscal rules that smooth expenditures, control expenditure growth, and put a ceiling on public debt; (c) successful passage of the Integrated Budget Law
                         that strengthens planning and budgeting, increases the comprehensiveness of the budget, and supports fiscal decentralization and participatory budgeting; (d) improved public
                         investment planning through the assistance to the planning agency in developing a medium term strategic plan, and the preparation of project appraisal guidelines. Less than

                         satisfactory progress has been made with respect the second element of the PDO, which is civil service reform and the development of a Human Resource Management Information
                         System (HRMIS). There is currently only one remaining activity in the project, which is the development of a Budget Preparation Information System. It is expected that the system
                         will be operational by December 2012.
