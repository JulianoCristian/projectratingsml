                         Implementation Status Overview
                         To date, the project's major accomplishments are (a) the development of a well functioning Government Financial Management Information System that has significantly improved the
                         Treasury function, in particular payments and cash management and (b) the successful passage of the Fiscal Stability Law that should significantly improve fiscal policy by requiring
                         the MTFF and the budget to adhere to fiscal rules that smooth expenditures, control expenditure growth, and put a ceiling on public debt. Currently there are three major on-going
                         activities under the project: (a) the development of the Budget Preparation Information System (BPIS); (b) the development of a Human Resource and Payroll System (HRMPS); and
                         (c) technical assistance to the NDIC and MoF on improving public investment planning.
