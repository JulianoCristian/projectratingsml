                                                       the client. These activities fit
                                                       within the mandate of the
                                                       components, and were critical in

                                                       objective. New activities, for
                                                       example, included passage of
                                                       the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL)

1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context
Country Background
1.1.1 Mongolia has gone through 20 years of democratic transition and market-based
economic reforms. Since the end of socialist rule in early 1990, the people of Mongolia
have made great strides towards transforming the country into a stable multi-party
democracy in which civil society is playing an increasing role and openly calls for greater
transparency and accountability. The classic range of post-socialism economic reforms
have also been adopted and implemented.

1.1.2 The country has been experiencing a rapid economic transformation generated by
rising mineral prices and new mineral discoveries. The economy was traditionally based
on livestock herding. Over the past decade growth accelerated with the rise in global
commodity prices, and a boom in mining exploration confirmed the existence of large
mineral deposits – notably copper, uranium, oil, coal, iron ore, and gold. Investments are
turning these into world class mineral projects: Oyu Tolgoi (OT), signed in 2009, is likely
to become one of the five largest copper and gold mines in the world; the Tavan Tolgoi
(TT) mine has potential to supply high quality coking coal for more than 100 years.

1.1.3 The recent and rapid growth is accompanied by several challenges as the
economy and national budget become more dependent on volatile and unpredictable
natural resource revenues. There is a risk of Dutch disease and governance problems as
the minerals sector’s dominance increases. Mongolia experienced recessions in the late
1990’s and in 2008-09 when global commodity prices declined substantially.

Sector Background
1.1.4 The World Bank and other international financial institutions in particular the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have
since 1991 contributed funding and technical assistance to implement the country’s
transition and reform program, including the government’s program for public sector
reform. Comprehensive reform, of this nature was deemed critical for improving the
effectiveness of poverty-reducing social programs and productivity-enhancing public
investment.

1.1.5 The thrust of the reforms in the early 2000s were guided by the Public Sector
Financial Management Law (PSMFL), proposed by the government in 1997 and passed
in June 2002, which was the primary public expenditure legislation in the country that
also had a strong performance management dimension. The PSMFL was intended to
underpin the pursuit of government objectives. However, the Government of Mongolia
(GoM) and the World Bank were of the view in 2003 that an implementation plan was




                                            1
missing for closing the gap between current practices and those necessary to support a
more performance-oriented public sector1.

1.1.6 The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) describes the context at appraisal as one
where: “Mongolia must continue to restructure its public finance patterns to protect
aggregate fiscal balances and ensure that deficits are sustainable. Much has been done
in the last two years to achieve this goal but significant gaps remain” (p.7).2 It goes on to
describe such additional weaknesses in the system that included:
 Poor annual budget planning and execution leading to unpredictable budget outcomes
    and arrears.
 Accountability for the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure programs is
    hampered by poor monitoring and information.
 Weak public administration capacity (including fragmentation, duplication and
    overlap of administrative structures and functions), compounded by low civil servant
    salaries and a high wage bill.

1.1.7 Since then a mineral boom (2003-07) and global economic crisis that followed in
2008-09 altered the focus of the government more toward improving natural resource
management and resulted in a new set of public expenditure laws, notably the Fiscal
Stability Law (2010) and the Budget Law (2011).

Rationale for Bank Assistance
1.1.8 The Economic Capacity Building Technical Assistance Credit (ECTAC) project
was designed to finance an integrated package of assistance towards strengthening of
budget planning, execution, reporting and accountability and improving the public
administration. The technical assistance supported institutional reform and policy
development, training and capacity building and a major upgrading of core systems for
PFM. The rationale for the ECTAC was that a focused capacity-building effort was
required over the medium-term to build institutional capacity to implement the
government’s policy and the institutional reforms.

1.1.9 ECTAC operated alongside, and eventually superseded the Fiscal Technical
Assistance (TA) Project (active 1998 to 2005) 3 and was later complemented by
Governance Assistance Project (active from 2007 and expected to be completed in 2013)
and the Multi-Sectoral TA project (active from 2010 and is expected to be completed in
2014). ECTAC also complemented an IMF program following the global economic
crisis and two World Bank Development Policy Operations (DPO) in 2009 and 2010.

  The Fiscal TA project had two components. The first provided the Government Financial Management Information
System (GFMIS), and associated capacity building (90 percent of the funds). The second component focused on
introducing a Value-Added Tax.


                                                       2
1.1.10 In this manner ECTAC forms part of continuous World Bank support on PFM
reform since the late 1990’s. The Fiscal TA project was initially focused on introducing
the Treasury System, which in Mongolia is called the Government Financial
Management Information System (GFMIS). First the GFMIS was intended for the
finance ministry and two pilot ministries/ agencies, but in 2002 the planning was initiated
for government wide deployment4. ECTAC was designed to fund this deployment and
wider implementation of the PSMFL. Later, with the economic crisis of 2008-09, the
PFM work focused on addressing the need to put in place a sound fiscal regime, a
stronger legal framework for budgeting, and strengthened public investment planning and
it was re-structured accordingly.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
1.2.1 The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to assist the GoM to design and
implement a public sector management reform program aimed at improving: (a)
budgetary and public expenditure management systems and processes; and (b) civil
service and public administration performance.

1.2.2 Table 1 shows the key performance indicators (KPI) for the project quoted from
the PAD, May 29, 2003. A full list of the original ‘output indicators’ by component is
provided in Annex 2.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
       Indicators, and reasons/justification
1.3.1 The PDO was not revised. However, in 2009 the performance indicators were
modified; Annex 2 provides the revised results framework (see Table A2). Whilst the
performance indicators were improved substantially this did not occur as part of a formal

restructuring of the project. However, the changes were endorsed by management,
agreed with the client and recorded in subsequent project reporting, including
Implementation Status Reports (ISR). The changes to the indicators were justified by the
need to sharpen the performance monitoring in line with general improvements to project
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) practices adopted since 20035 and in line with other
changes to the project (see Section 1.7).


1.4     Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 ECTAC’s design insists that the “policy and institutional reforms supported by
the proposed project will have a positive impact on the population”6. Four avenues are
articulated in the PAD:
   i. First, enhancing accountability in public financial management is expected to lead
        to a more transparent public decision making process.
  ii. Second, improving governance and expenditure management to focus on
        achieving MDG goals, through an improved focus on the impact of policies on
        narrowing the gender gap and assisting the poor and vulnerable benefit from
        growth.
 iii. Third, improving expenditure controls will have an immediate and beneficial
        impact on overall fiscal balances.
 iv. Fourth, streamlining civil service management and policy will result in improved
        administrative efficiency and coordination.

1.4.2 In terms of implementing agencies the PAD names the Ministry of Finance and
Economy (MoFE) as the responsible agency. Note that the MoFE was later renamed
Ministry of Finance (MoF). After its creation in January 2009, the planning agency, the
National Development and Innovation Committee (NDIC), also became a beneficiary. In
addition, Component Two is focused on civil service reform and the key partner there
was the Government Service Council of Mongolia (GSCM). Other stakeholders/ partners
included Line Ministries involved in the piloting of specific budget related reforms
(examples include the Health and Education ministries).

1.5     Original Components (as approved)
1.5.1 The project had two main technical components: (i) Strengthening Public
Expenditure Management Processes (ii) Modernizing the Public Administration and the
Civil Service. A third component dealt with Implementation Arrangements carried out
by the Project Coordination Unit. The components were as follows:

(i)    Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Processes: to improve budget
preparation, execution and monitoring systems and processes. It would focus on assisting
the government implement a medium-term expenditure framework at the central and
agency level, improve budget execution through the full roll out of the GFMIS system

  For Example the PAD’s outcome/ impact indicators are not all ‘SMART’ (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic
and time-bound).

  See PAD (p.18).


                                                         4
throughout government and assist government in refining the overall legal framework for
procurement. In the area of monitoring and accountability this component will focus on
building capacity of the government to move to unified accounting system and improve
and expand the function of state audit entities. Sub-components:
      Disciplining budget preparation, policy planning and budget formulation
      Enhancing budget and expenditure planning at agency level
      Improving budget execution and accountability systems
      Strengthening procurement at the central and agency levels
      Strengthening budget oversight and monitoring
      Strengthening accounting and internal audit at the center and agency level.

(ii)    Modernizing the Public Administration and the Civil Service: to streamline and
strengthen institutional arrangements and requisite capacity for civil service management,
financing, coordination and accountability. This component would provide consulting
services, training and equipment to support specific reforms which would form part of the
actions to be supported through the PRSCs. Sub-components:
       Strengthening civil service management capacity and professionalism
       Establishing a human resource management information system (HRMIS)
       Rationalizing the civil service wage bill, incentives and employment
       Strengthening accountability for performance

1.6   Revised Components
1.6.1 The 2009 restructuring (see Section 1.7) did not lead to changes to the
components, but support to the newly formed planning agency was added.


1.7    Other significant changes
1.7.1 In light of the long implementation period of the project, changes occurred in the
overall environment: the resource boom from 2003-07 (associated with increased
commodity prices), the global economic crisis 2008-09 (associated with decreased
commodity prices) and the signing of large scale mining projects, including TT and OT
leading to higher levels of resource revenues7 . These events reoriented focus of the
public administration and its reform towards natural resource management. The creation
of the NDIC in 2009 also motivated support to strengthening public investment
management.

1.7.2 At the request of the government the project was extended three times. The PAD
expected the project to be completed in 4.25 years, but when it closed in March 2013 it
had been active for 9.75 years. The following three extensions took place: (i) in April
2007 the project was extended until September 2009; (ii) in September 2009 the project
was extended until September 2011 and (iii) in September 2011 the project was extended



7
  OT only began production in June 2013, but between signing the mining project in 2009 and the end of the ECTAC
project there was a significant boost to the government’s revenues associated with upfront royalties and revenues
related to the $6 billion spent constructing phase one of the OT mine.


                                                         5
until March, 2013. The projects extensions are consistent with the viewpoint held at
approval that “improving overall public sector performance will take over 7-10 years”8.

1.7.3 At the initiative of government the project was formally restructured on April 29,
2009 in response to the global financial crisis and the government’s demand to shift its
focus away from civil service reform to more pressing fiscal issues. The restructuring
entailed the addition of several activities/subprojects to respond to the needs of the client,
and an accompanying reallocation of credit proceeds. These activities fit within the
mandate of the components, and were critical in achieving the development objective.
New activities, for example, included passage of the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) 2010 and
the integrated Budget Law 2011. Accordingly, as part of the restructuring the project also
had a reallocation of funds between categories as detailed in Table 3. The shift of funds
away from component 2 was justified by its slower progress, especially in implementing
the HRMIS. No mid-term review was held because in undertaking the 2009 restructuring
and subsequent extension the project was subject de facto to such a review.

2.          Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 Lessons from other similar World Bank operations were considered during the
design of the project. The PAD asserts that: “lessons were learned from other public
financial management reform projects financed by the World Bank, including those in
Kazakhstan, Ghana, Kosovo, Lithuania and Thailand and incorporated into the project”
(p. 24). The lessons led to some key principles for the design and implementation9:
 Integration of management and institutional reforms with ICT investments.
 Sequencing reforms, with a focus on core systems first.


8
    See PAD (p.1).
9
    See PAD p.24.


                                                               6
    Ensuring government commitment and management support for the overall reform.
    Inter-agency coordination and user involvement in systems design.
    Developing organizational capacity and technical skills.
    Formal project planning and systematic processes for management of change.

2.1.2 In addition, the project builds on lessons from previous public sector reform
projects in Mongolia and particularly the experience from implementing the Fiscal TA
Project. Further lessons were provided from the findings of a 2002 Public Expenditure
and Financial Management Review by the World Bank in collaboration and consultation
with other donors. Other reports from the design period rightly point to the need for long-
term engagement.

2.1.3 Despite the lessons it can be argued that the project’s design was rather ambitious
given the time allocated (originally 4.25 years) and the breadth and sophistication of
reforms being supported. One reason for the project’s ambitious nature is that the
government itself (with advice from development partners) had embarked on a very
ambitious set of reforms guided by the PSMFL 2002. The PSMFL set tough objectives
including: (i) the adoption of output-based budgeting, management and reporting by
ministries/ agencies and (ii) the adoption of accrual budgeting and accounting by
ministries/agencies. Like in many developing countries around the turn of the century,
New Zealand’s world class standards and radical or ‘big bang’ approach of getting there,
had become an attractive guide for reforms10.

2.1.4 Had the reforms been implemented the PSMFL would have propelled Mongolia
towards the top of OECD standards. With hindsight it is much easier to judge, but there
are also grounds to assert that even at the time it was known the reforms were ambitious11.
There are many incentives to announcing ambitious reforms for governments and donor
agencies alike. It is very appealing to signal that the reform process is progressing
quickly and imply the gap with OECD countries is closing. However, this can come at a
cost as there are downsides of ‘leap-frogging’ (Schick, 1998b) and when reforms are
simply ‘signals’ they frequently lead to failure in terms of actual institutional reform
(Andrews, 2013). A key opportunity cost of deepening reforms (increasing their
sophistication) is often consolidating gains and ensuring the ‘basics’ are in place.12

2.1.5 A second potential reason for the project’s ambitious nature was a hiatus in PFM
reform between 1998 and 2002 13 when implementation of the Fiscal TA project was
stalled. Only after five years of deliberation and a change of government was the PSMFL


10
   See Schick (1998a) for a discussion on why most developing countries should not try New Zealand Reforms.
11
   ECTAC’s predecessor, the Fiscal TA project, was also extended on three occasions
12
   Wescott (2008) provides several examples of where complex reforms (including accrual accounting and output-based
budgeting) have been attempted and failed at the expense of consolidating the ‘basics’. Although there is still debate
about what exactly the basics are; see Stevens (2004).
13
   During the period 1997 to 2002 the PAD acknowledges: “no real commitment across the government on the public
sector reform agenda, partly because of frequent personnel turnover in key positions, there were continuous tensions
between achieving short-term fiscal objectives and medium-term structural reforms, and a lack of realism about the
pace and capacity of Mongolia to implement reforms” (p. 1).


                                                          7
passed, leading to renewed PFM reform activity. The incentives at the time were perhaps
focused on maintaining the momentum, to avoid such a hiatus reoccurring. Therefore,
despite the project’s expected 4.25 year lifespan, it’s likely that potential extensions were
factored into the design or at least potential for future projects to continue on from where
ECTAC finishes. The PAD itself recognizes that “a focused capacity-building effort will
be required over the medium-term to build institutional capacity to implement the policy
and the institutional reforms that the Government proposes to undertake” (p.24).

2.2     Implementation
2.2.1 Nine factors influenced the implementation of the project. These are explained in
turn.
2.2.2 Inadequate project preparation. Some of the difficulties that the project
encountered — in implementing medium-term budgeting, supporting civil service reform,
in developing a HRMIS, and in developing a budget information system — could have
been avoided through better project preparation. A more thorough PFM assessment
would have revealed the capacity limitations, and challenges in cooperation between key
agencies, that these ambitious reforms would have come up against. It was also not clear
what problems a comprehensive civil service reform were aiming to address. For
example, the cancellation of the large HRMIS tender followed World Bank analytical
work on Civil Service Reform in 200914 that revealed the institutional fragmentation of
payroll and personnel management that would have made such a system very difficult to
implement. The bid documents and subsequent design documents for both the Budget
Preparation Information System (BPIS) and HRMIS were inadequate and were a major
reason for the significant project delay of the former and the failed bids of the latter as the
vendors did not have a clear understanding of the design of the system. As pointed out in
Section 1.7 and in response to this issue a restructuring of the project led to reallocation
of resources. The remaining resources for the civil service component were used to do
better preparatory work for the HRMIS. Local consultants were hired by both the MoF
and the Civil Service Council, and reported to a steering committee made up of both
agencies and the Ministry of Social Welfare, in an attempt to address the coordination
challenges. The consultants produced a detailed document on business specifications for
the HRMIS, technical design specifications for the system, and demonstration software.
These can provide a more solid basis for a future HRMIS.

2.2.3 Large consultancy contracts were signed to deliver support. Several large firm
consultancy contracts were tendered in support of the GoM, including for ‘Strengthening
Medium- and Short-Term Budget Planning’ and for the ‘Medium-Term Civil Service
Reform Strategy’. Some of the projects achievements relate to the large contracts, but in
general the results were below expectations giving rise to problems that impacted on
implementation. There are grounds to argue that had the delivery of the large contracts
ToRs been better the project would have achieved more. Where results were below
expectations the following issues were commonplace:
 Poor management of contracts.

     World Bank (2009), ‘Mongolia: Towards a High Performing Civil Service’.


                                                          8
 International consultants flying-in and flying-out.
 Production of large reports with little readership from counterparts.
 Delays in the tendering of the large contracts.

2.2.4 Fiduciary issues emerged and resulted in investigation. The World Bank
Group’s Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) had to investigate allegations of fraud and
corruption relating to contractors perceived behavior. One example is the investigation
of a company that supported Medium- and Short-Term Budget Planning that eventually
led to debarment and the contract’s termination. Issues included “misrepresentations
with regard to the staffing of the contract under the Mongolia ECTAC Project resulted in
performance deficiencies and ultimately the contract's termination” 15 . Performance
deficiencies relating to fraudulent behavior undermined the project’s success in
implementation.

2.2.5 Inter-linkages in PFM reforms. PFM reforms are inter-linked and changes to one
area create issues in another. A good example of this is maintaining a functional and
unified Chart of Accounts (COA). Changes to the GFMIS or the integration of program
budgeting results required changes to the COA, a burden that was not realized until
during the reform, leading to resistance from stakeholders (and in this case Treasury
Department staff ).

2.2.6 Ambitious nature of the reforms. Notwithstanding the other issues, the ambitious
nature of the reform agenda led to difficulties in implementation. The question remains
whether effective implementation of the more sophisticated reforms (MTEF, program-
budgeting and accrual accounting) could have yielded the expected results even with
perfect implementation. Southern Cross Advisors (2009) independent review of the
medium-term budgeting work — initiated by the WB in the context of the above-
mentioned INT investigation — suggested that it was frequently over-complicated
creating the need for automation as a means to cope. If budgeting was not made too
complex ahead of time then the reforms could have been sequenced better and efforts
consolidated before the next step was taken16.

2.2.7 Limited IT project management capacity. Large IT systems projects are complex
institutional reforms that require significant project management capacity in the
implementing agency and the vendor, a point that is emphasized in the Bank’s recent
assessment of Financial Management Information System (FMIS) projects17. Success is
contingent on close coordination between the client and the vendor so that functional
requirements are clearly understood and problems mutually resolved; which can only be
achieved through a dedicated project team on site with full-time project managers from
both the client and the vendor. These key ingredients were lacking in the BPIS
implementation and were a major reason for the unsatisfactory performance of this

activity. Specialized IT implementation support was brought in to the World Bank
supervision team, but could have been more effective if it had been brought in at an
earlier stage.

2.2.8 Lack of Political Support for Comprehensive Civil Service Reform. Relative to
the PFM reforms there was less drive when it came to the project’s second component
and slower progress led to the reallocation of funds from the component in 2009. There
were delays in making amendments to the Civil Service Law (made in 2008) and little
progress in implementing the 2007 ‘Medium-Term Civil Service Reform Strategy and
Implementation Action Plan’, or the amended Law, or realizing the HRMIS in the
project’s 9.75 year duration. As mentioned above, the task team undertook some
analytical work in 2009 to help “energize” this project work and guide government in this
area. 18 However, the release of the piece coincided with the economic crisis which
detracted the government’s attention.

2.2.9 Flexibility and Adaptation. This contributed to the few successes of the project,
because the project could during implementation adapt to: the speed of the reform
process; client demands; the trajectory of capacity improvements; and the changing
country context. The extensions, restructuring and reallocation of funding led to some
key project achievements. One significant contextual change was the growth of the
natural resource sector and the need to tailor financial management and fiscal policy
accordingly.

2.2.10 Continuity of World Bank Engagement: the ECTAC project is part of a series of
projects (see noted in Section 1.1). This enabled there to be consistent support for public
administration reforms from 2002 to the present day. This continual engagement
contributed positively to implementation, especially during the global economic crisis
when ECTAC provided a vehicle for coordination with the IMF program (resulting in the
passing of the FSL and IBL).

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 The M&E plan was based on performance indicators linked to the achievement of
the various project outputs. However, it was felt during implementation that the original
results framework (see Table 1) did not reflect the ongoing activities of the project and
there was also a needed to sharpen the M&E in line with general improvements to World
Bank project M&E practices (for example earlier ISRs did not track performance
indicators). As mentioned in Section 1.7 the results framework was enhanced in 2009 to
sharpen performance monitoring and reflect the changing context in which the project
was implemented.


2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Safeguards were not triggered for this project although a thorough risk assessment
and monitoring took place and during project implementation no issues were reported

18
     World Bank, 2009: “Mongolia: Toward to a High Performing Civil Service”.

regarding compliance with World Bank safeguard policy and related procedural
requirements.

2.4.2 The main issues of fiduciary compliance relate to two INT investigation (one
completed and one ongoing) cases which are mentioned in Section 2.2.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1 The ECTAC project was followed by the Governance Assistance Project (GAP,
active 2007 to 2103), the Multi-Sectoral Technical Assistance Project (MSTAP, active
2010 to 2014), further World Bank support from the Country Office team and
engagement from other development partners including the IMF, ADB, Swiss
Development Corporation, AusAid, GPF, among others. These projects are vehicles for
continuing the Bank’s engagement on improving public sector governance around the
mining value chain. The Mongolian government has also expressed its intention to
further fund and develop the public administration reform agenda.           Performance
indicators as part of the MSTAP and ‘Mongolia Country Partnership Strategy 2013-17’
will also help monitor the future progress of public administration reforms supported by
ECTAC.

2.5.2 Lessons learnt from the project have already been used in the design of the
MSTAP which avoids the use of large consultancy assignments and relies largely on
individual consultants, often local consultants embedded in the implementing agencies
and guided by international consultants. They have also been applied in other TA projects
in Mongolia which have been re-structured earlier in the process. Lessons learnt from the
project (see Section 6) are also reflected in a global study of financial management
systems (Dener, Watkins, and Dorotinsky; 2011), in regional south-south exchange (for
example Mongolia’s participation in PEMNA19) and in supporting the government design
future reform (including recently when designing a Sovereign Wealth Fund).

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
3.1.1 The project has a high relevance of objectives in line with the previous Country
Assistance Strategies (CAS) and ‘Mongolia Country Partnership Strategy 2013-17’. The
relevancy reflects that the project design boasted a proper diagnosis of development
priority that has remained relevant over the past nine years. The PDOs were fully aligned
to the government’s public sector strategy and legislation; including the PSMFL, the
Fiscal Stability Law (FSL), and integrated Budget Law (IBL).

3.1.2 The design remained mostly relevant, but given the length of the project (via its
three extensions) there have been changes within the project components to adapt to

changing circumstances. This flexibility to adapt and revise has been a key strength,
especially given the project’s duration.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1 The PDO was to assist Mongolia to design and implement a public sector
management reform program aimed at improving: (a) budgetary and public expenditure
management systems and processes; and (b) civil service and public administration
performance.

3.2.2 In pursuit of the PDO the project has achieved the following key outputs and
results:

 Full rollout of the GFMIS and establishment of a functional Treasury Single
  Account framework. This has greatly enhanced the Treasury's expenditure controls
  and improved payment processing. GFMIS went live on January 3, 2005 and there
  was support on hand to keep it running and ensure its expected benefits were realized.
  GFMIS has been deployed across the country and is connected to a payment
  settlement system at the Bank of Mongolia. Specifically, vendor payments are now
  made reliably and promptly and the stock of arrears is also minimal (less than 1
  percent of total expenditures). There has been no subsequent proliferation of bank
  accounts, and aggregate cash balances and flows are more accurately reported and
  controlled. Whilst the full potential of the GFMIS has not been realized (for example
  financial reporting needs improvement20) it is frequently described as the backbone
  for the PFM system. Both ECTAC and the Fiscal TA project are responsible for
  supporting government with this achievement. The GAP project also supported the
  rollout of the GFMIS to the sub-national governments.
 Successful passage of the Fiscal Stability Law: that could significantly improve
  fiscal policy by requiring the fiscal framework and the budget to adhere to fiscal rules
  that smooth expenditures, control expenditure growth, and put a ceiling on public
  debt.21
 Successful passage of the Budget Law: that strengthens planning and budgeting,
  increases the comprehensiveness of the budget, and supports fiscal decentralization
  and participatory budgeting.
 Multi-Year Budgeting: Steps made towards an MTEF with a medium-term fiscal
  framework prepared and submitted to parliament each year from 2008.
 Consolidating previous reforms: Success recognized in 2005 when the Fiscal TA
  project closed was maintained by ECTAC by supporting the consolidation of reform
  and providing support of request when issues emerged (especially relating to the
  GFMIS.


20
   Financial reporting needs further attention as currently only the payments module of the system is being used. The
main reason for this limited functionality is that the GFMIS chart of accounts is not consistent with the budget
classifications.
21
   It should be noted that analysis of the 2013 national budget suggests that the FSL fiscal conditions will not be met in
its first year (it binds from January 2013). This is because of large off-budget public expenditure in breach of legislated
deficit limits.


                                                           12
3.2.3 These achievements are especially important given the difficulties in achieving
successful reform of the public sector. The World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group
(World Bank, 2009) find that about two-thirds of all countries that borrowed from the
World Bank (between 1999-2006) for PFM showed improvement in this area, and under
half showed improvement for civil service and administrative reform.

3.2.4 To add to these achievements it should be noted that Mongolia in 2005 was
described in the Fiscal TA ICR as ahead of other countries in the East Asia in terms of
PFM reforms22.

3.2.5 However, these successes are counterbalanced by significant shortcomings.
Despite the long duration of the project:
 It failed to achieve any of its component two objectives on civil service reform.
 There were considerable delays to the operational acceptance of the BPIS (the
    contract was signed in January 2009 with an original completion date of December
    2009, but it has yet to be completed).
 There was limited progress in implementing a full MTEF and program budgeting.
 There were associated fiduciary issues including INT investigations.

3.2.6 To formally measure the success in achieving the PDO this ICR is required to
reflect the official indicators (i.e. the PAD or subsequently formally amended indicators),
and the project achievements against those indicators. Given there was not a formal
restructuring of the performance indicators the original ones should be assessed.
However, this is not simple as many of the original PDO indicators were not tracked
during implementation on account of them ‘not being linked to project activities’ or ‘not
particularly meaningful’23. The final ISR provides an overview of the results achieved by
the project (summarized in Table 4). Of the monitored indicators, introduced in 2009,
only one from four ‘project development objective indicators’ was deemed to be achieved.
Of the monitored ‘immediate results indicators’ two were deemed to have been ‘partially
achieved’ and six ‘not achieved’.

3.2.7 Earlier ratings of the project’s progress towards achieving the PDOs provided by
the ISRs had been more positive (i.e. the project was deemed ‘satisfactory’ until October
2008). However, over time it became clear that some results were lagging and the project
ISR’s rated it ‘moderately satisfactory’ from March 2009 to August 2012 and
‘moderately unsatisfactory’ from January 2013 to the close, despite intensified
supervision.


3.3     Efficiency
3.3.1 Despite the challenges listed above and failure to meet all the outputs, the
project’s achievements are important and have the potential to create economic benefits
that far exceed the costs of the project. Such benefits can be construed via improved
efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure (for example less wastage and
improved targeting stemming from the PFM reforms). There are also grounds to argue
that in many areas the project did achieve norms of ‘value for money’, although as
described above, this view is clouded by the fiduciary shortcomings relating to two of the
larger contracts from the project.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory
3.4.1 As explained above there were significant shortcomings in the achievement of the
project’s main objectives despite successes and satisfactory levels of efficiency and
relevance. This rating concurs with the final ISR that rated ‘progress towards
achievement of development objectives as unsatisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
3.5.1 Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. No negative effects
on the population (or sub-group of) and expected beneficiaries (see Section 1.4) can be
suggested from the project’s implementation. Likely however are advantages relating to
the project’s achievements (see Section 3.2) that extend to Mongolian Citizens. During
the project’s lifespan Mongolia has experienced enhanced social development, including
a reduction in poverty 24 . Whilst no causality can be demonstrated or proved there is
ground to at the very least assert that more effective institutions via public administration
reforms played some part.




24
  For example the proportion of Mongolians living in poverty, measured by the National statistics Office, fell from
39.2 percent in 2010 29.8 percent in 2012. See: http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/04/17/poverty-
level-estimated-at-nearly-30-percent-in-mongolia; accessed August 27 2013.




                                                             14
3.5.2 Institutional Change/ Strengthening. The ECTAC project fits into a suite of
projects supporting long-term institutional public administration since the early 1990’s.
This is a constructive approach as public administration reform is now known to take
decades and the timing (or pace) of reform actions is seen as critical to successful reform
(Diamond, 2013). The timing depends on the country context and establishing basics
cannot be rushed in favor of more advanced reforms (Schick 1998a, 1998b).


3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1 Optional surveys and stakeholder workshops were not conducted as a complement
to the ICR mission.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate.
4.1.1 At the time of evaluation there is an expectation that the gains achieved to date
are likely sustainable and will be maintained. The likelihood of changes detrimental to
the ultimate achievement of the PDO is deemed significant. Rationale is given in Table 5
where potential threats to the sustainability of the reforms and achievements are set out in.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.1 Quality at entry is deemed to have had significant shortcomings. The World Bank
team worked closely with the government of Mongolia and stakeholders to design a
project that supported public sector reforms. The components were designed based on
previous projects in Mongolia and World Bank led projects in other countries. However,
as set out in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 there are issues of over-ambition in the legislation
passed by government and hence in the design and implementation of the project (for
example the PDO was designed to be achieved in 4.25 years, but many of the reforms


                                                         15
were not complete after 9.75 years). Trying to leap-frog to OECD level reforms has
often been attempted in developing country settings, but is seldom achieved (Schick,
1998b). Hindsight suggests more might have been done to introduce greater realism into
the reform agenda by conducting a more detailed review of the Mongolian context and
capacity to inform the project’s design. For the specific activities, much of the necessary
up-front preparation work was differed to project implementation, particularly on the
large IT contracts, that were a major factor in the delays.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.2 The Bank has supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision
(including adequate transition arrangements and activities after the closure of the project).
However, there were significant shortcomings resulting in project’s failure to achieve
many of its expected outputs (see Section 3.2 and Table 4) suggesting a rating of
moderately unsatisfactory for World Bank supervision 25 . The main shortcomings
included weak M&E (changes to the performance indicators were not part of formal
restructuring and many indicators were not tracked sufficiently). Second, poor results
from large and expensive tenders; including fiduciary issues (although once aware of
issue the team moved quickly and effectively) and poor design work (for example prior to
the HRMIS and BPIS tenders). Third, in implementation the Bank was slow to identify
threats to achieving the PDOs, especially in component two. Fourth, insufficient
resources were provided for project management of the ICT components. There were no
issues relating to disbursement given the project was extended on three occasions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.3 The Bank’s performance was rated moderately unsatisfactory on both dimensions
above hence the overall rating of World Bank performance as per the ICR guidelines.

5.2     Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.2.1 The implementing agencies were committed to the public sector management
reform program. However, there were significant shortcomings resulting in project’s
failure to achieve several of its expected outputs (see Section 3.2). The main
shortcomings included a lack of coordination between implementing agencies (i.e.
between MoF and the Government Service Council; and between the Budget and
Treasury departments in MoF). Second, poor project management relating to the ICT
activities and large tenders (resulting in fiduciary issues; see Section 2.2.). Third and
finally, poor supervision of consultants and weak M&E. There were no issues relating to


25
  It should be noted that the final ISR rated Project Management ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’, Financial Management
‘Satisfactory’ and Monitoring and Evaluation ‘Satisfactory’.

disbursement given the project was extended on three occasions. That withstanding the
GoMs flexibility and willingness to adapt to changes during implementation helped
ensure some of the project’s outputs were achieved.

 (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.2.2 The main implementing agencies are reflected in the same way as the government
as a whole and performance is also deemed moderately unsatisfactory.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.2.3 Given both of the ratings above are moderately unsatisfactory the overall rating
remains consistent.

6.     Lessons Learned
6.1.1 The Mongolia case has shown that public sector reforms are achievable (for
example the passage of key legislation and in implementing the GFMIS) and gains do
transfer to beneficiaries. However, it is clear that expectations must be adapted to
appropriate pace, sequencing and sophistication of the reforms. To guide similar projects
in future the following lessons are suggested:

 Reforms cannot exceed the pace of capacity improvements. A suitable and
  country-specific time frame needs to be factored in the preparation for and the
  implementation of institutional-building activities and technical assistance
  components. Fundamental changes frequently take longer than expected and time
  must be allowed so that reforms can progress in line with necessary behavioral
  changes and capacity improvements.
 Realism in design is required. Basics should be considered a priority before more
  sophisticated reforms are attempted. If basic take longer than envisaged then the
  introduction of the sophisticated reforms should be delayed.
 Issue large tenders for technical assistance with caution. Large procurement
  packages are no substitute for adequate staffing of key government institutions to
  undertake large-scale reforms. Large-scale contracts for consultancy services are
  difficult to manage and require more absorptive capacity from the client agencies. If
  they are to be issued then the appropriate amount of supervision and monitoring from
  the World Bank must be made available. Issuing many smaller ToR may seem like
  more work in the short-term but may also lead to less issues in implementation and
  improved results.
 Continuous and long-term support is needed for institutional change. Continual
  efforts are needed to consolidate gains, to advance reforms and ensure that the
  benefits from the reforms are released.
 Flexibility in design and adaption during implementation are crucial. So that
  support can be client and problem driven project teams must be in a position to adapt
  during implementation and respond to changing context.

       Agencies/Partners
7.1.1 The borrower in their comments on the draft ICR (presented in Annex 4) made
the point that the economic crisis of 2008/09 necessitated a restructuring of the project,
which has already been reflected in the ICR. The borrower also proposed slight changes
to the results framework. However, given the guidelines that the ICR must follow and
the information provided in the ISR reports the requested changes cannot be made.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's Comments on Draft ICR

1.      The facts of the historical evidences described in this report are comprehensive
however, results indicators that used to evaluate outcome of the project have some
deviations from actual evidences and circumstances agreed with the Bank. We wish you
to consider our comments and make appropriate adjustments in the project evaluation.
Details are presented below.

2.      There are 11 outcome indicators and 26 output indicators have been identified and
reflected in the PAD of the ECTAC in 2003. However, these indicators are not used for
assessing the results because of the following two reasons. First, these were inapplicable
for measuring the progress and results of the project because of the lack of identified
“baseline value” and “target value” as well as “risk mitigation measures”. Second, needs
and requirements of the Government of Mongolia have been changed from time to time
due to election results. In last ten years peoples of Mongolia has passed three Parliament
elections in 2004, 2008, and 2012 respectively. After each election, a structure of the
Government has been changed substantially as well as its policies and priorities.

3.      In order to correct the first inadequacy, the TTL of the Bank together with
respective component leaders of the ECTAC has developed a “Results monitoring
framework of the ECTAC” in May 2009. This new framework contains 6 outcome
indicators and 3 output indicators. Within these only two outcome indicators related to
“budget preparation process” and “sector MTEF” are derived from the original indicators
but others are determined newly. As far as this monitoring framework clearly determined
the indicators with “baseline value” and “target values” which enable the evaluators and
supervisors to measure the project outcomes and outputs effectively.

4.      As the end of 2008 Government of Mongolia has committed almost 80 per cent of
the allocated fund from IDA under the ECTAC. Newly established Government has
ratified its four years Government Action Plan and identified its priority. In order to
ensure the efficiency of the project implementation the Government decided to spend the
remaining amount for funding of the BPIS and HRMIS projects and to strengthening of
the capacity of newly established National Development and Innovation Committee
(NDIC). According to NDIC’s mandate the MOF transformed its responsibility relating
to public investment planning to the NDIC. In this regard, all activities planned to
implement under GAP with relation to PIP are closed and transformed to ECTAC project.

5.      A part this sub-components of the ECTAC is changed substantially in FY2004
and some small changes made in FY2005, FY2006, FY2008, FY2009 and FY2010
respectively to meet the emergency of the Government. Whether the Governments
expectation was ambitious or not it would be rational if the progress of the project
(effectiveness and efficiency of the project implementation) measured by the outputs
achieved against the inputs contributed. Therefore we would like to propose the
following results framework for the ECTAC.
