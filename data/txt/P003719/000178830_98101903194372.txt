FOURTH AGBICULIJRAI ESTATES PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I1.       This report appraises a fourth project for the rehabilitation and
expansion of PNP X 1/ a group of Government-owned estates in Indonesia. The
estate industry as a whole, producir.g a wide range of crops, is one of
Indonesia's largest earners of foreign exchange accounting for 15-20% of all
export earnings in recent years. Prior to World War II, the estate industry
accounted for 60% of Indonesia's total export earnings and the decline since
that time reflects the difficulties wqhich have faced the industry. War time
occupation, followed by a war for independence, internal conflicts, shortages
of funds for replanting and rehabilitation, inflation and mismanagement, have
all contributed to the decline. Since 1968 Government has taken positive
steps to modernize the estate industry by introducing replanting programs and
other rehabilitation in its own estates, by returning some estates to their
previous owners, and by encouraging participation in the rehabilitation
program by the private sector through joint ventures.
ii.       PNP X is situated in South Sumatra and the project consists of
planting or replanting of 7,400 ha of oil palms and 4,000 ha of rubber;
rehabilitating 2,000 ha of oil palms and 9,700 ha of rubber; constructing an
oil mill and two block rubber factories; and rehabilitating and replacing
existing processing facilities, estate transportation and buildings. On
the basis of experience gained with the earlier projects, management would
be reorganized and strengthened by the appointment of Executive Assistants to
the President Director, and by the employment of Inspectors. Technical
assistance would also be provided for engineering services, foliar analysis,
marketing, plant breeding, and further diversification into tea, cloves,
cinnamon, cocoa and coconuts.
iii.      The project costs are estimated at US$21.9 M with a foreign
exchange component of US$11 M. It is proposed that the proceeds of an IDA
Credit of US$11 M and the direct Government contribution of US$10.9 M should
be provided as loans at 12% per annum, the current lending rate to public
sector enterprises, with an interest-free grace period of 18 years. PNP X
would be unable to meet debt service unless an interest-free grace period is
granted. During these 18 years PNP X would, however, be required to pay to
the Government the 3/4% per annum service charge on the IDA Credit.
iv.       International competitive bidding would be used for fertilizers
(US$1.05 M), processing plant and machinery (US$6.6 M) and agricultural
machinery and vehicles (US$0.73 N): technical advisory services of US$1.9 M
would be obtained from suitably qualified organizations. Housing construction
(US$1.4 M) and chemicals (US$0.6 M) would be procured in small lots by
competitive bidding but without international advertising. The remainder
(US$3.9 M) is for planting, upkeep of immature areas and special rehabilitation
consisting principally of wages.

- ii -
v.        Present project production of palm oil is 1,700 tons, palm
kernels 400 tons and rubber 4,500 tons. At full development in 1985-1990
this is estimated to increase to 39,500 tons of palm oil, 7,500 tons of
kernels and 14,800 tons of rubber. During this period annual foreign
exchange earnings from all crops would increase from US$2 M to some US$10 M.
The estimated rate of return to the economy from the project is 18.5%.
vi.       The project development proposals are similar in many respects to
the 2 North Sumatra Estates Projects (Credits 155-IND for US$16 M and 194-IND
for US$17 M) which included rubber and oil palm, and the Tea Project (Credit
259-IND for US$15 M) in West Java. All 3 projects experienced long delays
in becoming effective and in appointing Management Advisors and visiting
Inspectors, but IDA financed activities such as planting crops and implement-
ing fertilizer programs are now progressing satisfactorily. More serious
has been the poor overall PNP management where there has been little
progress, particularly in the North Sumatra projects, in raising standards
of budgetary and financial control, improving productivity or reducing
production costs. In late 1971, the Government took steps to implement a
timetable, which was agreed with IDA, to eliminate management deficiencies.
Although some changes in management performance have occurred, further
substantial improvement is required before normally accepted standards
of estate management can be achieved. The Tea Project, while still at an
early stage, has started well.
vii.      The project would be suitable for an IDA Credit of US$11 M to
the Government of Indonesia.



INDONESIA
FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested IDA assistance to finance
the rehabilitation of Perusahan Negara Perkebunan (PNP) X, a Government-
owned estate group in the Lampung region of South Sumatra. Three IDA Credits
for the rehabilitation and development of the Government-owned estate sector
have been approved to date and the proposed project would be the fourth
agricultural estates credit.
1.02      The first agricultural estates credit in 1969 was for US$16.0 M
to assist two estate enterprises (PNP V and PNP VII) in North Sumatra
(Credit 155-IND). In 1970 the second IDA credit (194-IND) for US$17.0 M
was approved for PNP IV and PNP VI, also in North Sumatra. And in 1971, the
third IDA credit (259-IND) was made for US$15.0 M for PNP XII and PNP XIII
in West Java. The first and second estates projects involve rubber and oil
palm and the third one is for tea rehabilitation and development. The
proposed project includes both rubber and oil palm. Further details of the
first three estates projects are given in paragraphs 2.05 and 2.06 and
Annex 1.
1.03      The first estates project provided for a survey by consultants of
other Government-owned estates in Indonesia. In 1971, Kumpulan Guthrie
Sendiran Berhad, a well-known plantation company based in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, conducted a survey of PNP X which was the basis for appraising the
proposed project.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission
comprising Messrs. Gold, Thillairajah, Lens (FAO) and Cooper (Consultant)
which visited Indonesia in November/December 1971. The mission was assisted
by Messrs. Creyke and Gray of the Bank's resident staff in Indonesia.
1.05      The association has made 21 credits to Indonesia totalling
US$273.4 M of which ten totalling US$139.5 M have been for the agricultural
sector. These credits, further details of which are given in Annex 1, com-
prise three for rehabilitating Government-owned estates, one for the
multiplication of high yielding rice seed, four for the rehabilitation of
irrigation systems, one for fertilizer production, and one for fisheries
development. Generally the projects are proceeding satisfactorily, although
the first and second estates projects and fisheries project have experienced
serious management problems.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The 3,000 islands which make up the Indonesian Archipelago total
some 1.9 M km2, the largest archipelago in the world. Its population of



- 2-
124.2 H, growing at about 2.6% per year, makes Indonesia the fifth most
populous country in the world. The most heavily populated islands, and
the most inPortant economically, are Java (population 80.2 M), and Sumatra
(population 20.4 MH; next are Sulawesi (population 9.2 M) and Kalimantan
(population 5.3 M). Indonesia's per capita GDP is about US$80. Agriculture
accounts for more than half of the GDP, employing 75% of the work force and
providing some 70% of export earnings.   Major export crops in 1970/71 were
rubber (40%), timber (20%) and coffee (10%); vegetable oil products total
about 14% of agricultural exports, divided almost equally between oil palm
and coconut.
B. The Estate Industry
2.02      Estate production from both Government-owned estates and the private
sector has contributed 15-20% of export earnings in recent years compared
with about 60% before World War II. The decline reflects the difficulties
which have faced the estate sector during that time. War time occupation,
followed by a war for independence, internal conflictL, nationalization -
either temporary or permanent - of all foreign-owned enterprises, shortage of
funds for replanting programs, processing facilities, and agricultural
machinery, and mismanagement; all contributed to the decline.  Since 1968
Government has taken positive steps towards stabilizing ownership, and
improving organization and management in the estate industry. The nationalizeA
previously Dutch-owned, estates are to remain under Go-7ernment ownership an-
management. Some 90,000 ha of estates have been retur,ied to their foreign
owners - Goodyear, Uni-Royal (American) and Harrisons and Crosfield (British)
are some of the larger compan±es involved - and management by them is ex-
pected to continue. One estate company, SCCFIN (Belgian), has entered into
a joint ownership and management venture with Government for the 31,000 ha
of rubber and oil palm which it previously owned outright.
C. The Government Estate Sector
2.03      In 1971, Government-owned estates comprised a planted area of some
609,000 ha of which the two largest were about 225,000 ha of rubber and
90,000 ha of oil palm (see Annex 2). The estates were previously organized
in five major crop groups each centrally managed from Djakarta. In 1968 they
were reorganized into 28 estate groups based on geographical location, crop
and size. The estate groups are known as PNP. Each PNP has an Executive
Board of Directors, sometimes located on one of the estates but sometimes at
a regional center such as Medan in North Sumatra or Bandung in West Java.
Many important powers are reserved to the Minister of Agriculture, including
senior staff appointments, approval of budgets and financial statements, and
determination of major policy matters. The Minister exercises these powers
through the Directorate General of Estates within the Ministry (see para
5.01). Much of the improvement that has occurred since the reorganization
in 1968 has resulted from the easing of financial restraints previously
imposed by heavy taxation and galloping inflation. However, little has been
done to reduce costs and increase productivity, so that the viability of
the PNP depends largely on the level of commodity prices. This has been



-3-
clearly demonstrated in both the First and Second Agricultural Estates
projects where PNP VI and VII are in a comfortable financial position due
to high palm oil prices, while PNP IV and V are having difficulties because
current rubber prices are low.
2.04      Modifications were made to the existing management arrangements
for the three IDA-financed estates projects so that they could serve as a
model for the rest of the Government-owned estate sector (see para 5.01).
In accordance with Government's long-term plans the third Credit (259-IND)
included conversion of the PNP to Peseroan Terbatas (PT or State-owned
corporate bodies operating independently under the commercial code). Con-
version of other PNP to PT has been halted pending the results of a manage-
ment survey recently instituted by Government and because there is currently
a shortage of qualified management personnel for such commercial units. In
addition, a survey of overall PNP management requirements is being made by
consultants with funds provided under Technical Assistance Credit (216-117D)
and will include recommendations for setting up a suitable organization for
Government to monitor and control PNP and PT activities. The proposed
project includes further strengthening of management by providing inter-
nationally recruited executive assistants for key posts (see para 5.04).
D. Existing Credits to the Estate Industry
2.05      The three IDA Credits 1/ to the Government-owned estate industry
mentioned in paragraph 1.02 experienced delays in becoming effective, and in
appointing Management Advisors and Inspectors.  Development programs are being
satisfactorily executed although the first two projects are twelve months
behind schedule because of initial delays.
2.06      The principal problem is weak management and despite the provision
of expatriate advisors the levels of costs and productivity envisaged at
appraisal have not been achieved. The Government is currently implementing
PNP management requirements agreed with IDA in late 1971 and performance is
slowly improving. Management consultants have also been appointed by Govern-
ment to review Government supervision and control requirements for the PNP
(see para 2.04). Further details are given in Annex 1.
1/   Credit 155-IND for US$16 million, June 20, 1969 for PNP V and VII,
effective December 10, 1969.
Credit 194-IND for US$17 million, June 15, 1970 for PNP IV and VI,
effective February 9, 1971.
Credit 259-IND for US$15 million, June 24, 1971 for PNP XII and XIII,
effective September 17, 1971.

III. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. General
3.01      PUP X consists of a scattered group of 14 estates situated in the                -
Lampung and South Sumatra provinces of Sumatra (see map). Available land
at the end of 1972 will total 36,000 ha of which 9,700 ha consists of rubber,
2,000 ha oil palms, 740 ha tea and one new estate on which 100 ha of cloves
is being planted in 1971/1972 (See Annex 3). 7,700 ha of land originally
planted with rubber were abandoned prior to 1972, and during 1972 a further
4,400 ha will be abandoned as they reach the end of their economic life.
Government has agreed that the tea estate should not be an integral part of
the project since it is 850 km from the main group of estates, which makes
effective management extremely difficult. The Government has also agreed
to exclude the new clove estate; it is a pilot project and the economic
viability of growing cloves under PNP conditions has yet to be proved (see
para 4.17). There are no other Government-owned estates in South Sumatra.
3.02      PNP X has title to concessions issued by Government since the
estates were taken over from the Dutch some 15 years ago. These titles are
renewable after 25 years and titles to all PNP-X concessions will become
renewable between 1980 and 2001. Included in the concessions is some 16,000
ha of land occupied by squatters. PNP X does not intend to reclaim these
occupied areas and assurances were obtained from Government during negotia-
tions that PNP X should be relieved of all taxes and other liabilities on
them.
3.03      PNP X has recently acquired some 2,500 ha of squatter land on which
the new clove estate is being developed. Compensation to squatters will be
payable at standard Government rates. PNP X is also negotiating for 4,500 ha
of additional land in the Bekri area for further oil palm development; this
would also involve compensation payments to squatters. Since PNP X will not
have the financial resources to develop these areas during the foreseeable
future, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the planting programs
included in the project would not be exceeded.
B. Climate and Soils
3.04      Average annual rainfall is about 2,000 mm, with a fairly severe dry
season between June and September. Average daily hours of sunlight are good
and days with no sunlight are rare even during the wet season. Soil is gener-
ally fertile, mainly volcanic origin, and well-suited to the cultivation of
rubber and oil palms, although there are limited areas of poorer soils.
Temperatures are typical of the wet tropics with an average of about 320 C
in daylight hours and falling generally by less than 10' C at night. Except
for the tea estate PNP X estates are at altitudes from 60 m to 350 m above
sea level. Terrain is mainly gently undulating with a few steep areas on Way
Berulu and Way Lima estates.



5
C. Communications
3.05      PNP X headquarters are at Kedaton, about 5 km from the provincial
capital of Teluk Betung and 20 km from the port of Pandjang (See map). Of
the 14 estates, 8 are within 50 km of headquarters, and the remainder range
from 70 km to 850 km from headquarters. Senior management normally visits
the 2 rubber estates near Palembang and the tea estate by flying first to
Djakarta, and following an overnight stop, by air to Palembang. Alternative
road or rail communication with these estates takes from 10 to 24 hours
continuous travel. The southern estates, in the Teluk Betung area, are served
by a main network of metalled roads in fairly good condition but about 50 km
of gravel roads connecting the estates to the metalled roads are in a poor
state and urgently need surfacing with gravel or laterite. Transportation
of crops and headquarters supervision are adversely affected by the poor
gravel roads and assurances were obtained from Government that these roads
would be upgraded before the end of 1973. Internal earth roads on the estates
are also in poor condition but could be readily improved with suitable
grading machinery to be financed under the Credit.
3.06      Latex is transported to small Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) 1/ factories
on each estate by truck, and lower grade rubbers from the southern estates
are processed at a central block rubber factory at Natar. The northern
estates have facilities for processing lower grade rubbers into crepes. Oil
palm fresh fruit bunches (ffb) from Bekri, the only oil palm estate, is
transported to a factory on the estate. The project provides for greater
centralization of processing facilities, and in future, crops will be moved
longer distances to larger and more economically run plants (see paragraphs
4.09 through 4.11 and Annex 4). Produce for export from the southern estates
is transported by truck to Pandjang where port facilities for dry cargo are
satisfactory. Ships up to 10,000 tons (dwt) 2/ and 8 meter draft can use
the port; there are no silting problems and there are plans for improvement
and extension within the next few years. At present palm oil is sold locally,
although the port at Pandjang has limited storage and pumping facilities for
palm oil. Funds would be provided under the Credit to improve these
facilities. Produce from the northern estates (tea and rubber) is transported
by road to Palembang where there are adequate port facilities for handling
PNP X crop increase.
D. Labor
3.07      Unlike most PNP which provide housing for nearly all their work
forces, PNP X only houses 25% of its workers. Housing is poor and by 1984,
some 0,000 workers will be required compared with about 7,000 presently
employed. No difficulty is anticipated in recruiting these from Java and
the project provides for an increase in labor housing to ultimately accomodate
1/   See paragraph 1(a) in Annex 4.
2/   Deadweight.

50% of the work force. The increase is required for the labor recruited from
Java. The remaining 50% would live on neighboring smallholdings and villages.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      Agricultural conditions and infrastructure on PNP X estates have
deteriorated steadily since they were taken over from their previous owners
in 1957. By the end of 1972, nearly 12,700 ha of previously profitable
but now uneconomic rubber and oil palm will have been abandoned, leaving
about 11,700 ha of poorly maintained rubber and oil palm, inadequate and badly
run down processing facilities, and weak management. Efforts to implement
a rehabilitation program in 1971 by a recently appointed management team
are being adversely affected by lack of funds; and while rubber remains
at its present low price any significant self-generation of funds for
rehabilitation, diversification into oil palms and replanting, is impossible.
However, fertile soils and suitable climate provide favorable conditions for
growing rubber and oil palm, and with substantial investment and improved
management, there would be long-term benefits in increased production and
foreign exchange earnings.
4.02      The project would consist of:
-    replanting about 6,400 ha of abandoned rubber land with
oil palms;
-    planting about 1,000 ha of reserve land with oil palms;
-    the purchase of oil palm planting material;
-    replanting about 4,000 ha of abandoned rubber land with
rubber;
-    the introduction of improved agricultural management for
the above areas, as well as for 9,700 ha existing mature
and immature rubber areas and 2,000 ha existing mature
and immature oil palm areas;
-    fertilizing up to 4,600 ha of mature rubber for 2 years
and all immature rubber areas for 8 years;
-    fertilizing up to 2,000 ha of mature oil palms for 3 years
and all immature oil palm areas for 8 years;
-    constructing one new palm oil factory and rehabilitating
an existing factory;
-    rehabilitating and expanding the bulking installation at
Pandjang port for storing and pumping palm oil;



-7-
-    constructing 2 new block rubber factories, rehabilitating
existing processing facilities, and providing laboratory
facilities for improved quality control;
-    rehabilitating and expanding housing, estate roads and
bridges and other estate infrastructure;
-    providing agricultural machinery, vehicles, chemicals and
equipment and rehabilitating existing machinery, vehicles
and equipment;
-    providing technical assistance including:
(i)  Executive assistants to the President Director (General
Manager);
(ii) Engineering advisory services;
(iii) Estate inspection services;
(iv) Foliar and soil analysis services;
(v)  Plant breeding advisory services;
(vi) Marketing advisory services;
(vii) Technical assistance for crop diversification projects
including tea,cloves, cinnamon, coconuts and cocoa.
B. Detailed Features
Planting Program
4.03      In planning the oil palm planting program a major consideration has
been the cost and location of future processing facilities. Some Rp 150 M
(US$360,000) has been committed in 1971 and 1972 to much needed rehabilitation
of the existing Bekri palm oil factory. When this work is completed the
Bekri factory will only be able to process crops from existing planted oil
palm areas through 1982. For this reason, and because suitable abandoned
rubber land and related infrastructure is available, the proposed 7,400 ha
oil palm program would be centered on the Kedaton estate. This will require
a new palm oil factory with an initial capacity of 20 ton ffb/hr by 1976/77.
4.04      The rubber replanting program of about 4,000 ha would be concentrated
on abandoned rubber land at 4 southern and 2 northern estates. From 1982
onwards a 27 year replanting cycle would be followed. The proposed 1973-77
combined oil palm and rubber planting programs would be phased as follows
(details of the program are given in Annex 5):



-8-
Planting Season    1973/74   1974/75   1975/76    1976/77   1977/78   Total
Oil Palm (Ha)        1,000      1,500     1,700       1,800      1,400    7,400
Rubber (Ha)            500        800       800       1,000        900    4,000
1,500     2,300      2,500      2,800      2,300   11,400
4.05      The proposed phasing is geared to the work load which can be borne
by the existing management and labor force, although faster oil palm develop-
ment provide economies in production costs. However progress with earlier
projects emphasizes the need to set realistic targets and it is unlikely that
the proposed program can be exceeded during the early years of the project.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that no
changes would be made to the planting programs without IDA agreement.
4.06      Following the appointment of oil palm plant breeding consultants
under the first Agricultural Estates project (Credit 155-IND), production
of oil palm seed of high yield potential from the Government-owned Marihat
Oil Palm Research Station in North Sumatra has been improved (Annex 6).
However in case there may not be sufficient material available in 1972 to
meet all the requirements of Government-owned estates in Sumatra, the project
costs provide for the purchase of high grade seed from foreign sources.
High yielding rubber planting material meeting internationally accepted
standards is available on PNP X and would be propagated in PNP X nurseries.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that all
material used for project oil palm and rubber planting programs would follow
the recommendations of plant breeding consultants appointed under Credit
155-IND. Funds are provided under the project to extend the plant breeding
consultants' appointments by 10 man-months so that they can continue to
provide Government with recommendations and progress reports on the oil palm
and rubber breeding programs.
Agricultural Rehabilitation and Fertilizer Program
4.07      Agricultural conditions of plantings in the project area are
generally poor. Tree growth is retarded by severe competition from weeds,
and tree losses have occurred in immature areas. Efforts to implement a
rehabilitation program in 1971 were partially successful as funds for chemicals
and machinery were insufficient. PNP X has obtained short-term finance to
continue the rehabilitation in 1972 and provision has been made in project
costs to complete this program. The initial costs of rehabilitation are
high but improved agricultural standards are essential before either the
planting or the fertilizer rehabilitation programs can proceed.
4.08      Optimum fertilizer applications can be determined only by scientific
techniques such as foliar and soil analyses which are described in Annex 7.
While foliar analysis services are being improved locally, they can only be
provided on a limited scale and the project costs include analysis services
from suitable research agencies abroad. Regular fertilizer applications
have been lacking for many years and both rubber and oil palm yields
are well below their potential. Before significant yield responses can
be obtained, fertilizer must be applied to correct imbalances and raise



-9-
nutrient levels. The corrective fertilizer applications required for mature
rubber for two years and for mature oil palms for three years and would be
financed under the project and fertilizer applications for immature areas
to maturity are also included in project costs.
Processing Facilities
4.09      Oil Palm:  PNP X began rehabilitating the existing Bekri palm oil
factory in 1971 but further modifications are required and provision has been
made in the project estimates for additional rehabilitation during 1972.
Thereafter processing facilities at Bekri will be sufficient for crops from
existing oil palm areas through 1982 when the old factory would be replaced
with a mill of 10 ton ffb per hour capacity. The present annual crop at
Bekri of 11,000 tons ffb is expected to rise to a peak of about 24,000 tons
in 1977. Production from the proposed oil palm development in the Kedaton
area is expected to total 6,000 tons ffb in 1977 and to rise to 150,000 tons
in 1982, during which time processing capacity of the Kedaton factory will be
increased from 20 tons to 60 tons ffb per hour. Under the project a new
factory would be built at Kedaton which would be commissioned in 1977.
Annex 4 gives details of existing oil palm processing facilities and the
expansion program.
4.10      At present all palm oil produced by PNP X is sold locally, local
sales are expected to increase to some 3,600 tons annually by 1977 and
thereafter by about 3% annually.  Oil surplus to local requirements would
be exported from the port of Pandjang. There are palm oil storage and pumping
facilities at the port which, following rehabilitation under the project,
would be adequate to handle oil through 1977. Rapidly increasing production
after 1977 will require new storage and pumping facilities which are also
included in the projects. During negotiations an assurance was obtained
from Government that suitable land would be made available by the port
authority to PNP at the port of Pandjang not later than 1975 for construction
of these facilities in 1976/77.
4.11      Rubber:  The present latex crop of about 3,100 tons per annum is
processed in sheet factories at each estate; lower grades are processed by
a central block rubber factory in the south, and into crepe grades at indi-
vidual northern estates. Annex 4 describes the main characteristics of the
various types of rubber produced and gives details of the existing factories.
These are poorly managed and maintained and their total capacity is in-
adequate for crops from existing rubber areas after 1974. PNP X crops are
expected to increase to 11,000 tons in 1977 and 2 block rubber factories will
be required for the additional output.
Buildings
4.12      Labor housing is generally substandard and project costs provide
for the replacement of 1,200 single housing units and construction of 800
additional units. The building program would be subject to review by the
Inspectors and would follow a schedule agreed between the Inspectors and the
PNP.



- 10 -
Agricultural Machinery, Vehicles, Chemicals and Equipment
4.13      Existing PNP X machinery and vehicles are old and there is a
chronic shortage of spare parts. Maintenance costs are high and repairs
take excessive time. Utilization of vehicles and machinery is low and new
investment is unlikely to reduce costs unless accompanied by improvements in
operating efficiency and work outputs. Under the project, obsolete and
irreparable equipment such as tractors, agricultural implements, road
maintenance machinery, crop transport and personnel vehicles would be re-
placed. The estimates for future requirements assume more efficient
utilization. Procurement would follow schedules agreed with Inspectors,
Engineering Advisors, Executive Management and the Executive Assistants.
4.14      Office equipment, agricultural chemicals and other general purpose
items required for the rehabilitation program would also be provided under
the project. Detailed requirements would be included in annual budgets
(see paragraph 5.08).
Technical Assistance
4.15      Technical assistance services for plant breeding and marketing
provided under Credit 155-IND would be extended to include PNP X (see para
4.06 and 6.04). Plant breeding is described in Annex 6, and foliar and
soil analysis-services required for the fertilizer investment program are
described in Annex 7. Details of Management Advisory, Inspectorate and
Engineering Services appear in Chapter V.
Diversification
4.16      Tea:  Although the distance of the tea estate (Pagaralam) from
headquarters precludes its full integration with the project (see paragraph
3.01), the estate will remain under PNP X management and is expected to
generate sufficient funds to break even. Some benefits to the estate are
expected from management improvements at headquarters. The Inspectorate
Services provided under Credit 259-IND to the tea estates in West Java (PNP
XII and XII) would be extended by 10 man-months to assist PNP X to prepare
a rehabilitation and development program for Pagaralam. These services
would be financed under the project.
4.17      Cloves:  In 1970, PNP X acquired some 2,500 ha on which a clove
estate (Kalianda) is being established. Some 100 ha are being planted in
1971/72 and 200 per ha per annum is scheduled for 1972/73 and 1973/74. The
economic viability of growing cloves in Indonesia under PNP management has
not been established so that Kalianda is essentially a pilot scheme. Funds
would be provided under the Credit for technical advisory visits from foreign
specialists and for importing high grade planting material for propagation
and environmental testing. Sales of planting material to smallholders would
provide income to pay for local costs of nurseries and small field trials.
During the project development period the suitability of cloves as a plant-
ation crop would be reviewed and the feasibility of a program of smallholder



- 11 -
development in the vicinity of a nucleus estate which would provide facilities
for processing, storage, marketing and the supply of high grade planting
material studied.
4.18      Cinnamon:  PNP X has established cinnamon nurseries at the
Pagaralam tea estate to provide planting material for 500 ha scheduled for
planting the 1972/73. Cinnamon will be planted on new land and developed
as a pilot project. Funds required for cinnamon development would be provided
by self-generated funds from Pagaralam estate.  During the project development
period, the advisability of further diversification from tea into cinnamon
would be studied. The project provides for technical advisory visits from
foreign specialists and for importing high grade planting material for testing
under Indonesian conditions.
4.19      Other Crops:  The project also provides for imports of high grade
coconut and cocoa planting material so that approximately 400 ha could be
established for the production of planting material, either for future
development and diversification on PNP X, or for sale to smallholders in
Lampung. Funds would be provided under the Credit for 5 man-months of
technical advisory services, and local costs would be met from government
sources.
C. Future Development
4.20      On completion of the project planting program, future development
potential includes 1,500 ha of abandoned and jungle land in the Bekri area,
4,500 ha of new land PNP X intends to acquire which is suitable for oil palms,
and 1,600 ha of abandoned land on other estates suitable for rubber. The
financial implications of developing these areas, with oil palm and rubber,
and providing processing facilities and infrastructure are shown in Annex 19
Tables 1-5. These and alternative plans for future development, including
diversification into other crops (see paragraphs 4.16 thru 4.19), would be
studied during the project period by PNP and its consultants, with a view
to possible future projects.
D. Cost Estimates
4.21      The total estimated costs during the development period 1972
through 1984 are US$25.6 M. The project costs from 1972 through 1980 would
amount to US$21.9 M and will have to be financed entirely by outside funds
(see paras 4.25 through 4.28). A summary of project cost estimates through
1980 is given below; further details are given in Annex 9.

_3_
4.22      The estimates and the foreign exchange component are based on
recent costs and current prices obtained during appraisal, and 10% has been
added to all machinery and vehicles to provide for inflation in 1972. For
the period 1973 through 1980 price contingencies of 6% per annum (compounded)
and physical contingencies of 5% have been provided for all project costs.
Provision has also been made in the cost estimates for an increase in labor
costs of 7-1/2% per annum (compounded) during the three year period 1973-75.
Estimated operating costs also include price contingencies of 4% per annum
(compounded) 1973 through 1980.
4.23      Project costs include Rp 151.2 M (US$0.36 M) for essential
rehabilitation expenditure in 1972. The foreign exchange component is
US$0.2 M; subject to IDA management approval and provided that procurements
are made in accordance with IDA guidelines this expenditure would be financed
retroactively by IDA.
4.24      Projects financed with foreign aid are exempt from import duties
and this would apply to the proposed project. Accordingly, import duties
are not included in project costs but provision has been made for Indonesian
income tax which may be levied on consultants providing technical assistance.
E. Proposed Financing
4.25      The proposed IDA Credit of US$11 M would cover the foreign
exchange component, equal to about 50% of total project costs; the remaining
US$10.9 M would be provided by Government. PNP X would not generate surplus
funds for development during the disbursement period, and would be required
to liquidate its existing debt obligations totalling US$1.1 M.
4.26      As PNP X is unable to generate funds for development, all cash
requirements would normally be provided by the Government at 12% per annum,
the standard rate for long-term development loans. However, if the proceeds
of the proposed IDA Credit and the Government contribution were lent at 12%
interest, PNP X would not be able to repay the loans. Expenditures after
1980 through 1984 to complete the project and for renewal of fixed assets
(see para 4.28) would make debt service impossible to meet. It is therefore
necessary to relieve PNP X of the debt service burden by granting an
interest-free grace period of 18 years on all loans required through 1980
in order to obtain a satisfactory cash flow (see Annex 18). PNP X would
also require a grace period of ten years for principal and would repay the
loan over the 20 years from 1983.  PNP X would however be required to pay to
Government during the 18 year interest-free grace period the 3/4% per annum
service charge due on the IDA funds invested.
4.27      The proposed financing arrangements were agreed with the Government
during negotiations and assurance was obtained that a draft subsidiary loan
agreement to lend to PNP X the entire proceeds of the IDA Credit and funds
provided by the Government would be submitted to IDA for approval. Signature
of this agreement would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit.



- 14 -
F. Completion of Project
4.28      The project would be substantially completed by 1980, after which
the PNP X self-generated funds would be sufficient to meet operating costs,
debt servicing arrangements detailed in paragraph 4.26 and the remaining
development expenditure amounting to US$3.7 M.
4.29      During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that
it would provide all funds needed to complete the project. If the Government
requests IDA to finance further new PNP X development (see paragraph 4.20)
such a program would be subject to further appraisal before 1978.
G. Procurement
4.30      International competitive bidding would be used for fertilizers
(US$0.85 M), processing plant and machinery (US$3.6 M) and agricultural
machinery and vehicles (US$0.7 M). Technical advisory services (US$1.9 M)
would be obtained from suitably qualified organizations. Housing construction
(US$1.4 M), chemicals (US$0.5 M), and some other items would be procured in
small lots and providing IDA agrees, and with the assistance of the
consultants, would be procured following competitive bidding but without
international advertising. For purposes of bid comparison, local producers
who add substantial value during manufacture would be accorded a margin of
preference of 15% or the actual customs duty, whichever is less. The
remaining costs (US$2.6 M) relate to planting and upkeep of immature areas
and rehabilitation of mature areas and consist principally of wages, planting
material and sundry expenses.
4.31      The Executive Assistants to the President Director and the
consultants providing inspectorate and engineering advisory services (see
Chapter 5) would assist in the preparation of procurement schedules, bidding
documents and specifications and participate in evaluation of tenders. Their
written comments or evaluations would be submitted to IDA before award of
contracts and an assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations.
4.32      While Government has waived import duties on procurement for
public sector projects financed by IDA, experience with earlier projects
has shown that formalities of clearing goods through customs result in long
delays. The Ministry of Trade also controls certain aspects of PNP
procurement, such as fertilizers, and while there is justification for this,
delays which result from government controls adversely affect the project.
Procurement problems such as these are currently under joint review by the
Government and IDA, and Government has undertaken to implement recommended
improvements.
H. Disbursement
4.33      The IDA Credit would be disbursed against:



- 15 -
(a) the C.I.F. costs of directly imported fertilizer,
agricultural machinery and vehicles and 80% of the cost of
these items if procured locally (US$1.7 M);
(b) the contractual foreign exchange costs incurred and 40% of
the remainIng costs for contracts for construction of oil
palm and rubber factories including supply and installation
of machinery. The percentage established above provides
for the Association financing 70% of these contracts
(US$4.3 M);
(c) inspectors' assessments of planting standards and costs,
12 to 18 months after planting of areas established in
1973-74 through 1975-76, at a scale of rates detailed in
Annex 10 (US$1.0 M); and
(d) the foreign exchange cost, net of Indonesian income tax,
of executive assistants, inspectorate services and other
technical assistance (US$1.4 M). An amount of US$2.6 M
would remain unallocated to meet price and physical
contingencies.
Included above is US$0.2 M which, providing procurement procedures were
satisfactory, IDA would disburse for payments against that part of the 1972
rehabilitation program involving agricultural chemicals and processing plant
which took place before the credit was signed.
4.34      A disbursement schedule is at Annex 11.  Any amount not used for
the project would be cancelled.
V. ORGANIZATIOIN AND MANAGEMENT
A. PNP Management and Government Control
5.01      Executive management of PNP consists of a President Director as
chief executive, a Production Director and a Commercial Director. They are
responsible to the Director General of Estates who advises the Minister of
Agriculture on policy matters and staff appointments, approves PNP budgets
and monitors its activities through an inspectorate and Government auditors.
The Directorate General of Estates is understaffed and it frequently happens
that this information is delayed or inaccurate which reduces effective
control. As a result PNP executive management receives insufficient guidance.
The first Agricultural Estates project (155-IND) provided for a restructuring
of PNP management into supervisory (board of directors) and executive
functions (general manager, production and commercial managers). This was
generally in line with Government plans to convert PNP's into commercial
units known as Peseroan Terbetas (PT). Subsequently it became apparent that
the supervisory boards did not exercise sufficient control over executive
management and the Second Estates Project (194-IND), provided for greater



- 16 -
control by the Director General's office. The third project (259-IND) pro-
vided for full conversion to PT and while this appears to be working satis-
factorily, a serious shortage of qualified personnel precludes conversion of
all PNP to PT at this time. Experience to date has made it clear that
executive management must be effectively guided and monitored and that
adequate controls will be needed for some time.  Accordingly, a survey to be
undertaken by management consultants (Sycip, Gorres and Company from the
Philippines jointly with two Belgian and two Malaysian-based consultancy firms),
during the first half of 1972, financed out of the second Technical Assistance
Credit (Credit 216-IND), will review and recommend improved PNP management
arrangements. It is expected that the management improvements would provide
the greater incentives of commercial independence for day-to-day operations
without losing the benefits of centralized technical advisory services,
better staff utilization and training. Government would retain suitable
inspectorate services which would be responsible for monitoring PNP's tech-
nical and financial performance and which would also provide technical
assistance and guidance on national policies on behalf of Government.
5.02      Pending completion of the management survey, a supervisory board
similar to those appointed under the earlier Agricultural Estates projects
would not be appointed and the executive management would remain directly
responsible to the Director General of Estates. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that initial appointments to the executive management,
and any subsequent changes, would be made following consultation with IDA.
Should any supervisory board be established in the future, the same procedure
for the appointment of its members would be followed. Assurances were also
obtained that following completion of the management survey, Government would
consult with IDA on which of the recommendations emanating from the survey
should be implemented, and as soon as possible thereafter would carry out
such recommendations on PNP X as are agreed with IDA. These would include
arrangements for internal management of PNP, Government control of Government-
owned estates, and the selection and appointment of senior staff.
5.03      In the meantime, internal management of the PNP would remain un-
changed except for the appointment of Executive Assistants to the President
Director (see para 5.04 and Annex 12). In addition 2 counterpart Inspectors
would be appointed after the consultant Inspectors' initial visit to the
PNP. Counterpart Inspectors would be selected from the most able and respected
managers on PNP X. They would not relinquish their existing posts, but
during bi-annual visits of the Consultant Inspectors, would take part in
the estate inspections and participate in the preparation of the reports.
Assurance of these appointments was obtained during negotiations.
B. Executive Assistants
5.04      In the First and Second Agricultural Estate projects, attempts to
improve management through the appointment of advisors without executive
functions have been disappointing (see para 2.06). Consequently, it is
proposed to appoint 3 internationally recruited Executive Assistants to



- 17 -
the President Director who would be responsible for the production and
commercial operations of PNP X for an initial period of 3 years although the
project includes funds for 8 years in case extension of their services is
necessary. The Executive Assistants responsible for rubber and oil palm
operations would control all production operations currently the responsibility
of the Production Director (the post of Production Director would be vacant
for the duration of the Executive Assistants' appointments, and the function
of the Production Director would be assumed by the President Director).
Responsibilities currently held by the Commercial Director would be shared.
The Commercial Director would retain administrative duties while the
Executive Assistant would assume control of financial and commercial operations.
The Executive Assistants would be particularly concerned with implementation
of the project planting programs, the introduction of modern technology and
improvements in financial and management controls. A description of their
duties is given in Annex 8. The appointment of the 3 Executive Assistants
would be a condition of effectiveness. Assurance of these appointments was
obtained during negotiations.
C. Insvection Service
5.05      In the previous three estates projects organizations well qualified
in plantation management have been appointed to provide Inspection and
Engineering Advisory Services; similar arrangements would be made for PNP X
(see Annex 8). Their duties do not differ substantially from those in the
earlier projects except that their appointment would be by the Government and
not by the PNP Board of Directors because of the Government's need for tech-
nical supervision of PNP activities. The Inspectors would, nevertheless,
be in close contact with PNP and their reports would benefit all levels
of PNP management. Reports would be distributed promptly to the PNP Executive
Management; the Supervisors and their successors; the Government and IDA.
The Inspectors would visit the estate twice yearly, following an introductory
visit and report submitted within three months of their appointment. They
would report on physical conditions of each estate, identify the major
problems, and make recommendations to overcome them. They would recommend
priorities for PNP action which would be contained, together with a summary
of their findings and recommendations, in a consolidated report to enable
the Government to monitor and control PNP activities. Priorities recommended
by the Inspectors and agreed by the Board would become specific responsibilities
of PNP management and their Executive Assistants. The appointment of the
Inspectors would be a condition of effectiveness.
5.06      Consultants appointed under the first three agricultural estates
Credits have experienced difficulties over entry and work permits, customs
clearance of personal effects and vehicle licensing. These problems have
been due to the fact that the government agencies responsible for these
matters have not been familiar with the terms of the consultants' contracts
with Government and PN? and also because the consultants and the PNP have
not been familiar with the large number of complex Government regulations
involved. Government has undertaken to advise all parties of their various
obligations and thereby reduce delays and difficulties.



- 18 -
D. Accounts and Audit
5.07      PNP X accounts are not kept in a satisfactory form and those for
1969, through 1971 have not been audited. Summarized balance sheets and
profit and loss accounts for these years appear in Annex 13 (Tables 1 and
2). Experience with previous projects has revealed deficiencies in provisions
for audits. Auditors have not been appointed promptly, there have been
disputes over fees, and PNP managements have not encouraged thorough audits.
It would be a condition of effectiveness that PNP X would make arrangements
satisfactory to IDA with independent auditors acceptable to IDA to carry out
annual audits. These would be conducted in accordance with guidelines
described in Annex 14.
E. Annual Budgets
5.08      Annual budgets prepared by PNP X Management together with the
Inspection Services would be approved by the Board. Assurances were obtained
from Government that prior to the preparation of the 1974 budget, an improved
budget form would be introduced which would adequataly portray unit costs
and productivity. The improved format would be designed to achieve standard-
ization for all PNP and PT having IDA credits outstanding at that time. An
assurance was also obtained that before the 1974 budget was completed, a
5-year plan of PNP X activities would be prepared and submitted to IDA for
comment. Similar 5-year plans will be prepared annually thereafter.
Assurances were also obtained that annual budgets, and any material changes
made subsequently, would be submitted to IDA for comment not later than 30
days prior to their adoption.
VI. PRODUCTION MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
A. Yields and Production
6.01      Growing conditions for rubber in the project area are very good
by world standards. Soils, sunlight and rainfall are also good for oil palms
but periodic severe dry spells which occur every four or five years for two
or three months cause temporary yield depressions, so that estimates for
average oil palm yields are 10% below those expected in North Sumatra.
Details of yield projections are given in Annex 15; in addition to estimated
yields from new plantings they include expected increases in yields which
will result from the fertilizer investment program and improved management
of areas already planted.
6.02      Total annual production of rubber is expected to rise from about
3,700 tons in 1972 to a peak of nearly 15,000 tons in 1985. Palm oil
production is expected to rise from 2,000 tons in 1972 to a peak of some
40,000 tons in 1992, while production of palm kernels will rise from 400
tons in 1972 to nearly 8,000 tons in 1992.



- 19 -
B. Marketing and Prices
6.03      Sales of palm oil and kernels are made directly to local buyers
on the basis of competitive bidding. The number of buyers is, however,
limited. Rubber sales are made both directly to local and overseas buyers
by the PNP and by the Joint Marketing Office (JHO) ir. Djakarta. The Djakarta
J140 office handles commodities produced in PNP X, XI, XII, and XIII; it has
handled rubber sales for PNP X on a trial basis only since April 1971.
6.04      Under the First Agricultural Estates Project (Credit 155-IND) con-
sultants were appointed to improve marketing procedures of the JMO in Medan.
Similar assistance would benefit PNP X and provision has been made in the
project to extend the terms of reference of the consultants to review PNP X
marketing procedures and recommend improvements. Sales of all PNP X rubber
and oil palm products would follow procedures recommended by the marketing
consultants and satisfactory to Government and IDA. An assurance to this
effect was obtained during negotiations.
6.05      Studies of world market supply and demand for palm products and
rubber prepared by the Bank's Economics Department are at Annexes 16 and 17.
All project palm oil and palm kernel production from 1968 to date was sold
in the local (Lampung) market where the annual average consumption during
these 3 years was 2,000 MT of oil and 150 MT of kernels. The consumption of
palm products in Southern Sumatra is expected to increase by about 3% annually,
so that the entire PNP X production up to 1975 will be absorbed in this market.
Thereafter, exports will become important although part of the production may
be sold. in Java. A growing proportion of PNP X rubber production will be
exported to internationally accepted technical specifications. Quality
control will be supervised by rubber research centers at Bogor and Medan.
6.06      The Bank's Economics Department forecasts that the actual price
for palm oil will decline to f 68 per long ton CIF Europe in 1975 through to
1980, compared with t 110 in 1970 and E 72 in 1968 (the peak and trough of a
15 year period).. For palm kernels the actual price is forecast at f 50-55
per long ton CIF Europe in 1980, compared with t 50 in January 1972 and f 71
in 1970.  The forecast price for rubber is around US 17 cents per pound
CIF New York in 1975, rising to US 19 cents during the period 1975 through
1985. These prices have been used as the basis for the economic and financial
analysis of the project. The FAO Secretariat of the Intergovernmental Group
on Oilseeds, Oils and Fats has been informed of the project. No objections
have been raised.
C. Financial Aspects
6.07      At present more than 50% of the PNP X planted area is immature and
significant earnings will not accrue from these areas until 1978 and there-
after. The first income from project plantings is not expected until 1977.
These factors, together with weak management and the existing debt burden,
preclude PNP X from contributing funds during the first 8 years of project
development.



-23 -
6.08      The cash flow projections shown in Annex 18 (Tables I to 5) are made
on the assumpticn that there would be no expansion of oil palm or rubber
areas after 1977, and that investments would be confined to regular replanting
cycles and expansion of processing facilities for increased crops. It has
also been assumed that Pagaralam tea plantation and pilot projects for
diversification into cloves, cinnamon, cocoa and coconuts would be either
self-financing or that separate financial arrangements would be made for
their development. (see paras 4.17 through 4.19). Cash flows have also been
prepared to show the financial implications of expanding the oil palm and
rubber areas after 1977 in accordance with the Government's long term plans
(Annex 19, Tables 1-5).
6.09      The financial arrangements (described in paragraphs 4.25 through
4.28) would enable PNP X to meet from 1983 onwards its operating costs,
replanting and other investment requirements and debt service obligations
out of self-generated funds. All cash surpluses remaining after meeting
debt service requirements are shown in the cash flow as retained earnings.
6.10      Realistic rates of return on capital cannot be calculated as the
real value of assets is not known due to heavy inflation in Indonesia before
1969. Before PNP X can be converted to a new enterprise under the Commercial
Code, a revaluation of the assets would be necessary.
6.11      Annex 20 shows the effect of PNP activities on the Government's
budgetary position. Loan interest payments by PNP X to Goverrment from 1983
to 2002 total US$8.4 M. Additional export duty and taxes that would accrue
to the Government during the 30-year period commencing 1973 amount to
some US$27 M.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The principal benefits of the Project would be to:
(a)  increase production of palm oil, palm kernels and
rubber by 38,500 tons, 7,200 tons and 10,500 tons
respectively; and
(b)  provide additional employment by 1990 for some 2,500
people, which would assist the Government in its policy
to find employment for workers from Java;
The increased production would raise net foreign exchange earnings from the
present level of US$2 million to about US$10.0 million in 1990.
7.02      The economic rates of return are 13.4% for oil palm development, 28%
for rubber, with a combined weighted average of 18.5%. The rate of return for
rubber in plantings already made is significantly higher than for oil palm
which is largely due to sunk costs; if these are taken into account, the
rate of return for rubber falls to 17%. Separate economic rates of return
have been calculated for rubber replanting and rehabilitation of existing



- 21 -
rubber. The rates of return are 18% and 34% respectively. The rubber
replanting program consists of small areas on six estates which would not
require any increased management or infrastructure.
7.03      The benefits used in the economic rate of return calculations are
based on selling prices for palm produce and rubber detailed in paragraph
6.06. Costs have been adjusted for identifiable taxes and export duties and
price contingencies have been excluded. Labor has not been shadow priced
although some of the labor coming from Java would earn higher incomes under
the project.
7.04      The economic rates of return are quite sensitive to changes in
selling prices and an increase or decrease of 10% and 20% would change
the combined rate of return by about 3 and 7 percentage points respectively.
7.05      In addition to the rates of return for the project, calculations
have also been made for the Government's long-term rubber and oil palm
development program for PNP X. The estimated rates of return of the program
are very similar to those of the project. Details of all the economic rate
of return calculations are at Annex 21.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The assurances obtained from Government during negotiations
included:
(i) PNP X would be relieved of all taxes and other liabilities
on some 16,000 ha of land presently occupied by squatters
which the PNP does not intend to reclaim (paragraph 3.02);
(ii) About 50 Km of connecting roads between individual PNP X
estates would be surfaced with gravel or laterite during
1972 and 1973 (para 3.05);
(iii)  No changes would be made to the proposed planting programs
without the agreement of IDA (paras 3.03, 4.05 and 4.17);
(iv) All material used for project oil palm and rubber planting
programs would be subject to the recommendations of plant
breeding consultants appointed under Credit 155-IND (para
4.06);
(v)  Bid evaluations submitted to IDA would contain written comments
of the Executive Assistants and consultants (para 4.31);
(vi) Appointments to the Executive Management and any supervisory
board, should it be established in the future, would only be
made after consultation with IDA (para 5.02);



- 22 -
(vii)  The appointment of 2 Executive Assistants to be responsible
for production operations and an Executive Assistant to be
responsible for commercial operations on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA (para 5.04);
(viii) An experienced plantation company, satisfactory to IDA, would
be engaged by PNP X for the project period to provide Inspection
Services and Engineering Advisory Services on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA (para 5.05);
(ix) An improved budget form would be adopted for 1974 and subsequent
budgets. Annual budgets from 1973, and 5-year plans, and any
subsequent material changes, together with the comments of the
Inspectors, would be submitted to IDA for its comment not later
than 30 days prior to their adoption (para 5.08); and
(x) Sales of all PNP X rubber and oil palm products would follow
procedures satisfactory to Government and IDA (para 6.04).
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness would be:
(i) a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between PNP X and Government had
been signed (para 4.27);
(ii) appointment of Executive Assistants to the President Director
(para 5.04);
(iii) an experienced plantation company had been appointed to provide
Inspection Services (para 5.05); and
(iv) independent auditors had been appointed (para 5.07).

INDONESIA
FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
Progress of Existing Agricultural Credits
Existing Credits to the Estate Industry
1.        Three IDA credits for the rehabilitation and development of the
Government-owned estate sector have been approved to date. The first, in
June 1969, was for US$16.0 M to assist two estate enterprises (PNP V and
PNP VII) in North Sunatra (Credit 155-IND). In June 1970 the second IDA
Credit (194-IND) for US$17 M was approved for PNP IV and PNP VI, also
in North Sumatra; and in June 1971, approval was given for the third IDA
Credit (259-IND) for US$15 M for PNP XII and PNP XIII in West Java. The
first and second estates projects involve rubber and oil palm (PNP IV and
V - rubber; PNP VI and VII - oil palm) and the third estates project is for
tea rehabilitation and development.
Credits 155 and 194-IND
2.        Credits 155 and 194-IND finance projects comprising the rehabilita-
tion of four Government-owned PNP estate groups. The problems of the two
projects are identical and consequently they are treated as one in this
review. The projects involve the planting or replanting of nearly 40,000 ha
of oil palms and rubber; upkeep of some 29,000 ha of imature oil palms
and rubber; fertilizers; agricultural vehicles and machinery; processing
plant and technical assistance for research and management.
3.        Credit 155-IND became effective six months after signature, and
Credit 194-IND eight months after signature. Delays in effectiveness and,
following this, in appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors,
have resulted in implementation of the projects being approximately one year
behind the schedules estimated in the appraisal reports. Other than these
delays, the project development programs have been followed except for oil
palm planting and replanting which have been restricted by an unforeseen
lack of suitable planting material. An IDA-financed oil palm breeder
determined that much of the oil palm planting material produced in Indonesia
was genetically unsuitable; this resulted in the need to destroy many
nurseries. The breeding program is now proceeding satisfactorily and with
the addition of imported seed 1972 plantings will proceed as planned.
4.        While there have been improvements, weak and inexperienced manage-
ment is the principal problem. At appraisal it was believed that, with
the help of experienced foreign advisors, management would improve steadily.
In practice, the improvement has been much slower than anticipated, and the
impact of the advisors has been very mixed. Principal management problems



ANNEX 1
Page 2
are weak budgetary, financial and operational controls, poor communications,
lack of delegation, and a poor knowledge of modern plantation techniques.
5.        In order to achieve the improvements in management that have
occurred, to ensure that planting and rehabilitation programs proceed and
obtain adherence to the Guidelines for Procurement, it has been necessary
to increase supervision intensity to three or four visits annually. Addi-
tionally, one of the PMI 1/ Agricultural Advisors is engaged almost full-time
in assisting GOI 2/ and the PNP in carrying out the projects.
6.        GOI has recently taken two actions to improve the situation.
First, it agreed and accepted in November 1971 an IDA prepared Aide-
Memoire on PNP Management Problems including an action timetable for the
implementation of specific improvements. Project PNP have been instructed
to execute the action program by July, 1972; a supervision mission in
March 1972 reported moderate improvements and a further review is scheduled
for August 1972.  Second, it has comissioned a study by management
consultants to determine a system whereby GOI will be able to effectively
supervise and control its PNP. At this time it is not possible to determine
whether these actions will have the desired results, however, by mid-1972,
there should be adequate evidence to conclude whether or not G0I and the PNP
have the will and capacity to improve to acceptable standards management
of the important Government-owned estate sector.
Credit 259-IND
7.        This project finances the rehabilitation of two groups of
Government-owned tea estates in West Java. The project will rehabilitate
2,100 ha of existing tea, will plant 2,300 ha of new tea and 1,100 ha of
cinchona (quinine) and the reorganization and reequipment of the estates'
tea factories. Technical assistance is being provided to strengthen manage-
ment and to introduce up-to-date tea cultivation and processing methods, tea
research will be improved and a survey will be made of the presently
depressed and inefficient smallholder and private estate tea industries,
aimed at finding ways to rehabilitate them. The project became effective
in December 1971. Progress to date is satisfactory and to date relationships
between management and the consultants are good.
Other Existing Agricultural Credits
8.        The remaining agricultural credits approved to date are 127, 195,
211, 220, and 246-IND. The progress of each of these projects is as
follows:
1/   IBRD Permanent Mission to Indonesia.
2/   Government of Indonesia.



ANNEX 1
?age 3
(a)  Credit 127-I2D  -  Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, US$5 M.
"his project finances the purchase and operation of equipment
required for rehabilitating the Rentang, Tjisendane and Glapau-
Sedadi irrigation systems in Java, and completing a new system,
Way Seputih in South Sumatra. It also finances consultants
(Har-a USA) to prepare feasibility reports for further irrigation
rehabilitation projects. The credit became effective on
March 25, 1969. Project works are proceeding well and dis-
bursements are on schedule.
(b) Credit 195-IND - Second Irrigation Rehabilitation ProJect,
US$18.5 M. This project involves the rehabilitation of the
Djatiluhur project in West Java. Under this project which
became effective on December 31, 1970, an autonomous agency,
Otorita Djatiluhur, was set up to administer the credit.
Due to difficulties in establishing the agency and its
inability to prepare the necessary tender documents on time,
the Association agreed (March 1971) that the 1971/72 program
could be carried out under eight small contracts, instead of
the negotiated five contracts, and that the first two amounting
to 15% of the value of the eight could be awarded after local
bidding. Because of these delays, disbursements are behind
schedule, but all eight contracts have now been awarded, all
to local contractors. Current procurement procedures - devised
to minimize irregular procurement - are cumbersome and slow.
They are being reviewed by a special committee, and are to
be streamlined. Thus disbursements are expected to grow
.apidly.
(c)  Credit 211-IND  -  Fisheries Project, US$3.5 M.  The project
is part of the overall program of the Indonesian Government
to develop export-orientated skipjack tuna fishing. It
consists of constructing and equipping freezing and cold
storage facilities, the construction of a wharf in Aer
Tembaga, the purchase of 30 wooden pole and line fishing
vessels of 30GT type and two refrigerated carriers to transport
frozen tuna to export markets. The project provides technical
assistance to support the program. The project became effective
on January 15, 1971. Although present operations of the
project unit, the State Fisheries Enterprise, can be con-
sidered inefficient, it is expected that Government remedial
action will improve the situation, and that the overall
prospects for successful implementation of the project are
good particularly in the light of an upward trend of world
market prices for skipjack tuna.
(d) Credit 220-IND - Third Irrigation Rehabilitation Project,
US$14.5 M. This project finances irrigation rehabilitation
at Tjiudjung and Pemali - Ijomal Ui Java and Sadang in South
Sulawesi. The project became effective on May 28, 1971, after



ANNEX 1
Page 4
a two-month delay caused by difficulties in recruiting ex-
patriate advisors. Planning and design are progressing
satisfactorily, but construction is only just starting.
(e) Credit 246-IND - Seeds Project, US$7.5 M. This project
finances the establishment of facilities and an organiza-
tion for the production and distribution of high-yielding
varieties of rice seed and other seed. The original date
of effectiveness was postponed from September 3, 1971 to
December 7, 1971 because consultant advisors had not taken
up their appointments. As for other IDA-financed projects
in Indonesia, management is likely to be the main constraint
to timely disbursements of funds.

INDONESIA
FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
PNP X Rubber and Oil Palm Processing Facilities
Rubber
1.        Each of the 11 rubber estates on PNP X has small RSS (ribbed
smoked sheet) factories in which latex crops are processed. Scrap grades
make up a lower than normal percentage of the total rubber crop due to the
practice on PNP X of collecting latex cups after each tapping. Late
drippings which normally coagulate in the cup between tappings are therefore
lost. The small quantity of scrap grades, which is collected, are processed
in the south in a central block rubber factory at Natar, and in the north
(Palembang area) in small crepe factories. Further details of the rubber
types processed on PNP X are as follows:
(a)  Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) - The latex is coagulated by
the addition of acid. The coagulum is passed through
rollers to remove water and the resulting sheets are
smoked dried. Quality standards can be technically
specified and controlled, but the normal., though less
satisfactory, practice is to grade RSS by visual appearance.
(b) Crepe - Either coagulated latex or scrap can be made into
crepe rubber. The rubber is passed through heavy rollers
running at different speeds which work the rubber into a
thin sheet with a crepe-like texture. The crepe is air
dried at a lower temperature than smoked sheet. As with
sheet, quality standards can be technically specified and
controlled but grading is normally done visually. Crepe
made from latex is a premium rubber and usually sells at
substantially higher prices than top grade smoked sheet.
(c) Block Rubbers - a relatively new process in which either
coagulated latex or scrap grades can be:
-    treated with chemicals to improve and retain the best
properties of natural rubber;
-    dried quickly and cheaply;
-    pressed into small bales of standard size for easier
handling; and
-    graded only to technical specifications.



ANNEX 4

all of which improve the competitiveness of natural rubber with synthetic
rubbers.
2.        Processing capacity of existing factories will not be adequate
for projected 1974 crops from existing planted areas.  Crop estimates
include the higher proportion of scrap rubbers (also higher total crops)
that would result from changes in tapping practices whereby late drippings
of latex will be collected in cups left on the trees between tappings.
There are anticipated long-term advantages of block rubber production from
centralized factories, and the project provides for 2 additional block rubber
factories to process latex crops from 7 estates in the south. These factories
would be constructed in 1973/74 and replace existing RSS plants. The total
cost of the 2 new block rubber factories would be about the same as
renovating and extending the 7 existing RSS factories over a 10 year period.
On more isolated estates, 2 southern and 2 northern, where crops are not
big enough to justify construction of block rubber factories, RSS production
would continue.
3.        IDA proposals for processing requirements, both rehabilitation and
extension of existing factories, and new factories, are summarized as
follows:
(a) Natar Processing Center
A modern block rubber plant was commissioned by PNP X in 1971.
It was sited in an ex-plywood factory belonging to the PNP about
14 km from PNP headquarters. The plant was designed to process
whole latex but PNP X uses it to process scrap grades from the
southern estates and smallholders rubber which is bought locally
for processing. The machinery is not well suited to processing
these rubbers, different parts of the plant have different
throughputs and by 1976, projected crops of scrap grades from
the southern estates will exceed its capacity. In order to
upgrade the plant and suitably adapt it for processing low
grade rubbers some US$160,000 would be spent in 1973 and 1974.
This would provide adequate capacity for future projected scrap
grade crops from all 9 southern estates. Additional expenditure
on driers of some US$33,000 would enable PNP to process small-
holders crop of up to 3 tons per day in peak seasons.
(b) Kedaton Processing Center
There are 4 estates (Kedaton, Bergen, Trikora and Tjisaat)
which are suitably located to use centralized facilities
at Kedaton.  These estates each have individual processing
facilities for RSS which would need major extensions between
1973 and 1976, and the Kedaton estate RSS factory particularly,
has barely sufficient capacity to process existing crops. Under
the project, a block rubber factory would be constructed on
Kedaton estate in 1973/74 at a cost of US$320,000 to process
latex crops from the 4 estates. Initial throughput would rise



ANNEX 4
Page 3
rapidly from peak crops of some 5 tons per day in 1973 to
nearly 15 tons per day in 1977. In 1977 an additional
expenditure of some US$59,000 would be required to raise
capacity to about 20 tons per day which, together with minor
additions to latex coagulating capacity in 1978 and 1979,
would be sufficient to process projected peak crops through
1982.  The area under rubber in 1972 will not increase as
abandoned areas on these estates are scheduled for oil palm
planting.
(c) Way Berulu Processing Center
Three estates (Way Berulu, Way Lima and Redjosari) are
suitably located to use a central block rubber factory on
Way Berulu estate. Existing RSS processing capacity on
each estate would need considerable extension from 1973
onwards but the project provides for the replacement of RSS
facilities with the construction of a block rubber factory
in 1973/74 at an estimated cost of US$320,000. Initial
throughput would rise rapidly from peak crops of about 6 tons
per day in 1973 to 15 tons per day in 1977 and then more
gradually through 1986 to a maximum of nearly 22 tons per
day. Thereafter peak crops would remain at about 21 tons per
day. Cost of increasing capacity in 1977, with minor additions
to latex coagulating capacity through 1979, estimated at
US$52,000 is included in the project.
(d) Southern Isolated Estates
Two estates in the Lampung group, Tangkit Sedang and Telung
Bujut, are too isolated to send latex crops to the proposed
centralized block rubber factories. The existing RSS factory
buildings are in reasonable condition on both estates but, in
common with all the PNP estates, the processing plant has been
poorly maintained, cleanliness standards are low and smoking
facilities are badly managed. All these factors result in a
high proportion of substandard grades and low productivity.
Improved management could remedy many of the deficiencies
without significant investment but projected crop increases
will require major investment to increase capacity during the
next 10 years. On Tangkit Serdang crops will rise from 220
tons in 1972 to 470 tons in 1977 and to a peak of 1,200 tons
in 1990.  During the project period new smoking capacity, power
plant and sheeting plant will cost about US$31,000 and further
renovations and extensions through 1982 are estimated to cost
an additional US$31,000.  Crops are very small from Telung Bujut
estate although they will triple in volume to 270 tons in 1977
and to 970 tons by 1990 if all available land is planted with
rubber. The only investment needed during the project period
is some US$3,000 for overhauling existing plant, but during the
following 5 years the cost of extending sheeting and smoking
facilities is estimated at US$25,000. Scrap grade crops together

with the scrap grades from all the other southern estates
would be sent to Natar for processing into block rubber.
(e)  Northern Isolated Estates (Palembang area)
The two estates near Palembang, Musi Landas and Tebenan, each
have RSS factories and also small creping facilities for
processing lower grades. The conditions and working standards
of the factories are similar to those on other PNP X estates
and could also be improved by better management without
major investment. However, projected crop increases
necessitate considerable expansion of the existing processing
facilities although relatively little will be required during
the project period. On Musi Landas annual crops will rise
from 530 tons in 1972 to 740 tons in 1977 and to a peak of some
2,800 tons by 1990 if all available land is planted with rubber.
During the project period, additional sheeting capacity, power
and baling capacity will be required at a cost of US$18,000.
Further renovations and extensions required through 1982 are
estimated to cost an additional US$76,000. On Tebenan, annual
crops are estimated to rise from 260 tons in 1972 to about
770 tons in 1977 and to 2,700 tons by 1990 if all available
land is developed. Renovations and extensions to sheeting,
smoking and power capacity during the project period are
estimated to cost about US$30,000; further investment through
1982 is expected to cost about US$70,000. Existing creping
facilities on both estates are adequate to process the projected
scrap grade crops.
Quality Control
4.        The estimates for block rubber plants include the basic laboratory
equipment required for production quality controls to meet specifications of
Standard Indonesian Rubber (SIR) set by Government and controlled through
Government research stations at Bogor (Java) and Medan (North Sumatra).
Currently, prices for SIR are below comparative grades for RSS and crepe
and it will take time before Indonesia can build a reputation in world
markets for SIR of reliable quality standards strictly enforced by Govern-
ment. Production of SIR in North Sumatra, and also on PNP X, is expected to
benefit from recommendations received from marketing consultants recently
appointed (Credit 155-IND), and other consultants (UNDP) yet to be
appointed to assist the Government research station at Medan.
5.        Quality conttol of RSS and crepe production can be improved by
better management particularly with respect to cleanliness standards, latex
collection, bulking, preservation and coagulation. Sheeting batteries
need to be properly adjusted so that sheets of even thickness are produced.
Sheets should be allowed to drip before smoking and smokehouse trolleys and
hangers maintained in good condition. Temperature control of smokehouse
should be supervised properly and temperature recorders installed. Grading
and packing should be strictly supervised. Implementing these controls
depends largely on better management and requires no major expenditure.

Oil Palms
6.        Bekri:  The only oil palm factory at present on PNP X is on Bekri
estate and was commissioned about 1919. It is highly inefficient with oil
extraction rates of about 12% and kernel extraction below 1%; normal
extraction rates range from 18% to 22% for oil and 3% to 4% for kernels.
Quality standards are low with free fatty acid (ffa) levels around 5%.  In
1971, work was started on improved pressing facilities but there are no plans
to renovate or replace other facilities, such as sterilizers and boilers to
ensure that fruit would be properly prepared for pressing. Without such
renovations, and additional equipment to improve kernel extraction, there
would be no benefit from the US$245,000 already committed to the new presses.
The project provides, therefore, US$100,000 for improvements to sterilizing,
power, and kernel extraction plants. These renovations would raise oil and
kernel extraction levels to 16% and 4% respectively. The more efficient
machinery and better management should improve quality standards and main-
tain ffa levels below 3%. Bekri factory would then have a capacity of
nearly 6 tons ffb per hour and would be able to process crops to a maximum
of 24,000 tons in 1981. At that time a new factory with a capacity of about
10 tons ffb/ha would be needed to replace the old one.
7.        Kedaton:  New oil palm development would take place on 5 estates
located 31 km or less from a proposed processing center on Kedaton. By the
end of the 1977/78 planting season, 7,400 ha oil palms will be planted on
these estates. The first crops, some 6,000 tons, are expected in 1977 and
these rise rapidly to nearly 150,000 tons by 1982. The palm oil factory
will be constructed and expanded to match the increase of crops. The first
stage for 20 tons ffb/hr will be constructed in 1975/77 and cost US$2.25 M.
This will be raised to 30 tons/hr in 1980 at a further cost Of US$110,000. In
1981 a second line of machinery will be installed which will be increased
in stages from 10 ton/hr in 1981 to 30 tons/hr in 1983. The total capacity
of the mill would then be 60 ton/hr and the total estimated cost US$4.8 mil-
lion. Due to differences in weather conditions higher peak crops (14%) are
expected in the Lampung Region compared to North Sumatra (12%) and although
droughts about once in 4 or 5 years depress average yields factory capacity
must be sufficient enough for normal crops in other years.
Port Storage and Pumping Installation
8.        PNP X presently owns palm oil storage and pumping facilities at
the Port of Pandjang. These are old and were last used in 1967. With some
low cost renovations (US$16,000) the existing installation will be sufficient
for projected palm oil shipments through 1977. The existing installation
is on a site required by the Port Authority for future port development and
this factor, together with the need for substantial increases in storage
capacity after 1977, necessitates the construction of a new installation in
1976/77 on an alternative site provided by the Port Authority. The estimated
cost of this is US$253,000 and with the addition of storage tanks (US$66,000
per year 1979 through 1981) as output increases the installation would be
sufficient to store and handle 5,000 tons palm oil.

FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
Plant Breeding and Planting Material
A. Plant Breeding
1.        In the first North Sumatra Estates project, Credit 155-IND, the
Government agreed to implement plant breeding programs for all Government-
owned estates in North Sumatra, to appoint oil palm and rubber plant breeding
consultants to monitor such programs, and to use only material for project
oil palm and rubber planting programs approved by the consultants. The
project provides for extension of their appointments so that they may
continue to provide Government with recommendations and progress reports
on the oil palm and rubber breeding programs. From 1978 onwards planting
material would be chosen by the Board of PNP X on the recommendations of the
plant breeders at the research centers and the Inspection Service.
B. Planting Material: Oil Palms
2.        The oil palm fruit comprises a kernel inside a hard shell,
surrounded by a mass of oily flesh; individual fruits develop in bunches
of approximately 1,200 attached to a fibrous core. A healthy palm produces
about 10 bunches a year and on a mature palm the average bunch weight is about
18 kg. Palm oil is extracted from the flesh and palm kernel oil from the kernel
in separate processes. Plant breeders have aimed at reducing the proportion
of shell in each fruit, which is the only non-oil bearing part, and have
achieved this by crossing thick-shelled (Dura) fruit, with fruit with no
shell (Pisifera 1/) to produce a thin-shelled fruit (Tenera). High yielding
hybrid material with these characteristics is now generally available
throughout the world, including Indonesia, and technically is known as
D x P.
3.        PNP X has previously obtained planting material from Government-
owned research stations in North Sumatra (RISPA in Medan and Marihat on PNP
VII) but it has been of doubtful quality and lower than material retained for
use on PNP VII. Since February 1971 oil palm seed production from Government
sources has been under the supervision of the plant breeding consultants but
1/   In theory Pisifera, with no shell, would be ideal planting material,
but in practice, small fruit size, a high sterility rate and a very
small proportion of kernel preclude its use.

supplies of high quality material have been limited. Production is expected
to be sufficient for the project planting program from 1973 onwards but for
immediate needs and in case of possible future shortfall in local supplies,
PNP X would purchase high grade material from Malaysia.
C. Planting Material: Rubber
4.        The most common rubber varieties (clones) planted by PNP X in
recent years are PR 107 and GTI, both classed as Grade One by the Rubber
Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM), the acknowledged authority which
classes only four clones as Grade One. PR 107 and GTI would continue to be
most coimaonly used for project plantings but the other Grade One Clones,
RRIM 600 and PB 5/51 would also be used. A well-known Sumatran clone,
Avros 2037, about which little is known outside Indonesia but which has done
well in Sumatra, is also included in the list of clones approved for large
scale plantings.
5.        There are a number of other potentially good clones available in
Sumatra but information is limited to yield data of doubtful value; and
before a clone can be safely used for large scale plantings, attention must
also be paid to soil conditions, wind damage and leaf disease characteris-
tics. Use of the newer clones of high but unproved potential would therefor._
be limited to plots of 20 ha, and the advice of the plant breeders and
Inspection Service would be sought before any decision was taken to proceed
to full scale planting.

OURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
Foliar Analysis and the Fertilizer Investment
Program for Mature Oil Palms and Rubber
1.        Until a few years ago fertilizer policies for oil palm and rubber
were usually based on the following:
(a) leaf symptoms which indicate the deficiency of some nutrients;
(b) known nutrient status of different soil types;
(c) fertilizer experiments; and
(d) management experience.
2.        Foliar analysis, in which the nutrient content of the leaf is
determined in the laboratorv and comoared with established optimum levels,
has become cormon practice for both rubber and oil palms in recent years
to determine deficiencies of major elements. Foliar analysis does nct,
however, provide an immediate and simple determination of the quantities of
fertilizer required; this can only be determined from fertilizer trials, but
foliar analysis does provide a reasonable guide to the main chemical defi-
ciencies. As more experience is gained, particularly by comparing fertilizer
trial results with determinations of leaf nutrient status made by foliar
analysis of trees in the trials, foliar analysis can becorae a most useful
aid in determining fertilizer requirements.
3.        Foliar analysis will be used by PNP X for the first time in 1972.
Significant responses from initial applications of fertilizers are not
expected from either oil palm or rubber until 1975 1/. The effect on oil
palm yields will be greater where the palms are young; in the case of older
palms whose yield capacities are past their peak, the response would be
lower. With mature rubber, factors such as tapping policy and the mainten-
ance of bark reserves are likely to have a greater effect on yields than
fertilizers, but it is estimated that a correct fertilizer policy would play
a significant and economic part in the recovery of rubber yields.
4.        PNP X fertilizer policy in recent years has been unsystematic and
inadequate. Visual symptons of deficiencies in oil palms are widespread
and yields are depressed. Rubber appears to be less badly affected by the
1/   Responses to the improved fertilizer program are expected after three
years in the case of oil palms and two years in the case of rubber.

lack of nutrients, but the fertilizers that have been applied night be
depressing yields since the applications were made on an ad hoc basis and
probably were not balanced.  Unless a scientific program of nutrient require-
ment appraisal is instituted and corrective applications made, this situation
cannot be improved.
5.        In view of the delay in yield response to balanced fertilizer
applications until 1975, the application of fertilizer to mature rubber
areas in 1973 and 1974 and to mature oil palm areas in 1973, 1974 and 1975
is considered an investment cost under the project.
6.        It is not possible to determine in advance of a detailed
appraisal of nutrient requirements the precise quantities or types of fer-
tilizer required.  The following assumptiotis based on recent research and
experience in Malaysia for rubber and oil palm are made for the purpose of
projections in this report:
(a)  Rubber - An annual application costing about US$16 per ha
for PNP X mature rubber, except for the last ten years of
productive life (i.e. years 16 through 25) when fertilizer
would be applied only to correct major deficiencies.
Applications under the two year fertilizer investment
program would be substantially higher at about US$32 per ha
per annum in 1973 and 1974. I=nature areas would receive
fertilizer applications totalling US$54 per ha for the whole
immature period.
(b)  Oil Palm - An annual application of about US$40 per ha
should be sufficient for PNP X mature oil palms under
normal conditions, except for the last 10 years of their
productive life (i.e. years 20 through 30) when fertilizer
is no longer required. For areas in their prime, however,
where natural nutrient reserves are badly exhausted,
applications under the three year fertilizer investment pro-
gram would have to be substantially higher, at about US$60
per ha per annum in 1973 through 1975. Immature areas would
receive fertilizer applications totalling US$36 per ha for
the whole immature period.
The above prices cover only the foreign exchange costs; in the financial
projections local handling and transport costs are also included.

CJFUrIl AGRICUL TURAL ESTATES PROJECT
Technical Assistance
Background
1.        Implementation of the proposed program of estate and factory
rehabilitation and expansion for PNP X requires skilled technical and
financial management.  This is not presently available at PNP X so that
management must be strengthened. Consultant advisors to management were
provided under Credits 155, 194 and 259-IND but the results so far have
been mixed; in some cases consultants have not perfonaed as well as expected;
in others their advice has been ignored or implemented only reluctantly.
Proposed Technical Assistance
2.        To assure a more effective utilization of the technical assistance
included in the proposed project, PNP X would appoint three internationally
recruited Executive Assistants to the President Director for an initial
period of three years; their role would not merely be advisory but executive.
The cost estimates include funds for eight years in case an extension of
their services is judged desirable at a later date. In addition, a suitably
qualified company with personnel experienced in up-to-date plantation
management would be appointed by the GOI for the development period to
provide Inspection and Engineering Advisory Services.
Executive Assistants
3.        On appointment one Executive Assistant would be responsible for
rubber operations and a second for oil palm operations. A third Executive
Assistant would be responsible for commercial operations. The Executive
Assistants would reside on the PNP.
4.        Executive Assistants responsible for rubber and oil palm operations
will have had at least eight years practical experience in modern rubber and
oil palm plantation management during the past ten years. It is desirable
that the Executive Assistant responsible for commercial operations should also
have had recent experience in commercial tree crop cultivation, and must have
a financial background connected with agriculture.
Responsibilities
5.        The Executive Assistants responsible for rubber and oil palm
operations would be responsible for all production operations currently the
responsibility of the Production Director. (The post of Production Director



ANNEX 8
Page 2
would remain vacant for the duration of the Executive Assistants' appointmen:s,
and the function of the Production Director would be assumed by the Presiden:
Director). The Executive Assistants would give particular attention to:
-    establishment and maintenance of nurseries and production
of planting material;
-    implementation of planting programs;
-    supervision of all management operations required to bring
immature areas into bearing as quickly and efficiently as
possible;
-    introduction of effective field work controls;
-    implementation and supervision of improved tapping and
harvesti4ng methods;
-    development and implementation of incentive schemes for
estate workers; and
-    introduction of modern technology, importantly the use of
agricultural chemicals and machinery.
The Commercial Director would retain administrative responsibilities consist-
ing of labor relations; legal matters; personnel affairs; public relations;
land titles; administration of head office and related matters. She Executive
Assistant would assume responsibilities for commercial operations and would
give particular attention to:
-    management and financial controls;
-    inventory controls;
-    control of local sales of PNP produce; and
-    internal audit.
6.        The Executive Assistants would assist in the introduction of
improved working records and controls, and incentive payment schemes. They
would participate in budget preparation, based on the Inspectors' recommenda-
tions and directions from the President Director, and in all stages of
procurement, particularly the preparation of specifications and the evalua-
tion of bids. An important function of the Executive Assistants would be
to train PNP X's staff to assume full responsibility for Production and
Commercial operations at the end of the Executive Assistants' appointments.
7.        Unless specifically instructed to the contrary by the President
Director, Executive Assistants would implement recommendations made in the
bi-annual Inspectors' reports. Should the President Director not agree with



ANNEX 8
Page 3
the Inspectors' recommendations, a written report would be sent by the
President DLrector directly and simultaneously to the Board,1/ the GOI and
IDA within 30 days of receiving the Inspectors' recommendations. The
President Director's report would give his reasons for not carrying out the
Inspectors' recommendations and the justification for his alternative
proposals (if any). The Board would decide the action to be taken and
would notify the President Director, OI and IDA promptly. If alternative
instructions are not issued by the Board within 30 days of receiving the
President Director's proposals, the Inspectors' recommendations would be
implemented.
8.        The Executive Assistants would attend Board Meetings whenever
the Production or Commercial Directors attend such meetings and at other
times when requested by the Board. They would also assist the Board and
Management in preparing long-term programs for PNP X.
9.        Monthly reports would be submitted by the Executive Assistants
to the Management on activities under their supervision. These reports would
contain recommendations for action and improvements and would include
comments on the performance of individual estate managers and their subor-
dinates in meeting work targets and budgets. The reports would be sent
directly and simultaneously to the Board, the GOI and IDA.
inspection Services
10.       The inspection team appointed for 8 years would consist of indivi-
duals with not less than 10 years experience in plantation management and
advisory work. They would be supervised by the most senior plantation
executive in the Inspectors' organization and the Inspectors' technical
recommendations would represent the accepted views and policies of their
organization. As soon as possible following their appointment the Inspectors,
working as a team, would examine the physical condition and operating and
technical efficiency of the PNP. Within three months of taking up their
appointment they would report in detail on each estate identifying the major
problems and recommending action to overcome them. They would set priorities
for PNP action and these would be contained together with a summary of their
findings and recommendations, in a consolidated report which would enable
the GOI to monitor and control PNP activities. Unless the Board ruled other-
wise, priorities set by the Inspectors would become specific responsibilities
of the PNP management and Executive Assistants.
11.       Subsequent inspections would take place at about six monthly
intervals. Following these, reports on the physical condition of the
estates would be prepared updating recommendations and priorities and
commenting on budgets, physical results and management performance. The
1/   Pending appointment of Supervisory Boards should this occur, the
Director General would assume the supervisory and policy making
function that would normally be assumed by a Supervisory Board.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
Inspectors would scrutinize annual budgets which would be prepared in
accordance with their recommendations unless the Board ruled otherwise.
Prior to the preparation of the 1974 budget the Inspectors, together with
the Executive Assistants, would assist PNP X with the preparation of a
5-year program of PNP X activities, including cash flow. gubsequently,
the Inspectors would review and revise the 5-year program each year with
PNP X staff.
12.       The Inspection Services would also provide specialists from time
to time to advise on specific problems such as pests, diseases, plant
nutrition, quality control, and budgeting. They would also provide short
intensive courses of instruction within their organization for PNP staff
in certain specialist fields.
13.       In addition to the reports described in paragraphs 9 and 10, the
Inspectors would provide written reports on immature areas planted from 1973
through 1975 on which IDA reimbursement would be based (see Table 1 of this
Annex 10).
Engineering Advisor
14.       An advisor or advisors would be appointed by the Board to assist
the PNP to rehabilitate and expand processing facilities for rubber and palm
oil. The appointment would provide for periodic visits and would involve
about 42 months residence on PNP X over eight years. The engineer would
assist the PNP to improve existing processing facilities for each crop,
participate in budget preparation, and in cooperation with the Inspectors
and Executive Assistants would prepare a long-term program for rehabilitation,
replacement and extension of processing, transportation and general engineering
facilities.

FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
IDA Disbursements Against Local Expenditure
for Rubber and Oil Palm Plantings
1.        Under previous IDA Credits for estates rehabilitation, disburse-
ments were restricted to foreign exchange items. In the proposed project
IDA would reimburse part of the local expenditure for rubber and oil palm
plantings. This would provide a measure of control and should improve
planting standards. The reimbursements would cover initial planting costs
and upkeep and maintenance expenditure to maturity during the 12 months
following planting.
2.        To ensure that plantings have been properly established, IDA
disbursements would only be made 12 to 18 months after planting. Following
an assessment of planting standards by the Inspection Services to be
financed under the Credit (see Annex 8 on Technical Assistance), the
inspectors would provide written reports on the condition of oil palm and
rubber areas planted from 1973 through 1975 (not more than 6,700 ha), on
which IDA disbursements would be based. The first reports would be made 12
to 18 months after initial planting, and would grade rubber trees and oil
palms according to growth, standards of upkeep, and costs in relation to
budgets. Following IDA approval of the reports, disbursements would be made
in accordance with the grading shown in the following table.

3.        Performance standards would be assessed on a 0 to 4 grading system
for various aspects of development.  The assessment would take place not less
than 12 months and not more than 18 months following planting. Grade S
would represent areas of full stand which the inspectors consider would reach
maturity within budgeted costs.  This would be not more than 3 years from
planting in the case of oil palms, and 5-1/2 years from planting in the case
of rubber, providing standards at the time of grading are maintained throughout
immaturity.  Inspectors would be expected to submit for agreement by the GOI,
PNP Board and IDA, a statement of the standards they would apply to grades 0
through 3. A modified grading system of this sort would be suitable for Gov-
ernment assessment of management performance and could be used as the basis
for incentive payment or bonus schemes.

Guidelines for Independent Auditors
1.        The independent auditors should be requested to submit both
short-form and long-form reports.
2.        These reports should be addressed to the Board of Directors and
not to any member of the PNP/ET management.
3.        The following is an example of a short-form  report expected of
the auditors:
"We have examined the balance sheet of PNP/PT as of
December 31, 19--, and the profit and loss account
and related statements for the year then ended.
"Our examination was made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, ard accordingly included
such tests of the accounting records, verification of
assets and liabilities, and such other auditing procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
"In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and profit
and loss account present fairly the financial position of
the PNP/PT at December 31, 19--, and the results of its
operations for the year then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles."
4.        When a qualified opinion is intended by the auditors, the
opinion paragraph of short-form report should be modified in such a way as
to make clear the nature of the qualification. It should refer specifically
to the subject of the qualification and of the effect on the financial
position and results of operations, if reasonably determinable.
5.        Generally accepted auditing standards include, in addition to
adherence to accounting principles which are generally accepted, standards
of preparation, standards of field records, standards of supervision, review,
reporting and disclosure. All of these standards are well-known to public
accountants.
In case generally accepted auditing standards could not be fol-
lowed, the auditors should expressly state so, indicating specifically
the circumstances.  Where there is a failure to observe these standards, the
auditors should refrain from making an overall opinion of the financial
statements submitted.

and managemint practises. Extraction figures for oil and kern3l are based on the axisting factory rasults.
B.   FFB yields appearing in Column B are due to a correctiva fertilizer program based on foliar analysis together witil
improved agricultural standards and ganaral management practises.  Extraction figures for oil and kernel are based
on improved harvesting and rehabilitation of the existing factory
C.   FFB yields app.aring in Column C are those expected from modern planting material used from 1-473 onards assuming
high agricultural and managew3nt standards. Extraction figures for oil and kernel are basad on high harvesting

Market ?rospects for Palm Oil and Palm Kernels
World Oils and Fats Situation
1.        Oils and fats consist of vegetable oils (edible and industrial),
animal fats and marine oils. Improvements in agricultural techniques as
well as in processing and refining techniques have resulted in increased
substitutability of the various oils and fats in the manufacture of end-
products. In addition, the development of synthetic products such as
detergents and synthetic alcohol has offered competition to products (mainly
non-food) containing oils and fats. Thus the complexity of the world market
situation does suggest that competitive pressure on the individual oils
and fats is likely to remain strong.
2.        World production of oils and fats increased at 2.7% yearly during
the 1960's while growth in world consumption was 2.9Z yearly. Although
consumption was in excess of production in 1965 and 1966 - the reverse
position of the 1950's and early 1960's - stocks had reached a relatively
high level by the end of 1968. During 1969 and 1970, stocks were reduced
when world production of several leading vegetable oils was relatively low.
Although there are indications that stocks are rising, the end-1972 level
is expected to remain below the end-1968 level.
3.        During the past decade world exports of oils and fats increased
at 3.7% yearly while the vegetable oil group showed a higher yearly growth
at 4.2%. This expansion in trade could only be absorbed at declining world
prices as shown in the Chart. The level of international prices in 1970 and
during the first half of 1971 was abnormally high because of relatively low
crops in 1969 and 1970 in copra, groundnuts and fish oil and reduced exports
of sunflowerseed oil. World-production of oils and fats in 1971 compared
with 1970 showed the largest increase for a decade - about two million metric
tons. In 1972 total output is expected to increase by one million tons or
2.4% over 1971 due mainly to producer response to high prices for annual
edible oilseed crops, favorable weather after periods of drought and
continuing expansion of areas coming into higher yields (Palm oil and palm
kernels). In contrast, output of industrial oils has been reduced owing to
the sharp fall in linseed production. Because of adequate stocks of linseed
and oil, exportable supplies will be more than adequate to meet expected
demand. This situation is reflected in the downward movement of prices as
shown in Table 3. The level of the Unilever index of major oils and fats
prices by December 1971 had fallen to 99 compared with 120 in July and 115
for the year. The FAO index of edible/soap oils and fats prices showed a
similar trend (see Chart).



ANNEX 16
Page 2
4.        Most important to world trade in oils and fats is the import
demand in the developed countries. They accounted for approximately three-
quarters of world net imports in 1970. Although Western Europe accounted
for 60% of the world total, their rate of growth of import demand has
declined to 2% yearly in the last half of the 1960's compared with 2.5%
in the last half of the 1950's. This decline has been offset by a substantial
increase in Japanese demand (14% of net world import demand by 1970) resulting
in continuing growth in demand in the developed countries. On the other
hand, as prices declined, import demand in the developing countries was
stimulated. Their share of world net imports increased from 13% in 1961-63
to 22% in 1970.
5.        Over the decade of the 1970's world production of oils and fats
's expected to increase at about 3% yearly. This will mean that the rate
of increase in export availabilities by 1980 will accelerate to 4.1% yearly
compared with 3.7% during the 1960's. If this expansion is to be met by an
equally large increase in import demand, mainly in developing countries,
prices would have to move fairly sharply downward from the high levels of
recent years. In the process of achieving equilibrium it is assumed that
price will play an important role. Some downward adjustments in the
production targets of the various development schemes may take place and some
upward adjustments in consumption may be expected.
6.        To sum up, the world oils and fats situation by the mid-1970's and
on to 1980 is expected to be similar to the years 1962 and 1968 when supplies
were plentiful and prices relatively low (Table 3). Because it will be
essential for a number of individual oils to increase their share of the
total oils and fats market by 1975 and onward, prices fairly comparable with
or perhaps somewhat below the 1962 and 1968 levels seem likely.
Palm Oil
7.        Palm oil is produced mainly in Nigeria, Malaysia, Zaire and
Indonesia. These four countries accounted for 75% of the world total in
1970 as shown in Table 1. During the 1960's output of palm oil increased
at 2.7% yearly. In recent years, however, the rate has accelerated and
1972 production is forecast at 2.3 million metric tons compared with 1.8
million metric tons two years earlier. In a number of countries large oil
palm development schemes are in operation while some other areas are in the
process of being opened up for oil palm production.
8.        World production of palm oil in 1980 is expected to amount to 4.3
million metric tons which is considered a conservative estimate. This is
the mid-point of a range from 3.8 to 5.0 million metric tons. The high
alternative assumes that all known planting schemes will be carried out as
currently planned to 1975; the low, that no more plantings will be carried
out in the early seventies. The mid-point figure implies that palm oil
production will increase at 9.3% yearly over the decade of the 1970's
compared with 3.0% for output of total oils and fats. As a result palm
oils' share of total oils and fats production will double from 1970 to 1980.

9.        Assuming that domestic consumption in the producing regions is
1.5 million metric tons by 1980, world export availabilities may amount to
2.8 million metric tons based on the mid-point production. This implies that
palm oil's share of the world oils and fats market will have to increase from
about 6% in 1970 to around 19% by 1980.
10.       The above-mentioned figures and those for palm kernels (para 13)
were prepared by FAO. During the February 1972 session of the Intergovern-
mental Group on Oilseeds, Oils and Fats the world figures, which were based
on individual country information, compiled by FAO were considered at the
meeting. As a result of comments of Governments, they were revised in
mid-April and are included in this paper. FAO also prepared, in collaboration
with various international financing institutions, the amount of oil palm
production generated as a result of international project financing. As of
November 1971, 546 thousand metric tons of palm oil and 132 thousand metric
tons of palm kernels in 1980 may be attributed to this type of project
financing.
11.       The Indonesian oil palm projects 1/ under consideration will
produce 15.8 thousand metric tons and 5.4 thousand metric tons, respectively,
of palm oil in 1980 as a result of Bank financing. The first project's
production will reach its maximum of 38.5 thousand metric tons in 1992.
The latter project will attain maximum output in 1984 of 11.2 thousand metric
tons. Bank Group participation in palm oil projects, already approved,
amounts to production of 317 thousand metric tons by 1980. When these two
projects are added, total production of palm oil generated by Bank financing
amounts to about 338 thousand metric tons. Since most of the projects are
export-oriented, around 12% of the world exports of palm oil in 1980 will
result from Bank financing. A considerable share of the expansion attributed
to Bank financing was included in the national development plans of the
countries concerned. It is quite likely that a high proportion of the 338
thousand metric tons of palm oil would have materialized without Bank
financing.
12.       For the market to absorb this increased level of world palm oil
exports, it is essential that palm oil's share in total usage of oils and
fats increases substantially. This can only be achieved by palm oil being
relatively cheaper than other oils and fats and by exporting countries
providing a steady supply of quality oil. It has been estimated that the
palm oil price will experience a much greater than average decline when
compared with most other vegetable oils and settle around E 68 per long ton
c.i.f. Europe in 1975 through to 1980 compared with E 110 in 1970 and E 72
in 1968 (the peak and trough of a 15-year period).
Palm Kernels
13.       World production of palm kernels in 1980 is expected to amount to
1.46 million metric tons. As noted for palm oil, it is the mid-point of a
low estimate (1.5 million tons) and high estimate (1.8 million tons). To
1/   Fourth Agricultural Estates Project and Smallholder Division Project.



ANNEX 16
Page 4
achieve this figure the rate of growth of production over the decade (1970
to 1980) would be 5.3% yearly whereas from 1960 to 1970 there was an
absolute decline of 90 thousand metric tons as shown in Table 2. Palm
kernel's (in oil equivalent) share of total output of all oils and fats in
1980 will be only 1.4%. The new varieties of oil palm being planted have
a smaller nut and higher proportion of pulp containing the palm oil which
accounts for the more rapid growth in palm oil production than for palm
kernel.
14.       Assuming that world exports of palm kernels continue to account
for about 60% of world output, exports could reach approximately 966 thousand
metric tons (454 thousand tons oil equivalent) in 1980. This irmiplies that
palm kernel oil's share of the total oils and fats market by 1980 may be
about 3.0% compared with 3.6% in 1970.
15.       The two projects under consideration are expected to generate
4.0 thousand metric tons and 1.1 thousand metric tons, respectively, of
palm kernels in 1980. When these figures are added to the amount already
financed, production of kernels in 1980 resulting from Bank financing will
be 82.5 thousand metric tons. Assuming that about 75% of the output is
exported, approximately 7% of world exports of palm kernels in 1980 will be
accounted for by Bank projects.
16.       It is assumed that palm kernel prices will be in line with other
oils and fats prices over the long term. A price of f 50-55 per long ton,
c.i.f. Europe by 1980 seems likely for palm kernels. The 1972 January
average price was E 50 because it had dropped sharply from the unprecedented
high 1970 average level of E 71 under the pressure of the steep price
decline in the copra price. The vegetable oils from palm kernels and copra
are classified as lauric oils since they contain high lathering qualities
and fatty acids which the other edible vegetables do not. However, they are
used mainly for food products and contain a high degree of saturated fat.
Their use in nonfood products (toilet soap and lauric alcohols) has declined
due to competition from synthetics in the last 10 years. It is unlikely
that copra will continue at its recent relatively low price for too long
a period since this price is approaching the level at which there is little
incentive to pick the coconuts unless economies in production costs can be
achieved.

FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
Natural Rubber: Trends and Outlook
1.        Natural rubber is among the most important primary commodities
exported by thie developing countries. Its production, of which only small
amounts are consumed in producing countries, is highly concentrated in
Southeast Asia. More than 90% of natural rubber exports originate in
four Asian countries - Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Ceylon: the first
two alone account for about three quarters of the total trade. The rest
is supplied by some fifteen countries in Asia and Africa, of which India,
Liberia, Nigeria, Khmer Republic and Zaire are significant producers (see
Table 1).
2.        The bulk of natural rubber is used in the manufacture of tires
and other automobile parts. Other uses include surgical applicances,
household goods and toys. Demand for these goods has expanded quite
rapidly in the postwar period, averaging 7% per annum, but the supply of
natural rubber expanded only at an average annual rate of 2.6%. The
deficiency in the elastomer supply was met by the development of synthetic
rubbers, of which the most widely used are styrene-butadiene, poly-butadiene
and poly-isoprene rubbers. Over the years the producers of synthetic rubbers
have not only improved their quality, but have also succeeded in reducing
their costs of production, and as such have come to actively compete with
(and sometimes even displace) natural rubber.
3.        The tardy expansion in natural rubber supplies relative to the
total elastomer supply has naturally led to a decline in the share of the
former in the market. In countries other than those conventionally classed
as centrally planned, this share has declined from 65% in 1950-52 to around
32% in recent years. In the United States, which is foremost in the research
in and production of synthetic rubber, the share has dropped to 23%, while
in most other consuming countries it ranges from 35 to 45%. Some researchers
in the field believe that about a quarter of the elastomer demand, under the
existing technology, is specific to natural rubber, but there is a wide
difference of opinion in this respect.
4.        Natural rubber is particularly threatened by the expansion of
production of poly-isoprene, which is so far the closest (still not a perfect)
synthetic analogue to the natural product. It is generally believed that
poly-isoprene could successfully replace natural rubber under the existing
conditions in the remaining uses, provided it could be produced more
cheaply, and/or the price of RSS1 variety of natural rubber were to exceed
20 cents per pound. While the search for a more economic process for
producing poly-isoprene goes on in the developed and centrally planned
countries, the natural rubber supplies are expected to increase at a
particularly fast rate and it is unlikely that the long-run price of natural
rubber would exceed that limit in the current decade.



ANNEX 17
Page 2
5.        It will be seen from Table 2 that, disregarding enormous yearly
fluctuations, the price of natural rubber has shown a declining trend.
The price has been particularly low in recent years, reaching a level of
18 cents per pound (RSS1, New York) in 1971 as compared to 26 cents in 1969.
The price in recent months has centered around 17 cents, but this low level
is more due to short-run economic factors (e.g., economic recessions, un-
certainty about the U.S. dollar, etc.) than due to the long-run market
forces.
6.        With the development of high yielding clones, the productivity
of rubber lands has been enormously increased. Recent researches in Malaysia
promise yields of 3,000-4,000 pounds per acre (with a possibility of even
reaching 6,000 pounds eventually) as against the current average of 1,200
pounds in that country. Under current cultural practices, yields of up to
2,000 pounds are fairly common in lands planted with the new material. Thus
it is replanting old rubber lands with the high yielding clones that promises
a much more rapid expansion in rubber supplies. 1/
7.        The yields of the existing crop of trees can also be increased
by the use of yield stimulants. Of these Ethrel 2/ is particularly important.
Extensive experiments have been carried out at the Rubber Research Institute
of Malaya and elsewhere to test the long-term effects of Ethrel use.
Although there still exists some conflict of opinion among the researchers,
there is a fair degree of consensus that in the short run the use of Ethrel
will have far-reaching implications from the point of view of rubber output
and the tappers' productivity. Recent experiments have shown that yields
can be increased by 40-100%, particularly if the chemical is applied to
older but well-looked-after trees. In addition, it may make natural rubber
supply more responsive to the short-run market forces, and hence may reduce
the extent of price fluctuations. However, on the negative side, while
Ethrel has the advantage of easy application to the tree, its cost to the
farmer, estimated at about US$13 per acre, is regarded as rather high for
its extensive use by smallholders.
Market Outlook
8.        Table 3 gives the probable course of natural rubber supply and
elastomer demand in the current decade. As a result of extensive replanting
and new planting of rubber areas with the new high yielding clonal material
rubber output has expanded much more rapidly in the last few years than
in the 1950-65 period. Output of natural rubber increased from 2.4 million

of Natural Rubber, EC-179, July 13, 1971.
2/   Ethrel is a brand name for a chemical manufactured by a U.S. Firm.
This chemical when applied to a rubber tree acts as a decoagulant,
whereby it increases the flow of latex from the tree. For details,

ference, July 1970.

metric tens during 1964-66 to 2.6 million tons in 1968 and 2.9 million tons
in the following two years. This rate of expansion is expected to be further
stepped up in the next few years, when, according to the estimates prepared
by the International Rubber Study Group (IRSG), output would reach 3.9
million tons in 1975 and 4.8 million tons in 1980. These estimates exclude
the possible effect of an extensive use of Ethrel, which if successfully
applied, would probably add another 100,000 tons and 500,000 tons respectively
to the supply in the two benchmark years.
9.        The growth in elastomer demand in the current decade has been
estimated on the basis of growth of the industrial activity in the OECD
countries. It has been observed that the growth of industrial output and
the growth of elastomer consumption in major consuming countries, as well
as for the world as a whole, are very closely associated. This is explained
by the fact that the single most important source of demand for elastomers
is the automobile and other transport-related industry, which in turn is
highly correlated with the growth of industrial output.
10.       The results of a regression on 1951-69 data showed that 98% of
the variation in elastomer consumption outside the centrally planned
countries was explained by the growth in industrial production and that, on
an average, 1% increase in industrial production was associated with 1.13%
increase in the demand for elastomers. Similar relationships have been
observed to hold also for certain individual consuming countries, such as
the United States, the EEC and Japan.
11.       The estimates of elastomer demand in 1975 and 1980 in Table 3 are
based on the above-observed relationship between the growth in rubber
consunption and industrial output. On the basis of projections of the
GNP and industrial output in OECD countries, world consumption of elastomers
outside the centrally planned countries is expected to reach a level of 9.2
million metric tons per year by 1975, and 12.2 million tons in 1980. In
addition, according to the IRSG, net imports of natural rubber into the
centrally planned countries are projected to reach 800,000 metric tons in
1975 and 1 million tons in 1980.
12.       In view of the very rapid expansion in natural supplies and
a virtually unchanged rate of growth of elastomer demand, the declining
trend in the share of natural rubber in the rubber market will be arrested:
the share in recent years has remained around 32%, but is expected to rise
to 36% in 1975 and will decline once again to 31% in 1980. The disposal
of large additional supplies in the market would obviously necessitate
maintaining natural rubber prices competitive with the prices of synthetic
substitutes. Broadly speaking, the rubber market seems to be characterized
by the following features:
(a) Supply of natural rubber in the short run is quite
price inelastic. Output cannot be expanded signifi-
cantly because of the limits imposed by the existing
tree capacity. On the other hand, a decline in
rubber price does not result in a significant reduction
in output since resources devoted to rubber production



ANNEX 17
Page 4
are quite "use-specific" and for most producers not many
alternatives are available. Furthermore, where producers
do have a choice to move to more profitable pursuits,
the decline in supply is compensated for by an increase
from intensive tapping by those producers who have no
such alternatives available to them but wish to maintain
their subsistence income from rubber. 1/
(b) Supply of synthetic rubber is highly price elastic.
Not only are the synthetic producers able to respond
to price signals more quickly, as the gestation period
in the industry is relatively short, but also a fairly
substantial excess capacity usually exists in the synthetic
industry. The normal production level is estimated not
to exceed 75% of the rated capacity. 2/
(c) Since almost the entire elastomer demand is in the nature
of derived demand, it is not very price elastic. Leaving
aside speciality rubbers, such as nitrile, there does seem
to exist a fair degree of price competitiveness among
various types of rubber, particularly between poly-isoprene
and natural rubber, though there is not a general consensus
on the actual area of competition. A change in the price
of natural rubber relative to the prices of such substitutes
as styrenebutadiene rubber (SBR), polybutadiene and poly-
isoprene does encourage substitution within certain limits,
but the extent of shift depends also on the length of
time for which the particular trend in the price persists.
Over the long run, the price of natural rubber has to be
such that it competes effectively with the substitutes,
although in the short run it frequently diverges from this
trend.
13.       The implications of these features are that synthetic producers
as a group more readily adjust their supplies to the existing state of
elastomer demand and supply of natural rubber. Natural producers, on the
other hand, manage to dispose of their supplies at a price which is largely
determined by the synthetic producers, although many other factors, such
as market expectations, obviously also influence the state of the market.
According to this model, therefore, the producers of natural rubber behave
as if they were the "price-takers", and it is for this reason that the
price of natural rubber has been projected in this note on the basis of
the expected trends in the costs of production of the main synthetic sub-
stitutes rather than being a result of simple demand and supply forces.
Since data on costs of production are available only in current dollar terms,
an attempt is made to project first the current actual price, and then to
allow for the possible inflationary effect.

ANNEX 17

14.       Since the most important single element of cost of production is
the cost of the basic monomer, the synthetic producers have devoted most
of their research efforts to finding means of reducing its cost. This
has been successfully realized in the past and some further decline in this
element of cost is anticipated in the case of the butadiene-based synthetic
rubbers, that is, polybutadiene and SBR. The status of butadiene is
expected to change from being a product primarily produced for synthetic
rubber conversion to a by-product of another major chemical product,
ethylene. Cost reduction in the raw material input of polyisoprene, which,
as stated above, is the closest synthetic approximaticn to natural rubber
and hence competes most directly with it, may also result from economies
of scale in the manufacture of isoprene. The net effect of such technical
improvements, on the one hand, and the effect of anticipated inflationary
pressures, on the other, is expected to be such that the price of poly-
butadiene would decline to around 15 cents per pound and that of poly-
isoprene to around 18 cents per pound by 1975. Some cost reduction is
expected to take place also in the case of SBR, but the rate of decline
would be considerably smaller than that recorded in the early sixties.
The price of oil-extended SBR is likely to be in the neighborhood of 13
cents per pound.
15.       The price of natural rubber in 1975 is expected to lie somewhere
in the middle of the 15-18 cents range, based on the above-mentioned pros-
pects for polybutadiene and polyisoprene prices. In particular, the price
of polyisoprene will serve as a ceiling, since protracted movements of
natural rubber above that ceiling would lead to an accelerated expansion
of capacity in polyisoprene. The projected price (in current dollars) of
natural rubber is therefore estimated to be around 17 cents (c.i.f. New
York) per pound for RSSI grade in 1975.
16.       The cost of production of synthetics has so far remained con-
spicuously unaffected by the increases in capital and labor costs as well
as by the recent increase in the petroleum price. Since labor costs are
a relatively small portion of cost and since substantial excess capacity
in the synthetic industry is known to exist, it is expected that a moder-
ate rate of inflation in developed countries would affect the forecast
price to a smaller extent than in the case of manufactured goods generally
wiich are expected to rise at an annual rate of 2 percent per annum during
much of the 1970's.
17.       For the period 1975-85 - during which new and replanted natural
rubber installed after 1970 would be maturing - it is assumed that the price
of natural rubber could rise to around 19 cents per pound, given the
anticipated inflation and technical developments in the field of synthetic
rubber. The current excess capacity in the synthetic industry is likely
to be fully utilized by the mid-seventies, thus necessitating installation
of new plants. Labor costs, although small, are continuously rising and
the cost of producing synthetic rubber. Some reduction in cost due to
technical improvements is bound to occur, but on balance the costs are
expected to rise as in the case of other manufactures.



ANNEX 17
Page 6
18.       This price forecast could be substantially altered if some way
of producing polyisoprene more cheaply is discovered. Currently, research
efforts are being made by the industry to adjust the petro-chemical pro-
duction stream so as to derive isoprene, the major raw material input, as
a by-product. The history of success in solving technological problems
in the butadiene-based rubbers suggests that this aim might be achieved
though for the present no such technical breakthrough is in sight.

FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
Notes on Cash Flow and Supporting Statements
1.        The cash flow statements and the supporting tables are prepared
only in respect of oil palm and rubber activities. All other PNP activities,
including Pagaralam tea and diversification pilot projects, are assumed to
be self-financing and that separate financial arrangements will be made
to meet any deficits.
2.        Provision has not been made for annual depreciation of fixed
assets but regular replacements of all fixed assets are included in the
Investment statements.
3.        In ascertaining working capital, allowance has been made for two
months' time lag between production and realization of sales proceeds.
4.        Indonesian income tax that may be levied on profit of foreign
consultancy firms and remuneration of their personnel is estimated at 50%
of the total foreign exchange cost and shown as Contingencies.
5.        It has been assumed that the project would rank for "New Venture"
status and advantage has been taken to "carry forward indefinitely" Initial
Losses (i.e. tax losses from 1973 through 1978).
6.        Interest on retained earnings has been calculated at 12% per annum,
although prevailing deposit rates are significantly higher.
7.        For Government loans an interest-free grace period of 18 years
has been assumed.
8.        Wages element in all expense items except tapping and harvesting
is computed at the 1972 daily basic wage rate of Rp 150 allowing annual
incrc:Lse of 7-1/2% compounded for 1973, 1974 and 1975.
9.        General charges include all overheads and PNP Head Office expendi-
ture. Following PNP practice all General Charges are charged in the
Operating statement 5% of total expenditure is attributed to Tea, and
the balance 95% has been apportioned to Rubber and Oil Palm on the basis
of planted hectarage.
10.       It is anticipated that all oil and kernel produced up to 1975
and thereafter similar quantities rising annually by 3% would be sold in
the local market at prices equal to FOB Pandjang rate. However, to be
coimservative, the entire production from 1973 is treated as exports bringing
in smaller net revenue to the PHIP.

FOURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
Economic Rates of Return and Sensitivitv Analysis
Economic Rate of Return
1.        Economic Rates of return have been calculated both for the
proposed project, and for the long-term oil palm and rubber development
program assuming expansion after 1977. For each of these, economic rates
of return have been calculated separately for the oil palm and rubber
components.
2.        The estimated economic rates of return calculations are shown in
Tables 1 through 4 of this Annex. The assumptions used for the czlfulations
are explained in notes attached to the tables. In summary, the economic
rates of return are as follows:
IDA-Financed Phase
Palm Oil            13.4%
Rubber              28.0%
Combined            18.5%
Overall Program 1/
Palm Oil            15.7%
Rubber              27.2%
Combined            19.3%
3.        The rate of return for rubber is significantly higher than for oil
palm which is largely due to sunk costs; if these are taken into account,
the rate of return for rubber in the IDA-financed phase falls to 18%.
Separate economic rates of return have been calculated for rubber replanting
and rehabilitation of existing rubber. The rates of return are 18% and 35%
respectively. The rubber replanting program consists of small areas on
six estates which would not require any increased management or infrastruc-
ture.
4.        The benefits are based on the selling prices for palm products
and rubber provided by the Bank's Trade Policies and Export Projections
Division (see para 6.06 of the Main Report). Costs are free of identifiable
duties and taxes and excludes the provisions made for price contingencies
in Annexes 18 and 19.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.        A test has been made of the sensitivity of the estimated economic
rates of return to increases and decreases in benefits and costs and the
results are summarized in Table 5 of this Annex.
1/   See paragraphs 4.20 and 7.05.

FOlURTH AGRICULTURAL ESTATES PROJECT
NOTES ON ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN CALCULATIONS
Operating Costs and Benefits - Rubber and Oil Palm
1.        Unit costs used in Operating and Capital expenditure calculations
are those shown in pages 2 through 7 of Annex 18 with the following exceptions:
(a) The contingency provisions for inflation used in the
Financial Statements are excluded.
(b) Export Duties and Cesses are excluded.
2.        Production estimates are based on Planting Program in Annex 4
and Yield Assumptions in Annex 15.
3.        The entire Oil Palm production of the Southern estates around
the proposed new mill at Kedaton is taken as project benefits. In the
case of the Bekri Oil Palm estate, however, only the incremental production
of palm oil and kernel up to 1982 is taken into account. This incremental
production processed by the rehabilitated Bekri factory consists of:
(a) processed produce from incremental crop resulting from
improved agricultural management and fertilizer application;
(b)  entire kernel production resulting from the replacement of
the existing Crackers;
(c) 4% increase in palm oil extraction attributable to the Mill
rehabilitation.
Benefits in (b) and (c) above are excluded after 1982, when the rehabilitated
Mill is replaced by a new one.
4.        All rubber production from new plantings and incremental produc-
tion from existing rubber areas arising from improved management and regular
ferti'lizer applications are taken as project benefits. Improvement in quality
standards of crops processed in existing factories arising from improved
management estimated at 10% net sale proceeds is also regarded as project
benefits.
