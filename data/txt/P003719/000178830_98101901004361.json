The\n            project as appraised was to: rehabilitate 2,000 ha of oil\n            palm and 9,700 ha of rubber; plant 7,400 ha of additional\n            oil palm and 4,000 ha of rubber; rehabilitate existing\n            factories and install new processing capacity; and provide\n            the estate with buildings, vehicles and technical\n            assistance. Palm oil production, despite a reduction in the\n            planting program, was almost 21,000 tons in 1981, against an\n            appraisal estimate of 23,000 tons, while rubber production\n            was over 15,000 tons, as compared with an appraisal forecast\n            of 13,000 tons. Financial results have largely exceeded\n            expectations. An overall cost increase of $14.2 million, was\n            more than offset by higher prices and increased production.\n            Net income (1981 prices) from rubber rose from a loss of Rp\n            333 million in 1971 to an estimated Rp 3,023 million in\n            1982, and net income from palm oil increased from a loss of\n            Rp 51 million in 1971 to Rp 1,851 million in 1982. Local\n            contractors in collaboration with foreign contractors\n            successfully carried out construction of the rubber plants,\n            labor housing and estate civil works."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
