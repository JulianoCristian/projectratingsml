I. Disbursement Profile
1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES, AND DESIGN

1.1 CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL

At the time of appraisal, in July 2010, Bangladesh had experienced a steady long-term
decline in poverty, which had gone hand-in-hand with improving human development
indicators, and the country was making good progress toward achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). Still, poverty remained widespread, and some 47 million
people (31.5 percent of the population) were classified as poor in 2010; of these, 26
million were considered extremely poor. Rural households that were engaged in casual
labor were particularly vulnerable, and their situation was aggravated by recurring natural
disasters and strong seasonal variations in food production—farmers typically face two
lean seasons, one before harvest and another before planting—that rendered them
temporarily unemployed. During these lean seasons many male casual farm laborers
migrate to cities looking for work leaving their families behind. This brings about an
added vulnerability for these temporary female-headed households in rural areas. Female
employment has been traditionally low, and in rural areas it is primarily confined to
unpaid housework.
Bangladesh has a long history of implementing a wide spectrum of social safety net
programs that include both cash and in-kind programs, as part of its social protection
system. Early efforts in social protection were rolled out as emergency relief measures in
response to a cyclone or a famine crisis. These efforts instilled a culture of
experimentation and innovation: the nature of the crisis determined the nature of
instruments. The structure of Bangladesh’s social protection landscape, which consists of
a large number of fragmented food transfer programs, was largely determined by these
initial conditions. Workfare programs have historically been the Government’s main
response to poverty and vulnerability and stems from the need to rebuild community
infrastructure while providing a safety net in the aftermath of the famines and
catastrophic natural disasters Bangladesh faced in the 70s and 80s. Over time some
programs retained their emphasis on infrastructure development, while others focused on
the safety net function.

Building on this tradition of crisis response, the Government introduced a 100-day
Emergency Employment Program in 2008 to cushion the poor against the immediate
impact of rising food prices. Low levels of food stock availability in the Public Food
Distribution System (PFDS) 1 in the wake of the global food crisis prompted the
Government to introduce the country’s first cash based emergency workfare program.
Since 2009 the program underwent multiple iterations of design changes based on rapid
assessments, and eventually evolved into the more permanent Government flagship
Employment Generation Program for the Poorest (EGPP) aimed at providing cash for

 The major safety net programs are food based (Food for Works, Test Relief, Vulnerable Group Feeding,
Vulnerable Group Development) and used to rotate food stocks in the PFDS.

work during the two annual lean seasons, and continued to maintain its primary focus on
its safety net function rather than on building community infrastructure. The willingness
of the Government to evaluate and modify the design of the program provided an
opportunity for the Bank to bring in global best practice on workfare programs through
the IDA-funded EGPP Project. This first major engagement on safety nets was in
response to a Government request to the Bank for financial and technical assistance to
increase the effectiveness of the Government’s EGPP Program,2 which by that time had
lost much of its focus as a public works program and had assumed the informal local
name as ‘Olosh Bhata’ or ‘lazy allowance’. The Project was aligned with the Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period of FY2011–2015, which envisaged
supporting Bangladesh in building up safety nets while emphasizing the needs of women
and the extremely poor.

1.2 ORIGINAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES (PDO) AND KEY INDICATORS

The project development objective (PDO) was to provide short-term employment on
community subprojects to enable households to better cope with vulnerability, while
strengthening program implementation.
The PDO was to be achieved by (i) ensuring that program benefits were targeted at the
poorest areas and households; (ii) improving governance through better transparency and
accountability; and (iii) improving capacity for monitoring and evaluation.
Based on the results framework, the key PDO indicators were associated with short-term
employment. These were (i) the number of individuals participating in short-term
employment created by the program (male/female); and (ii) the number of person-days of
short-term employment generated. Indicators relating to vulnerability were to draw on
results of an Impact Evaluation. A set of Intermediate PDO Indicators were defined for
areas to be strengthened for better program implementation (that is, focus areas – see
below on project description).

1.3 REVISED PDO (AS APPROVED BY ORIGINAL APPROVING AUTHORITY)                                 AND   KEY
INDICATORS, AND REASONS/JUSTIFICATION

The PDO was not revised during project implementation. A level-two restructuring was
approved on May 09, 2014, to retroactively adjust the quantitative milestones for PDO-
indicator 2 (number of person-days of short-term employment generated) for each of the
phases in FY2011–2013, and correcting the end-of-project target (phase 1 of FY2014)
from the initial 60 million person-days per year to 48 million person-days per year. The
adjustment reflected a change in the parameters underlying the number of person-days of
employment: in FY2011, the Program’s daily wage rate was revised upward on par with


2
  The EGPP Program and the EGPP Project are used interchangeably in the text, reflecting the fact that the
Project is an integral part of the public works Program. IDA support to the Program was in the form of
financing wage costs to a maximum of $144.75 million, but not exceeding 70 percent of wages paid, over
the three-year period (2011–2013). Disbursements were linked to results aimed at improving the Program’s
efficiency, accountability and transparency, and were monitored through indicators which applied for the
entire Program.

                                                   14
inflation, which prompted the Government to reduce the number of working days per FY
from 100 to 80 in order to mitigate the effects on the budget. Since this was expected to
occur—and did occur—in subsequent fiscal years, each time affecting the milestones and
target indicators, the Bank team decided that rather than restructuring each time, it would
do so only once towards the end of the project period.3
In addition to the modification in PDO-indicator targets, a quantitative target was
introduced for the each of the PDO indicators (number of individuals participating in
short-term employment and number of person-days of short-term employment) for the
first phase of FY2014, as the original design had not included this possibly due to an
oversight. The new targets were the same as those retroactively adjusted for the previous
fiscal years.

1.4 MAIN BENEFICIARIES

The main beneficiaries of the project were households in extreme poverty. Households
where the household head was a day laborer and the household had less than half an acre
of land were eligible for EGPP jobs. 4 In addition, a minimum of 33 percent of
participating workers under the program were to be women. Secondary beneficiaries
were (i) the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MODMR),5 whose capacity to
oversee program implementation was enhanced at both central and local levels; and (ii)
local authorities—local Upazila (sub-district) and community UP officials—who
benefited from their involvement in the day-to-day implementation of EGPP activities,
notably from the more structured processes that were introduced for the subproject cycle.

1.5 ORIGINAL COMPONENTS

The project had two components: (i) a main program component that helped finance
workers’ wages, with disbursements linked to progress made in three focus areas of
Program reform6 - targeting, governance, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E); and (ii)
an operational support component that financed inputs necessary to achieve the targets in
the three focus areas of the main component.




3
 The initial daily wage rate was BDT 150 (US$1.96), which was raised to BDT 175 (US$2.24) in
FY2011and to BDT 200 (US$2.56) in FY2014.

4
    These two variables are highly correlated with poverty in Bangladesh.

5
  At the time of approval, the implementing ministry was the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management
(MOFDM), which was later reorganized as Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MODMR). At
the same time, the implementing arm, Disaster Management and Relief Division, was reclassified as
Department of Disaster Management. The ICR will refer to the current organizational structure – MODMR.
6
 The focus areas of Program reform were designed to address the challenges and constraints faced by the
sector, as highlighted in the Government’s draft National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction II
(NSAPR II) and also took into account the lessons and experience from the precursor 100-day Employment
Program.

                                                     15
Component 1, the Main Program Component (MPC), had a total estimated cost of
US$492.16 million (IDA US$144.75 million) at appraisal; actual costs were US$470.59
million (IDA US$144.75 million). The component was to finance wage and non-wage
costs of small-scale public works selected by local government and community entities.
IDA financed a little less than a third of the wage costs of the public works schemes.
Disbursement of IDA funds was triggered by progress made on reforms to the overall
EGPP Program in the three focus areas, determined by a schedule of disbursement linked
indicators (DLIs) that applied to each year of implementation. With all disbursement
conditions for a year being met as planned, there were seven disbursements altogether
(corresponding to two lean seasons per year, but only one in the final FY of the project)
over the Project implementation period, financing a share of workers’ wages over
FY2011–2014.7 The DLI schedule is outlined in Annex 10.

The three focus areas of Program reform were as follows:

 Focus area 1: Targeting. The project was to introduce revisions to the existing
targeting system to increase its coverage of very poor households, while reducing
leakages to the non-poor. The targeting system included geographic, household and
gender level targeting. Changes were to be introduced to cut-off points for geographic
targeting which grouped Upazilas into high, moderate, and low extreme-poverty density
and the related formula for allocating project budgets between the three categories. These
changes were to increase the emphasis of spending in the high and moderate extreme-
poverty density Upazilas. At the household level, targeting was to be made more rigorous
by introducing self-targeting through a below-market wage. In addition since
oversubscription for the program was expected, specific criteria for eligibility—the
household head would have to be a day laborer, and the household had to own less than
half an acre of land—was also introduced to help ration the EGPP job cards among the
total eligible population. Finally, the share of women participating in the EGPP was to
progressively increase to 33 percent by the final project year.
 Focus area 2: Governance. The project was to improve program governance by
articulating clearer rules for the Program and introducing greater transparency in its
implementation. Measures were to include public disclosure (at the community level) of
upcoming public works schemes, their budgets, and the beneficiary selection process;
guidelines on the provision of non-wage costs; better payment systems to reduce
fiduciary risk, including payment through banks or other formal financial channels as
well as piloting innovative payment solutions for remote areas and effective worksite
monitoring; effective dissemination of information on any changes to the program; and
enhancing the capacity of MODMR’s field officers by introducing Field Supervisors to
support program implementation, including the provision of training and logistical
support.

 The financing of wages was done retroactively: Government expenditure for these wages was reimbursed
upon verification of DLI achievement through field-level expenditure reports. Reimbursements flowed
directly to the Government’s Consolidated Fund, while financing of Component 2 (Operational Support
Component) was disbursed directly to the implementing Ministry’s Designated Account.

                                                 16
 Focus area 3: Monitoring and evaluation. The project was to refine the monitoring
strategy of the EGPP by developing monitoring capacity in MODMR at the central and
Upazila levels. This would involve the development of a set of standardized summary
indicators and monitoring reports on inputs, outputs, and intermediate outcomes, and
compliance with program rules. To ensure that the data collected on the monitoring
indicators would be available for real-time decision-making, the project was to set up
Management Information System (MIS) at the central and Upazila levels, and provide
related training for key staff. Independent assessments were to be undertaken, including
third-party validation of program targeting and processes. Further quantitative analysis
based on household surveys was to be complemented by qualitative beneficiary
assessments.
Component 2, the Operational Support Component, had an estimated total cost of
US$5.21 million at appraisal; actual costs were also US$5.21 million. It was fully
financed by IDA. This component was to finance activities relating to the focus areas,
including the purchase of hardware and software for the MIS, consultant services,
training and vehicles for field staff, and operating and maintenance costs for the program

1.6 REVISED COMPONENTS

The components were not revised during implementation, although Bank-executed Trust
Funds were introduced and utilized to support the monitoring and evaluation activities
under component 2 by means of third party assessments and verification; and pilot
workplace attendance and payment systems (Section 2.2).

1.7 OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

On October 5, 2011, the Government of Bangladesh requested a change in the geographic
allocation of program resources to provide larger allocations to Upazilas with higher
poverty rates, and reduce allocations in less poor areas. Based on its own assessments of
program performance, attesting to lower enrolment of beneficiaries in lower poverty
areas and a greater propensity for irregularities in such areas, the Bank agreed to the
change. This decision was conveyed to the Government through a management letter
dated January 11, 2012. This change was formalized in the EGPP Program Guidelines,
given that the allocations per work phase were to be made according to these Guidelines.
This minor technical modification was not processed as restructuring as per advice from
the Bank’s legal team. Since then, OPCS and LEG policy has highlighted that any change
in legal agreements requires restructuring, including minor changes.

In light of this guidance, a level two restructuring was approved on November 5, 2013 for
a subsequent change in the geographic resource allocation formula. It included the
revision of the associated DLI target for 2013 which was warranted to maintain
consistency between the EGPP Project and a new IDA-funded Safety Net Systems for the
Poorest (SNSP) Project (approved in June 2013) for which an updated geographic
targeting formula, based on a new national poverty map, had been introduced. A second
level-two restructuring was approved on May 9, 2014 to retroactively adjust the



                                           17
quantitative targets for PDO-level indicator 2 and introduce PDO-level indicator targets
for phase 1 of FY2014. Details of the restructuring are noted in section 1.3.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN, AND QUALITY AT ENTRY

Project preparation. At the time that the project was being considered, the Bank was not
engaged in a lending operation to support safety nets in the country. However, a dialogue
between the MOFDM and the Bank based on analytical work gradually shaped a
common platform that led to the Government’s request for assistance in strengthening the
EGPP Program. In addition to this dialogue, the Bank was also able to draw on the
experience and lessons of the 100 Day Employment Program that preceded the EGPP, as
well as earlier Bank assessments of public works programs in Bangladesh, and on its own
wider international experience in public works schemes. Lessons from the 100 Day
Program that would inform the design of the project included an emphasis on self-
targeting and a concern for ensuring a degree of women’s participation in public works
schemes; the importance of community consultation and awareness raising to increase the
relevance and sense of ownership of subprojects; the importance of well-articulated rules
and guidelines, and accountability arrangements; an accessible payments system,
preferably one that could draw on existing electronic beneficiary databases for payments
through banks; and an effective M&E process to provide a valid evidence-basis for
pursuing the program.
A thorough risk assessment was undertaken, and is detailed in the PAD (pp. 15–16). It
drew attention to a series of institutional risks that might constrain implementation:
oversight arrangements; payment and grievance processes; safeguard and fiduciary
arrangements, especially unfamiliarity with Bank procedures; and human resource
constraints. These risks were addressed in the project design and selectively included in
the DLI framework.
Design. Project design was directly relevant to achieving the immediate objective of
reducing vulnerability among the very poor through the provision of temporary jobs, and
to the more permanent one of building institutions that would strengthen the EGPP
during the project period and beyond. The Project financed part of the Program over a
three-year period, including a share of wages (an estimated 31 percent of the Program’s
wage bill over the Project period), and the cost of necessary technical assistance. Under
the Program (and the Project), each participant had access to two phases of seasonal
employment of 40 days each during the two lean seasons of April-May and October-
November. Participants were required to do physical work on rural community
infrastructure chosen by the local community and local government bodies. To facilitate
women’s participation, works were mainly focused on lighter schemes, often repair and
maintenance of existing infrastructures in close proximity to local communities.
To achieve project objectives, Program reforms were grouped into the three key focus
areas of targeting, governance, and M&E, and a results-based approach was applied, as
expressed in the DLI framework. Annual disbursements from the IDA credit were
contingent on meeting milestones for the relevant year. Performance targets were defined

                                           18
for each focus area, including baselines and annual milestones for each fiscal year (2011–
2013), and detailed in the Data Sheet.
The other key features of design that would determine performance and achievement of
objectives included the following: (i) consistent application of a geographic targeting
mechanism that favored the poorest areas and of household-level poverty indicators that
strongly correlated with extreme poverty and (ii) requirements on women’s participation
through the introduction of minimum quotas. These features were underpinned by (iii) a
payment system for workers’ wages that delinked resource management from payment of
wages, reducing the risk of irregularities in the payment process; (iv) an effective M&E
system that allowed timely adjustment to processes when challenges arose; (v) enhanced
capacity for oversight and management of implementation processes at the central
Ministry and local levels; (vi) a focus on community engagement that would facilitate
reporting on performance; and (vii) the introduction of a 10–20 percent non-wage cost
requirement to broaden the subproject menu from simple earth works and reduce the risk
of wage funds being diverted to non-wage spending. Non-wage subproject costs were to
be financed by the Government.
The MPC, which supported expansion of and reforms to the existing Program through the
three focus areas, was coupled with the OSC, which provided direct support to the
implementing agency for implementation support and capacity strengthening based on
needs. Therefore, the MPC could be viewed as a component that reimbursed the
Government for results, while the OSC was the financing instrument for the inputs
needed to achieve the results indicated in the MPC.
Institutional arrangements consisted of an oversight agency, the MODMR, and a project
implementation team created specifically for the Project. The implementation team
included a project director, a deputy director, and fiduciary, MIS, and training expertise.
Field Supervisors were to be contracted to support the MODMR field officers in
monitoring the Program and supporting its implementation. Sub-district Upazila
committees were given responsibility for program implementation and community-level
UP committees for subprojects. A national steering committee was to be set up to oversee
the work of the implementation team. A grievance redressal system was to be established
to handle complaints, and a database was to be developed for recording, monitoring, and
following up on procurement activities. Third-party validation of compliance with
program guidelines was also introduced. Training on safeguards and fiduciary
requirements was to be provided to central and Upazila-level staff.
The Quality Assurance Group did not review the project for quality at entry.
2.2 IMPLEMENTATION

The Project was rated ‘Satisfactory’ throughout project implementation, and this is
reflected in its overall performance, averaging over 700,000 participants, over 90 percent
of whom were extremely poor, including about 33 percent women, and generating almost
28 million person-days of employment per phase, throughout the Project period.
During implementation, a number of adjustments were made: (i) the geographic targeting
approach was sharpened: early on, it was recognized that targeting results were weaker in
lower poverty areas where potential beneficiaries were fewer, and the allocation formula

                                            19
was adjusted accordingly; (ii) field-level monitoring was strengthened: when capacity
constraints appeared in field-level monitoring and supervision, so-called Labor Leaders
were introduced to support Field Supervisors, with the former chosen from among
participating workers to ensure day-to-day monitoring of individual work sites; (iii)
governance was enhanced: the payment process was adjusted—noting difficulties related
to paying beneficiaries located far from banks, the findings prompted the team to seek
Trust Fund resources8 to finance a worksite attendance and payment pilot for electronic
payment delivery via cash cards and mobile phones—adjustments to the payment process
based on the pilot results are currently being considered in the follow on the SNSP; (iv)
transparency was strengthened: a practice of placing signboards at upcoming worksites
was introduced, informing about the subproject and the number of beneficiaries; (v)
attendance: difficulties in recording attendance, and in particular avoiding ghost workers,
prompted the payments pilot to also focus on linking payments to electronic work
attendance. The pilots not only informed about more effective monitoring of attendance,
and easier payments for all public works programs under the SNSP project, but they have
also informed the design of the payments solution being adopted under the proposed
Income Support Program for the Poorest (P146520) scheduled for Board presentation on
December 16, 2014; (vi) third party monitoring: due to delays in the development of the
MIS, Bank-executed TF resources 9 were used to conduct a qualitative evaluation and
regular spot checks in each phase of the Project to provide feedback on the three focus
areas of expected reforms in the overall EGPP Program. These spot checks were also
used as an independent validation of the DLIs. Beneficiary surveys were included as part
of this third party monitoring exercise and feedback from the surveys is summarized in
Annex 5. Throughout the Project period, concerns were expressed about the danger of
political capture, notably through fraudulent worker rolls with a large presence of ‘ghost
workers’, and collection of informal ‘entry fees’ from the participating workers. However,
the household survey results conducted annually over the course of the project indicated
that this was a diminishing problem as implementation practices became more
established, information about the program more widespread, and local level monitoring
more rigorous.
Implementation encountered challenges mainly in three areas: (i) procurement, with
difficulties related to limited capacity at the national level, and unexpected turnovers in
procurement expertise, and minor mis-procurement; (ii) the timing of work seasons; and
(iii) women’s participation. The first challenge is discussed in the section on Safeguards
and Fiduciary Compliance. The second challenge came to light during the process
evaluations: the EGPP spring season officially covers the months of March and April;
however, administrative lags between the allocation of funds and subproject start-up
would, in some instances, push the start of work into late March or even late April. This

timing of works coincided with the planting season, the rains, or when farm jobs became
available, and earthworks, which were a major feature of many public works schemes,
could not be undertaken. A partial solution was found by increasing the work program
from five to six days per week to finish works earlier and allow workers to seek jobs
during the active farming season. However, the team recognized that a longer term
solution had to do with managing local level politicians who had consistently attempted
to capture program implementation and cause delays in the starting of the public works.
These discussions are part of the ongoing dialogue with the Government under the SNSP.
The third challenge, women’s participation, was addressed through subproject designs
that required lighter workloads – essentially repair and maintenance works – in close by
locations. This also offered opportunities to other physically less-able members of the
labor force.
Toward the end of Project implementation, geographic targeting formulas were adjusted
at the Government’s request, following updated poverty mapping. The adjustment also
brought consistency to the formulas in the EGPP and the SNSP.

2.3 MONITORING         AND    EVALUATION (M&E) DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION,                         AND
UTILIZATION

M&E design. The project was to use the MODMR’s regular program monitoring system,
appropriately streamlined under the Project’s focus area 3 to include a set of standardized
indicators and monitoring reports that would facilitate data collection, reporting, and real-
time decision-making. A new element was to be the introduction of a digitized MIS at the
Upazila level, as well as connectivity that would allow information to be transferred
electronically from local levels to the center. This was to be complemented by
independent third-party validation of program processes, including spot checks and
impact evaluations to determine the effectiveness of targeting and the effects of the
program on household incomes and coping strategies in response to shocks. Qualitative
assessments were also to be undertaken to seek beneficiary views on how well the
program was working. The M&E design was likely to provide adequate information to
monitor progress toward the PDO.
M&E implementation. Contrary to expectations, data collection and reporting did not
benefit from the new MIS, which was put in place only toward the end of the project due
to delays in the procurement process. Instead, the regular program monitoring system was
used, appropriately streamlined with redesigned monitoring forms and reports to facilitate
monitoring of inputs, outputs, intermediate outcomes, and compliance with program
guidelines. It was complemented with third-party validations (including qualitative
assessments, spot checks, process evaluations and beneficiary focus group discussions)
that were implemented at each phase, and analysis from three household surveys – a 2010
baseline, a 2011 midline and a 2012 endline survey.10



10
  These surveys were supported by the following Trust Fund resources: US$200,000 from the Trust Fund
for Environmentally & Socially Sustainable Development (TFESSD 097673) and US$50,000 from Gender
Trust Funds (GEN-TF098475).

                                                21
M&E utilization. The information flowing out of the M&E system was a key input in
adjusting design during implementation, and in developing the design for the follow-up
SNSP project. Feedback processes generated changes that are indicated in the section on
Implementation. For instance, the regular spot checks as well as the household surveys
found that beneficiaries were only utilizing their EGPP bank accounts to receive
payments, and were not aware that these were proper checking and saving accounts. A
decision was then made to require a small portion of their wages to be retained as savings.
This change in design increased the interest of beneficiaries in ‘owning’ their EGPP bank
accounts. The introduction of worksite supervisors or ‘Labor Leaders’ and increasing the
authority of the Field Supervisors hired under the Project were all small design changes,
introduced as a result of the assessments, which had a large impact in the implementation
of the overall EGPP program. The adjusted M&E implementation plan was also critical
in underpinning the assessment of PDO achievement by the Project, as well as
disbursement decisions relating to the DLIs. Both the survey analysis as well as the
regular third party monitoring proved to be particularly useful in measuring, monitoring,
and verifying results and, as highlighted earlier, informing and motivating relevant
adjustments to Program design. In addition, the team utilized results from additional
survey based evaluations conducted by IFPRI, one in August 2011 and a second one in
August 2012. The timing of these surveys was fortuitously in the same periods as that of
the Bank’s midline and endline surveys, thereby allowing the Bank team to triangulate
the results coming from three sets of analysis.11 The Bank team noted that the three sets
of assessments were consistently pointing to four results: (i) the self-targeting feature of
the Program was working well, and the EGPP was among the best targeted program
among all of the major safety nets; (ii) leakage in benefit amount had reduced; (iii) a third
of the Program participants were women; and (iv) a change in the branding of the
Program had occurred at the community level from being previously known as ‘lazy
allowance’ (Olosh bhata) to ’40-day employment program’ (Chollish diner kormo
shuchi). The 2011 IFPRI evaluation was commissioned by the Government and its
positive feedback on the performance of the EGPP prompted the Government to increase
its allocation in FY13 from BDT 1000 billion to BDT 1200 billion (the highest increase
received among all of the 95 programs under the social protection budget). Subsequently,
the program allocation has increased to BDT1400 billion in FY14 and is currently
proposed as BDT 1500 billion in FY15.
2.4 SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE

Safeguards. The project triggered safeguard policies on the environment, involuntary
resettlement and indigenous peoples.
a) Environment. The majority of the EGPP’s approximately 37,000 small-scale
subprojects were earthworks, and environmental issues were likely to be minor. However,
the Bank’s Operational Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) was triggered,



11
  A workshop with key stakeholders from the Government, development partners, media, research think
tanks and NGOs was held by the Bank team on September 25, 2013.


                                                 22
and the project was identified as category ‘B’. The implementing agency already had an
Environmental Management Framework (EMF) with screening tools, procedures for
mitigating potentially adverse impacts, a monitoring mechanism, and procedures for
disclosure. All subprojects were subject to a prior environmental screening. The project’s
independent third-party assessments included a brief environmental audit.
b) Involuntary resettlement and Indigenous Peoples. No private land acquisition or
large-scale displacement was expected under the program. However, the safeguards
policy on involuntary resettlement (OP4.12) was triggered, as was the safeguards policy
for Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10). A Social Management Framework was developed,
including a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and an Indigenous Peoples Planning
Framework (IPPF). There were no deviations or waivers from the Bank’s safeguard
policies, nor did any issues arise during implementation.
Financial management (FM). A financial management assessment of the EGPP was
carried out during project preparation in accordance with OP/BP 10.02. While it
determined the project’s FM risk as substantial, it noted that important mitigating
measures were incorporated into project design, and that existing FM arrangements could
be maintained for the project. Overall, financial performance was ‘Satisfactory’, albeit
moderated by delays in the timeliness of disbursements under component 2 and reporting
on spending on both components. For the external audit, the program’s financial
statements (wages and operational support) were audited annually by the Comptroller and
Auditor General of Bangladesh. Audit reports signaled no material weaknesses, although
the audited financial statements for FYs 2011 and 2012 initially remained beyond audit
assurance in the absence of an audit of expenditures under component 1. This component,
which was being executed under a revenue budget program, fell outside the scope of the
auditor’s remit. The outstanding issues were in the process of being resolved during the
preparation of the ICR.
Procurement. Project design had envisaged including procurement expertise to support
the implementation team, but rapid turnover of procurement specialists—three during
implementation—delayed contracting of goods and services. This particularly affected
the contracting of an IT firm to develop MIS software, and delayed a DLI—efficient
record-keeping mechanism—which required that testing of the MIS be completed. The
testing was subsequently completed and funds were disbursed. Mis-procurement did arise
in FY2012 on three contracts totaling US$17,450. This was discovered during a post-
review conducted in FY2014 (report was finalized in June 2014) and the Government
was informed in July 2014. Another two contracts, one in FY2012 and another in
FY2013, totaling US$10,527, were also found to have been mis-procured. As all
contracts had already been issued and the project closing day elapsed, the respective
funds were cancelled. These funds are in process of being returned to the Bank.

2.5 POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE

The EGPP Project introduced new and innovative processes into safety net design, which
had a significant impact on efficiency and effectiveness with which the overall EGPP
Program was being implemented, and that are reflected in the results (see Assessment of
Objectives below). This was the case in all three focus areas: the introduction of a

                                           23
rigorous targeting methodology, and increased transparency in selection and payment of
participants, underpinned by improved monitoring and evaluation, including in particular
continuous third party evaluation of processes. Encouraged by the performance of the
EGPP, the Government is introducing these elements into other ongoing public safety net
programs in the country, while it is embarking on a broad effort to raise the performance
of the system as a whole. It is also committed to developing a national poverty database
with the intention of gradually adopting proxy means-testing to further improve the
targeting efficiency of safety net programs. Such developments are also expected to
encourage other sectors to introduce similar reforms. The success of the EGPP Project
has also deepened the Bank’s engagement in this new phase of safety net development.
The SNSP, approved in June 2013, is helping to strengthen the analytical and institutional
base of major safety net programs, drawing on lessons learned in the EGPP Project.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION

The overall relevance of the Project is satisfactory.
Relevance of objectives. The PDO was highly relevant to the Government’s poverty
reduction strategy and the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) at project approval,
and remains so today. It supports the Government’s aim of developing a coherent social
protection system, where an effective public works component is expected to provide a
versatile safety net instrument, in particular one that can be flexibly applied to address
seasonal vulnerabilities that are part and parcel of rural life in Bangladesh. It is aligned
with the Bank’s social protection strategy in Bangladesh, which seeks to harmonize and
increase effectiveness of a diverse set of safety net instruments with a particular focus on
moving from food based to cash based instruments that over time would broaden and
deepen coverage of the poor. A direct focus area of Strategic Objective 1.3 in the CAS
(FY2011–15) is strengthening the social protection system to reduce vulnerability.
Relevance of design. Project design was consistent with the development objective. It
utilized a cash-based workfare program to provide short-term employment on rural
community infrastructure projects to help very poor households cope during the annual
lean seasons. The lighter workload of the projects (that is, primarily maintenance work of
small roads and bridges) and their proximity to local communities enabled female
participation and, more generally, participation from members of the community who
otherwise might not, for physical reasons, have been able to migrate to cities during lean
seasons as is customary in many parts of the country.. A particular focus on self-targeting
and governance sought to ensure that wages primarily reached the intended extremely
poor beneficiaries, and that female and male participants received the same wage rate. A
rigorous M&E system, including third-party assessments, provided the necessary
elements to strengthen project design during implementation.
The introduction of results-based lending through rigorously applied DLIs provided a
unifying framework that facilitated implementation. The joint formulation of indicators,
targets, and protocols created common ground for recognizing the importance of shaping
a path for reform in program design that could be defined, implemented and monitored,

                                            24
and is results-oriented. Furthermore, supporting the results-based component with
technical assistance allowed for effective implementation by strengthening capacity and
providing the means for achieving results. This proved particularly valuable in
strengthening government and implementing agency buy-in, underlining the importance
of recognizing capacity constraints and institutional weaknesses, and fine-tuning
implementation accordingly.
The results framework did not include indicators on changes in households’ ability to
cope with vulnerability, an outcome which was considered too complex to be measured
by one or two indicators. Instead, household surveys were introduced to measure the
well-being of participating households, which allowed assessments of whether the Project
indeed was able to target the eligible vulnerable populations. Ensuring employment
during lean seasons was provided and that wages did reach beneficiaries would imply
that the Project objective of reducing vulnerability was achieved as designed (section
3.2). A set of intermediate outcome indicators were associated with strengthening
program implementation, addressing three focus areas for intervention (described in
section 1.5). In addition, a set of DLIs—mostly milestones for achievements over time—
was used to incentivize results-based project implementation of component 1.
Relevance of implementation. Implementation was relevant. The project was responsive
to changing needs – as reflected through two restructurings conducted to accommodate a
sharper focus on poverty targeting and ensuring that wages were being adjusted for rising
inflation to help maintain the adequacy of the transfer – and remained important to
achieving country and Bank objectives on poverty reduction. Third-party process
monitoring was also able to flag issues early and facilitated the introduction of
incremental improvements in program design throughout implementation. That, and the
measures that already had been introduced during Project design to address institutional
risks, proved largely sufficient to allow smooth execution.

3.2 ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

The project objective - [to provide] short-term employment to reduce household
vulnerability while strengthening program implementation— had three sub-objectives: (i)
provide short-term employment; (ii) reduce household vulnerability; and (iii) strengthen
program implementation. All three sub-objectives were achieved.
Sub-objective 1: provide short-term employment. The short-term employment
objective was met. On average, over 700,000 individuals participated in each of the seven
phases of the works (against an original target of 600,000 per phase), for a total of 3.02
million participants (an individual could only participate in two phases) with a total of
195 million person-days of employment generated over the Project period. The revised
annual target of generating 48 million person-days of employment was met and exceeded.
Of these, 33 percent of participants were women.
Sub-objective 2: reduce household vulnerability. The reduction in household
vulnerability was met, albeit with some shortcomings in measurement of results. On
average, over 90 percent of beneficiaries came from households that met the
characteristics for ‘extremely poor’, exceeding the 80 percent target. There was also a
low level of leakage, with beneficiaries receiving some 97 percent of the value of their

                                           25
entitled payments. 12 That participation in the EGPP helped to provide an additional
source of income during the lean seasons indicated that there was a reduction in
household vulnerability during those periods. Analysis based on the household surveys
also showed significant differences in household consumption between the EGPP and
non-EGPP households,13 the cross-sectional nature of the surveys suggest caveats to these
results as the analyses are not able to control for unobservable factors that could explain
the differences between the two groups.
Sub-objective 3: strengthen program implementation. The strengthening of program
implementation was successful. It was strengthened through incremental actions in the
three focus areas of targeting, governance, and monitoring and evaluation. Milestones
and targets had been defined in the DLI framework (Annex 10), which also served as a
means of monitoring progress on reforms. As indicated above in section 2.1 on Design,
annual IDA disbursements were triggered by meeting the milestones. By the end of the
Project, all the targets had been met according to schedule without interruptions in
disbursements. Likewise, all targets for each of the focus areas had been achieved, with
the exception of one, relating to signboards and publicly available beneficiary lists at
work sites, which was 96 percent achieved. Moreover, the Project produced spillover
effects by leveraging IDA financing of less than one-third of Program costs to generate
reform and efficiencies across the entire Program.

Achievement on the focus areas was as follows:

a) Targeting.

       i.   Geographic targeting. To strengthen geographic targeting, program guidelines
            had been adjusted to favor Upazilas with extreme poverty rates of 35 percent
            and over. The percentage of wage costs allocated to such Upazilas had
            exceeded the target of 45 percent of resources allocated in each of the three
            full fiscal years 2011-2013, achieving 55 percent, 60 percent and 60 percent,
            respectively. For phase 1 of fiscal year 2014 (the last phase under the project),
            45 percent of extremely poor Upazilas had been reached.

      ii.   Household targeting. Household targeting had been strengthened with the
            introduction of eligibility criteria that households should own less than 0.5


12
  In a country where leakage rates can be as high as 14 percent, this is a favorable outcome. However,
there were regional variations, with some areas having consistently higher leakage. The payments pilot
focused on one such area to determine underlying factors, finding that leakage was largely driven by
political capture of the program. This challenge is currently being addressed under the SNSP through
increased use of technology in program administration, which is expected to insulate program
implementation from local politics.

13
  Male-headed EGPP households had a significantly larger level of non-food expenditure than non-EGPP
households, drawing on the analysis used in the baseline survey; while female-headed EGPP households
had a significantly larger level of non-food expenditure than non-EGPP households when the data from the
endline survey is used.


                                                  26
           acres of land and the household head be engaged in manual labor. The target
           of 80 percent of beneficiary households meeting these criteria was exceeded
           in each full project fiscal year and in the first phase of fiscal year 2014,
           meeting 90 percent and 95 percent, respectively, of the land and labor criteria
           in FY2011; 83 percent for both in FY2012; 90 percent and 84 percent,
           respectively, in FY2013; and 94 percent and 100 percent, respectively, for the
           first phase of FY2014.

    iii.   Gender targeting. The target of at least 33 percent of the EGPP participants
           being women by the end of the Project was exceeded, with the share of
           women at 36 percent.

b) Governance.

      i.   To improve public disclosure at the community level of the details of
           workfare schemes, signboards and publicly available beneficiary lists were to
           be set up for at least 75 percent of subprojects. The target was partially met, as
           such information was provided in 72 percent of cases. In some locations,
           signboards caught on only slowly, but once they did do so, they were viewed
           favorably by the communities.

     ii.   To strengthen the wage payment mechanism, including reducing leakage and
           improving the timeliness of payments, a target was set to transfer 95 percent
           of all wage payments through formal financial channels by the end of the
           Project. At Project closing, all wage payments were being made through
           formal financial channels. This contributed to a significant reduction in
           leakage, including the use of ghost workers (as determined by third party field
           audits). The introduction of a defined share of non-wage costs also reduced
           the incentives for leakage. During implementation, a pilot was also introduced
           to explore means of improving financial access in remote locations, using cash
           cards and mobile phones. Initial results of the pilot indicate that the new
           mechanisms that were being tested were an improvement, based on
           beneficiary interviews. Grievance redressal systems were introduced and
           functional in all Upazilas.

    iii.   Strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation system contributed to stronger
           governance by providing greater transparency to the overall process.

c) Monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation capacity was successfully
   built up to provide the information necessary for targeting and governance elements,
   and more broadly the results-based system with DLIs, to be successfully implemented.
   The management information system that initially was to be the key to real-time
   decision-making was delayed and put in place only towards the end of the Project.
   Consequently, by the end of the Project, 82 percent of Upazilas had set up an
   electronic beneficiary database, instead of the targeted 100 percent. Instead, available
   monitoring mechanisms were adapted to accommodate information needs, and
   subprojects were strengthened with field level and worksite monitors. Field-level

                                            27
   monitoring was further complemented by third party validation of program processes
   related to the three focus areas of the DLIs. To support sub-objective 2, annual
   household surveys were conducted, feeding into the Project’s Impact Evaluation.

3.3 EFFICIENCY

The overall efficiency of the project is rated satisfactory.

The economic analysis in the PAD presented conservative estimates of the cost
effectiveness of the Program. It also noted that the fiscal impact of the EGPP was
consistent with the fiscal costs of safety net programs in countries with comparable levels
of income, including other countries in the region. The ICR applies a cost-effectiveness
analysis similar to the PAD, and compares the results of the two. Due to the different
nature of the EGPP Program and its predecessor, the 100-day Employment Generation
Program, in particular, when it comes to targeting criteria and consequently the
beneficiary pool, cost effectiveness comparisons were not made between that Program
and the EGPP. The analysis in the PAD and the ICR quantifies the impact of the EGPP
on poverty and estimates how cost-effective the workfare program is in raising incomes
of the poor when compared to a counterfactual program where each household receives a
uniform transfer. The analysis is detailed in Annex 3.

In a conservative scenario, the cost-effectiveness ratio is between 0.38–0.45, without
including any indirect effects from community assets. Estimates have also been made on
the assumption of a modest impact on well-being as a result of the works, resulting in
cost effectiveness ratios of between 0.76 and 0.83. Both sets of estimates exceed the
poverty rate of the population (0.32), and consequently, it can be concluded that the
Program is a more cost-effective mechanism for reaching the poor than the counterfactual
of a transfer to all households. The cost-effectiveness ratio compares with estimates
ranging from 0.33 to 0.38 and 0.63 to 0.76, respectively, in the PAD.

In addition the EGPP is fiscally sustainable. The Program absorbs 12 percent of the
government budget for social protection, which in turn claims a 14 percent share of the
overall government budget (2013). The project generates no apparent additional fiscal
commitments apart from those generated by future increases in the wage rate, which can
be expected to keep pace with inflation. The country’s macroeconomic outlook is
expected to be able to cope with any additional commitments.

3.4 JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING

Rating before restructuring: Satisfactory
Rating after restructuring: Satisfactory
Overall rating: Satisfactory
Based on the disbursement-weighted rating to take into account the revision in the PDO
indicator target (see Table 1), the achievement of project objectives is rated
‘Satisfactory’.

This rating reflects the successful implementation of the Project, its strategic relevance,
and innovative nature, as described in sections 3.1 and 3.2. The Project objectives were in
line with the Government’s national social protection strategy and the Bank’s CAS for
Bangladesh. The design focused on reducing the vulnerability of the extremely poor
during lean seasons of the year, while introducing innovations into key processes –
targeting, encouraging female participation, reducing leakages and political capture, and
improving monitoring and evaluation. These are being drawn on as the Government (and
the Bank) expands reforms into other areas of social protection. In most instances,
innovations in design resulted in improved outcomes and improved efficiency, as noted
in sections 3.2 and 3.3. Some challenges were encountered, as reflected in two
restructurings to accommodate a sharper poverty targeting and the effects of inflation on
wages; and in technical adjustments in processes during implementation. Shortcomings
were observed in the methodology for the household surveys, which gives some
uncertainty to the achievement of the vulnerability objective; and in the results
framework, where PDO indicators were included only for the first sub-objective – short-
term employment.
3.5 OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES, AND IMPACTS

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty impact. The project had a strong focus on the very poor, limiting mis-targeting
to an estimated 2.8 percent of beneficiaries, the leakages essentially reflecting the
recording of ghost workers on a few work sites. These are expected to be better-
controlled as the lessons of the pilot on worker attendance begin to be applied in the
follow on SNSP. The effect on the well-being of families was significant, as wages
provided income to those least likely to have sources of income during the lean seasons.
External reviews indicated that participating households displayed significantly higher
consumption during lean periods than comparator groups.

                                            29
Gender and social development. As a workfare safety net program that focused on
small-scale maintenance and repair, the EGPP was successful in extending coverage to
segments of the labor force that had earlier tended to be marginalized in works schemes,
including women. Female participation exceeded the project target of 33 percent during
the implementation period, albeit with significant variation by location. Participation was
particularly low in wealthier communities and more conservative ones.

In practice, the EGPP has evolved into a flagship safety net program for the Government.
According to third-party assessments, it is strongly entrenched in local community life,
with lean-season interventions keenly awaited by the most vulnerable among the rural
poor.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project brought about significant institutional and process changes as discussed in
section 2. They are being retained and strengthened, including under the SNSP project. In
addition, as noted in section 3.2, the Project triggered institutional strengthening
measures which positively affected the entire Program.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)

Guidelines for subproject design emphasized relatively simple interventions with lighter
workload demands, for example, workfare schemes with a greater than usual emphasis on
repairs and maintenance. This encouraged women’s participation, and it also made it
easier to draw in other more fragile segments of the labor force that under other
circumstances might have been marginalized in works schemes. Moreover, the emphasis
on repairs and maintenance also came to include rural infrastructure needs that otherwise
were likely to be bypassed because of their modest size.

Administrative lags at the district level between the approval and start of works would
often postpone the start of works into the harvesting season, when the EGPP beneficiaries
normally sought job opportunities. In addition, the rainy season made it difficult to do
earthworks, which were a major type of work under the project. As indicated in section
2.2, this was partly solved by extending the work week from five to six days in
anticipation of harvesting.

3.6 SUMMARY      OF   FINDINGS    OF   BENEFICIARY SURVEY         AND/OR    STAKEHOLDER
WORKSHOPS

Focus group discussions were carried out with beneficiaries as part of third party
assessment activities and a summary has been provided in Annex 5. Overall findings
indicate there was sufficient information provided regarding the Program preceding each
phase, albeit from various sources, ranging from the local political administration to the
sub-district Upazila administrative officers; the majority of the beneficiaries stated that
the subprojects comprised useful activities that benefit the general population of the area,
and almost all beneficiaries appreciated the use of Labor Leaders, who were invaluable in

                                            30
providing information and supervisory support. Areas that required further strengthening
included the need for increased publicity measures during beneficiary selection;
providing more awareness on grievance redress procedures and addressing the difficulties
associated with high cost and time incurred in traveling to the bank, particularly for those
beneficiaries who were more remotely located. These issues were taken on board both
during the implementation of the Project as well as in informing the preparation of the
SNSP.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
Rating: Moderate

The PAD rated the risk to the development outcome achievement as ‘Substantial’, based
on low program-implementation capacity, notably with regard to targeting and benefits
payment; and lack of experience in working with the Bank. It did not flag policy
shortcomings as a risk.
The risk to the sustainability of the project achievements after EGPP project closing is
moderate. While a program like the EGPP will always depend on political will and
adequate resources being made available through the Government budget, it is likely that
the EGPP will continue to have strong Government support. It is already deemed a
flagship program for the Government, and this is reflected in the fact that increased
budget resources were allocated to it throughout Project implementation, amounting to an
overall 40 percent increase over the Project period.

Still, there is some risk attached as the country moves forward in its efforts to harmonize
social protection programs, including through the SNSP. While implementation of the
EGPP Project was administered from a Project Implementation Office in MODMR, the
continued Program implementation was mainstreamed under MODMR’s regular
implementing arm – the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) – following the
close of the project in December 2013. The DDM is also responsible for implementing
four other safety nets and the expanded responsibility of EGPP implementation may put a
strain on its resources, although one year into the implementation of SNSP, there is little
indication of this risk.

5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 BANK PERFORMANCE

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team brought a wealth of international experience in reforming safety net
programs, including public works schemes, and it drew on lessons from the 100-day
Employment Program that had preceded the EGPP. Working closely with the
Government on developing the results framework and defining the DLIs, it shaped a

                                            31
Project that was strategically relevant in focusing on both immediate relief and institution
building, with a design that addressed key challenges with broad application to better
safety net performance generally – improved targeting, better governance, and rigorous
monitoring and evaluation. Emphasis was placed on smoothing incomes for extremely
poor households and on facilitating women’s access to the Program through its design
features and by introducing quotas; and it engaged communities in the process by giving
them a role in beneficiary selection and subproject choice. M&E mechanisms allowed
‘learning-by-doing’ and incremental improvements to cope with teething problems as
new processes were introduced. While risk was initially assessed as being substantial,
mitigating measures were introduced during implementation, which, in most instances,
were successful. Local implementation capacity was to some extent overestimated, and
had to be strengthened during implementation; and more weight would have to be given
to non-wage costs to avoid leakages from wage funds. Moreover, no outcome indicators
were included to underpin the PDO outcomes beyond ones for temporary job creation;
and an inadvertent omission was the initial absence of targets for FY2014 in the original
results framework. Finally, the methodology for the household surveys could have been
more closely considered early on. Instead, it now lends some uncertainty to achievement
of addressing the vulnerability sub-objective.
(b) Quality of Supervision (Including Fiduciary and Safeguards Policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

A field-based Bank team that combined solid technical skills and policy understanding
provided continuous monitoring of project implementation, as well as undertaking formal
supervision missions. Timely interventions ensured that IDA disbursements took place on
schedule, and that the Project was completed on time with satisfactory results. The
robustness of the reforms and strengthened institutional features that were introduced
under the Project, as indicated in section 3.2, ensured that these could credibly begin to
be applied in the broader reform of the social protection system on which the
Government was embarking. The supervision team was able to quickly engage with the
Government to address challenges when they arose: adjusting geographic targeting
weights to emphasize poorer Upazilas; removing bottlenecks in field-level monitoring of
work sites before they threatened work programs and wage payments; recognizing the
need for better payment mechanisms for remotely located workers, and better work
attendance monitoring, and initiating pilots to find solutions to these issues; promoting
the use of signboards to inform about worksites and eligible workers; and introducing the
missing quantitative targets for the first phase of FY2014. When faced with unexpected
delays in setting up the MIS for the Program (see section 2.4 on Procurement), the team
found alternative solutions, drawing on existing, streamlined, information mechanisms.
Otherwise, fiduciary and safeguard policies were correctly applied. While the level-two
restructuring (section 1.3) could have been undertaken earlier, or each time, as necessary,
the decision to postpone formal restructuring towards the end of the Project, was a
pragmatic one. The one concern regarding supervision performance relates to the
household surveys, where concerns with the methodology might have been tackled at the
latest during implementation. While the quality of supervision might justify a highly
satisfactory rating, the ICR nevertheless conservatively rates it satisfactory.

                                            32
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Taking into account the ratings of satisfactory on both ensuring quality at entry and
supervision, overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.
5.2 BORROWER PERFORMANCE

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Government, as the financial authority and policy-making body, had already taken
full ownership of the Program prior to seeking Bank assistance for improving it, and
remained fully committed to it throughout implementation. By displaying a high level of
policy engagement, involving in particular the Ministries of Finance and of Food and
Disaster Management 14 (the latter would also house the project management team), it
facilitated continuous improvements in operations, including strengthening the Program’s
poverty focus, and saw to it that adequate budget resources were available while at the
same time ensuring that the Program would remain within a reasonable budget envelope.
The latter is illustrated by the reduction in the scope of the Program early on (from 100
days to 80 days) to ensure its fiscal feasibility. The Government demonstrated
commendable foresight to see the EGPP Project as a stepping stone to broader reform in
social protection. The engagement with the Bank was therefore not only a financial one,
but also a means of seeking technical support for systemic social protection reforms. The
level of commitment continued through three government changes, none of which
adversely affected Program implementation, and is evidenced through the increased
budget allocation to the Program over the course of implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The MODMR implemented the Project through the Office of the EGPP Project Director,
which was supported by a project implementation team with the necessary fiduciary
expertise and technical skills to undertake implementation. The team was able to monitor
implementation, and it collaborated well with the Bank team in reacting in a timely
manner to field-level challenges as signaled through the monitoring and evaluation
processes. It was able to maintain a full contingent of Field Supervisors despite
resignations, especially towards the end of the Project; and it initiated workshops to
disseminate learnings on the Project for field level officials and other line ministries’ staff.

                                                 33
It did however generate minor instances of mis-procurement and encounter difficulties in
larger procurement, in particular, contracting for the MIS, primarily due to the gaps
created by the rapid turnover in procurement expertise, which would threaten
disbursement of IDA funds and the effectiveness of information flows. This was
managed through intensive proactivity on the part of the project team to facilitate MIS
development once contracting issues had been resolved and allowed for the achievement
of all DLI targets and full disbursement under component 1.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Taking into account the ratings of Highly Satisfactory on the part of the Government and
Satisfactory on the part of the Implementing Agency, overall Borrower performance is
rated satisfactory.

6. LESSONS LEARNED (BOTH PROJECT-SPECIFIC AND OF WIDE
GENERAL APPLICATION)

Strategic entry point and focused program. The EGPP Project served as a strategic entry
point for the Bank on its policy dialogue in the social protection arena and, by enabling
incremental and positive changes to the Program, it led to strong collaboration between
the Bank and the Government and established the Bank as a credible partner in bringing
relevant international good practice in building sound social protection systems in
Bangladesh. This has resulted in a longer term programmatic engagement and continued
dialogue on improving the design, implementation and monitoring of safety net
programs. As such, it was important to keep the overall program simple and focused on a
few critical reforms. The instrument design – with DLI financing to leverage policy
changes and technical assistance to motivate institutions to implement policies – proved
to be effective in achieving the intended results. Further details on the choice of
instrument are below.

Use of results-based lending through DLIs was a suitable instrument to help drive
specific policy changes through budget support. The instrument, coupled with technical
assistance, was an effective way to build capacity to sustain such policy changes.
However, this form of lending can also be a complex instrument and considerable
thought should be given to the nature of targets (that is, whether to ‘fix’ them to a specific
date, failing which the Borrower will not be able to request disbursement of the financing
amount allocated to that DLI, or keep them ‘floating’, whereby the Borrower can request
disbursement against the achievement of the DLI at any point after the achievement has
been formally verified) and in setting a realistic schedule of targets so that risks of
slippage are minimized.

Defining the results framework. The DLI-based instrument allowed the dialogue with
counterparts to focus more on outputs, outcomes, and results, thereby helping to promote
continuity in politically difficult, governance-oriented reforms. However, there must be a

                                             34
clear articulation of linkages in formulating indicators, targets, and protocols to ensure
that the DLIs are helping in the achievement of project objectives.

Independent verification through third party monitoring. Although no external validation
mechanism was put in place under the Project to measure and monitor results, the Bank
team utilized Trust Fund resources to conduct independent spot-checks and operational
assessments during each phase of the Program which enabled a positive feedback loop by
identifying areas that required remedial measures and course correction, and thus
informed necessary changes and updates to Program guidelines.

Creating opportunities for marginal groups and addressing the needs of the community.
The design of workfare subprojects had a favorable effect on job opportunities for
community members who are often sidelined in the job market. In the EGPP, the lighter
workload of the public workfare schemes (primarily maintenance work) and their
proximity to local communities facilitated women’s participation. At the same time, it
also had the effect of extending coverage to other, more fragile, segments of the labor
force that had earlier tended to be marginalized in works schemes. Although generating
community assets was not the primary objective of the Program, independent assessments
confirmed that the subprojects implemented addressed the maintenance needs of existing
infrastructure, which is an overlooked aspect of rural infrastructure in Bangladesh.

Use of smart technology to address administrative challenges. Operational assessments
highlighted two potential areas of weakness in program administration, namely
irregularities in recording attendance at work sites and payment mismanagement. An
innovative pilot using mobile phones and Bangladesh Post Office cash cards for
attendance verification and payment solutions demonstrated that while there may be
initial hurdles, as would be expected with introducing any new technology, once
beneficiaries understand how a new solution helps them directly (reduced processing
time, greater transparency, etc.), there will be greater effort on their part to learn it more
proactively. At the same time, the solution must adopt a customer-centric approach to
start with and design appropriate tools and processes with the intended users in mind.
Using lessons from the initial pilot, further innovations, such as the use of biometric
technology, is being considered under the follow-on SNSP operation.

          ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
The economic analysis applies a cost effectiveness analysis to the program. It follows the
analysis used in the PAD that draws on an approach suggested in Ravallion (1998) for
appraising workfare programs. It determines how cost effective the EGPP is in raising
incomes of the poor compared to a counterfactual where every household in the
population receives a uniform transfer. This analysis compares the assumptions in the
PAD and calculates cost effectiveness ratios based on actual results under the project. It
considers (i) the extent to which the program reaches the beneficiary population; (ii)
program benefits as measured by net income transfers to poor households; and (iii) the
value of community assets created under the program for poor households. Welfare
benefits arising from avoiding negative coping behaviors are not considered.

In the analysis, the proportion of public expenditure on the program accruing as net
income gains to the poor is restructured to include the following components:

   a) Government spending. All financing comes from general revenues, in line with
      the assumption in the PAD
   b) Labor intensity, that is the wage costs as a share of total operating costs,
      averaged 91 percent, compared with a PAD estimate of between 80 and 90
      percent, assuming non-wage costs of 10–20 percent.
   c) Targeting performance, that is the share of wages that went to the intended
      beneficiaries, was 94 percent, compared with a PAD estimate of 80 percent.
   d) The net wage gain, that is household income with participation minus income in
      the absence of participation, was conservatively estimated between 51 percent and
      60 percent in the PAD. These estimates have been retained in the analysis.
   e) Indirect benefits. The benefit from assets use two alternatives, one where no
      indirect benefits accrue (reflected in current gains per unit of spending); and the
      other assuming a 35 percent benefit accruing to the extremely poor - assuming
      that indirect benefits accrue proportionately to the extremely poor and others in
      the community, reflecting the poverty rate in the community.

Here, the analysis envisages two scenarios: one that looks at current values, assuming
that benefits only accrue in the future; and another that includes future indirect benefits to
the poor.

Table 3 sets out the results of the analysis. The current earnings gain per dollar of
program spending is 0.38 or 0.45, depending on the estimate of net earnings gain. It also
means that it takes US$2.63 or US$2.22, respectively, to transfer US$1 to the beneficiary.

A similar analysis indicates that the earnings gain per dollar of program spending when
indirect benefits are included is 0.76 or 0.83, respectively, depending on the estimate of
net earnings gain. It also means that it takes US$1.32 or US$1.20, respectively, to
transfer US$1 to the beneficiary.




                                             39
In both instances, current and current and future gains exceed the poverty rate—31.5
percent—indicating that the EGPP outperforms the counterfactual of a uniform allocation
of the budget to the population in terms of poverty reduction.

               ANNEX 5. BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS
              Summary of Focus Groups Discussions with Beneficiaries15

Information dissemination
    In most areas, information on the EGPP was disseminated through meetings
      among UP project committee and local communities.
    Information circulation began 12–20 days prior to the EGPP work start date.
    In some areas where poverty rate is higher and employment opportunities are
      more sought after, awareness on the project was built through word-of- mouth.
      Nevertheless, procedural details about the program were provided by the UP
      members and Chairmen.
    Local political leaders also played an active role in spreading awareness about the
      EGPP.
    Information on the project was provided through television broadcast which
      proved to be quite effective in building awareness on the EGPP in some areas.
    UP committees organized miking in local markets to spread information on the
      EGPP.
    In some areas UP Chairmen, UP members, Tag Officers and chowkidars were
      responsible for information dissemination.
    Overall, information that was provided through different methods was considered
      to be adequate by the beneficiaries.

Knowledge on responsible body for project implementation
   The general idea among the beneficiaries was that UP Chairmen and members
     would be responsible for the implementation of the program.
   Tag Officers along with Union Project committees were considered to be the
     responsible bodies for project implementation in some areas.
   In some areas political leaders were considered to be responsible for project
     implementation.

Beneficiary selection process and mobilization
    In some areas UP project committee had to take the help of a local influential
       person to mobilize workers because the wage rate was lower than the existing
       market rate.
    In some areas beneficiaries were under the impression that local political leaders
       were in charge of beneficiary selection.
    Local political leaders did play a significant role in assisting the Project
       Committee in the selection of beneficiaries in most targeted areas.
    Overall, local politicians were not able to manipulate the process of beneficiary
       selection but in some areas beneficiaries were not sure about who was responsible

  Taken from assessments conducted by Power and Participation Research Centre (Employment
Generation Program for the Poorest [EGPP]: A Qualitative Assessment [2011–13]) under the Project.


                                               43
       for beneficiary selection.
      More than 40 percent of the beneficiaries who participated in the FGDs reported
       that they were selected in the Program by UP Chairmen and members.

Level of awareness on eligibility criteria
    Almost all beneficiaries who participated in the FGDs were aware that the main
       objective of the EGPP program was to create short-term employment for the
       poorest people in their respective areas.
    All participants of these FGDs were aware that this program would target both
       male and female able workers who were poor and unemployed.

Transparency in selection of beneficiaries
    80–82 percent of the participants reported that the selection was done mainly in
      presence of the Union Council by the UP Chairmen along with the UP members
      and the process was transparent.
    However, local politicians were reported to have some influence on the selection
      process but all poor from the targeted communities were included in the list of
      beneficiaries.
    In a few reported cases participants had to pay some amount of money to be
      included in the list. Some also agreed to have provided bribe to certain elite
      members of their society to open respective beneficiary bank accounts and to
      receive their Job cards.

       They received clear instructions from their local government authorities and
       leaders.

Access to information
    50 percent of the participants informed that signboards with information on daily
       wage rate number of working days and LS allocation were places a week before
       work week.
    100 percent participants appreciate these signboards as they are an easy access to
       important information about the project.
    In some worksites signboards were never put up. In order to increase transparency
       at the worksites these signboards are strongly requested by the participants.
                                          44
Role of Labor Leaders
    Majority of the participants reported that the Labor Leaders were responsible for
       managing and maintaining the attendance register as well as the master roll.
    85 percent of the participants reported that they relied on the Labor Leaders for

Types of projects preferred by beneficiaries
    90 percent of beneficiaries suggested projects to be undertaken that would help in
      construction/reconstruction of roads, bridges and embankments.
    65 percent of participants reported that in their areas drainage facilities need to be

    To better facilitate travel between two villages more connecting roads should be
      built.
    In order to cope with water crisis in some areas, beneficiaries strongly suggested
      building of canals.

Male vs. Female workers
   90–95 percent of the participants reported that there is no difference between the
      type of work undertaken by male and female laborers.
   In some cases it was reported that it was difficult for female workers to till the
      soil, and therefore, they are thought to be more efficient in carrying the soil from
      one place to another.

Wage disbursement process
   On average, Program participants work 5 days a week for 8 hours a day.
   75 percent of participants reported that they receive their wages from banks upon

   Some beneficiaries reported that they encountered difficulties in opening accounts
      at the banks.
   Above 80 percent of participants have valid bank accounts which they are
      maintaining from the beginning of the project.
   Beneficiaries also informed that banks are putting BDT 25 per day from their
      daily wages aside as savings. Participants appreciated this initiative as they realize
      that by the end of a month they have more money at their disposal which can help
      them in times of need economic crisis.
   Some beneficiaries complained of the transport fare that they had to pay each time
      in order to collect their wages from the banks.

       field officers and UP Chairmen. These complaints were addressed at meetings
       which were every fortnight.

Monitoring & Evaluation
   80 percent of participants reported that Project Implementation Committee
      Chairmen and members and Field Supervisors make regular monitoring visits to
      project sites.
   These officers ensure workers attendance, ensure quality of work and report on
      progress of work.
   70 percent of participants reported that more visits by senior, Upazila-level
      officers would help in improving the transparency of the project.

Suggestions
    90 percent of the participants reported that there should be an increase in the
      number of beneficiaries targeted.
    Majority of beneficiaries requested the wage rate to be more than the markets rate.
    Beneficiaries also suggested that a system should be developed where no political
      influence or manipulation in beneficiary selection can take place.
    50 percent of participants requested an increase in the number of working days.
    Incentivize the UP Chairmen and members in order to improve the monitoring
      and accountability system.

updated poverty statistics and ensure that the provisions under the EGPP and the SNSP
were aligned. The changes were as follows:
