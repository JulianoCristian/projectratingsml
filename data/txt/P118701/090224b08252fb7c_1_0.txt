                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project supporting the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest (EGPP) is closing on June 30, 2014, having provided both financing and technical support for the
                         Government program during the three and a half year period (2011- 2014). The EGPP Program operates twice a year (Oct-Dec referred to as Phase 1; and Mar-April referred to as
                         Phase 2), and the EGPP project has supported seven phases over the course of its implementation. During this time, there have been, on average, over 700,000 participants in each
                         of the seven Program phases, of whom over 33.2% have been female, with over 27 million person-days of employment generated in each phase. Two independent assessments of
                         the Program by IFPRI carried out in 2011 and 2012 based on nationally representative household surveys show that the Program is able to target the poorest households well
                         primarily due to its in-built self-targeting feature. Additionally a series of third party spot checks assessments conducted in each Program phase suggest incremental improvements in

                         surveys show a positive impact on the consumption of program participants and a reduction in their vulnerability. Given the Program's continued sound performance, the Government
                         has increased the program budget allocation in both FY12-13 and FY13-14, from a base budget of BDT 10 billion in FY11-12 to BDT 12 billion in FY12-13 (a 20% increase, which
                         was the largest increase in budget compared to all safety net programs) and to BDT 14 billion in FY13-14 (a 16.7% increase). The allocation is expected to further increase to BDT 15

                         Following the closing of the EGPP project, the Safety Net Systems for the Poorest (SNSP) Project (IDA 5281-BD) will continue to provide financial and technical support for the
                         EGPP, along with support for other safety net programs implemented by the Ministry of Disaster Management & Relief (MoDMR).
