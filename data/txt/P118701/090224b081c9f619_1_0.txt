                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A mid-term review of the Project, carried out in January 2013, including evaluations commissioned by the Bank, along with those conducted by third parties such as the International
                         Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), indicate that design features introduced in the program show positive outcomes. Over 600,000 beneficiaries have been maintained in each
                         phase of the Program during the last two fiscal years, and the minimum quota for female participation has consistently been met. Analyses of baseline and midline household surveys
                         commissioned by the Bank suggest that EGPP beneficiary households experienced a significant increase in their total expenditures compared to eligible but non-EGPP beneficiary
                         households. Field Supervisors recruited under the Project have helped provided much needed support to Project Implementation Officers (PIOs) in 334 Upazilas (sub-districts) as
                         suggested by random spot checks. Both these spot checks and quantitative household surveys have provided useful evaluation results as well as assessment of processes for

                         While there has been significant progress in terms of higher level outcomes and satisfactory progress in terms of improvement of implementation quality, the Office of the Project
                         Director (OPD) has limited capacity in processing large contracts and the Bank’s post procurement review has highlighted the specific improvements needed in this area.

                         Furthermore, findings from evaluation work indicate that there is further scope for improvements in implementation, such as, better work attendance verification, better monitoring of
                         payments though bank accounts, and better documentation. Much of these improvements are expected to be made through a management information system (MIS) which is in the
                         process of development. A pilot that links electronically attendance verification and payments using the Bangladesh Post Office's cash cards and commercial mobile banking
                         services, if shown to be successful and cost-effective, is likely to offer solutions to the implementation challenges identified. This pilot is currently planned for fall 2013 (i.e. Phase 1 of
                         the Program in FY 2013-14).

                         An application for withdrawal for approximately USD 27 million has been submitted for the Bank’s review and approved on June 9, 2013. Following the disbursement of this amount,
                         cumulative disbursements under the Project will now exceed USD 90 million, which comprises over 60% of the Project cost.
