                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project supporting the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest (EGPP) is now in its last year of implementation, having provided both financing and technical support
                         for the Government program during the three year period from FY 2011 to FY 2013. Over the past six phases of the Program (i.e. across the past three fiscal years) there have been,
                         on average, over 700,000 participants in each phase, of whom over 33.2% have been female, with over 27 million person-days of employment generated in each phase. Two
                         independent assessments of the Program by IFPRI in 2011 and 2012 based on nationally representative household surveys show that the Program is able to target the poorest
                         households well due to the in-built self-targeting feature of the program. The Bank's own assessments based on household surveys show a positive effect in increasing the
                         consumption of program participants. A series of third party spot checks conducted in each phase of the program suggest consistent improvements in program implementation

                         through the systematic formalization of institutional arrangements based on continuous feedback from the field. Given the Program's continued sound performance, the Government
                         has increased the program budget allocation in both FY12-13 and FY13-14, from a base budget of BDT 10 billion in FY11-12 to BDT 12 billion in FY12-13 (a 20% increase, which
                         was the largest increase in budget compared to all safety net programs) and to BDT 14 billion in FY13-14 (a 16.7% increase).

                         The last tranche of financing of EGPP expenditures will be made against the current phase of the Program (i.e. Phase 1 of FY 2014), which is still on-going but is expected to end
                         around February 2014. Subsequently, the Safety Net Systems for the Poorest (SNSP) Project (IDA 5281-BD), will continue to provide financial and technical support for the EGPP,
                         along with support for other safety net programs implemented by the Ministry of Disaster Management & Relief (MoDMR).

                         On September 2, 2013, the Government requested an amendment to the Financing Agreement for the EGPP Project, to ensure that the disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) target for
                         2013 for one specific focus area (“Geographic Targeting”) remained aligned with the provisions of the follow-on SNSP Project. The DLI target required modification as the SNSP
                         Project was to commence implementation and support the same Government program during the same fiscal year, and included an updated geographic targeting formula based on
                         new regional poverty statistics. It was agreed during negotiations for the SNSP Project that the new DLI targets agreed for the Government program would apply to the EGPP Project,
                         thereby necessitating an amendment to the EGPP Project's Financing Agreement. The Project was restructured accordingly and the amendment to the Financing Agreement became
                         retroactively effective from July 1, 2013 (having been countersigned by the Economic Relations Division on December 17, 2013). The EGPP budget for Phase 1 of FY 2014 has
                         already been distributed on the basis of the revised geographic targeting formula.

                         All major contracts have now been awarded, and the Office of the Project Director (OPD) is now focused on ensuring that the development of the management information system for
                         the EGPP.This is the only activity that has been delayed but currently remains on track to be completed by the project closing date. Using supplemental grant resources from the
                         Rapid Social Response MDTF, the OPD is also piloting two systems for electronic payment delivery and work attendance monitoring, via (1) the Bangladesh Post Office's cash card
                         service, and (2) a mobile banking service. Two pre-pilots conducted in two unions have shown encouraging results, and thus both payment options are being scaled up in 33 unions
                         to determine their efficacy and practicality. Should any of these modalities prove to be feasible, they are likely to offer more cost-effective and transparent monitoring of attendance
                         and payments for not only EGPP but all of the public works programs implemented by MoDMR and supported by the follow on SNSP project.

                         Cumulative disbursements under the Project now exceed USD 105 million, which is approximately 72% of the Project cost.
