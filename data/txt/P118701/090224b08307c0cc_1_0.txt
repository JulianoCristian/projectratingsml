AUDITOR'S REPORT
Secretary
Disaster Management and Relief Division
Ministry of Food and Disaster Management
Bangladesh Secretariat, Dhaka.
I. We have audited the Financial Statement of the "Employment Generation Programme for
the Poorest (EGPP)" Project financed under IDA Credit no. 4833 BD as of 30t June, 2014
and for the year then ended. The preparation of Financial Statement is the responsibility of
Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Financial Statement based on
our audit. This project has two components: i) Main Programme Component and ii)
Operational Support Component.
II.   We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the Financial Statement is free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Financial
Statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as, evaluating the overall Financial Statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
III.  FAPAD is entrusted to conduct audit on the foreign aided projects only which are part
of the Annual Development Program of the Govt. of Bangladesh. There is separate
arrangement for maintenance of accounts and audit for non development expenditure of the
Government which is done through preparation & certification of Appropriation Accounts &
Finance accounts of the Government by the C&AG of Bangladesh. In Main Program
Component of EGPP audit & accounts covers only non-development receipts and
expenditures which do not follow the existing systems of accounts and audit practiced in
Bangladesh. In spite of above non- compliance with the existing system audit is conducted by
FAPAD under an interim arrangement and directives from OCAG to satisfy the needs of the
Development Partner and the Government.
IV.   In our opinion, except non-compliance of financial rules and regulations in subsequent
observations along with the management letter following the Financial Statement gives a fair view in
all material aspects of the financial position of "Employment Generation Programme for the
Poorest (EGPP)" of the financial position as of 30f June, 2014 and the results of its
operations and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the cash basis of
accounting followed by the Government of Bangladesh.
