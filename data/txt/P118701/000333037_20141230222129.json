outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            served as a strategic entry point for the Bank on its policy\n            dialogue in the social protection arena and, by enabling\n            incremental and positive changes to the Program, it led to\n            strong collaboration between the Bank and the Government and\n            established the Bank as a credible partner in bringing\n            relevant international good practice in building sound\n            social protection systems in Bangladesh. This has resulted\n            in a longer term programmatic engagement and continued\n            dialogue on improving the design, implementation and\n            monitoring of safety net programs.  Although no external\n            validation mechanism was put in place under the Project to\n            measure and monitor results, the Bank team utilized Trust\n            Fund resources to conduct independent spot-checks and\n            operational assessments during each phase of the Program\n            which enabled a positive feedback loop by identifying areas\n            that required remedial measures and course correction, and\n            thus informed necessary changes and updates to program\n            guidelines. Operational assessments highlighted two\n            potential areas of weakness in program administration,\n            namely irregularities in recording attendance at work sites\n            and payment mismanagement. An innovative pilot using mobile\n            phones and Bangladesh Post Office cash cards for attendance\n            verification and payment solutions demonstrated that while\n            there may be initial hurdles, as would be expected with\n            introducing any new technology, once beneficiaries\n            understand how a new solution helps them directly (reduced\n            processing time, greater transparency, etc.), there will be\n            greater effort on their part to learn it more proactively."}, "docdt": "2014-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
