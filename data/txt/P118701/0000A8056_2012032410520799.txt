                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Employment Generation Program for the Poorest (EGPP) Project is the first results-based investment operation approved for Bangladesh which provide financing for a flagship
                         program known as the Employment Generation Program for the Hardcore Poor (EGPHP) which was established in 2009 by the Government of Bangladesh in response to the 2008
                         food price rises. The Project Development Objective is to provide short term employment on community sub-projects to enable households to better cope with vulnerability, while
                         strengthening program implementation. To achieve the PDO, disbursements are linked to a set of outcome indicators that mainly focus on (a) strengthening the Program's targeting
                         approach to better reach vulnerable households in extreme poverty, and especially women; (b) providing better governance as reflected in revised program implementation guidelines
                         that are transparently applied and publicly disclosed; and (c) strengthening program monitoring and evaluation systems. The project became effective on January 5, 2011 and the

                         disbursements so far have been made against the following results: (i) geographic targeting (DLI1); (ii) household targeting (DLI2); (iii) gender targeting (DLI3); and (iv) efficient
                         payment systems (DLI4).

                         Achieving these DLIs has allowed EGPP to implement reforms to improve its operations, including changes to the targeting of the program by concentrating on geographical areas

                         with higher poverty rates and tightening selection criteria for beneficiaries, the introduction of a quota for female participants, introducing wage payments through the banking system,
                         and improved systems for program monitoring. The project also has a strong focus on monitoring and evaluation. With funding from the TFESSD and the GAP JIT trust funds, the
                         World Bank is supporting process and impact evaluation of the EGPP over the three year project period. The implementing Ministry has also asked IFPRI to conduct an external
                         evaluation of the EGPP. The IFPRI evaluation and the work commissioned by the Bank in 2011 have found that EGPP beneficiary selection process and self-targeting features of
                         the program performed well with low level of leakage. Program reforms enacted to enhance female participation, with a target of 33 percent, are well on their way to success, with
                         more than 30 percent participation overall, although there is wide variability throughout the country. Focus group discussions reveal that light workload in close proximity to home not
                         only offers an income earning source for poor women but also alternatives to migration for those who are physically unable to migrate. However, participation in the program can be
                         hampered by lack of demand, political capture, presence of ghost workers, and social barriers for women. These problems are likely to be more prevalent in less poor areas.
                         Beneficiaries are in general very happy with the move to payments through bank branches, with substantially lower levels of leakage reported than in the previous payments system.
                         The evaluation also found that the distance to banks remained a problem for some beneficiaries and lack of attendance register makes it easier to have ghost workers. Greater
                         flexibility of the project in terms of choice of schemes was found to facilitate the creation of useful community assets, but project management is susceptible to political interference
                         and inadequate monitoring happens due to staff shortages.

                         The early results of the evaluation work are already being used to improve the design and administration of the program to enhance outcomes. For instance, the early evaluation
                         work suggested that problems with beneficiary selection were greatest in lower poverty areas, so in order to improve targeting and reduce leakages the GoB revised the geographic
                         targeting formula by increasing allocations to the poorest areas from 50 to 60% while reducing the allocation for the least poor areas. To address challenges remaining with paying
                         beneficiaries, a payments pilot is planned to develop solutions to link attendance to payments electronically and make electronic payments via cash cards and mobile phones. The
                         baseline data and qualitative work is being used to suggest which payment options would be most accessible for female beneficiaries of the EGPP, who are less likely to own their
                         own mobile phone or, prior to the program, have a bank account.
