REPORT AND RECOGu1ENDATICN OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FUR THE SECOND TELECOM?UNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a pro-
posed credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $15
million to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to finance the foreign
exchange costs of priority items required for the fiscal years 1968/69-
1971/72 expansion program of the Telegraph and Telephone Department of
the Government of Pakistan (T & T).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Early in 1969, the Association made its first credit for
telecommunications in Pakistan (No. 145-PAK) in an amount of US $16
million. This credit was to assist in financing (i) the addition of about
125,000 new lines to the subscribers'distribution network, (ii) micro-
wave and coaxial cable systems as well as open wire lines in East and
West Palistan, (iii) high frequency radio system improvements for the
interwing and international network, and (iv) management consultants
to T & T. Initial difficulties in starting the execution of the pro-
ject have now been remedied and orders totalling about US $6.6 million
equivalent are being placed. Tenders for further items totalling about
US $8 million equivalent have also been issued, with orders to be placed
by December of this year. The management consultants have already started
their worlc. It is expected that the project will be completed on time and
the credit fully disbursed by the agreed Closing Date, December 31, 1972.
3.        The proposed project was appraised in November/December 1969.
Negotiations were held in Washington from April 20 to 27, 1970. Messrs.
A.R. Bashir, Economic Minister, and Mr. A.M.A. Muhith, Economic Counselor
to the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington represented the Government of
Pa.cistan. Messrs. S.A. Sathar, T & T's Chiet Engineer, Operations and
Maintenance, and A.Q. Farooqi, Deputy Chief Engineer, Coordination, re-
presented T & T.
4.        The Association has made twenty-nine development credits to
Pakistan totalling US $399.2 million, net of cancellations.   Ten credits are
already fully disbursed. The Bank has made thirty loans in Palcistan totallino



US :p61L.3 xnitlion, net of cancellations, of which eighteen are fully
disbursed. The following is a summary statement of Banlc loans and IDA
credits to Pakistan, as of March 31, 1970:

5.        In my recent report on the Chandpur II Irrigation Project in
Eazt Pakistan (dated April 2, 1970; circulated to the Executive Directors
as IDA/R70-12) I have referred to the slow rate of disbursement of some
of the Bank Group's loans and credits in Pakistan and actions we are
taking to deal with this situation.
6.        IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling about
US $21.6 million, net of cancellations. The value of outstanding commit-
ments, net of repayments, cancellations and sales of loans, is about
US $16.5 million. IFC is presently considering applications for invest-
ments in a large engineering conppny and in a project for fertilizer
production.
7.        On April 14, 1970 the Executive Directors approved a US $13
million credit for the Chandpur II Irrigation Project, and on April 21,
1970 a US $1 million credit for the Karachi Port Trust Engineering
Project; both are expected to be signed shortly. An engineering credit
for the Karnaphuli and Muhuri irrigation projects (US $2.5 million
equivalent) has been negotiated, with the final amount of the credit
subject to adjuBhaent on the basis of a firm price proposal from the
consultant yet to be selected. Recommendations for the following three
projects on which negotiations have been substantially completed or
are underwqy, will be submitted to the Executive Directors shortly:
Small Industries in Eaat Pakistan (US $3 million); West Pakistan Power
Transmission and Distribution (US $22.4 million) and West Pakistan
Engineering Education (US $8 million). Two other projects are also
expected to be negotiated soon: Tubewells in East Pakistan (US $23
million total financing Jointly with the Swedish International Devel-
opment Agency and the Canadian International Dsvelopment Agency) and
Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (US $19.2 million).

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
8.        Borrower:           The Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Beneficiary:        Telegraph and Telephone Department of
the Government of Pakistan (T & T).
Amount:             The equivalent in various currencies of
US $15 million.
Purpose:            To help finance the foreign exchange costs
of priority items under T & T's expansion
program for fiscal years 1968/69-1971/72.
Amortization:       In 50 years including ten years grace,
through semi-annual installments of
i of 1% from August 1, 1980 through
February 1, 1990, and 1I½ frcm August
1, 1990 through February 1, 2020.
Service Charge:     3/4 of 1% per annum.

relend the proceeds of the Credit to
T & T for a period of 24 years including
four years grace at an interest rate of
6E6 per annum on the principal amount
outstanding from time to time.
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        A report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Telecommunications
Project - Pakistan" (No. PU-34a), dated April 30, 1970, is attached.
10.       At the time of Independence in 1947, the telecommunications
sector of Pakistan was rudimentary. In the meantime, the country has
undertaken substantial efforts to develop this sector and since 1955,
when the First Five-Year Plan was introduced, telephone density has
increased at an average rate of over 12 percent per annum. Neverthe-
less, telecommunications development is still lagging behind the rest
of the economy and is at present still quite under-developed among
major developing countries, with 1.4 telephones for 1000 persons and a
waiting list of 72,000 as compared with 135,000 connected subscribers.
The huge unsatisfied demand has led to high calling rates and substantial
traffic overflows.



11.       The need for better telecommunications facilities in Paicistan
is intensified by the geographical situation of the country, with its
two wings separated by over 1,000 miles of foreign territory. In West
Pakistan the main population and industrial centers are hundreds of miles
apart; in East Pakistan where distances are shorter, the numerous rivers
are a major barrier in the path of fast and easy communications required
for the development of the Province.
12.       The 1968/69-1971/72 program of telecommunications expansion
presently being carried out (of which both last year's and the proposed
projects form part) is the maximum program which can be achieved with
the existing human and material resources in Pakistan. With estimated
total costs of about US $200 million equivalent (out of which about US
$82 million is required in foreign exchange) it will provide the country
with high quality international and interwing telecommunications facili-
ties, a high capacity trunk network and 175,000 additional telephones.
If the proposed Credit is approved, a total of aboat US $72 million
equivalent of the foreign exchange required will have been secured from
the Association and various bilateral sources; the Government of Pakistan
is now negotiating to secure the rinaining US $10 million from other bilat-
eral sources or through suppliers' credits.
13.       The part of the expansion program which would be ftinanced under
the proposed Credit consists of the installation ol a microwave system,
local and junction cables and air-conditioning equipment. The microwave
system consists of two links, with ancillary equipment, between Karachi
and Multan, with one link branching off to Rawalpindi, the other to Lyallpur.
The foreign exchange cost of this part (including related surveys, studies,
supervision and training), is estimated at US $6.8 million. The proposed
system will add another miode to the existing main coaxial trunkline of
West Pakistan, thus increasing the reliability of the network, by providing
an alternative mode should one fail.
14.       Local and junction exchange cables will also be financed under
the proposed Credit to enable installation of about 50,000 new telephones,
which form part of the telephone network expansion planned under the 1968/69-
1971/72 program.  At the time of appraisal of the first project it was
expected that these cables would be supplied-5j ^a local cable factory. The
factory is not yet finished; production is expected to start later this
year. In any case, it will not be producing junction exchange cables and
will not reach full capacity until mid 1972. The timely completion of
T & T's expansion program therefore requires the import of junction and
local exchange cables, at a foreign exchange cost of US $5.7 million.
15.       Telecommnications equipment does not perform satisfactorily
unless operated in a dust-free atmosphere at optimal temperature and hu-
midity. This is of particular importance under the climatic conditions
in many parts of Pakcistan. It is therefore proposed to include US $1.5
million under the Credit to finance the foreign exchange cost o.C provid-
ing air-conditioning for equipment rooms. Contingencies on the items de-
scribed in the foregoing paragraphs would add a final US $1 million.



- 6 -
16.       Total costs of the project are estimated at about US $35.3
million. T & T will finance the local costs out of its own operating
revenues. Completion of the installation of the new telephones and of
the air-conditioning equipment is expected by June 30, 1972, and of the
microwave part by June 30, 1973.
17.       The project is expected to have a substantial and favorable
impact on telecommunications and consequently on the economy of Pakistan.
The Appraisal Report (Annex 13, IV) estimates that for many years after
completion of the project 80-90 percent of all direct exchange lines
will still be used by business and government. The economic benefits
of the project are reflected in the unusually high rates of return; for
instance in the case of the microwave system the minimum economic rate
of return is estimated at 37 percent.
18.       All items to be financed from the proposed Credit will be
procured on the basis of international competitive bidding. A local
factory, Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP), about 80 percent govern-
ment owned (through T & T) is qualified and expected to bid on a part of
the microwave system, the multiplex channeling equipment, the total
costs of which are estimated at about US $500,000 or less than 1.5 per-
cent of total project costs. In evaluating bids, TIP would be granted
a margin of preference of 15 percent, or the prevailing customs duties,
whichever is lower.
19.       The Appraisal Report describes T & T in detail (para. 3.01 to
3.07) and points out certain organizational shortcomings and weaknesses.
Both the Government of Pakistan and T & T are aware of the need to give
the agency more autonorm  and an integrated financial management.  The
management consultants financed under Credit No. 145-PAK are already
studying these problems. Their recommendations are expected to be sub-
mitted soon to the Government and the Association for approval, and
T & T has already indicated its willingness to implement them as soon
as approved. In the meantime, T & T is already taking various steps to
improve its efficiency and under the proposed draft Credit Agreement
will continue to do so. The consultants are also designing and will
assist in introducing by the end of fiscal year 1972 a suitably staffed
modern accounting system.
20.       T & T's financial position is sound.   To ensure that this
situation is maintained, T & T has agreed not to reduce its tariffs
until the introduction of the new accounting system without prior ap-
proval of the Association. After the introduction of the new accounting
system, a rate covenant will become effective, under which T & T is
required to achieve a minimum annual rate of return of 10 percent. At
the same time a debt covenant will come into effect, under which no
new debts may be incurred by T & T (or for it) unless its maximum debt
service requirement for any fiscal year is covered at least 1.5 times
by its net revenues for the preceding twelve-month period.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and the Association, the Recommendation of' the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of
Agreement, and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed.
Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement follows the usual
pattern of credit agreements for projects of' this type, and that of
Development Credit Agreement No. 145-PAK.
PART V - THE ECONaMY
22.       In my report on the Chandpur II Irrigation Project, referred
to in paragraph 5 above, recent economic developments in Pakistan were
reviewed. Since then, an economic mission has returned from Pakistan
and we expect to distribute its report in mid-June.
23.       During the sixties, Pakistan's national product recorded
sustained growth at a rate above 5.5 percent per annum. Such an
achievement was attained despite substantial adverse developments
arising from the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965 and the decrease in net
transfers of foreigi assistance.
24.       Despite this good performance in terms of the overall growth
rate, Pakistan is now faced with a number of issues and difficulties.
Some of these difficulties originated in the deliberate policy of the
Government to maintain a high rate of growth despite shortfalls in
internal and external resources. Income growth has been accompanied
by an increasing disparity in personal and regional incomes. Over
the Third Plan Period 1964/65-1969/70, income per capita is estimated
to have grown in West Pakistan by 3.3 percent annually, whereas in
East Pakistan the estimate is only 1.1 percent per annum. The need to
improve income distribution will call for greater emphasis on social
sectors, and in:.rastructural facilities that have somewhat lagged be-
hind the development of production will also have to be expanded.
25.       With this new orientation of capital expenditure, resource
constraints may be felt more than ever. The Government is aware of
the importance of raising national savings to meet investment require-
ments and of improving the fiscal effort to finance operating and
development spending. Government taxes currently account for only
nine percent of the national product; but it is expected 'that this
ratio will improve over the next few years with greater reliance on
direct taxation. Increased tax revenues would also enable Pakistan
to increase its capacity to absorb project aid, a capacity which has
been somewhat limited in recent years by the shortage of domestic
resources.



- 8 -
26.       In order to sustain the output growth required to meet the new
challenges posed to Pakistan, an improvement in infrastructural invest-
ment is needed, including the coimunication network. The geographical
position of two wings, separated by more than 1,000 miles, the length
of the axis between the adninistrative capital, Islamabad, and Karachi,
the largest city and only port of West Pakistan, the natural obstacles
put by numerous rivers in East Pakistan, are factors emphasizing the
need to raise telecammunication facilities to international standards.
27.       In view of Pakistan's rising debt service, which has now
reached about 20 percent of foreign exchange earnings, the Consortium
is considering how to maintain a net capital inflow at a level and on
terms compatible with the development needs of Pakistan   The relatively
small deficit on external payments which is expected for 1969/70 results
from a drastic curtailment of imports that cannot be continued without
jeopardizing longer-term development. It will also be necessary for
the Government to take action with respect to exports in order to put
an end to the current stagnation and resume the rapid expansion demon-
strated by exports in the sixties.
28.       In these circumstances, and considering Pakistan's good record
oI' economic management, continued assistance is justified on concessional
terms.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREFMENT
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles oi Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMNENDATION
30.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
