follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory; borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            rigor and candor in the Bank's supervision can play a\n            pivotal role in capacity building. The task team\n            leader's presence in the field and his rigorous,\n            pedagogical approach to accompanying and guiding the\n            Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme (PNLP) in\n            strategic management and oversight of the project (and\n            program) were consistently cited as being a critical factor\n            of success in strengthening Benin's capacity, and\n            recognized as an important comparative advantage of the\n            Bank. Even within a single disease program, a sector-wide\n            approach can achieve great synergies and efficiencies in\n            planning, financing, implementation, evaluation. The\n            seamless coordination and collaboration among the Roll Back\n            Malaria (RBM) partners has culminated in a number of good\n            practices and efficiencies. It is possible to support a\n            single disease through a health systems approach. Disease\n            control and health systems strengthening are not mutually\n            exclusive. Quality of supervision depends in part on\n            striking the right balance between depth and breadth of\n            supervision efforts. There is evidence and strong consensus\n            that both the quantity and quality of supervision needs to\n            be increased and that quality supervision requires the\n            proper technical expertise. Community malaria workers were\n            pivotal in the success of the malaria program. While not\n            directly financed under the Bank's project, these\n            workers were the first point of contact of children under\n            five suffering from malaria symptoms. Community-level\n            treatment has enhanced the ability of the health system to\n            treat children within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms and,\n            according to health facility staff, contributed to a decline\n            in severe cases."}, "docdt": "2011-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
