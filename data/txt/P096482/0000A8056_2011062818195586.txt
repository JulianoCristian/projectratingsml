                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project will support the implementation of the national 2006-2010 Malaria Control Program over the next four years. The success of the Project will be
                         reflected in the overall increase access to, and utilization of, an effective package of malaria control interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from
                         malaria. Specifically, the Project would contribute to strengthen malaria control capacities to: (a) improve case management and treatment of malaria so that by
                         year 2010, at least 60% of malaria of < 5 years old cases are treated adequately within 24 hours from onset of fever; and (b) expand prevention activities so that
                         by 2010 at least 60% children under 5 year old and of pregnant women sleep under an ITN; and that at least 60% of pregnant women receive a prophylactic
                         treatment.

                         The Project made good progress towards the achievement of its development objective. It is expected to close on June 30, 2011. All planned activities are now fully completed, and
                         the malaria efforts are continuing with another distribution campaign to take place in June 2011. The Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Initiative partners fully support the campaign which

                         aims at helping Benin attain the universal access to insecticide treated nets recommended by the WHO to boost malaria prevention and case management in malaria endemic
                         countries. The IDA-financed Project contributed to the campaign with the provision of 1,200,000 Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) out of a need of 4,500,000. Other main
                         contributors are the Global Fund (2,500,000), the government through the State budget, the WHO and UNICEF. The nets procured under the Project's funds have been deployed in
                         the warehouses of the southern health districts while awaiting the holding of the next campaign in June 2011. Recent Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) data collected and validated
                         by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) confirm that satisfactory progress has been achieved as regards most of the results indicators. As of end May 2011, three Project
                         Development Objective indicators have been fully met or exceeded, and one remains unchanged although it may show improvement when the DHS survey is released in early 2012.
