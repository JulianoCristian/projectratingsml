                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project will support the implementation of the national 2006-2010 Malaria Control Program over the next four years. The success of the Project will be
                         reflected in the overall increase access to, and utilization of, an effective package of malaria control interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from
                         malaria. Specifically, the Project would contribute to strengthen malaria control capacities to: (a) improve case management and treatment of malaria so that by
                         year 2010, at least 60% of malaria of < 5 years old cases are treated adequately within 24 hours from onset of fever; and (b) expand prevention activities so that
                         by 2010 at least 60% children under 5 year old and of pregnant women sleep under an ITN; and that at least 60% of pregnant women receive a prophylactic
                         treatment.

                         The Project is making good progress towards the achievement of its development objective. Most activities are completed, except the national mass net distribution campaign which
                         has been delayed due to the preparation of the presidential elections, first round of which took place on March 13, 2011. The Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Initiative partners fully support

                         the campaign which aims at helping Benin attain the universal access to LLIN recommended by the WHO to boost malaria prevention and case management in malaria endemic
                         countries. The IDA-financed Project contributes to the campaign with the provision of 1,200,000 LLIN out of a need of 4,500,000. Other main contributors are the Global Fund
                         (2,500,000), the government through the State budget, the WHO and UNICEF. The campaign is now scheduled to take place by early May, 2011. Recent M&E data collected and
                         validated by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) confirm that satisfactory progress has been achieved as regards results indicators. As of December 31, 2010, targets for
                         two (2) main indicators have been fully met or exceeded; and two (2) others are likely to be met by end June, 2011.
