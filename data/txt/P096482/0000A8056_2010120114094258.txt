                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project will support the implementation of the national 2006-2010 Malaria Control Program over the next four years. The success of the Project will be
                         reflected in the overall increase access to, and utilization of, an effective package of malaria control interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from
                         malaria. Specifically, the Project would contribute to strengthen malaria control capacities to: (a) improve case management and treatment of malaria so that by
                         year 2010, at least 60% of malaria of < 5 years old cases are treated adequately within 24 hours from onset of fever; and (b) expand prevention activities so that
                         by 2010 at least 60% children under 5 year old and of pregnant women sleep under an ITN; and that at least 60% of pregnant women receive a prophylactic
                         treatment.

                         The Project is making good progress towards the achievement of its development objective. Most activities planned to be implemented during the course of the project are near
                         completion. At the government's request, the Bank has agreed to extend the project's closing date from February 28, 2011 to June 30, 2011 to allow the Ministry of Health to

                         complete a few major activities that will contribute to the consolidation of the results achieved on the ground during the past 4 years of implementation. The activities to be carried out
                         during the extension period include: (i) activities linked to a national mass campaign distribution of long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) that the government plans to organize by end
                         December 2010; (ii) household and health facilities surveys to evidence results achieved on the ground at the end of the project; research activities to assess the effects of the
                         integrated malaria control strategies through the use of LLINs and Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACTs) for malaria prevention and case management; (iv) audit of the
                         Project account as required by the Development Grant Agreement.
