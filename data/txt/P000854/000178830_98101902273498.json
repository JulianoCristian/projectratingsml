60 km double\n            circuit, 161 kV transmission line to Tema; (b) installation\n            of a 25 MVAR synchronous condenser at Prestea and a 25 MVAR\n            static condenser at Kumasi for reactive power compensation\n            on VRA's transmission grid; (c) construction of a 161\n            kV, 80 km transmission line and related substations to\n            supply the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani area in Southwestern Ghana,\n            to feed the ECG distribution system; and (d) addition of a\n            161 kV, 25 km transmission line from Tema to Accra (Achimoto\n            substation) and the extension of both the substations to\n            increase the capacity of the existing system."}, "docdt": "1977-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
