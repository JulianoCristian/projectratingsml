REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE VOLTA
RIVER AUTHORITY WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC
OF GHANA FOR THE KPONG HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Volta River Authority (VRA) with the Guarantee of the Republic
of Ghana for the equivalent of US$39 million to help finance the Kpong Hydro-
electric Project on the Volta River and related transmission investments.
The loan would have a term of 20 years including 4-1/2 years of grace with
interest at 8.5 percent per annum. The remaining foreign exchange costs
would be financed by loans totaling US$133 million from the following: Fonds
Europeen du Developpement (FED), European Investment Bank (EIB), Banque Arabe
du Developpement Economique en Afrique (BADEA), Kuwait Fund, Saudi Fund for
Development and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Fiscal and Balance of Payments Aspects
of Ghana's Development" (638a-GH) dated May 19, 1975, was distributed to the
Executive Directors in June 1975. A special economic report on export promo-
tion and financial intermediation will be distributed shortly. Basic data are
summarized in Annex 1.
Basic Economic Characteristics
3.        Compared with most other West African nations, Ghana enjoys a
fairly high standard of living; its annual per capita GNP, according to World
Bank estimates, was about US$460 in 1975, but this is almost certainly over-
stated because of the existing exchange rate. Over the past decade and a half
GDP growth averaged about 2.5 percent per annum and failed to keep pace with
the growth of population. There was virtually no growth in the volume of
exports, which depended almost entirely on a few traditional export commodi-
ties -- cocoa (of which Ghana is the world's largest producer), gold, and
timber. In addition to contributing 60 percent of the country's export
earnings, cocoa provides around 30 percent of government revenue and employs
upwards of 20 percent of the labor force. Although the development strategy
of the early 1960s broadened the industrial base, industries remained heavily
dependent on imported inputs. This strategy resulted in recurrent balance
of payments crises and an accumulation of external debt.
4.        Economic and social policies of the early 1960s emphasized extensive
government involvement in a wide range of social services, in setting up a
large number of state enterprises and in allocating resources through an exten-
sive system of physical and financial controls. Since the mid-1960s, there

has been a growing imbalance in public finances due to rapid growth of
budget current expenditures, slow growth in current revenue and uneconomic
operations of several government enterprises. The imbalance has depressed
government development expenditures to an inadequate level and has also been
a persistent source of inflationary pressure.
5.        After cocoa and timber, Ghana's principal traditional exports are
gold, manganese, diamonds and bauxite. Production of most of these minerals
is stagnating, mainly because of depletion of the ore reserves. However, a
proposal is being considered that would open a new mine to produce bauxite
for local reduction to alumina to supply the existing aluminum smelter.
Ghana imports its entire petroleum requirements, mostly in the form of crude
oil which is refined domestically and used chiefly as a source of fuel for
the transport sector. Hydroelectric power meets most of Ghana's energy re-
quirements.
6.        Despite the economic problems of the 1960s, Ghana has devoted con-
siderable effort to development of its human resources. The education system
is well established, elementary education has been free and universal since
1962, public health facilities are fairly widespread and further expansion
favors rural areas. It is the declared policy of the Government to achieve
a more equitable income distribution by increasing productive investments in
the rural areas, by expanding low cost rural housing and water supply, and
by improving feeder roads.
Recent Developments
7.        The military government that took office in early 1972 inherited
a critical balance of payments position. Large medium and short-term debts
had been incurred and foreign exchange reserves were virtually exhausted,
largely as a result of a liberal import policy and a decline in cocoa produc-
tion and prices. In an endeavour to redress the situation, the previous
Government, in December 1971, introduced a 44 percent devaluation of the Cedi
in terms of the US Dollar. The new Government, shortly after taking over,
revalued the Cedi, reducing the previous devaluation to about 20 percent. In
addition, the Government enacted an import retrenchment program which hit the
industrial and distributive sectors hard, causing GDP to fall by 3.7 percent
in 1972. A recovery followed in the next two years (growth rates of 4.6 and
4.9 percent) encouraged by a greater availability of imports, but in 1975
there was virtually no rise in GDP.
8.        A strong improvement in the balance of payments in 1972 and 1973,
brought about by import controls and favorable price developments for cocoa,
gold and timber, ended abruptly in 1974 when the impact of higher oil prices
and a breakdown of the import licensing system caused an acute foreign ex-
change crisis. The situation was reversed in 1975 - at the end of which
exchange reserves had increased to $150 million (about two months imports) -
following a re-enforcement of import controls and a drawing on the IMF Oil
Facility. At the end of December 1976, exchange reserves amounted to US$1)4



- 3 -
million, equivalent to about six weeks imports. Recently, the world cocoa
price has risen sharply, partly in response to an expected poor harvest in
West Africa. Higher export earnings for cocoa, in spite of a lower volume,
should therefore ease the foreign exchange position in the near future.
Advantage should be taken of this situation to correct some of the presently
severe distortions in the domestic price/incentive structure which is heavily
biased against exports, enables large profits to be made by importers and is
resulting in a serious misallocation of domestic resources.
Public Finance
9.        The steep rise in cocoa prices and efforts by government to expand
non-cocoa revenue have substantially increased revenue collections. Current
expenditure, however, has risen even more rapidly, resulting in extensive
borrowing from the Bank of Ghana to finance development expenditure. This has
been a major factor contributing to the high rate of increase in domestic
prices, which has been aggravated by imported inflation, the inhibiting
effects of import controls on domestic industrial production and the effects
on domestic food and agricultural availability of two years of low rainfall.
The cost of living rose by 30 percent in 1975, and increased to a rate of 50
percent per annum during 1976; there are now widespread shortages of many
types of consumer goods. Revenue and expenditure measures announced in the
1976/77 budget are intended to produce a smaller deficit than in the previous
year. On the revenue side the major changes include higher excise duties and
the introduction of a uniform 10 percent import license levy. The currently
high cocoa price should temporarily improve revenues, but much more stringent
controls will have to be imposed on public expenditures if inflation is to
be checked.
Prospects
10.       A Five-Year Development Plan, covering the period 1976-1980, shows
a target rate of GDP growth of 5.5 percent per annum. However, sharp fluc-
tuations in revenue and export earnings will continue to hamper an effective
development policy in Ghana, since diversification away from cocoa can proceed
only gradually. Recent measures on the balance of payments and the budget
reflect an awareness of needed policy directions, but the severe external
resource constraint and the rate of inflation require difficult policy deci-
sions in the near future to restore external and domestic equilibrium.
11.       Ghana's growth prospects over the next five to ten years will
depend to a considerable extent on the effective implementation of appropriate
policies to deal with the problems outlined above. Key policy measures should
aim at: (a) correcting the imbalance on external account through a more
realistic structure of prices and costs; (b) reducing the strong inflationary
tendencies associated with large public sector deficits; (c) promoting an
expansion of domestic production through more appropriate price incentives,
more assured supplies of necessary inputs and greater productivity of invest-
ment. It is difficult at present to assess the likelihood of the Government



- 4 -
taking all the economic policy measures necessary to restore equilibrium on
the external account and provide a more secure basis for accelerated growth in
the domestic economy. Some important policy actions have already been taken.
Fertilizer subsidies are being phased out, cocoa producer prices have been
increased, as well as public utility rates and agricultural interest rates,
and recent budgets have attempted to limit the growth of current expenditures.
While these measures represent important steps, the pace of implementation is
still too gradual given the severity of Ghana's economic problems, and a
considerably reinforced effort will be required over the next few years to
achieve correction of the economy's structural imbalances.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
12.       An agreement on a long-term rescheduling of Ghana's medium-term
external debt was concluded in March 1974. Under this agreement, all pay-
ments due after February 1, 1972, in respect of pre-1966 debt obligations,
will be paid over a period of 28 years, including a grace period of 10 years,
with an interest rate of 2-1/2 percent per annum. Pre-1972 trade credit
arrears are gradually being cleared. At the end of February 1976, these
amounted to US$61 million, compared to US$188 million at the end of 1972.
Remittance of profit and dividends is still restricted. The current external
debt service ratio is only about 3.5 percent and is expected to drop to about
3.0 percent by the end of the decade and then rise, when the grace period on
the rescheduled debt expires in 1982, to around 7.0 percent in the late 1980s.
The Bank Group's share of Ghana's total external debt service in 1975 is
estimated at about 18%; this is expected to rise to about one-third by the end
of 1980 and gradually decline thereafter as a result of the terms of the debt
rescheduling agreement. Ghana is relying on official sources for the bulk of
the external capital required to support its development program, and rela-
tively little of its medium and long-term borrowing will be on commercial
terms. The March 1974 agreement with creditors on rescheduling helped provide
the foundation for a resumption of assistance. Canada, Germany, the United
States, the Arab Funds, the U.K. and the European Economic Community have
indicated a willingness to commit substantial capital assistance, most of
which will be provided on soft terms. Bank Group Lending, as a proportion of
total external public debt, is expected to increase from about 14 percent in
1975 to about 25% by the end of the decade. In view of the very low present
and prospective debt service ratio, Ghana can be considered creditworthy for
additional Bank lending. However, the country's vulnerability to fluctuations
in the prices of cocoa and other primary products make it desirable that
future debt service obligations should be kept as low as possible. Continued
assistance on the basis of a blend of Bank/IDA financing would appear to be
justified, given the country's relatively low per capita income.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
13.       Since 1962, when the Bank Group financed its first operation in
Ghana, the Bank has made eight loans totaling US$142.5 million -- two for
the Volta dam and associated infrastructure works for electricity generation,
one for telecommunications, one for highways, one for cocoa development, one
for the National Investment Bank, one on Third Window terms for agricultural
development, and one for a regional clinker plant, financed as part of the
three nation (Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast) CIMAO industrial development project;
IDA has extended 12 credits totaling US$96.3 million -- five for agriculture
(including livestock, cocoa and fisheries), two for water supply and sewerage,
two for power distribution and three for highways. Annex II contains a summary
statement of loans and credits as of January 31, 1977, with notes on the
execution of ongoing projects. There are no IFC investments.
14.       The principal objectives of Bank Group assistance to Ghana are:
(a) to encourage Government to adopt economic policies designed to strengthen
the balance of payments and improve domestic demand management, (b) to help
rehabilitate and expand production of cocoa, the country's main foreign
exchange earner, (c) to promote agricultural and industrial diversification,
particularly for export promotion and import substitution, and (d) to improve
the country's essential infrastructure so as to relieve constraints upon
economic growth.  At the same time, the Bank Group's lending program will
give emphasis to projects which would raise the living standards of the
poorer groups of the population; particular attention would also be given,
in the context of individual projects, to specific policy action (e.g. on
pricing, tariffs and subsidies) designed to improve output and productivity
in the economy and improve the performance of public enterprises.
15.       The two power projects currently under consideration are complemen-
tary undertakings designed to meet essential power requirements for future
economic growth. In line with the country's development priorities, future
Bank Group lending will place increasing emphasis on the agricultural and
industrial sectors. In agriculture, it is expected that a second sugar
project will be prepared to help increase output of the on-going Bank-financed
operation and reduce the country's dependence on imports. A second rural
development project is under preparation aimed at increasing agricultural
output and the incomes of small farmers in the Volta Region in Ghana. In
addition further assistance is contemplated for increased cocoa output, which
would strengthen Ghana's foreign exchange earnings. In industry a small-scale
industries project is being prepared and a second loan to the National Invest-
ment Bank will be considered in due course; both these projects should help
diversify industrial production and provide wider employment opportunities.
Funds from the Project Preparation Facility have been approved to help finance
preparation work on the proposed Kibi bauxite/alumina project. In the social
sectors, the Government has requested assistance in designing and implementing
projects to improve urban development. A possible project is being prepared,
with financial assistance from the Project Preparation Facility, for upgrading
several low income settlements and developing sites and services in a number
of urban areas; an employment component is planned to provide work opportuni-
ties in the informal sector.

PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Bank Financing in the Sector
16.       The Bank has made four previous loans/credits to the power sector
in Ghana totaling US$70.1 million. Two loans, for US$47 million in 1962 and
US$6 million in 1969, assisted the Volta River Authority (VRA) in building
and expanding its power generating and transmission facilities, the major
component of which was the Akosombo power plant on the Volta River, about
100 km northeast of Accra (see map). This six unit hydroelectric facility,
with a total installed capacity of 912 MW, presently provides more than 90
percent of the country's electric power requirements. Two credits, for
US$10 million in 1968 and US$7.1 million in 1971, assisted the Government
in financing the Electricity Corporation of Ghana's (ECG) program to improve
and expand its distribution systems to meet growing demand for power, partic-
ularly for industrial use. The physical execution of the projects has been
satisfactory. A project performance audit report (No. 1363 of Nov. 23, 1976)
on the second loan to VRA concluded that the project was implemented success-
fully, presenting no unusual problems. Audit reports on the two projects
involving ECG are being prepared.
Sector Objectives
17.       The principal sector objectives are to:
(a) increase firm generating capacity in order to be able
to supply the demand growth beyond 1978;
(b) carry out feasibility studies for the required gener-
ating and transmission line facilities for the years
1983/84 onwards;
(c) extend hydropower supply to areas where costly diesel
generating plants are now in operation and to new rural
areas; and
(d) extend and reinforce transmission systems in order to
take care of load growth and improve the quality of
service.
The proposed project and an associated loan for improving ECG's power dis-
tribution capacity are designed to further these goals.
Sector History and Institutions
18.       The waters of the Volta River system spring from no less than
six West African states -- Upper Volta, Togo, Benin, Ivory Coast, Mali and
Ghana. The main stream rises in the Kong mountains, about 25 miles outside



- 7 -
of Bobo-Dioulasso in Upper Volta, and after flowing first northeast and then
south for some 320 miles as the Black Volta it enters Ghana. Then it joins
forces with the White and Red Voltas and the Oti River to form the massive
flow that reaches the sea at Ada, east of Accra.
19.       The first serious proposal for harnessing the power potential of
the Volta was made by an Australian geologist/engineer in 1915. He explored
the gorge at Akosombo, 68 miles from the river's mouth, and estimated that
a 100 foot dam would generate 180,000 horsepower, or 134,000 kilowatts (a
little less than the output of one of the six generators now installed at the
Akosombo power plant). It was not until about 40 years later, however, that
a special preparatory commission recommended the feasibility of a power
project, basically to supply power to a proposed nearby aluminum smelter.
Following a review of the proposals in the late 1950s, Kaiser Aluminum and
Chemical Corporation sponsored the smelter and in 1962 the Bank and other
donors agreed to assist in financing the hydroelectric plant. The two de-
velopments were thus mutually dependent: Ghana's. Volta River system offered
a large potential source of easily accessible power while the power-inten-
sive smelter operated by the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO) provided the
large demand required to justify and enable the hydroelectric facility to
be financed.
20.       The Volta River Authority (VRA) was created in 1961 to build and
operate the power plant at Akosombo. VRA is a statutory corporation owned
by the Government of Ghana and supplies bulk power to the VALCO smelter at
Tema, to several gold, diamond, manganese and bauxite mining industries, to
Akosombo township, to the Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB) which
supplies Togo and Benin, and to the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG).
The latter institution is also a statutory corporation owned by Government.
It was established in 1967 and is responsible for the distribution of power
to all other consumers in Ghana and for the generation of electricity in
areas that cannot be economically connected to the VRA system. ECG serves
the four principal cities of Accra, Tema, Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi, as
well as 26 smaller urban centers. The feasibility of merging ECG and VRA
has been considered off and on since the mid-60s. As ECG and VRA have
developed into relatively mature organizations with distinctly different
functions, a merger is not expected to bring about major benefits.
Existing Facilities
21.       VRA's facilities include the hydro plant at Akosombo and a 920 km
161 kV transmission system which forms the national grid and covers most of
southern Ghana. The hydro facility consists of a rock fill dam and a six
unit powerhouse with long-term dependable generation estimated at 5,400 GWh
per year. Volta Lake, one of the world's largest man-made reservoirs, covers
about one-tenth of Ghana's area and can accommodate almost two years of
average yearly inflow from the upper Volta basin. The lake's electric energy
storage capability is about 10,000 GWh. ECG's facilities comprise 33 and
11 kV distribution systems fed from VRA's transmission system or from ECG's
own diesel-electric stations. There are 28 of the latter with a total
installed capacity of 81 MW.



The Power Market
22.       Public electricity supply presently serves about 100 towns totaling
some 2.25 million people (about 25 percent of Ghana's population). In the
rural areas, electricity supply serves areas with an estimated 260,000 people,
4 percent of the rural population. Total electricity consumption in Ghana
increased at an average annual rate of 8.1 percent in the 1968-74 period;
ECG's sales increased by 12.2 percent per annum. Peak demand of 540 MW was
reached in 1974; generation over the past decade has increased to 4,110 GWh,
of which over 90 percent is hydroelectric. About two-thirds of the hydro-
electric supply is consumed by VALCO's 132,000 ton smelter, ECG customers
consume about 20 percent, the mines 6.5 percent, CEB and Akosombo township
the rest. It is estimated that by 1984 peak demand will be 900 MW and
generation 6,200 GWh.
Tariffs
23.       VRA has a two-fold tariff arrangement:  one governing sales to
VALCO, the other covering sales to ECG, the mines, CEB and Akosombo town-
ship. The VALCO tariff formula is embodied in a special power contract
negotiated in 1962. This obliged VRA to deliver ultimately up to 370 MW
of firm power and, on the other hand, requires VALCO to pay a rate of
2.625 US mills/kWh for the energy effectively taken or to pay ultimately
at least a minimum charge equal to the basic rate times 3.079 GWh (i.e.
370 MW at 95 percent load factor). VALCO's payments are in US Dollars.
24.       Recently a new tariff schedule has been negotiated.   VALCO and Ghana
agreed to (a) increase the basic rate to 3.25 US mills/kWh for the 1973-75
period and (b) increase the rate to 4.5 US mills/kWh for 1976 with further
increases leading ultimately to 5.0 US mills/kWh in 1981. In addition, an
escalation mechanism will protect VRA against operating cost increases and
future exchange rate risks associated with two outstanding loans from the
World Bank. Earlier, VRA had agreed to provide VALCO with an additional 30 MW
firm and 15 MW interruptible power (above and beyond the basic 370 MW) to
serve a new potline for the smelter, shortly to commence operations. As part
of the recently concluded negotiations, a temporary rate of 6.75 US mills/kWh
was agreed for this additional power. The rate will be reviewed about one
year prior to the commissioning of the proposed Kpong power plant when the
actual costs of that facility are known more firmly. Should the new rate be
higher than 9.75 US mills/kWh, however, VALCO has the option under the agree-
ment to reduce or to forego entirely the 30 MW. During negotiations, Govern-
ment and VRA agreed that a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan would
be the execution and delivery of the rate agreement with VALCO (Section 8.01,
draft Loan Agreement).
25.       The VRA tariff formula to non-VALCO customers consists of a capacity
charge related to the highest recorded monthly maximum demand and an energy
charge which reflects the very low running cost of hydroelectric power. ECG's
scheduled tariffs are of two types: a simple kWh charge in a declining block
tariff for small residential, commercial and industrial consumers; for larger
consumers a monthly maximum demand charge and an energy charge per kWh which
decreases with kWh consumption. Tariffs to CEB were increased by 24 percent
on July 1, 1976, while tariffs to ECG and the mines were increased by 60
percent on September 1, 1976.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The project was appraised by a Bank Mission which visited Ghana
in March 1976. A report entitled "Appraisal of the Kpong Hydroelectric
Project", No. 1299a-GH and dated March 1, 1977, is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is presented in Annex
III. Negotiations were held in Washington from November 29 to December 3,
1976. The Government/VRA delegation was headed by Dr. S.K.B. Asante and
Dr. E.L. Quartey.
Project Description
27.       The proposed project is the second step in the planned development
of the Volta River's hydropower potential. The first step involved construc-
tion of the Akosombo power plant. The Kpong project is necessary to meet
the growth in demand for power and would comprise the following components:
(a) the Kpong dam and hydroelectric plant with associated transmission
facilities; (b) reactive power compensation on VRA's transmission grid; (c) a
transmission line and related substations to supply the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani
area in southwestern Ghana; and (d) additional transmission facilities from
Tema to Accra.
28.       The Kpong component, as designed by Canadian consultants (Acres
International), would be constructed on the Volta River 24 km downstream
from the existing Akosombo dam and would include: (a) a dam formed by an
integral concrete intake-powerhouse structure, a gated concrete overflow
spillway and an embankment river dam and forebay dykes; (b) a 60 km double
circuit 161 kV transmission line to Tema where it would tie in the VRA's
transmission grid. The installed capacity of the power plant will total
160 MW in four vertical units. Simulation studies indicate that the long-
term dependable power output and annual generation of the VRA power system
would increase by 140 NW and 970 GWh by the addition of the Kpong plant.
29.       The reactive power compensation component is necessary to maintain
satisfactory voltage conditions in the grid and to keep power and energy
losses at a reasonable level. It would be achieved through installation of
a 25 MVAR synchronous condenser at Prestea and a static condenser of the
same capacity of Kumasi. The transmission line and related substations to
the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani area would consist mainly of an 80-km 161 kV line
connected to VRA's grid at Dunkwa. This component is needed in order to per-
mit construction of a distribution system that is proposed as part of the
proposed Electricity Corporation of Ghana project; the distribution system
would serve industries and some 30,000 people in seven townships. The addi-
tional transmission facilities from Tema to Accra are required by 1980 to
ensure against overloading of the existing lines.

The Borrower
30.       The Volta River Authority, the proposed Borrower, is required
under its charter to operate Volta river power projects according to sound
public utility practices and to develop such non-power activities associated
with Lake Volta as lake transport, lake research and resettlement. The
Authority is governed by a board which is appointed and supervised by the
Ghanaian head of state. The board consists of a Chairman and seven other
members, including VRA's Chief Executive and representatives of the major
power consumers and the general public.
31.       VRA has been managed since 1966 by a competent engineer/manager.
The heads of the main management units -- engineering and administrative/
financial -- are also well qualified professionals. VRA's managerial staff
are entirely Ghanaian. Of the total staff of about 2,400, the majority are
engaged in power generation and transmission tasks. There are a number of
vacant positions, which VRA is endeavoring to staff, the most important of
which is the Director of Finance. During negotiations VRA gave assurances
that this position will be filled by July 1, 1977 (Loan Agreement; Section
4.01(b)). VRA's electric facilities are operated in a professional manner
and its accounting system is well established.
Project Cost
32.       The estimated total project cost, excluding interest during con-
struction and net of taxes and duties, is about US$237 million equivalent,
including foreign exchange costs of about US$172 million equivalent. The
cost estimates for Kpong hydroelectric scheme proper were prepared by VRA's
consultants, Acres International, and are based on mid-1976 prices. The
estimates include physical contingencies amounting to 9 percent of total
base line costs and price contingencies amounting to 25 percent of total
base line costs plus physical contingencies. Engineering and management
of the hydropower development were estimated at 10 percent of base line
costs of equipment and civil engineering works. The cost of the reactive
power compensation, the transmission line to the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani area
and associated substations and the additional transmission facility between
Tema and Accra are tentatively estimated at US$11.5 million including con-
tingencies, of which about US$10 million would be in foreign exchange. Proj-
ect costs are summarized in Annex III.
Project Financing
33.       The proposed Bank loan of US$39.0 million would cover about 23 per-
cent of the foreign exchange cost (US$172 million) of the project and would
help finance the following components: (a) the foreign exchange cost of the
Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani transmission line (US$3.0 million); (b) the foreign
exchange cost of construction equipment, vehicles and spare parts for pre-
liminary works in Kpong and for the resettlement program (US$2.4 million);
(c) part of the foreign exchange cost of generating equipment, powerhouse
crane, transformers, ancillary equipment, materials and equipment for the



- 11 -
transmission line from Kpong to the Volta substation in Tema, a review en-
gineering board, reactive power compensation equipment and additional trans-
mission between Tema and Accra (US$33.6 million). The latter group of items
would be financed jointly with the FED and EIB, which have agreed in principle
to provide together about US$21.0 million to VRA. EIB will contribute about
US$11 million equivalent for 15 years including 4-1/2 years of grace at 6-1/2
percent, while the FED loan of US$10 million equivalent would be at 1 percent
for 40 years (including 10 years of grace).
34.       The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has agreed to
provide Government 35 million Canadian dollars (50 years repayment including
10 years grace at no interest) for engineering services and gates and hoists.
In the event that the cost of these items exceeds the current value of the
CIDA loan, CIDA has agreed to consider additional funding. Our present esti-
mate of the cost of these items is US$39 million equivalent, as reflected in
the following table. Three Arab agencies -- BADEA, Kuwait Fund and Saudi
Fund for Development -- have agreed to finance jointly up to US$73 million
equivalent for civil engineering works. BADEA and the Saudi Fund will lend
US$30 million and US$15 million respectively to VRA at 4 percent for 25 years
including 5 years of grace. The Kuwait Fund loan of US$ 28 million will be
to the Government for 20 years including 5 years of grace at 6 percent in-
terest with onlending to VRA at 6 percent. Local costs totaling US$64.5
million equivalent would be financed by VRA out of its own internal cash
generation. The financing package is summarized as follows:

Engineering and Construction
35.       Design studies for the hydroelectric development have been com-
pleted by Acres, VRA's consultants. Project drawings and technical speci-
fications are available for the civil engineering works, the electrical
and mechanical equipment for the powerhouse, and the required hydraulic
gates and hoisting devices. Work on the design of transmission facilities
for Kpong will commence in early 1977. In order to complete Kpong by June
1981, contracts for the civil engineering works and the supply of the main
generating equipment and spillway gates would have to be awarded by April
1977. This seems feasible since the bids for the civil works were opened on
February 1, 1977, and for the equipment on March 1, 1977, and are now being
evaluated. Preliminary review of the bids indicates that the cost of these
components can be accommodated within the proposed financing.
36.       VRA plans to retain the services of Acres to assist in the imple-
mentation of the Kpong scheme. The consultants will supervise and manage
construction. Installation of all major electrical and mechanical equipment
would be done by the suppliers, assisted by the civil works contractor.
The transmission line between Kpong and the Volta substation at Tema would
be constructed under a contract covering all materials and construction.
For the proposed transmission line to the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani area, VRA
is making a topographical survey of the transmission route, but has not yet
started design work. No definite construction schedule has been established,
but in order to supply the proposed ECG distribution project in time, all
works would have to be completed by mid-1979. VRA will employ consultants
to design the line and substations. Supervision of construction would be
undertaken by VRA's own personnel, assisted by consultants. VRA will also
employ consultants for implementation of the proposed reactive power com-
pensation, and the additional transmission facilities between Tema and Accra.
The consultants will design the facilities and supervise installation.
Procurement
37.       Except items to be financed by CIDA (para. 34), which would be
contracted in Canada, all other items for the project involving foreign
financing would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Contracts for hydraulic gates and
hoists, which would be covered by the CIDA contribution to the project,
will be awarded after competitive bidding in Canada and are not expected
to cost significantly more than if procured as a result of international
competitive bidding. All items to be financed by the Bank would be con-
tracted though international competitive bidding, the only deviation from
the "Guidelines for Procurement" being that, in the case of items to be
financed jointly with FED and EIB, the date of bid opening shall be the
operative date in establishing the rate of exchange for bid evaluation, in
accordance with FED/EIB guidelines, instead of the date of the decision to
notify the award to the successful bidder. Retroactive financing of about
US$1.0 million is recommended to cover advance procurement after September 1,
1976, of construction equipment needed by VRA for the preliminary works of
Kpong and for the initial phase of resettlement (Schedule 1, para. 4(a),
Loan Agreement).

Disbursement
38.       The proposed Bank loan of US$39.0 million would be disbursed as

Disbursement of loan funds for the power supply to the Sefwi-Wiawso-Bibiani
area would be contingent on design specifications satisfactory to the Bank
having been prepared (Schedule 1, para. 4 (b), Loan Agreement).
Resettlement and Environmental Aspects
39.       The Kpong head pond will cover an area of about 3,700 ha. and will
necessitate the resettlement of about 5,700 people and the provision of com-
pensation for flooded farm lands. The cost of the resettlement and compensa-
tion has been estimated at US$8.2 million. The VRA, which has had consider-
able experience with resettlement as a result of the construction of the
Akosombo power plant in the early 1960s (80,000 people had to be resettled),
is preparing, with the aid of consultants, a detailed plan for resettlement
and compensation. A condition of loan effectiveness is that the plan should
have been completed satisfactory to the Bank. (Section 8.01 (d), Loan
Agreement).
40.       The Kpong head pond, though small when compared with Lake Volta
(870,000 ha.), could result in an increased incidence of schistosomiasis



- 14 -
(bilharzia). However, the project will result in the inundation of the
Senchi and Kpong rapids on the Volta River, which are now breeding areas
of the vector of onchocerciasis (riverblindness) and thus should bring
about a reduction in that disease. To help reduce the schistosomiasis
hazard, piped treated water will be supplied to communities surrounding
the head pond, thus obviating the need to seek supplies directly from the
river, and suitable wharfing facilities for fishermen will also be pro-
vided to permit embarkation without wading. During the construction of
the dam, it is expected that the workforce and local population will be at
considerable risk from the onchocerciasis vector. Hence, application of
chemical deterrants in the breeding sites will be done. Malaria is also
endemic but it is not expected that the Kpong impoundment will significantly
affect its prevalence. Workers from low-prevalence areas and expatriate
staff will, however, be at great risk; therefore, a prophylaxis program is
necessary. Plans for handling expected clinical referrals between the con-
tractor's work force and area hospitals will be worked out; the contractor
is fully responsible for these services and will be paid accordingly.
VRA Finances
41.       Although VRA started operations in 1965, its revenues only became
significant in 1967 when VALCO's aluminum smelter started production. Since
then VRA has been improving its financial performance and has generated
sufficient resources to cover operating and capital requirements plus debt
service and dividends, although it was unable to achieve the 8 percent rate
of return on equity in FY's 74 and 75 as stipulated in the previous Loan
Agreement (Loan 618-GH) (the actual rate achieved was about 6 percent).
Given the larger investment requirements associated with its second major
expansion program, and the need to earn a reasonable return on investment,
VRA is now required to increase tariffs to non-VALCO customers by 10-25
percent in current terms during 1978-1981. During negotiations VRA and the
Government agreed to modify the existing rate of return covenant and to main-
tain tariffs so as to achieve a rate of return on equity of not less than
7 percent in FY77, 8 percent in FY's 78-80 and 9 percent thereafter (Section
5.05, Loan Agreement). Government also agreed that the required VRA tariff
increases will be passed on to ECG's own customers (Section 3.02, Guarantee
Agreement).
42.       VRA's assets need revaluing and during negotiations VRA agreed that
by June 30, 1977, it will revalue its assets as at December 31, 1976, and main-
tain them thereafter on a currently valued basis, according to indices accept-
able to the Bank (Section 5.04, Loan Agreement). VRA's assets were last
revalued in FY71 and then only partially so, since the revaluation was only
applied to assets financed from foreign currency. It has been estimated that
VRA's assets may presently be undervalued by as much as 80 percent which would
decrease the rate of return on average equity (corresponding to the revalued
assets) to about 2-3 percent for FY74 and FY75. However, given the VALCO rate
increase for FY76 and tariff increases to ECG and the mines, the rate of
return in that year would be 9 percent. Should the actual revaluation of
assets yield a different value than the estimated 300 million Cedis, the rate



- 15 -
of return standard would be adjusted proportionately (Section 5.05, Loan
Agreement) so as to insure sufficient internal cash generation to meet VRA's
investment requirements. In order to avoid large and abrupt tariff increases,
Government and VRA will explore the possibility of introducing a rate adjust-
ment formula that would provide for smaller gradual increases on a monthly or
quarterly basis.
43.       With the additional revenue from the rate adjustments, the
financial forecasts to 1984 indicate that VRA's financial position should
continue to be sound and earnings sufficient to adequately meet operating
expenses, contributions to the investment program and continued dividend
payments. Debt service coverage is adequate; in fact, VRA's foreign ex-
change revenues from VALCO and CEB alone are expected to cover fully the
debt servicing obligations.
Benefits, Justifications and Risks
44.       The Kpong project is necessary to meet the growth in demand for
power in Ghana and, as a result of detailed study, has been found to be
the least cost solution for doing so. The annual energy capacity of the
existing hydro facility will be reached by the load demand in 1978. The
Kpong project will add 140 MW firm and 970 GWh per year to the VRA system,
thus providing for normal growth plus a total of 174 GWh of interruptible
supply for industrial heating until 1985 when additional generation facil-
ities will be needed. VRA is well qualified to implement the project and
the costs and financing plan have been prepared after careful analysis by
consultants. Thus, the risks involved are not greater than those normal
for projects of this type.
45.       Principal beneficiaries of Kpong power will be ECG customers
who will consume about 78 percent of the output by 1985. The remaining
22 percent will be consumed by the mines, CEB and Akosombo Township. If
existing tariffs in Ghana were used as a proxy for benefits, the rate of
return on the project would be 7.5 percent. However, current tariffs re-
flect the very low cost of Akosombo. If benefits were assumed to be rep-
resented by long-term marginal cost, the return would be about 11 percent,
although this would still be an inadequate measure of the actual economic
benefits to be obtained by power consumers. While marginal cost pricing is
desirable from the economic point of view to help ensure efficient decision
making, a 70 percent tariff increase would need to be applied to approach
eventually levels based on long-term marginal cost. In the context of the
proposed ECG distribution project, the Government agreed to undertake a
Power Sector Study to be completed for review by the Bank by June 30, 1978;
the purpose of the study would be to derive a tariff structure which would
reflect as closely as possible the costs to the economy of meeting the
demand for electricity and determining the appropriate levels of tariffs
which should be charged to the various categories of VRA and ECG customers,
taking into account social and wider economic considerations.

forty purse seiners; (b) credits to fishermen for purchasing such vessels;
(c) fishing harbor improvement and expansion studies, and (d) the improve-
ment of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation's Boatyard Division.
Following protracted problems over design and price, the number of boats
was reduced from the original 40 to 10, and delivery of the boats has been
completed. A combination of mechanical problems and poor catches by purse
seine methods have resulted in lower income for sub-borrowers. In order to
improve the trawling capacity reliability and reduce time spent under re-
pair, measures are now being discussed to increase the engine power of the
boats and the maintenance facilities of the GIHOC Boatyard, utilizing about
US$500,000 left in the project account. The original Closing Date of
December 31, 1972 has been extended to June 30, 1977 to allow for consultant
advice on the procurement of engines and boatyard equipment.
Cr. No. 205 -     Cocoa Rehabilitation Project:   US$8.5 million
Credit of June 26, 1970
Effective Date: March 12, 1971
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project, principally involving the rehabilitation of 51,000
acres and replanting of 36,000 acres of cocoa, experienced delays mainly due
to poor weather conditions, poor farmer participation, limited availability
of labor, and shortages of insecticides. Project performance last year was
unsatisfactory with only 24 percent of the planting targets (7,000 acres) and
22 percent of the rehabilitation targets (10,000 acres) achieved. Only 62
percent of the original planting target and 35 percent of rehabilitation
target have been achieved to date. The closing date has been extended to
December 31, 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 354 -    Sugar Rehabilitation Project; US$15.6 million
Credit of January 29, 1973
Effective Date: May 31, 1973
Closing Date: March 31, 1979
Although 1975-76 sugar production (12,100 tons) was lower than
appraisal estimates, rehabilitation of factories and expansion of cane
acreage at Asutsuare progressed steadily despite procurement difficulties.
Estimated sugar production for 1976-77 is about 17,150 tons. Appraisal
production estimates have been revised to take account of implementation
delays and it is now expected that full development sugar output of 42,000
tons will be realized in 1980, two years behind schedule.
Cr. No. 438 -    First Highway Project; US$13 million
Credit of November 21, 1973
Effective Date: January 22, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project provides for the rehabilitation of 138 miles of trunk
roads, preparation of a road maintenance program and feasibility studies
to determine future road work requirements and procurement of traffic control
and pavement survey equipment. Due to considerable difficulties in getting
the major item, road rehabilitation, underway, the number of roads were
reduced from the original project provision of 345 miles to the present 138
miles. Recent actions by the Government and its executing agency, the Ghana
Highway Authority (GHA) have resulted in improvement in the overall progress
of the work. The Government has agreed to cover all additional costs which
were caused partly by higher standards of improvement and partly by inflation.
Studies have been satisfactorily completed, a maintenance program is being
implemented under the Second Highway project, and equipment acquisition is
still in progress. It is likely that there will be a delay of two years in
project completion over the appraisal estimate of June 1977.
Cr. No. 499 -     Second Water Supply Project; US$10.4 million
Credit of July 26, 1974
Effective Date: January 7, 1975
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
This project is a follow-up on the first Water Supply project
financed under Credit 160-GH and consists of the construction of an earth
dam at Weija; extension of the distribution system in the Accra/Tema area;
extension of rural water supplies near Accra; and technical assistance
and training. A delay in Credit Effectiveness was due mainly to the delayed
conclusion of a loan agreement between the Government and CIDA which financed
pumping stations and treatment work. The work is substantially behind
schedule due to delays in procurement. For example, the procurement of ADB-
financed large diameter pipes has been delayed more than a year, although
it is now expected that the contract will be shortly awarded. The construction
of the Weija dam is about 80 percent complete but some remaining critical

Page 4 of 6 pages
components may present difficult problems; there are presently under discus-
sion with the Corporation. It is expected that the project will be completed
in June 1980, one year after the appraisal estimate, and that there will be a
substantial cost overrun.
Cr. No. 500 -    Livestock Development Project; US$2.0 million
Credit of July 26, 1974
Effective Date: May 14, 1975
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Project management has been improved following the appointment
of a permanent Managing Director of the Ghana Livestock Company, the approval
of new ranch development plans and the best use of existing finance under the
project. Because of unanticipated difficulties in acquiring necessary land,
and cost overruns resulting from higher cattle prices due mainly to the
Sahelian drought, the Executive Directors approved a revised project descrip-
tion in August 1976. The project now includes: (i) development of two com-
mercial ranches for 4,000 head of cattle, (ii) credit for 20 private live-
stock producers, (iii) the preparation of a follow-up project, and training
for ranch managers. Project costs are estimated at US$2.3 million. Govern-
ment has agreed to provide any additional foreign exchange, above and beyond
that available in the Credit, to help complete the project. The market
prospects for beef are very good and permit the project to be commercially
viable on a substantially smaller scale than at appraisal.
Cr. No. 531 -    Oil Palm Project; US$13.6 million
Credit of March 5, 1975
Effective Date: June 30, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project became effective on June 30, 1976 after a two-year
delay. Approximately 35,000 seedlings would be ready to plant 500 acres
in May 1977. Land will be cleared mechanically to accelerate the planting
program for completion by 1980; land-clearing machinery and initial vehicle
and equipment have been ordered. The managing director, project manager,
and financial controller have been appointed. Nursery and headquarters
building sites have been cleared and a 2-1/2 mile road, which leads to the
site, has been bulldozed and graded. Cost overruns are expected on buildings,
oil mill civil works and equipment because of the long delay in implementa-
tion.
Ln. No. 1122 -   Telecommunications Project; US$23 million
Loan of June 10, 1975
Effective Date: January 23, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Project components include the rehabilitation and expansion of
telephone exchange equipment, improvement and expansion of long distance
telephone facilities and expansion of telex services. Engineering consult-
ants have been appointed and bids for equipment are being evaluated. Project
is progressing according to schedule.

Ln. No. 1180 -   National Investment Bank Proiect; US$10 mill4on
Loan of December 23, 1975
Effective Date: March 2, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project provides for a US$10 million loan to the National
Investment Bank to help finance industrial, tourism and agro-industrial
development projects and to support small and medium scale private enter-
prises. Despite the high inflation and slow economic growth, NIB was able
to maintain its operations at the 1974 level, i.e., total approvals of
021.3 million. Ninety loans were approved for ¢16 million in the industrial
sector. Recovery of arrears is the major problem but the senior management
is continuing its efforts to reduce the portfolio exposure to less than 40
percent.
Cr. No. 1181 -   Ashanti Region Cocoa Project; US$14 million
Loan of December 23, 1975
Effective Date: February 23, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Project consists of replanting and maintaining during the three
year project period 42,500 acres of hybrid cocoa in the Ashanti region.
Credit and training will be provided to farmers; other project components
are the provision of feeder road equipment, consultancy services for de-
signing a survey of the cocoa sector and evaluating seed garden produc-
tion. Field progress is on schedule though some difficulties have been
experienced in finding active farmers. Project performance during 1975-76
was very satisfactory with 96 percent of the 6,000 acres planting targets
achieved. Progress in designing the cocoa sector survey, appointing a seed
garden consultant, completing a farmer input study, and formulating a cocoa
pricing policy has been slow. The Government has obtained additional financ-
ing of US$5.0 million from BADEA for this project.
Cr. No. 594 -    Second Highway Project:   US$10 million Credit
US$18 million Loan of December 23, 1975
Ln No. 1182 -    Effective Date:   March 30, 1976
Closing Date: December 31. 1980
The Loan/Credit became effective March 30, 1976, postponed from
February 23, 1976, due to delay in Government's submission of Legal Opinion
and Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The project is in support of the first 4-
year phase of an 8-year road maintenance program plus rehabilitation of
a short section of trunk road. The main elements are the procurement of
road maintenance equipment and spare parts; assistance to the Ghana Highway
Authority (GHA) in the management and planning of the maintenance program;
and an onlending operation through the Ghana Bank of Housing and Construction
(BHC), with related technical assistance to provide domestic contractors with
foreign exchange to enable them to procure equipment and spare parts to carry

out Ghana Highway Authority maintenance projects; and funds for the rehabili-
tation of the Accra-Nsawam trunk road section. Orders have been placed for
equipment and spare parts, part of the equipment has been received, and the
contract for the Accra-Nsawam road has been awarded, following international
competitive bidding. Screening of domestic contracts for sub-loans from BHC is
under way.
Ln. No. 1291-T - Upper Region Agricultural Development
Project; US$21 million
Loan of June 28, 1976
Effective Date: Not yet effective
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project, the first Bank operation for integrated agricultural
development in Ghana, would provide most of the 125,000 farm families living
in the Upper Region with improved support services, farm inputs and physical
infrastructure. Two principal objectives are to increase farm incomes via
increase in agricultural production and to establish permanent farm support
services. The investment period will be spread over five years, 1976/77 to
1980/81. Date of effectiveness has been extended to March 31, 1977 to
allow time for recruitment of key personnel and the establishment of the
Farmers Services Company.
Ln. No. 1298 -   CIMAO - Regional Clinker Project; US$3.5 million
Loan of June 28, 1976
Effective Date: Not yet effective
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
This is the first Bank regional operation involving the Republic
of Ghana, the Republic of Togo, and the Republic of Ivory Coast. The main
project consists of a clinker plant, with an annual production capacity of
1.2 million tons, to be located in Togo. The Bank has approved a loan of
US$60 million, of which US$3.5 million is loaned to the Government of Ghana
to acquire preferred shares in Ciments de l'Afrique de l'ouest (CIMAO), an
entity which will own and operate the above project. Loans of US$3.5 mil-
lion each have been given to the Governments of Togo and Ivory Coast for
the same purpose. Procurement of the industrial complex is proceeding
satisfactorily. The main mechanical contract was signed in October 1976.
Recruitment efforts have started. Date of effectiveness has been extended
to May 31, 1977.
