In addition, despite\n            substantial institutional development, and satisfactory\n            performance by the Borrower, the Bank performance is rated\n            as marginally satisfactory, because supervision reporting\n            was incomplete, and little was done to support follow-up\n            funding generation. This is therefore the main lesson drawn\n            from this project. During the early stages of the pilot\n            phase of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), it was\n            implicitly assumed that environmental follow-up funding,\n            would supersede the initial GEF input to support maintenance\n            operations. However, this assumption proved incorrect,\n            therefore, after ten years of experience, it is now\n            suggested that GEF should review the possibility to ensure\n            long-term support to protect resources of high global\n            biodiversity value, considering a broader view of\n            biodiversity, and conservation issues. A more general review\n            on how to ensure sustainability of globally valuable\n            bio-resources, should be raised at the tenth anniversary of\n            the Rio Conference."}, "docdt": "2001-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
