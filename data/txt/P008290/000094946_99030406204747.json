The key lessons learned are: a) The\n            social assessment component of the management plan conducted\n            in the last year of the project revealed that public\n            awareness of the project objectives and activities was weak.\n            Local residents valued the park's conservation\n            objectives and would be more supportive of the national park\n            if they received some of the benefits. As a result, the\n            national park is improving its communication with local\n            communities. Participation of local communities would have\n            been more successful if the social assessment had been\n            conducted earlier in the project. b) The project was\n            strongly oriented to achieving results, especially in\n            technical subjects. The project design could have been\n            improved by identifying discrete results to be achieved at\n            different stages of the project, and used as measures of\n            success. c) Professional development and training activities\n            were an important ingredient of the project's success.\n            d) Early in the project, a needs assessment of the Project\n            Managing Unit could have identified the need for training in\n            the office management and business skills needed to\n            implement the project. This could have reduced the initial\n            delays in implementation and given greater time to the\n            substantive work to be done."}, "docdt": "1998-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
