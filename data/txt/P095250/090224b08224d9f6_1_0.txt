                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The proposed Project will be an integral part of a larger and longer-term program of the Government to improve the effectiveness of health and social assistance
                         systems in Moldova. In addition to the proposed IDA credit, several donors including IDA, EU, SIDA, DfID, CEB and relevant UN agencies, will through coordinated but
                         parallel financed operations, support the Government initiatives in this area. The overall project objective is to promote the Government's program to increase access to
                         quality and efficient health services with the aim of decreasing premature mortality and disability for the local population and improve the targeting of social transfers
                         and services to the poor in line with the MTEF for 2007-2009.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         1. Project Development Objective (PDO) and Intermediate Outcome Indicators: Progress towards the intermediate outcome indicators is good. Progress of PDO 1 indicators (access
                         to health services) remains the same since the last review. There is progress in PDO 2 indicator regarding the development of Social Assistance Automated Information (SAAIS)
                         system.

                         2. Disbursement: Of the total IDA credits of US$27.2 million (original and additional financing), US$ 24.5 million (90%) have been disbursed and US$1.7 million (6.2%) are committed.
                         All funds are expected to be disbursed by Project closing.

                         3. Civil Works: There have been some delays in the completion of the new surgical block in the Republican Hospital, mainly due to uncertainties about the specific equipment to be
                         procured through bilateral JICA funding which is outside the project's control (specificities of such equipment would dictate selected aspects of civil works). The Government intends
                         to open the new surgical block partially in the first half of 2014. Construction of the remaining 35 rural health centers (RHCs) is underway. In addition, there are two newly planned
                         RHCs -- in Mingir (Hînceşti rayon) and Gangura (Ialoveni rayon), where construction will not start before spring 2014. However, MoH guaranteed to complete the design work as well
                         as the bidding process during the coming months and finish civil works before Project closing date in August 2014.

                         4. Hospital reforms: A workshop on (i) hospital regionalization, (ii) decentralization of chemotherapy and (iii) long-term care was organized in September 2013 with the support of the
                         World Bank. The MoH is developing a new health strategy which incorporates the recommendations of the consultancies on hospital reform financed by the project.

                         5. New hospital payment mechanism: during the first year of nation-wide Diagnostic-Related Groups (DRG) implementation, hospital budgets are still structured to maintain the
                         historical trend (e.g. DRG being budget-neutral). A gradual increase in DRG share in the hospital budget will be gradually introduced over time. MOH was advised to develop a road
                         map to increase the share of DRG in hospital payment mechanisms over the years. Technical assistance is underway to build capacity of the National Health Insurance Fund
                         (CNAM) in managing, analyzing and auditing DRG payments to hospitals.

                         6. Social Assistance and Welfare: The development of the Social Assistance Automated Information System (SAAIS) was completed. SAAIS has now entered the production stage.
                         Training of Local Public Authorities on Ajutor Social Program was carried out in August 2013 with the project support.
