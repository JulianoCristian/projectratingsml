                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The proposed Project will be an integral part of a larger and longer-term program of the Government to improve the effectiveness of health and social assistance
                         systems in Moldova. In addition to the proposed IDA credit, several donors including IDA, EU, SIDA, DfID, CEB and relevant UN agencies, will through coordinated but
                         parallel financed operations, support the Government initiatives in this area. The overall project objective is to promote the Government's program to increase access to
                         quality and efficient health services with the aim of decreasing premature mortality and disability for the local population and improve the targeting of social transfers
                         and services to the poor in line with the MTEF for 2007-2009.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Good implementation progress was observed in all project activities, including civil works. Project has been extended to August 30, 2014. Assurance was made by the Ministry of
                         Health (MoH) that all project activities will be completed by the new project closing date. Current project disbursement is 100% of the original project proceedings, and 36% of
                         Additional Financing amount under the health component.

                         Civil works: In Rural Health Centers (RHCs) which have been renovated/constructed under the project, facility functionality and energy efficiency have significantly improved, creating
                         a favorable environment for health workers to provide services. Civil works for the remaining 35 RHCs have been contracted. The MoH submitted a proposal for two additional RHCs
                         which was approved by the World Bank. Construction of the Republican Hospital’s surgical block has made good progress. The Government has been able to secure financing for
                         new equipment from the Austrian government and JICA. The new surgical work is expected to be operational from October 2013.

                         Hospital Reforms: The World Bank fully supports the steps suggested by the consulting firm Sanigest for optimizing the hospital and laboratory systems in the Northern region. The
                         third and final report from Sanigest is expected to include a discussion on HR policies and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) feasibility for the proposed new regional hospital in
                         Edinets. Hospital overcapacity issue for the rest of the country may be potentially addressed by creating a hospital consortia/networks through contracting the consortia/network
                         rather than with individual hospital.

                         New hospital payment system: Implementation of nationwide DRG-based payment system for hospital care has been taken over by the National Health Insurance Company. In
                         addition, the MoH has reallocated project funds in order to continue supporting the implementation of the DRG system in Moldova. However, all functions to manage the DRG system
                         (IT, audit, etc.) are not yet fully coordinated. Therefore, further institutional strengthening is needed to ensure the availability of DRG-related information and their effective analysis to
                         inform decision making.

                         E.health strategy: The development of the e-Health Strategy is in its final stage.

                         Social Assistance and Welfare: The implementation of this component has picked up momentum. Over the last few months, the new social assistance software has been designed
                         and installation started, the hardware procurement and installation of equipment in all local welfare offices across the country was finalized, the functional review of the MoLSPF has
                         been completed. Finally, an information campaign on Ajutor Social, the new targeted social assistance cash benefit program, has been carried out. Although the plan to finish the
                         project activities seems to be feasible, and both the MoLSPF team and the new Materna’s software sub-contractor (BAAS Systems) team have been strengthened, very close
                         monitoring of the process is still needed to resolve any potential issues.
