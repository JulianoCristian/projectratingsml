F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall project development objective (PDO) was to promote the government’s program to
increase access to quality and efficient health services with the aim of decreasing premature
mortality and disability for the local population and improve the targeting of social transfers and
services to the poor in line with the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for 2007–
2009.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDOs were not revised in the official documents.

                                                                    the credit closing date.

1.    Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

 1.    The project was designed based on lessons of the previous Bank-supported projects in the
 health and social protection sectors, including: (a) Health Investment Fund Project (IDA-34080);
 (b) Social Protection Management Project (IDA-32610); (c) AIDS Control Project (IDA-
 H0460); (d) Public Financial Management Technical Assistance (IDA-40820); and (e) Public
 Administration Reform Project (MULT-56601). In addition: (a) Bank-financed analytical work
 and advisory services (Health Policy Note, Social Assistance Note and Poverty Update) laid the
 conceptual basis for this project; (b) the project supported the Country Assistance Strategy 2004
 objectives to increase access of the poor to health care services and to improve targeting of social
 assistance; and (c) the Poverty Reduction Support Credit Programs (PRSC 1, 2, 3) complemented
 and supported the health sector reform agenda through their policy agenda, which included the
 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), Social Assistance Reform Action Plan for
 improved poverty targeting, and direct contracting with primary health care (PHC) providers by
 the National Health Insurance Company (NHIC).

1.1   Context at Appraisal

 2.    The Government of Moldova demonstrated its commitment to the public’s well-being by
 increasing funding for social services and improving the efficiency of public spending in
 accordance with the MTEF 2007–2009. Initial steps were made to: (a) improve the
 administration of pension and social insurance and to eliminate arrears in payment of pensions
 by establishment of the National Social Insurance House; (b) improve efficiency of operation by
 consolidation of health infrastructure; (c) make hospitals self-governing entities and extensions
 of the primary care network; and (d) establish the NHIC. However, there were significant issues
 within the health and social assistance systems related to (a) still adequate but old infrastructure;
 (b) outdated or missing equipment; and (c) insufficiency and inadequate distribution of health
 care staff, particularly in rural areas. In addition, access to quality health care services was in
 favor of the largely better-off urban population.

 3. Health indicators remained well below European Union (EU) averages, as evidenced by a
 life expectancy of 68 years, 12 years shorter than the EU average and 6 years shorter than for
 new EU-10 nationals. Although there was progress in infant and maternal mortality during the
 last decade, the infant mortality rate remained 2.5 times higher, and the maternal mortality rate
 4 times higher, than in the EU. Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, caused double
 the share of avoidable mortality in the working age population compared to the EU-10.
 Continued high incidence rates for tuberculosis (11 times higher than for the EU) and HIV/AIDS
 (1.3 times higher than for the EU) posed risks to the population in Moldova as well as for the
 neighboring EU countries (as addressed under the European Neighborhood Policy). Therefore,
 improvements in the quality of health services would decrease avoidable mortality and disability
 and improve labor productivity over the long term.

 4.    Health insurance coverage was limited and not universal. Health insurance covered 76
 percent of the population, although nearly half of the population aged 25–44 was not covered by
 health insurance. The government contributed close to 65 percent of the resources of the NHIC



                                                 1
to cover benefits for public sector employees and poor and vulnerable groups; the nonpublic
sector working age population was partially included in the health insurance.

5.    Health financing reforms did not change budget management and contracting. Although
there was a reimbursement norm for each patient treated in each department, in practice volumes
in the contracts were adjusted so that historical budget allocations would be preserved. Contracts
were not designed to meet specific objectives in terms of costs per unit of service and the quality
of service, resulting in lack of motivation for the providers.

6.    The health system informal payments and co-payments remained high. The public
subsidies to health insurance helped decrease the share of private expenditure in total financing
of the health system from 50 percent in 2003 to 42 percent in 2005. However, while formal co-
payments for health services decreased as a share of private expenditures, informal co-payments
remained unchanged and constituted US$35 million per year, a large amount for a relatively
small country (PAD, 2007).

7.    The governance structure was changing at the time of appraisal. The role of the Ministry
of Health (MoH) changed with the establishment of the NHIC to finance health services and
decentralization of management of health facilities to local governments. The MoH was no
longer an administrator of a network of facilities, but the policy maker and steward of the health
system, while it managed directly the tertiary care, “republican” facilities in Chisinau.
Consequently, the MoH and the system had to consider: (a) focusing on health promotion, policy,
and regulatory functions; (b) improving the level of financing to the sector and the efficient use
of available resources; (c) improving the quality and effectiveness of health services; (d) further
rationalizing excessive hospital and specialized care facilities, mostly in a dire need of renovation,
refurbishment, and upgrading because of lack of capital investment and maintenance; (e)
providing support with infrastructure and basic laboratory and medical equipment for PHC
services; and (f) motivating the health workforce, which relied on informal payments (to cope
with low salaries), and promoting a clinical practice environment and incentives for provision of
quality care.

8.    The social assistance and welfare system was characterized by fragmentation of social
assistance transfers, making it difficult to reach the poor. There were 15 social assistance benefits
with a range of eligibility criteria and processing procedures, which included specific benefits
for children in difficult conditions, war veterans, individuals with special conditions, etc. These
benefits were small on average and represented 2–3 percent of household income. Moreover,
eligibility for social assistance benefits was based on categories of people (veterans, orphans,
disabled, etc.) that were no longer effective in determining the income needs of households.
Therefore, social transfers were unevenly distributed across different socioeconomic groups
instead of being concentrated among the poorest. In fact, much of social assistance was provided
to middle- and upper-income groups. The government did not have a unified database that
combined all benefit types received by each recipient and could not monitor and evaluate the
entire social assistance system due to fragmented data sets.

9.   The Health Services and Social Assistance Project (Cr. 4320-MD) was approved on June 7,
2007, in the amount of SDR 11.3 million (US$17 million equivalent) and became effective on


                                                 2
 September 5, 2007. In addition, in 2008 the government of Moldova received a grant from the
 Global Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (TF-92641), which was processed as an
 Additional Financing in the amount of US$7.0 million equivalent. The grant was approved by
 the Board on August 8, 2008, and closed on August 28, 2011, fully disbursed. Another additional
 financing (Cr. 5023-MD) was approved on December 8, 2011, in the amount of SDR 6.6 million
 (US$10.2 million equivalent), and became effective on May 25, 2012.

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

 10. The overall objective of the project was to promote the government’s program to increase
 access to quality and efficient health services with the aim of decreasing premature mortality and
 disability for the local population and improving the targeting of social transfers and services to
 the poor in line with the MTEF for 2007–2009.

 11. The wording of the PDO in the main text of the project appraisal document (PAD) included
 the following phrase “in line with the MTEF for 2007-2009”, whereas this phrase was missing
 in the PDO formulation in Annex 3 of the PAD, the financing agreement, and the project paper
 on Additional Financing (2011).

 12. The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the performance indicators
 corresponding to each main sector – health and social assistance – supported by the project.
 Original PDO indicators were:
    The trend of population satisfied with access to the health care system compared with the
      previous year;
    Management of arterial hypertension: number of patients with confirmed arterial
      hypertension under control/surveillance with blood pressure target level up to 140/80
      mmHg achieved and maintained;
    Number of consultations per person per year by socioeconomic group;
    Discharge rate per doctor by hospital category and by region;
    Share of largest social assistance transfer received by the bottom 40 percent of households
      in terms of income (the largest transfer is nominal compensation for heat and utilities);
    Share of the largest social assistance transfer that leaks to the top 40 percent of households
      in terms of income.

1.3   Revised PDO and Key Indicators

 13. The PDO was not revised. However, the project’s Results Framework was revised at the
 time of the Additional Financing (Cr. 5023-MD, approved on December 8, 2011) and during the
 project formal restructuring (April 18, 2013). The AF formally removed all the outcome
 indicators except for “Number of consultation per person per year by socioeconomic group”,
 which was removed later during the project restructuring and changed intermediate indicators.
 New outcome and intermediate indicators (as described in detail in the data sheet and Annex 10)
 were introduced.




                                                3
 14. The AF grant (TF-92641) under the Global Food Price Crisis Response Program (approved
 on August 15, 2008, and closed on August 31, 2011) introduced additional intermediate
 indicators to the project, which were monitored within the duration of the Trust Fund (TF):
    Percentage of pregnant woman and mothers who received nutrient supplements before their
       infant reached 8 weeks of age;
    Percentage of children under 2 years of age who received nutrient supplements;
    Number of beneficiaries who received adequate food and nutrition through the cash
       transfer program.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

 15. The direct beneficiaries of the project investments in the health sector were to be the
 communities benefiting from the construction and refurbishment of PHC facilities and a
 modernized hospital. Poor people were to benefit more from PHC interventions, including
 construction of PHC facilities, training of health staff, and provision of equipment. Physicians,
 nurses, laboratory technicians, hospital managers, and key government stakeholders benefited
 from the capacity-building activities implemented under the project. Longer-term benefits were
 expected for the whole of society from the increase in health insurance coverage, resulting in
 reduction of out-of-pocket expenses and informal co-payments made by the poor, promotion of
 healthy lifestyles, and prevention and early management of chronic diseases, which in most cases
 affect mainly the poor. The health staff at these facilities would benefit from improved
 infrastructure, strengthened clinical capacity, improved regulatory environment, and greater
 institutional capacity for better governance and optimization, as well as increased trust in the
 health system among the general population.

 16. Direct beneficiaries of investments in the social protection sector under the project were to
 be the populations that were most in need of social assistance, who would benefit from the
 unified social benefits system and targeted social transfers to the poor. Social assistance
 authorities, social workers at the primaria level, local authorities, and the staff of the Ministry of
 Labor, Social Protection, and Family (MoLSPF) were to benefit from training, retraining,
 seminars, and other activities that provided capacity building and enhanced human resources.

1.5      Original Components

 17.     The project supported the following three components:

      (a) Component 1: Health system modernization (US$11.5 million at appraisal and
          US$20.98 million after restructuring of December 2011). The component was to support
          priorities identified for implementation in the first years of the Government’s National
          Health Strategy 2007–2017. The component financed four subcomponents:

         (i) Capacity development and sector regulation, aimed at increasing policy development
         capacity in health service planning, finance, and quality enhancement, as well as skills
         development in analysis, monitoring, and evaluation of policies at the MoH and associated
         agencies, including institutionalization of National Health Accounts (NHA);



                                                  4
         (ii) Health care financing and provider payment, to broaden the coverage of health
         insurance and improve the incentives facing service-providers through development and
         implementation of a strategy and actions to increase health insurance coverage and reduce
         informal payments, and a new health care provider payment system based on diagnosis-
         related groups (DRGs);
         (iii) Primary health care development, to improve the quality of care services delivered
         in rural areas through rehabilitation and construction of health centers, provision of
         equipment, and preparation and implementation of working procedures and guidelines;
         (iv) Hospital capacity assessment and modernization, to modernize the hospital network
         in order to optimize hospital capacity and improve operational efficiency in Chisinau, and
         to assess national capacity needs to guide future investments through preparation of a
         National Hospital Master Plan.

      (b) Component 2: Social assistance and welfare (US$5 million and US$4.97 million after
          restructuring of December 2011). The component was to support a targeted social
          assistance program to improve the effectiveness of cash benefits and social welfare services
          in combating poverty, and to improve the efficiency of delivered social assistance services.

      (c) Component 3: Institutional support (US$0.5 million and US$1.25 after restructuring of
          December 2011). The component aimed at building administrative capacity in the
          implementing agencies in order to improve overall management, monitoring and
          evaluation, and fiduciary management, including operational reviews, performance audits,
          and procurement.

1.6      Revised or Added Components

 18. The following component was added to the project as part of the AF grant from the Global
 Food Crisis Response Trust Fund under the Global Food Price Crisis Response Program
 (approved on August 15, 2008) to support an urgent response to the food price crisis through
 additional activities not anticipated in the initial project design:

         Component 4: Protecting health and nutritional status (US$7 million). The component
         mainly provided financing to cover expenses related to (a) procurement of commodities
         (food and nutritional supplements) for pregnant or lactating women and children under 3
         years of age; and (b) cash transfers to specialized institutions, which provided food to
         children, handicapped people, the homeless, orphans, the elderly, and victims of domestic
         violence, and other vulnerable groups to compensate for food price increases during the
         2008/2009 winter season.

1.7      Other Significant Changes

 19. The project was restructured twice and granted a cumulative extension of 36 months from
 the original Closing Date of August 31, 2011:
    The first amendment, following a letter from the government requesting an extension of
       the financing agreement, dated May 20, 2011, led to an extension of the Closing Date from
       August 31, 2011, to August 31, 2013. The project was restructured as follows: (a) the RF


                                                   5
          was revised, and key performance indicators changed toward outcomes that were
          measurable and more closely aligned with the project activities; and (b) the project
          description was modified to include the new activities financed under the additional
          financing. Additional financing for the project (US$10.2 million) was approved in
          December 2011, with a Closing Date of August 31, 2013. The additional funds were to
          support the expansion of original activities: (a) completion of refurbishment work on PHC
          facilities; (b) completion of technical assistance work on hospital and PHC reforms; and
          (c) wider-scale introduction and application of information technologies for the social
          assistance system.
         The second amendment, in a letter of February 11, 2013, extended the Closing Date from
          August 31, 2013, to August 31, 2014. The extension was necessary to complete
          (a) international and local technical assistance for the implementation of the new payment
          system for hospitals (DRG system); (b) construction of two health centers in addition to
          the 35 initially planned (Magdacesti health center in Criuleni rayon, and Mingir health
          center in Hincesti rayon); and (c) development and implementation of 15 standardized
          clinical protocols to family doctors’ workplaces (in addition to 60 protocols).

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

 20. The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) team rates the design and
 quality at entry as Moderately Satisfactory for the following reasons:

 21. Soundness of background analysis. Preparation was based on extensive research and
 discussions with other donor organizations. The Bank team carried out a number of analytical
 studies, including social sector chapters in the public expenditure review; the prepared Health
 Policy Note, Social Assistance Note, and Poverty Update; and analysis of consulted documents
 prepared by other donors and the government. The background analysis based on analytical work
 and already implemented projects provided a solid base to identify issues in the health and social
 sectors, reform actions that had taken place, the challenges to be addressed, and development of
 a set of options for further reforms. In cooperation with the donor organizations – the United
 Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the U.K. Department for International Development
 (DFID), the EU, and the World Health Organization (WHO) – the directions to be taken by the
 wide-scale reforms of the health and social assistance systems were identified and agreed upon,
 to be addressed by the partners within their respective projects.

 22. Key lessons learned. The project design incorporated several key lessons learned from the
 design and implementation of projects in the region, and derived from the then recent Health
 Investment Fund Project and Social Protection Management Project. Key lessons of the Health
 Investment Fund Project were: (a) the project should be implemented by government structures
 to avoid weak ownership and accountability by government, which can occur when the project
 is implemented by a project implementation unit; (b) all stakeholders, providers, and
 communities should be involved during project activities, specifically in the process of primary
 care investments, which helps build consensus at the district level; (c) significant value is added
 by investment in PHC; and (d) flexibility and coherent work between the Bank and the client in


                                                  6
identifying problems and looking for solutions during project implementation creates a
trustworthy environment and achieve desired results.

23. Quality enhancement review (QER). The review took place on March 5, 2007, and
concluded that it was important: (a) to link health and social assistance components, for example
by including poverty in the health indicators listed in the results matrix; (b) to improve
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of health components through measuring utilization of the
PHC system by the poor and the morbidity rates for chronic diseases; and (c) to obtain a
government decision on local management of the social assistance system so that social workers
can put information on targeting into the database. The recommendations of the QER were for
the most part incorporated into the design of the project and addressed in the PAD. However, the
poverty related health indicator was dropped from the RF (AF, IDA 50230, December 2011) due
to the fact that available data from the MOH was not disaggregated by socio-economic groups.

24. Assessment of project design. The project design was guided by an intensive consultative
preparation process. The Bank team visited Moldova frequently to engage a wide range of
counterparts in order to ensure that the scope and content of the project was well understood and
accepted. Regular discussions were conducted with the key donors represented in the country
that were engaged in the social sectors. Despite deep analysis of health sector needs and careful
preparation, the project design was complex. The project design did not set up a sound M&E
system and the local capacity of the implementing partners was overestimated. As a consequence,
the RF was further changed at the later stage during project restructuring through revising the
outcome indicators.

25. Other considerations during project preparation. The project was originally planned as
two separate projects (health and social assistance), but due to the merger of the MoH and
MoLSPF into a single ministry, the two sectors were jointly prepared within one ministry.
Although the ministry was later once again split into two ministries, it was decided to proceed
with one project to ensure an intersectoral approach and reduce the costs of project management
for the government. In addition, the project team considered investment in primary care only,
rather than in primary and hospital care. However, due to the increased funding for primary care
provided under the EU Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States
(TACIS), and considering the necessity for improving hospital sector efficiency, the government
and the team agreed to include a component on hospital modernization.

26. Alignment with development priorities. The objective of the project was in accordance
with the development priorities of the Government of Moldova and the Bank. The project was
designed to focus on the most critical issues of the existing government strategy for development
of the health and the social protection sectors, with a long-term view towards implementing the
reform agenda. Specifically, the project design addressed: (i) health financing challenges facing
the health sector and health insurance coverage; (ii) capacity building required for ensuring long
term positive effects of reforms in both sectors; as well (iii) establishing a transparent system for
social assistance services. Similarly, the project design was aligned with the 2004 Country
Assistance Strategy (Report No. 28556-MD) to increase access to health services by the poor, to
enhance the quality, efficiency, and coverage of health services and to improve targeting, cash
social assistance, and to invest in institutions that would target social assistance to the poor.

                                                7
 Moreover, the project proposed improvements in social services that were in line with the
 government’s plans within the MTEF and the policy objectives of the Poverty Reduction Support
 Credit operations in the country.

2.2         Implementation

 27. The ICR rates overall implementation as Moderately Satisfactory. The project was
 successful in delivering most of the outputs and achieving for the most part its expected outcomes
 (see details in section 3.2, Annex 2, the data sheet and Annex 10). Although the project
 encountered significant delays in the first three years of project implementation, the performance
 was rated Satisfactory for both project Development Objective (PDO) and Implementation
 Progress (IP). The lack of implementation progress towards achieving PDO was stated only in
 November 2011, when it was judged that the PDO could not be fully achieved as some indicators
 did not meet the targets, leading to downgrading of both ratings to Moderately Satisfactory.

 28. At the same time, implementation of the project activities accelerated by the end of 2011
 and about 70 percent of allocations were disbursed. Responding to the request of the Government
 of Moldova to provide additional financing to cover a financing gap for rehabilitation of PHCs
 and complete the activities under the original Credit, as well as to scale-up implementation of
 new activities in support of the healthcare and social assistance services’ reform, an Additional
 Financing (IDA 50230) was approved in December 2011. The project description was modified
 to include the new activities as well as the result framework was revised to adjust performance
 indicators towards outcomes to be measurable and aligned with project activities.
 Implementation of activities under the AF were progressing well, including: (i) study on hospital
 regionalization; (ii) construction of additional PHC facilities; (iii) study on development of long-
 term care and geriatric services; (iv) training of PHC doctors in management of health facilities
 and etc. The project implementation showed an overall good progress with the IP rated as
 Satisfactory but the PDO Moderately Satisfactory; some of the PDO indicators still were difficult
 to achieve.

 29. Thus, the project went through level 2 restructuring in April 2013, extending the project
 closing date and revising the Results Framework (RF). The extension allowed for the completion
 of the rehabilitation work in PHC facilities, as well as a few technical assistance and training
 activities.

      (a)      Negative Factors and Events That Influenced Project Achievements

 30. Key factors that negatively influenced implementation progress at times were: (a)
 governmental or political changes over the project implementation period; (b) high turnover of
 staff at the MoH; (c) opposition of stakeholders to difficult reforms (for example hospital
 restructuring); and (d) lack of MoH strategic communication and engagement with other
 stakeholders to pursue the reforms.

 31. Perhaps the changes in the structure of the PHC services (provision of financial and
 administrative autonomy to PHC providers) led to overloading the family doctors and PHC



                                                 8
 doctors, who were unable to dedicate sufficient time to prevention and early detection of the
 above-mentioned diseases or non-communicable diseases in general.

 32. There was also a structural issue with data quality, which the project could not fully address.
 Therefore, the results indicators relative to service coverage should be read with some caution.

      (b)      Positive Factors and Events That Influenced Project Achievements

 33. Despite implementation issues and delays, the project successfully completed envisaged
 activities. The Government showed dedication to the reforms in health and in the social
 protection sectors despite relatively weak capacity, frequent staff changes, and political tensions

 34. The Bank and the Government teams demonstrated flexibility, within the project
 development objectives, to address pressing implementation issues and to achieve common
 grounds for the ways forward.

 35. The project was implemented in close collaboration with other international organizations.
 For example, the construction of the new surgical block for the Republican Clinical Hospital
 under the project was greatly complimented by the EU Neighborhood Grant and the equipment
 was provided by the Japanese Government. In addition, the WHO significantly supported
 through provision of expertise to a number of studies and strategic documents developed under
 the project, such as the study on extending population coverage with mandatory health insurance
 which contributed to the increase in health insurance coverage.

2.3         Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

 36. Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E are rated Moderately Satisfactory for
 reasons elaborated below.

 37. Design. The original project design presented health outcome and satisfaction indicators
 that proved impossible to track, and were very loosely related to the actual activities financed
 by the project. The original RF in the PAD consisted of 6 PDO indicators and 12 intermediate
 indicators and was weak and overly ambitious for a number of indicators and targets to monitor
 and achieve them. Adequate consideration was not given to ensure quality at entry. No baseline
 data were available, and in fact several indicators were not measurable and had to be revised by
 restructuring of the project. An M&E plan was developed and agreed with the counterparts,
 including responsible institutions for data collection.

 38. Implementation. Overly complex project design involving multiple components and
 implementing agencies, as well as over-estimation of implementing capacity resulted in lack of
 ability to correctly monitor project achievements especially at the beginning of the project. A
 number of important decisions was taken during introduction of the AF and the restructuring of
 the original project. The RF was revised during restructuring to promote a more effective
 monitoring of progress towards achievement of PDO; outcome and output indicators were also


                                                 9
 reconsidered. Finally, the RF included 9 PDO indicators and 19 intermediate outcome indicators.
 This evaluation finds that PDO indicators 1, 2, 4, and 6 (see data sheet) were still too ambitious
 and difficult to achieve over the life span of the project. The baseline data for these indicators
 were already high, and the target data to achieve them were little higher, by 11 to 21 percent
 from the baseline. The restructuring tried to use PDO indicators that were more closely related
 to the PDO (improving quality and efficiency of services), but were equally constrained by the
 poor quality of the existing official health statistics. However, the intermediate indicators were
 reasonable and focused on showing the final results of implemented activities.

 39. The AF (December, 2011) dropped five PDO indicators out of six and one was changed,
 because they were not measurable or inconsistent with the project design and also to reflect the
 newly introduced activities. Majority of the intermediate indicators were revised, some merged
 and several new indicators were introduced (Annex 10).

 40. The project restructuring (April, 2013) resulted in further enhancement of RF, and
 introduction of four new PDO indicators; the intermediate indicators were not changed and only
 one was moved to the PDO indicator (Annex 10).

 41. Considering the fact that the M&E system was neglected at the beginning of the project,
 there was no real ownership of it along with poor data collection and weak reporting. However,
 as a result of major efforts, the RF, monitoring and reporting was improved and remained
 satisfactory for the remaining period of project implementation.

 42. Utilization. Generally, M&E was well used by both ministries, but starting from a very
 low baseline. A Policy and Human Resources Development Fund grant for project preparation
 supported strengthening of the framework and methodologies, and training of staff in M&E. On
 the basis of the data collected and analyzed, various strategic documents were prepared to assist
 the MoH with the short- and long-term plans in tackling various issues in the health sector.
 Similarly, for social assistance, data were collected from the household budget survey by the
 National Bureau of Statistics to monitor the results. The M&E framework for the MoLSPF was
 established under a DFID program and included project-specific indicators. In addition, it was
 particularly important for the social assistance system to regularly review, analyze, and verify
 the electronic data collected through the new system of electronic administration of social
 assistance.

2.4   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

 43. Environmental analysis. This was a category B project, which trigged Safeguard Policy
 OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment). An environmental analysis conducted during
 preparation identified issues to be monitored during project implementation with regard to
 demolition works, choice of construction materials, waste and sewerage systems, and health care
 waste management. As a result of the Environmental Management Plan, actions were introduced
 to diminish the risks in the design, planning, and supervision of the construction and renovation
 of health care facilities (PHC centers and surgical block), as well as any risks pertaining to their
 use. In addition, the main principles and guidelines for health care waste management were
 presented in two national documents: National Action Plan for Health Care Waste Management

                                                10
 and Regulation Regarding Medical Waste Management. During implementation, the MoH
 ensured that all selected subprojects had been assessed from an environmental viewpoint and
 that the contracting companies operated in compliance with national and World Bank
 environmental requirements. Project supervision showed that the Environmental Management
 Plan requirements were followed by contractors and that no complaints were recorded by the
 MoH’s Environmental Inspectorate and supervising engineers. Moreover, all new PHC facilities
 are accessible by people with physical disabilities, which is an important structural improvement
 compared to older buildings.

 44. Environmental impacts. The project did not have significant or irreversible negative
 environmental impacts during the construction phase of the facilities. Environmental impacts
 during the construction and renovation phase were typical of all small- and medium-scale
 rehabilitation and construction activities and were limited to the sites identified within the project.
 Constructed and renovated PHC facilities were situated on State-owned land plots with user
 rights already granted to the medical institutions operating on those plots.

 45. Financial management. The Budget, Finance and Insurance Department of the MoH and
 the Economic, Financial, and Accounting Department of the MoLSPF had overall responsibility
 for the project financial management and contract management. The financial arrangements at
 both ministries including accounting and reporting, planning and budgeting, internal control
 procedures, counterpart funding, disbursement, financial manual and procedures, and external
 audits. They were considered to be sufficient and were rated Satisfactory throughout
 implementation, but this was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in the last financial review
 (January 2014) due to accounting software not being fully implemented. External audits were
 prepared and issued on time and have been rated as unqualified. The FY 2013 external audit was
 finalized and sent to the Bank in June 2014. Disbursements under the project proceeded generally
 as planned. As of December 2014 (end of the grace period), US$27.46 million equivalent had
 been disbursed from the credit and US$7.0 million equivalent from the grant. Withdrawal
 applications were prepared on a regular basis and supporting documentation was comprehensive.

 46. Procurement. Procurement was rated Satisfactory for most of the project’s
 implementation period. For short periods it was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory.
 Procurement Management was carried out by procurement specialists. The Procurement Plan
 was updated as required. Procurement under the project included civil works, medical and office
 equipment, furniture, medical supplies, and consulting services.

2.5    Postcompletion Operation and Next Phase

 47. This project was followed by a new Bank-supported operation in the health sector. The
 new Health Transformation Project (IDA-5469 and IDA-5470) builds on previous experience
 and supports the government’s agenda for further reforms in the health sector. The project was
 approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on May 22, 2014 and is one of the
 first Program for Results (PforR) operations for the Europe and Central Asia Region. The PDO
 is to contribute to reducing key risks for non-communicable diseases and improving efficiency
 of health services in Moldova.

3.        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

     48. The relevance of objectives, design, and implementation is rated Substantial. Increasing
     access to health services by the poor, and improving the quality, efficiency, and coverage of
     health services with the focus on PHC services and financial sustainability, as well as improving
     and targeting provision of the social assistance benefits to the most in need was a high priority
     for the Government of Moldova at the beginning of the project and remained the same at the
     completion. These goals were presented in the Country Assistance Strategy (FY05-08) as high
     priority for the government and the Bank. The PDO was closely connected to the priorities of
     the national health and social assistance strategies approved in 2004, as part of the Economic
     Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2004-2006). The project has fully supported
     these goals, improving PHC service delivery, increasing capacity for policy planning and
     regulation, strengthening health financing and improving targeting mechanism for social
     assistance benefits. Furthermore, the project has served to address key challenges under the
     development of human capital, explicitly described in Moldova National Development Strategy
     (2008-2011) and the Country Partnership Strategy (FY09-12). Thus, project activities were
     directed to (i) improve quality of health services through further infrastructure optimization,
     expanding the health insurance coverage and to (ii) provide efficiency of targeting social
     assistance. The project design and implemented activities were perfectly aligned with the
     Healthcare Development Strategy (2008-2017).

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

     49. This evaluation of project efficacy assesses the achievement of the two main PDOs related
     to the health and the social protection sectors and is based on the achievement of the PDO
     indicators, according to administrative data from MOH, MoLSPF and NHIC. It is also based on
     the analysis of the accomplishment of intermediate indicators (Table 1) and the contribution of
     project activities to the achievement of the PDOs, as well as the linkages for each of the two
     PDOs (Table 2).

Table 2. Achievement of the PDOs

 1. Share of eligible patients     Not achieved. Despite implemented PHC reforms, the              PDO 1
 tested for arterial blood         direct contracting of PHC facilities by the NHIC, and
 pressure                          payment based on performance indicators (15%), the
                                   target was not achieved.
 2. Share of eligible patients     Not achieved. Despite implemented PHC reforms, the              PDO 1
 tested for cervical cancer        direct contracting of PHC facilities by the NHIC, and
                                   payment based on performance indicators (15%), the
                                   target was not achieved.
 3. Share of population covered    Overachieved. A number of activities have been                  PDO 1
 with mandatory health             implemented to streamline health financing and develop
 insurance increased               and implement strategies to increase the share of insured
                                   people.
 4. Share of new cases of grade    Partially achieved. The insufficient detection of cases in      PDO 1
 IV malignant tumors identified    2013 could be explained by the restructuring of the PHC
                                   services, getting new responsibilities to the PHC services,
                                   direct contracting with the National Health Insurance
                                   Company (NHIC), and generally a transition period for
                                   the PHC staff – all factors that might affect the screening
                                   and detection of new cases.
 5. Share of early pregnancies     Achieved. Project-end value for this indicator is only 0.1      PDO 1
 (within the first 12 weeks)       percentage point short of target. Therefore, it can be
 registered at a family doctors’   rounded up and considered to be achieved. As the PHC
 center                            facilities are being contracted by the NHIC and paid based
                                   on performance indicators, it provides additional
                                   incentives to reach the required indicators, such as this
                                   one.
 6. Average number of bed-         Partially achieved. A number of activities have been            PDO 1
 days used during the year         undertaken throughout the project that should have
                                   affected this indicator (feasibility studies, Hospital Master

                                      etc.).
    7. Number of rural health         Overachieved. As the development of rural health centers      PDO 1
    centers (health centers, family   was supported through rehabilitation and construction
    doctors’ centers) directly        works, management and financial accountability training
    contracted out by the National    courses, etc., the PHC facilities became able to carry out
    Health Insurance Company          their full responsibilities for the provision of health
                                      services and managing health practices. Thus, by the end
                                      of 2014 all 208 PHC facilities were contracted out by the
                                      NHIC.
    8. Social Assistance              Achieved. The SAAIS was developed to have an effective        PDO 2
    Automated Information             and secure system of cash transfers and social services. It
    System (SAAIS) developed          connects databases of the State register, National Social
                                      Insurance House, National Employment Agency, Register
                                      of Transport Units, NHIC, and MoLSPF. The system is
                                      flexible and allows introduction of changes (based on
                                      legislative amendments).
    9. Number of households           Overachieved. Targeted cash transfer program Ajutor           PDO 2
    benefiting from Ajutor Social     Social was launched in 2008. The program combines
                                      welfare and proxy means testing to determine eligibility
                                      and benefit channel for the beneficiary. As a result of
                                      targeted cash payments, over 132,000 people got out of
                                      poverty according to national statistics (in 2013).

           Achievement of PDO 1: Promote the Government’s program to increase access to
           quality and efficient health services with the aim of decreasing premature mortality
           and disability for the local population

    50. The achievement of the PDO 1 is rated as Modest. This evaluation is based on the
    achievement of the outcome indicators (out of seven PDO indicators related to the PDO 1, two
    are overachieved, one achieved, two partially achieved and two not achieved.

Assessment of PDO 1 achievement on the basis of additional outcome data

    51. Positive trends in health outcomes were seen in Moldova during the period 2009–2012,
    specifically an increase in life expectancy from 69.4 to 72.0 years, a decrease in the standardized
    death rate for cardiovascular diseases from 155.2 to 140.5 per 100,000 persons (0–64 age group)
    (9.5 percent reduction), and a decrease in the standardized death rate for cancers from 98.3 to
    94.3 per 100,000 persons (0–64 age group) (4 percent reduction)2. Such additional outcome data
    from the World Health Organization show significant reductions in premature mortality (which
    is part of the PDO 1) during the project period, although they cannot be purely attributed to the
    project.

Assessment of PDO 1 achievement on the basis of Intermediate Outcome and other Output
Indicators

 52. As per the Results Framework Analysis in Section F (Data Sheet) out of 17 Intermediate
 Outcome Indicators related to PDO 1, the project has either overachieved or achieved 15
 indicators and two indicators) were partially achieved.

 53. The overachievement of PDO1 indicator (“share of population covered with mandatory
 health insurance”) is particularly notable, as this represents an important progress toward
 Universal Health Coverage and increased efficiency of healthcare services in Moldova. The
 project made an impact in health care financing and provider payment reforms, specifically in
 expansion of health insurance coverage and strengthening the purchasing function of the NHIC
 and implementation of a new hospital payment system based on DRGs. Following the study on
 how to expand social health insurance coverage, conducted in 2009, and the revision of the
 Health Insurance Law, free health insurance was provided to beneficiaries of Ajutor Social
 (Targeted Social Assistance program), discounts (up to 75 percent) on insurance contributions
 were granted to self-employed farmers, and significant incentives to contribute were provided to
 vulnerable populations and people with disabilities in order to ensure they were covered by the
 basic package of health services. The project contributed to the further strengthening of NHIC
 capacity to develop contracting methods for PHC services and provider payment methods for
 hospitals based on the DRG system, and provided additional technical assistance with the new
 diagnostic coding system and proper auditing methods. All necessary software and hardware
 were procured for the hospitals and the NHIC. As well as training for the staff, informative study
 tours and workshops were conducted. A DRG license was procured from the government of
 Australia. Application of the DRG system started gradually, with introduction first in seven pilot
 hospitals (2012), followed by nationwide realization (2013) of the “budget-neutral” DRG system.
 The increase in the DRG share of hospital budgets was gradually introduced over time. A DRG
 management unit was created in the NHIC to take responsibility for running the DRG system,
 collection of data being generated by the system, and analysis of the data. The DRG-based
 system can be a powerful tool for resource allocation and stimulating competition and greater
 efficiency. However, if inappropriately implemented, the new system can be similarly powerful
 in taking the opposite direction. Therefore, auditing mechanisms have been established to control
 fraud in data collection. Thus, further strengthening of the capacity of the NHIC is being
 supported by the new health project.

 54. The project supported strengthening primary healthcare system and improvement of
 quality and access through number of important activities (addressing PDO1 indicators on
 “share of eligible patients tested for arterial blood pressure”, “share of eligible patients tested
 for cervical cancer”, share of new cases of grade IV tumors” and “share of early pregnancies
 registered at the family doctors centers”). Previously started reforms in PHC were continued
 under the project by further strengthening the PHC system and quality of care. The project was
 successful in improving access to and delivery of health care services via: (a) strengthening of
 the medical education system through revision of curricula for a number of programs, including
 university education for family doctors, postgraduate and continuous in-service training in
 family medicine for doctors, and basic training and continuous training for PHC nurses; (b)


                                                15
training and retraining of health staff of PHC facilities according to the new curricula; (c)
development and implementation of 60 standardized protocols for family doctors to be used in
the workplace; and (d) construction and renovation of 77 rural health centers in selected districts
and provision of vehicles. The selection and approval of rural health centers, as well as revised
standard designs for construction and renovation, were carried out in accordance with the
“Feasibility study and plan for infrastructure and human resources in the PHC system”, from
2007.
55. Providing PHC facilities with financial and decision-making autonomy was supported by
the project within the overall MoH decentralization program (addressing PDO1 indicator on
“number of RHCs (health centers, family doctors centers) directly contracted by the NHIC”).
The legislation was developed to enhance direct contracting of PHC facilities by the NHIC;
family doctors, managers, and accountants went through the PHC management training and
retraining based on the new curriculum developed under the project. The MoH started with a
pilot in several PHC facilities for a limited period of time to test the program’s wider flexibility
in planning and executing the business plans; after successful implementation, it was rolled out
and introduced to all PHC facilities. New contractual arrangements with the NHIC also provided
incentives for family doctors to improve the quality of services provided by participation in
family doctor training programs and by the introduction of performance-based indicators. All
208 RHCs are currently contracted by the NHIC. These elements of strengthened PHC capacity
will have an impact on improvement of basic health determinants in the long run.

56. Hospital capacity assessment and modernization activities were also carried out
(addressing PDO1 indicator on “average number of bed-days used during the year”). Based on
the Republican Clinical Hospital feasibility study (2008), redevelopment of the hospital was
considered, and as a result a new surgical block was constructed in accordance with international
standards. Equipment was procured and financed by the funds from the Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) (50 million euros) and the Austrian government (7.5 million euros).
The project supported several important studies, followed by action plans. The National Hospital
Master Plan, prepared in 2010, focused on further optimization of the hospital network and
creating a well-functioning referral system with strengthened regional hospital districts. Thus,
the decision was made by the MoH to undertake a merger of several hospitals offering similar
services in Chisinau in order to generate savings on administrative costs and improve the quality
and efficiency of hospital operations. In addition, to make further progress on hospital reforms
and to increase the cost-effectiveness and quality of health services provided by regional
hospitals, a study on a Hospital Regionalization Strategy was carried out to define health zones
(32 rayons) and select priorities for the construction of regional hospitals and reprofiling other
hospitals in the regions for long-term care. Consequently, the Hospital Regionalization Plan
(Regional Hospital Action Plan) was developed (2012), with a more detailed plan for one
selected region on emergency services (regional hospital with 100–120 beds), as well as
consideration for chronic and long-term care. Options for acute rehabilitation and long-term
rehabilitative services were also outlined in the plan. In order to improve oncology health
services in the country, an oncology services feasibility study was conducted, followed by a
detailed Action Plan for Decentralization of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy Services. As a
result it was proposed to have three centers for chemotherapy located in Belts, Cahul, and
Chisinau (north, south, and center of the country) to relieve the overloaded Chisinau center and
redistribute the flow of patients to the other two centers. During all these activities, the relevant

                                                16
staff of health facilities and the staff of the MoH participated in a number of trainings, workshops,
and seminars within and outside the country.

57. The project was successful in helping to strengthen the MoH’s stewardship capacities to
formulate and implement health policies and accelerate the health reforms in primary care,
hospital rationalization, payment system for medical facilities, public-private partnerships
(PPPs) and other critically important directions through investments in institutional capacity,
knowledge, and infrastructure. Thus, the National Health Management Center (NHMC) was
restructured in view of the consolidation of its role as a primary analytical center responsible for
collection and analysis of data (DRGs, NHA, and health management information system) for
MoH decision makers. The NHA system was institutionalized and developed five reports, more
than initially planned, and became a key diagnostic tool to monitor evaluation and resource
allocation in the health sector. A number of studies and policy design initiatives took place, such
as a new legislative framework for establishing PPPs and development of PPP pilots (2010). The
Human Resource Strategy (2011–2015) and action plan was developed, which identified the
short- and long-term human resource needs for the health sector and proposed certain revisions
of career incentives and criteria for posting, transfer, and promotion of medical staff. Three
important assessments and follow-up action plans were developed on hospital regionalization,
long-term and rehabilitative care, and decentralization of oncology services. These significant
steps have resulted in enhanced policy development and monitoring capacity at the higher
management levels, as shown in a number of important decisions. Moreover, they are major
factors in improving the quality of services and health outcomes in the long term.

58. The project supported the MoH in capacity development and formulation of sector
regulations through activities on: (a) institutionalization of NHA through technical assistance,
hardware, software, and training courses for staff; (b) development of BOOST in the health
sector as a complementary analytical tool for NHAs to analyze public expenditure data, including
training of NHIC staff in the tool to enable them to take responsibility for maintenance of the
BOOST database; (c) development of policy options for private sector participation in the health
sector to attract external financing to cover health sector investment needs and for building PPPs
in health service delivery; and (d) review and development of the health sector legislative
framework for coherency and internal harmonization.

59. An innovative approach in the health reforms was the introduction of Public Private
Partnership. In cooperation with the International Finance Corporation, the project supported
technical work on PPPs (2009); consequently, necessary amendments to legislation were made.
Two PPP projects were identified for the rehabilitation, endowment, and operation of the
radiology and diagnostic imaging service in the Republican Clinical Hospital, and the
radiotherapy service of the Oncology Institute. The first project agreement was signed and the
project became effective, but the second project agreement has not yet been signed. The Strategic
Planning and Development Unit of the MoH has been responsible for implementation of health
PPPs and successfully implemented, on its own initiative, a new PPP project for modernization
and management of the hemodialysis service in the country.

60. During the project life span there were regular consultations on the MTEF between the
World Bank team, the MoH, and WHO, as well as the Ministry of Finance and NHIC. The main


                                               17
 issues that have been discussed were stabilizing cost pressures in the health sector, limitation of
 unfunded mandates imposed on the NHIC annually, prioritization of expenditures within health
 programs, and reduction of inefficient resource allocations in the sector. The MTEF needed to
 reflect the collective priorities of the NHIC and the MoH; and as time passed, it became clearer
 that the planning and budgeting exercise would be jointly processed.

 61. On the basis of the achievement of project Outcome and Intermediate Outcome indicators
 as well as additional outcome data, project efficacy related to the first PDO is rated Substantial.

       Achievement of PDO 2: Improve the targeting of social transfers and services to the poor

Assessment of PDO 2 achievement on the basis of project outcome indicators

 62. As per the Results Framework Analysis in Section F above, for the two PDO indicators
 related to the PDO 2, one is achieved (PDO indictor No.8) and one overachieved (PDO indicator
 No. 9). This represents excellent achievement of the second PDO.

Assessment of PDO 2 achievement on the basis of Intermediate Outcome and other Output
Indicators

 63. The project was effective in supporting the efforts of the MoLSPF to develop a better
 targeted and administered cash benefit system and to improve the social welfare system
 (addressing the PDO 2 indicators on “Social Assistance Automated Information System
 developed” and “number of households benefiting from Ajutor Social”). The newly developed
 Social Assistance Automated Information System (SAAIS) was launched in September 2013.
 Additional applications and features have been proposed for the SAAIS, as per the inception
 report, in order to: (a) strengthen monitoring of family income for the means-tested benefits; (b)
 integrate functions related to social inspection to reduce fraud and corruption; (c) facilitate the
 accreditation process of social services providers; and (d) facilitate the work of social assistants
 on individual case management for special category cases (such as disability). A public relations
 campaign was carried out in promoting the Ajutor Social program. The MoLSPF and local rayon
 departments received 1,200 work stations and underwent thorough training courses to become
 acquainted with the new information system. Thus, new modules of cash benefit (additional
 heating allowances, disability benefits, and child and family protection benefits) and case
 management (individual case management and orthopedic services for disabilities) were
 introduced, resulting in consolidation of databases for all social benefits. Since the beginning of
 the Ajutor Social in 2008 about 147,000 households received cash benefit (at least once). The
 share of population exposed to extreme poverty dropped significantly from 3.2 percent in 2008
 to 0.3 percent in 2013. As a result of this targeted and well-designed program over 132,000
 people got out of the poverty (2013).

 64. The second direction that the project supported was conducting a functional review of the
 MoLSPF (2012), with a detailed action plan for a short- and long-term strategy. Based on the
 recommendations of the review, the ministry adopted an action plan for 2012–2017 that includes
 reorganization and introduction of new divisions and units with new functions, tasks, and
 responsibilities. However, the evaluation concluded that the ministry should focus more on


                                                18
 analytical capacity development in order to strengthen its capacity. The MoLSPF included the
 recommendations of the functional review in its Strategic Development Program. The ministry
 shows commitment to social reforms and continued engagement with the Bank, with a results-
 based financing as a follow-up project on strengthening social safety nets in Moldova.

 65. On the basis of the achievement of project Outcome and Intermediate Outcome indicators,
 project efficacy related to the second PDO is rated High.

Overall Project Efficacy

 66. With an efficacy rating of Modest for the first PDO and High for the second PDO, the
 overall project efficacy is rated as Substantial.

3.3    Efficiency

 67. Efficiency is rated Modest. Data is not available to allow for re-calculation of project net
 present value and economic rate of return. The efficiency analysis will be assessed based on
 whether the project represented the least cost solution to attain the benefits. In the course of
 planning and implementation of the project, some inefficiencies in resource use can be observed.
 Originally, the project planned to construct/renovate 65 rural health centers, however, due to cost
 overrun, only 38 rural health centers were constructed. This is because the unit costs of
 constructing the facilities were higher than expected at appraisal: rural health center construction
 was projected at US$80,000 but cost US$170,000 when completed (more than 100 percent
 increase). The mistake in the estimation of unit costs of facilities can be traced to cost
 calculations in the PAD which were based on 2005 prices. During implementation of civil works
 in 2008, construction costs doubled, with high labor wages and significant increases in the cost
 of primary building materials and other construction rental services of equipment. In addition,
 the estimated costs did not consider the costs associated with ensuring that buildings were
 earthquake-proof, as Moldova is in a 6–9 degree seismic zone. The impacts of these price
 movements on project costs were noticeably more than the 6 percent price contingency assumed
 at appraisal.
 68. In terms of benefits, the project created both direct and indirect benefits for the population
 and led to improvement in capacity of MoH and MoLSPF. On the whole, when costs are viewed
 vis-à-vis the direct and indirect project benefits, the results seem to be comparable with the ex-
 ante calculations presented in the PAD. Due to the cost-overruns, the net benefits are assumed
 to be at the lower spectrum. As such, the efficiency of the project is rated as Modest.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

 69. The project’s overall outcome is considered Moderately Satisfactory. This rating is
 consistent with the rating in the last ISR of August 2014. While both relevance and efficacy are
 rated Substantial (section 3.1), efficiency is rated Modest.




                                                19
3.5         Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

      (a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

 70. The project had a direct positive impact on the poor population of the country, explicitly
 strengthening targeted social assistance within component 2 and, inter alia, through activities
 under component 1, increasing quality of and access to health care services and health insurance
 coverage. The infrastructure and system improvements in the PHC facilities constructed and
 renovated under the project have improved access to and quality of care for all socioeconomic
 groups, including the poor and women, especially in rural areas. Initially, the project’s results
 framework included an outcome indicator related to the utilization of PHC by poor (namely:
 “number of consultation per person per year by socio-economic group”). Since the data collected
 by the MOH did not provide information on different socio-economic groups, the indicator was
 dropped; however a new indicator was introduced (‘share of early pregnancies, within the first
 12 weeks, registered at a family doctors’ center) which was directly connected and registered
 positive improvement on the healthcare of women. In addition, under the Food Crisis Response
 TF, the project supported directly poor families, women and children during the times of acute
 and persistent food price crisis with provision of food packages and nutritional supplements. .

      (b)      Institutional Change and Strengthening

 71. The project had a significant impact on institutional development and building long-term
 capacity in various areas. During the ICR mission, central and local authorities emphasized the
 important impact on institutional development resulting from project investments in capacity
 building and technology. Furthermore, the project has contributed to preparing the MoH to
 embark on a PforR operation and to meet its challenges, now supported by disbursement-linked
 indicators. The project strengthened several institutions (MoH, MoLSPF, primarias, hospitals
 and PHC facilities, State University for Medicine and Pharmacy) and supported development of
 the family medicine approach to improve PHC. Personnel stressed the direct impacts of the
 project in training and retraining of doctors and nurses, enabling them to work as teams in the
 family medicine setting, as well as training social workers to provide better targeting of social
 assistance services. Physicians and nurses in participating health facilities acknowledged the
 positive role the project has played, not only in improving the physical infrastructure and
 availability of medical equipment, but also in promoting staff efficiency and productivity gains.

 72. Each of the components supported institutional strengthening in its respective area.
 Component 1, on health system modernization, supported technical assistance and training for:
 (a) development of health system performance capacity; (b) establishment of NHAs;
 (c) developing a Human Resource Strategy with the focus on determining needs and modeling
 supply, review of the curriculum for medical personnel, and conducting a study on how to attract
 and retain staff, especially in rural areas; (d) strengthening the social assistance information
 system; (e) management training for PHC institutions; and (f) hospital reorganization reform
 training and study tours. Overall, about 1,500 health staff went through the training process.

 73. Component 2, on social assistance and welfare, financed technical assistance and training
 for: (a) automation of a targeted social program; (b) a program on consolidation of all social


                                                20
 welfare databases and electronic record keeping; and (c) institutional capacity building through
 revision of internal business processes, strategic planning, budget formulation, policy M&E, IT,
 legislative drafting, professional in-service training and retraining, etc. Overall, more than 1,375
 social workers and ministry staff benefited from the technical assistance activities.

 74. Component 3, on project coordination and M&E, has improved overall project
 management and coordination through staff participation in training courses, on-the-job training
 provided by consultants, and participation in training courses in procurement and financial
 management within and outside the country. Key project coordinators have been involved in
 strategic departments of the MoH and MoLSPF, which further contributed to the reforms in both
 sectors.

      (c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)

 75. Close coordination and synergies with activities financed by WHO, UNICEF, DFID,
 Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), U.S. Agency for International
 Development (USAID), JICA, and the EU has resulted in robust outcomes for the sectors. For
 instance, WHO has supported improved health policy formulation, including development of the
 National Health Strategy, and health financing reforms, and has worked with the MoH and NHIC
 to review and revise hospital payment mechanisms. DFID, USAID, and the EU provided
 technical assistance with equipment for social workers. JICA and the Austrian government
 equipped the new surgical block of the national hospital.

 76. It should be mentioned, that the reorganization of primary healthcare system to make the
 PHC facilities and the family doctors to work as an autonomous units, consumed significant
 amount of time and efforts to acquire knowledge and skills in management and financing
 yielding to less time devoted to medical practice. This negative impact could be attributed to the
 failure in achieving some of the project outcomes directly related to the healthcare at the primary
 level.
3.6         Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey or Stakeholder Workshops

 77.        Not applicable.

4.          Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 78. The risk at the time of the ICR that development outcomes (or expected outcomes) would
 not be maintained is rated Moderate. Reforms in new payment mechanisms for primary and
 tertiary health care providers, strengthening family medicine pre-service and in-service
 education, and improving quality of PHC services have been imperative and are expected to be
 continued.

 79. Similarly, developments in the social welfare information system can be expanded, as there
 is commitment beyond the MoLSPF to create an integrated information system in the country.
 However, it is important to continue maintaining the significant achievements of the introduced



                                                21
 system of targeted social assistance and ensure full coverage of poor and vulnerable population
 with social assistance cash benefits in the years to come.

5.          Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1         Bank Performance

      (a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

 80. This evaluation rates the quality at entry as Moderately Satisfactory. The project design
 was relevant to the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy and the government’s strategy
 as described in Section 2.1 and para 46. The design benefited from the analytical work and
 recommendations of the Bank and other partners. The Bank team applied the lessons learned
 from implementation of the Bank-supported health and social protection projects as well as other
 projects in the region. The background analysis was sound. The team considered a number of
 options during preparation, which were well justified in the PAD. The Bank team ensured a
 participatory approach during project preparation and engaged both central and local
 counterparts, as well as other development partners, in discussions to ensure that there was
 overall agreement on project design and scope.

 81. Recommendations of the quality enhancement review were reflected in the design of the
 project. However, the project design did not put in place a sound M&E system for monitoring
 project implementation and assessing its achievements. Baseline data were missing for many
 indicators and there were no proposed activity related to a baseline survey. The results
 framework was changed during project restructuring, adding new indicators and dropping others.
 Thus the baseline data for new indicators were confusing in the sense that they were already
 quite high and there was not sufficient time left after project restructuring to reach the targets.

      (b)      Quality of Supervision

 82. The ICR team rates the quality of supervision as Moderately Satisfactory. The team leader
 responsible for processing the project for approval remained for three years. The second team
 leader guided implementation for about a year; the third was based in Kiev and frequently visited
 Moldova (2010–2013); and the fourth managed the project for about a year until the closing date.
 Generally there were two annual implementation support visits; the number increased starting in
 2013, as a new project was being prepared at that time.

 83. Reporting on the supervision missions was inadequate. Some Aide-Mémoires outlined
 implementation progress substantially, whereas others had limited information on project
 components and subcomponents. Progress on component 2 was last reported in the January 2012
 aide-mémoire. The midterm review could have provided a more comprehensive evaluation of
 mid-project progress. The last Aide-Mémoire was prepared in October 2013; there were no Aide-
 Mémoires covering project life prior to its closing in August 2014. Moreover, it would have been
 beneficial to address in Aide-Mémoires overall sector reforms in addition to project activities,
 which would have helped to ensure that the project was closely linked to, and contributed to, the
 overall sectoral performance.


                                                22
 84. The project team developed good relations with the MoH, NHIC, and MoLSPF. Project
 implementation was monitored regularly by Bank staff during and between missions. The skills
 mix was appropriate, and additional consultants were used by the Bank team to support
 ongoing activities (for example, an engineer for construction of the physical facilities, an IT
 consultant for the information system enhancement). The Bank team communicated well on
 project activities with relevant and responsible units and departments within the MoH and
 MoLSPF.
 85. Procurement and financial management were well supervised throughout the life of the
 project. Safeguard policies were a particular focus of the project team during project
 implementation, which helped identify issues and ensure that measures were taken to fix them
 in a timely manner.

 86. From discussions during the ICR mission and the review of Aide-Mémoires and other
 documents, it is evident that teams for the most part coordinated well with other development
 partners, including WHO, UNICEF, DFID, JICA, and the EU, to ensure timeliness, quality, and
 best use of resources.

      (c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

 87.        Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2         Borrower Performance

      (a)      Government Performance

 88. The government’s performance during project preparation and implementation is rated
 Satisfactory. Prior to project approval, the MoH prepared a draft National Health Strategy 2007–
 2017 with a five-year implementation plan. Also, in 2004, the Government of Moldova approved
 a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper with a long-term strategy for social assistance reforms. In
 addition: (a) a draft Project Implementation Plan was prepared by the working group; (b) an
 arrangement was made to establish a joint interministerial steering committee; (c) the
 government made its contribution to the ICR of the previous health and social protection
 projects; (d) studies and background analysis were prepared for the health and social assistance
 sectors; and (e) strategy management teams within each ministry were set up to implement
 respective project components and be responsible for day-to-day management and coordination.
 High-level government officials were actively involved in discussions on design of the project
 and its overall scope and content. Moreover, the Government of Moldova’s political and
 institutional commitment during project implementation, and decision to continue reforms in
 follow-up projects in both sectors, were adequate.

      (b)      Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

 89. The MoH’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The MoH’s commitment to
 health reforms has been strong, despite the rapid changes of management teams. The MoH
 supervision team was effective in assisting with resolution of issues arising during development

                                                  23
     and approval of the National Hospital Master Plan, establishment of NHAs, agreement on the
     Action Plan for Decentralization of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy Services rationalization
     plan for oncology services, introduction of the DRG system together with the NHIC, and
     coordination with other agencies participating in the project, such as the management of hospitals
     and other health facilities, the Medical University, and district authorities. The main issue has
     been the very slow progress on the key reforms (such as hospital reforms, implementation of
     human resource strategy, primary care reforms, and payment system reforms). The MoH has
     accumulated a very significant set of policy and preparatory documents, but real action has been
     delayed.

     90. The MoLSPF’s performance is rated as Satisfactory. The MoLSPF showed commitment
     to the reforms in social protection and assistance systems. Relevant heads of departments were
     involved in project implementation. A steering committee and the program working group
     established at the beginning of the project were efficient in guiding and monitoring the strategic
     direction of the social assistance program. The working group worked closely with consultants,
     ministry officials, and donor representatives, and reported the project accomplishments to the
     steering committee.

     91. Overall coordination, as well as procurement, financial management, and M&E, worked
     well. The project was directly coordinated by the MoH and MoLSPF without project
     implementation units, but with support from a contracted team of consultants, including M&E
     coordinator, procurement and financial management consultants, and translators, and others as
     per project requirements. The setup was successful in maintaining dynamic relationships with
     all who implemented various parts of the project activities and participated in the project. The
     M&E of the project performance was carried out by the strengthened capacities of both ministries.
     MoH and MoLSPF management and staff of relevant departments involved in implementation
     of the project participated actively in the ICR discussions. As indicated earlier, project
     management and coordination was assessed as Satisfactory during the life of the project.

      (c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

     92. Based on the Satisfactory performance of the Government and the Moderately Satisfactory
     performance of the Implementing Agency (average of both agencies), the overall rating assigned
     to Borrower Performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

6.          Lessons Learned

     93.    Lessons learned can be categorized under the following headings:

6.1         Government Ownership and Capacity Development
           Health and social sector reforms are costly, but long lasting. The project committed
            resources to building the capacity of the MoH, NHIC, and MoLSPF. It also concentrated
            on building capacity for management of health and social assistance information and health
            financial data, and formulation and implementation of reforms and associated policies. The
            staff at all three agencies and associated facilities acquired skills and knowledge throughout
            numerous trainings, seminars, workshops, and study tours. The real impact of the

                                                     24
          introduced policies and of the training for improved efficiency and health outcomes will
          become apparent years after the project closure.
         Strong government ownership is important, mainly with reform-oriented projects.
          Reforms in health and social sectors are not purely about technical issues, but depend
          profoundly on ownership, institutional capacity, and the political process. Limited
          commitment negatively affected the passing or adoption of policies and strategies, such as
          the Human Resource Strategy and plans for attraction of family doctors to rural areas. The
          real difference in performance under the social protection component and the health
          component is due to the greater reform commitment of the leadership of the MoLSPF.
         Elections and changes in the cabinet of ministries influenced the government’s
          decisions and attitudes toward the ongoing reforms. Several appointments of health
          ministers and deputy ministers created delays and put on hold the decision-making process
          (for several policy papers, legislation, and action plans, etc.).
         Reaching agreement among stakeholders is crucial. This applies not only during
          preparation but also during implementation, as it can affect the success and sustainability
          of any reform. Agreement at all stages is specifically important when there are two or more
          implementing agencies. Long-term engagement is essential. Considering that this project
          was not the first one in both sectors, and there are other engagements in both sectors, it
          would be advisable that the Bank team together with the client decide on a longer-term
          approach, as health and social sector reforms are complex and it takes up to 10 years to see
          results. However, it is commendable that the momentum gained during project-supported
          reforms was not lost and was continued in new engagements.
         It is difficult to institute a results-centered attitude. Despite repeated workshops and
          attempts by the task team leader to refocus the MoH leadership on final results, the lion’s
          share of the attention was given to infrastructure investments (in primary care and in the
          Republican Clinical Hospital surgical ward).

6.2       Coordination

         Close coordination with development partners was critical. Close coordination and
          collaboration with the EU, WHO, JICA, DFID, and UNICEF during preparation and
          implementation were significant. The institutions provided technical expertise, financed
          equipment, and participated in seminars and workshops. Close cooperation during
          implementation helped keep important activities on track and guaranteed complementarity
          of involvement.

6.3       Implementation Guidance by the Bank

         Lack of sound M&E design questions the overall quality of project design. Moreover,
          monitoring of project implementation becomes puzzling and difficult to prove project
          achievements. Missing baseline data for outcome and output indicators may negatively
          affect overall project relevance.
         Recognizing problems and pursuing solutions by the Bank-client-partner team is
          important for accomplishing results. The team acted appropriately in ensuring timely
          consideration of project restructuring and review of the results framework.



                                                  25
         Both the Bank and the government need to have the right expertise in all areas of the
          project. Frequent change of coordinators from both the client side and the Bank side
          interrupted smooth implementation of project activities and resulted in loss of momentum.
          Thus, some activities took longer to complete than was initially planned.

7.        Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower, Implementing Agencies, and Partners

7.1       Borrower and Implementing Agencies

 94. The ICR author interviewed all relevant stakeholders, and the feedback provided was very
 positive on the role that the project had played in further improvement of the health and social
 protection and assistance sectors. During the ICR mission, the Minister of Health and the
 Minister of Labor, Social Protection, and Family commented positively on the achievements of
 the project and the Bank’s role in assisting the government of Moldova in the development of
 the sectors, and expressed a desire for future Bank cooperation in the sectors. The Chief
 Executive Officer of the NHIC was also very positive in his feedback and was pleased with the
 cooperation and support provided to the NHIC within the project. The ICR author received a
 report prepared jointly by the two implementing ministries on the project objectives and
 indicators as a contribution to the ICR, which is presented in Annex 7.

 95. The ICR team visited the newly built surgical block of the central hospital in Chisinau,
 PHC facilities in Hincesti and Ialoveni rayons, and the social assistance center in Ialoveni
 rayon. In discussions, medical staff expressed their satisfaction with the quality of the facilities,
 the equipment, and the practical guidelines used by family doctors. In short discussions,
 patients and family members also showed satisfaction with the improved services. Meetings at
 the social welfare office also provided a positive impression of the level of professionalism of
 the staff, overall infrastructure, and proper functioning of the information system.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

      1.   Background

      1. Health indicators in Moldova have shown improvement, but it has remained well below
         European Union (EU) averages. Life expectancy was 12 years shorter than the EU average
         and 6 years shorter than for the new EU-10 nationals. Although there was some progress,
         infant mortality rate remained 2.5 times higher, and the maternal mortality rate 4 times
         higher, than in the EU. Avoidable mortality is primarily due to chronic diseases, the biggest
         share of which was cardiovascular disease with mortality rate for productive population
         doubled that of EU-10. Moldova was facing double burden of disease due to continued
         high incidence rates for tuberculosis (11 times higher than for the EU) and HIV/AIDS (1.3
         times higher than for the EU).

      2. To overcome these challenges, the HSSAP promoted the implementation of several
         activities that intended to modernize the health system through: (i) capacity development
         and sector regulation, (ii) introduction of new provider payment systems to improve health
         care financing, (iii) development of primary health care, and (iv) modernization and
         improvements in capacity and operational efficiency in hospitals. Through additional
         financing, the project also alleviated health and nutritional status of vulnerable women.
         Finding vulnerable population was improved through the social assistance and welfare
         component of the project which helped improve the efficiency of targeting social assistance
         services.

      3. At the end of the project, all planned activities have been implemented. Majority of PDO
         and intermediate indicators were achieved, but not all. The project renovated 77 PHCs. In
         addition, the project financed technical support for preparing a rationalization plan for a
         hospital network in Chisinau, and development of the National Hospital Master Plan.
         Moreover, additional technical assistance was provided under the technical assistance for
         activities, such as development of 60 standardized protocols for family doctors, and
         training of medical residents.

      4. This economic analysis reviews the development impact of HSSAP. To the extent possible,
         it aims to present an overall picture of project efficiency.

      1.   Methodology, data and assumptions3

           2.1 Direct benefits

      5. Due to investments in PHC, the main benefits from the project are as follows:
           a) Increase in PHC visits and decrease in unnecessary inpatient services. The
              government reported 77 PHC facilities were renovated and all rural centers, including


3
    All data are from project documents, unless stated otherwise.


                                                  31
       health centers and family doctor centers, have been renovated or built in line with the
       renewed national norms and standards. In the duration of the project, average annual
       number of visits to a doctor increased from 6.3 in 2008 to 6.5 in 2013 (National Bureau
       of Statistics, Moldova). There was no data available to show decrease in unnecessary
       inpatient services.
   b) Greater access to needed services. Share of population with mandatory health
      insurance increased from 77% in 2007 to 83% in 2014, allowing for greater access to
      health services by more people.
   c) Better quality of care. A total of 75 family doctors’ protocols were developed and
      approved by the MoH. Copies were disseminated to PHC facilities and regional
      training on use of the standards was conducted for 360 family doctors. Enhanced
      curriculum/education program for family doctors was finalized and training curriculum
      for family doctors and nurses was completed from 2008 to 2009. Over 70 resident
      doctors were enrolled annually from 2010 to 2013 at the Family Medicine Department
      of the State University for Medicine and Pharmacy. These residents trained for over
      three years using the new curriculum. To complement doctor training, nurses were also
      trained based on the new curriculum. Although there is no quantitative evidence that
      shows improvements in quality of care, evidence from other countries show that
      protocols and training leads to better quality of care (Grimshaw and Rusell, 1993;
      Chaudrhy et al, 2006).
   d) Greater focus on prevention and early management of health problems. Focusing
      on prevention and early management of health problems lead to a more efficient health
      system. As proxies for focus on prevention, share of early pregnancies (within the first
      12 weeks) registered at a family doctors’ center, increased from 77.6% in 2007 to 79.9
      percent in 2014. The percent of patients tested for arterial blood pressure also increased
      from 81.3% in 2009 to 90.8% in 2012 and 84.5% in 2013.
   e) Better nutrition for pregnant mothers and lactating mothers and children With
      better targeting system due to component 2 of the project, vulnerable women and
      children received micronutrient supplementation. Empirical evidence has shown that
      better nourished pregnant women and children below 5 lead to long term gains in the
      form of a more productive work force (Gertler, et al, 2013).
6. Due to investments in hospitals, the main benefits are as follows: More efficient use of
   hospital network
7. The project financed the National Hospital Master Plan which was completed in 2010.
   This TA served as an input to the Hospital Care Development Program 2010–2012, which
   was approved and implemented by the government. New provider payment system based
   on DRG system was developed in close cooperation with the MoH, NHIC, and
   international technical assistance and was introduced nationwide in 2013. The project also
   financed a plan for decentralization of chemotherapy and radiotherapy services, a
   regionalization plan, a plan for rehabilitation and long-term health services, and PPP
   projects.
8. Some proxy indicators regarding a more efficient hospital network is the decrease in the
   number of hospital beds by specialization which decreased from 61.1 beds per 10,000


                                            32
       population in 2008 to 58.4 in 2013 (National Bureau of Statistics, Moldova). There is also
       a decrease in ER cases from 282.7 per 1000 cases to 270.9 in 2013 suggesting that patient
       management is being handled better.

2.2 Indirect Benefits

    9. Indirect project benefits are better implementation capacity of MOH and MoLSPF. The
       introduction of DRG payment system is likely to lead in more efficient use of resources.
       Morbidity data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that population morbidity due
       to infectious and parasitic disease has decreased from 46.5 per 1000 in 2008 to 34.1 in
       2013. Neoplasms also decreased from 22.3 per 1000 in 2008 to 20.6 in 2013. A healthier,
       more productive population is expected to contribute more to the economy.

2.3 Project costs

    10. The project has three components, of which Component 1 accounted for majority of project
        costs and benefits. The total project cost including additional financing was 203% of the
        appraisal estimate (Annex 1). Original credit and additional financing from IDA accounted
        for 80% of the total project cost. It should be noted that the funds from bilateral agencies
        foreseen during appraisal did not materialize.

3   Efficiency
    11. The cost-benefit analysis presented in the PAD estimated the internal rate of return of 31
        percent alone for PHC restructuring and at 22 percent for both PHC and hospital
        restructuring. The direct benefits were the benefits attributable to the project from reduced
        hospital stay, reducing inpatient consultation for the services obtained at the rural health
        centers, and saved travel time and costs. The indirect benefits included reduced mortality
        rate and associated potential years of life saved. It was estimated that the internal rate of
        return would decrease to 14 percent in the event that the assumed benefits were reduced by
        40 percent. It was assumed that the project would remain justifiable, even assuming a one-
        year delay in project benefits or 40 percent reduction in project benefits received.

    12. The net present value of the project was also estimated, applying a 10 percent discount rate
        and a 10-year horizon. The net present value was estimated at US$22.1 million of total
        benefits and US$8.6 million of net benefits. Sensitivity analyses results show that NPV
        will remain positive even when benefits are assumed to be reduced by 40 percent.

    13. While it would have been ideal to reproduce the original economic analysis in the PAD,
        there was no available data that would allow the team to do so. As noted in the Bank’s
        ICR Guidelines, in the absence of NPV/ERR, the project’s efficiency can be assessed by
        evaluating whether the project has represented the least-cost solution to attain the benefits.

    14. There are three major changes during implementation of the project impacted its economic
        viability. First, under the health system modernization component, 77 (compared to a
        planned 65) rural health center facilities were constructed or renovated. Originally, the
        project planned to construct/renovate 65 rural health centers. However, due to cost overrun,


                                                 33
   only 38 rural health centers were constructed. This is because the unit costs of constructing
   these component 1 facilities were higher than expected at appraisal. For example, each
   rural health center construction was projected at US$80,000 but actually cost US$170,000
   (more than 100 percent increase). It was decided to complement with additional financing
   in the amount of US$10.2 million (2011) to complete the construction of an additional 35
   rural health centers. The additional financing also led a construction of a new surgical block
   and a number of additional important activities, such as rationalization plans and
   implementation of the DRG system. Thus, the actual total cost of component 1 turned out
   to be US$21.4 million, more than the budgeting amount of US$20.98 million in the last
   project restructuring document (2011).

15. Second, an important reason for the increase in the unit costs of facilities in component 1
    was that cost calculations in the PAD were based on 2005 prices. During implementation
    of civil works (2008), construction costs doubled, with high labor wages and significant
    increases in the cost of primary building materials and other construction rental services
    for certain equipment. In addition, the initially calculated costs did not consider the costs
    associated with ensuring that buildings were earthquake-proof, as Moldova is in a 6–9
    degree seismic zone. The impacts of these price movements on project costs were
    noticeably more than the 6 percent price contingency assumed at appraisal.

16. The third major change during implementation was the government’s decision to develop
    and implement a number of rationalization plans (merging tertiary health facilities and
    focusing more on PHC strengthening, decentralization of oncological services,
    introduction of PPP services, etc.) in the entire country. The significant work done under
    the health care financing and provider payment direction should be noted, resulting in
    financial autonomy and contracting arrangements for the PHC facilities, implementation
    of the DRG system in hospitals, and actions taken to increase the health insurance coverage
    of the population of Moldova. Just as essential was the extensive technical and institutional
    support and training built into the project, enabling the government to accelerate the health
    and social welfare reforms to influence the effectiveness described in section.

17. On the whole, when costs are viewed vis-à-vis the direct and indirect project benefits, the
    results seem to be comparable with the ex-ante calculations presented in the PAD. Due
    to the cost-overruns, the net benefits are assumed to be at the lower spectrum. As such, the
    efficiency of the project is rated as Modest.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

   a) Summary of Borrower’s ICR

The ICR team received the report of the Government on the project implementation. The report
provides an assessment of the achievements of the PDO and intermediate indicators vis-à-vis
activities that were carried out under the project.

Number of activities were implemented under the project in relation to the PDO indicator of “share
of patients eligible for blood pressure testing”, “share of patients eligible for cervical cancer
screening” and “share of newly diagnosed patients with grade IV malignant tumors” such as
developing PHC facilities (design, supervision and construction); development of standardized
protocols for family doctors; training of staff in health facilities, policy dialogue, workshops, etc.
Hence, for all three indicators there was a positive trend from 2009 to 2012 and then for the year
of 2013-2014 there were not a significant progress. This situation could be linked to the transition
of family doctors to the new working conditions under financial autonomy and lack of sufficient
time to follow up on this indicator. Thus, it is expected that the family doctors will pay more
attention to this group of patients with received skills through training courses, introduction of 75
new treatment protocols and also this indicator being among performance based indicators under
the family doctor and NHIC contracts.

Streamlining the health system financing and activities done to boost it, contributed positively to
the achievement of the PDO indicator on “increase in the share of population covered by
mandatory health insurance”, particularly development and implementation of policies meant to
increase this share more than it was predicted.

The project reached the planned target for the “early ante-natal care (early registration of
pregnancies in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) with the family doctor” indicator. All the PHC
activities described above positively contributed to increased number of early registered pregnant
women. The share increased from 74.9 percent in 2008 to 79.9 percent in 2013, meeting the project
target.

Activities under the hospital sector modernization, such as development and piloting of the new
diagnostic-related groups (DRGs), nationwide implementation of DRG system, development of
feasibility studies foe the Republican Clinical Hospital (RCH) and the Oncology Institute, co-
financing for the construction of the new surgical block of RCH, development of hospital master
plan, development of hospital regionalization plan, preparation of the development program for
rehabilitation services, development of the decentralization plan for chemo- and radio-therapy,
training of staff in health facilities, etc. resulted in improving the “average number of bed days
used per year, number of days”. The utilization increased from 281 days per year in 2007 to 302
in 2013; and for the first half of 2014 it was 156 days for half a year.

The project overachieved the indicator on the “number of rural primary healthcare centers (primary
healthcare centers, family doctors centers) contracted directly by the National Health Insurance
company. The number increased from 17 centers in 2007 to 234 in the first half of 2014,
representing 2.3 fold increase compared to the project target of 100 centers.

The final two PDO indicators: “development and implementation of the “Social Assistance”
automated information system” and “number of households benefiting from Ajutor Social” were
successfully achieved under the activities implemented by the MoLSPF. The project has supported
improving the social care services and making the cash benefits more transparent and targeted
through the nationwide introduction of the information system, and setting the foundation for
launching and then expanding Ajutor Social. The central office and the local providers of services
have been trained in the new electronic system of social assistance, and have been equipped with
the necessary information technology (IT) for it to become operational and to run the system
smoothly.

The Social assistance automated system was launched in September 2013, comprising of two
modules: (i) cash transfers module, based on an evaluation of income of Ajutor Social and winter
season benefits’ applicants, verification of declared information by applicants and cross checking
with information systems of other state organizations (State Registry, National Employment
Agency, NHIC and (ii) social service module, that covers social services and case management
including services for children, people with disabilities, victims of violence and other groups of
beneficiaries. By the beginning of 2014, the system was fully operational.

According to official data of the national Bureau of Statistics, the absolute poverty rate was 12.7
percent in 2013 compared to 16.6 percent in 2012 and 26.4 percent in 2008. In 2013, the poverty
gap that measures the income deficit of the poor in relation to the poverty line was at 2 percent,
showing a decreasing trend. In addition, to poverty levels, the inequality level in the country was
0.2754 in 2013 compared to 0.2824 in 2012. The poverty reduction in 2013 is linked to the national
economy revival, as well as positive impact of Ajutor Social made on poor families through
accurate allocation of resources for those in rea need.

The Government of Moldova introduced targeted cash transfer program, called Ajutor Social, in
2008 and was implemented country-wide since 2009, becoming “the main program financed by
the Government”. In 2011, the Parliament adopted an addendum to the Ajutor Social program as
a benefit for the cold season in a fixed amount established by the Government. Beneficiaries of
this benefit were all households receiving cash from Ajutor Social, and also households that had
an income lower than the minimum monthly guaranteed income increased by 1.6 coefficient. The
Ajutor Social replaced the Nominal Compensations program for payment of utility services, which
was paid only to several categories of population even those who did not need it. The Ajutor Social
has monitored and evaluated its impact on the poor population and important measured to improve
it has been constantly applied.

Moreover, the activities under the project provided support to improve the regulatory framework,
to conduct training of specialist implementing the social programs, to carry out information and
awareness campaigns, as well as discussions with various policy makers, civil society, academia
and local authorities during the introduction of social programs, such as Ajutor Social program.

The MoLSPF provided their conclusions on the lessons learnt from project implementation as
following: (i) “it is important to understand at the design stage the need to create a system that
could be easily maintained, would be sufficiently flexible to ensure continuous development,


                                                40
modernization and enhanced capacity”; (ii) “beneficiary involvement at all stages of design is very
important and even the most well-known developers must be controlled. It is important that all
stakeholders participate in the design.

The project helped to strengthen MoH capacity by: (a) supporting formulation and implementation
of health policies; (b) establishing the NHAs; (c) improving M&E capacity; and (d) enhancing
capacity in health service planning, finance, and quality enhancement.

The project has assisted in improving delivery and efficiency of health care services through: (a)
construction of rural health facilities and a new surgical block in the central hospital following the
National Hospital Master Plan; (b) development of detailed plans for rehabilitation and
construction, and equipping of PHC and other health facilities; (c) training and retraining of health
staff; (d) strengthening the medical education system for family medicine; (e) strengthening
management capacity through in-country training; and (f) developing the National Hospital Master
Plan and a detailed study on how hospital infrastructure could be rationalized in one region of the
country (North).

Hospital capacity assessment and modernization has been efficient. It was important to carry out
a needs assessment for the hospital sector and develop a National Hospital Master Plan, which
would provide guidance on hospital structures, profiles, catchment areas, specialists, referral
system, and other matters. Following development of the National Hospital Master Plan, the more
detailed Regionalization Plan for Hospital Care Services was developed. Under the
Regionalization Plan, some hospitals were earmarked for long-term care rather than surgeries and
deliveries (for instance), while other hospitals were consolidated, taking into account such criteria
as specialization of the hospitals, administrative structure, and geographic characteristics. Each
regionalization business plan was required to focus on urgent services, as well as chronic or
palliative care and rehabilitation.

The PHC network has been strengthened through enhancing the skills and knowledge of family
doctors and raising the standards of rural health facilities, thus improving the quality of and access
to PHC services.

The project has been successful in supporting financial sustainability and equity. Considerable
importance has been attached to the implementation of the new provider payment system based on
a DRG approach, especially given the decision of the government to implement the system
nationwide.


   b) Comments on Draft ICR

The ICR dated January 26, 2015 has been sent for comments to the Ministry of Health and the
Ministry of Labor, Social Protection and Family on February 5, 2015. The MoLSPF with the letter
dated February 20, 2015, notified the Bank about having no objections to the ICR document. The
comments from the MoH have not been provided by the time of this writing.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners and Stakeholders

During discussion with the ICR mission, WHO expressed its appreciation for the close
collaboration the Bank team had maintained with its staff and consultants. WHO recognized the
role the project had played in the development of the sector and the importance of the areas that it
addressed. While the technical assistance and training provided by WHO were important in
building institutional capacity for the development of the health strategy, WHO acknowledged that
the integration of the various pieces of analytical work were part of a bigger picture in the sector.
