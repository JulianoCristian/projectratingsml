In order to accomplish this, the project\n            comprises several components.  They include (a) technical\n            asistance for operational development and sector studies;\n            (b) training for all levels of staff; (c) operational\n            improvements consisting of equipment, vehicles, replacement\n            of house connections and distribution mains, installation of\n            water meters, construction of a meter repair shop, and\n            purchase of imported chemicals and spare parts.  Lastly, the\n            project involves (d) construction of additional capacity for\n            the production of water.  Within the project, the technical\n            assistance and training components would be implemented in\n            association with a mentor water utility in another country."}, "docdt": "1986-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
