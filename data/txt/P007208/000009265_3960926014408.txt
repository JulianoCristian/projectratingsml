GUATEMALA
WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                Republic of Guatemala
Implementing
Agency:                Municipality of Guatemala City, acting through
EMPAGUA (Empresa Municipal de Agua)
Amount:                  US$23.0 million equivalent
Terms:                    15 years including a grace period of 5 years.
Relending Terms:         The Borrower would or,lend US$22.3 million equiva-
lent in quetzales of the proceeds of the loan to
the Municipality of Guatemala City with the same
grace period, repayment terms and interest rate
as the Bank loan. EMPAGUA would provide the ser-
vicing of and would bear the foreign exchange
risk of this subsidiary loan.
ProJect ObJectives       The project would assist EMPAGUA in becoming a
and Description:       more efficient organization, capable of providing
good service without recourse to operating subsi-
dies from the Government. Main specific objec-
tives are:   (a) the improvement of EMPAGUA's
methods and procedures of management and opera-
tion; (b) the establishment of improved tariff
structure and levels; (c) the reduction of
unaccounted-for  water  and  rehabilitation  of
wells; and (d) an increase of water production to
meet the demand for water through 1994.
The project comprises:  (a) technical assistance
for operational development and studies on user
charges,   groundwater  potential,   and  sector
adjustments; (b) training for all levels of
staff; (c) operational improvements, includ4ng
equipment and vehicle purchases, replacement of
house connections and minor distribution mains,
installation of water meters, construction of a
meter repair shop, and purchase of imported chem-
icals; and (d) construction of additional capa-
city for production of water.   The technical
assistance and training components would be
implemented in association with a mentor water
utility in another country.



-ii-
Benefits:                The benefits would consist of increased water
availability to consumers, improved water qual-
ity, and improvements in DIPAGUA's management and
finances.   Additional water availability would
enable the servicing of a population of about
700,000, mainly in poor areas of the city.
Risks:                   The main risk is a possible delay eaused by
opposition from certain quarters to the strong
oommitment of both EMPAGUA's management and the
Central Government for the proposed measures to
improve EMPAGUA's administration and finances.
The present outlook for timely execution, how-
ever, is favorable.   There is also a risk of
delays because of the multiplicity of activities
planned under the project.   Yearly assessments
and revisions of the operational development pro-
gram would minimize this risk.

I. THE SECTOR
Service Levels and Quality
1.01      Service levels for water and sanitation in Guatemala are the low-
est in Central America. Both urban and rural areas are poorly served: in
1982 house connections were provided to only 55% of the urban and 6% of the
rural population; a sewerage system was used by 37% of the urban popula-
tion, while latrines or septic tanks were used by 10% of the urban and 25%
of the rural families*  Service quality also is low.  Rationing is wide-
spread in Guatemala City, and treatment is deficient in most localities.
Operations and maintenance in the majority of the operating entities are
poor due to inadequate institutional structures.
1.02       Inadequate water and other services are associated with poverty
and unsatisfactory health conditions. Life expectancy at birth is 60 years
vs. 65 years on the average for all countries in Latin America. The prin-
cipal cause of death is intestinal disease, which is directly related to
inadequate water and sanitation services.
Sector Organization
1.03      Guatemala has many agencies involved in water and sanitation.  On
the national level, the main agencies and their respective responsibilities
are the following:  (a) the General Secretariat of Planning (SEGEPLAN) for
economic and physical planning; (b) the National Reconstruction Committee
(NRA) for reconstruction of damaged infrastructure; (c) the Xaya-Pixcaya
Unit of the Ministry of Communications and Public Works for the construc-
tion of a major transmission line to Guatemala City; (d) the Institute for
Municipal Development (INFOM), under the Ministry of Development, for.
finance, construction and operational advice in urban areas outside the
capital; (e) the Division of Environmental Sanitation (DSA) of the Ministry
of Public Health and Social Assistance for services to dispersed rural
areas; and (f) the Executing Unit for Rural Water Supply (UNEPAR), under
the Ministry of Health, for concentrated rural areas. On the local level,
construction, operations and maintenance are the responsibility of munici-
palities.  In Guatemala City, the municipality has established a special-
ized agency, the Empresa Municipal de Agua (EMPAGUA), to operate, maintain
and charge for water and sewerage services.
1.04      Until recently these agencies were uncoordinated, and their poli-
cies and programs  unrelated  to common goals.   Cooperation started to
improve in 1982 with the establishment of the Permanent Committee for the
Coordination of the Water and Sanitation Sector (COPECAS), with membership
drawn from all the relevant agencies. UNDP, with the assistance of PAHO,
is actively involved in financing technical assistance and training for
COPECAS and its member agencies. In 1986, a new Ministry for the Develop-
ment of Urban and Rural Communities has been created to identify the needs
for oublic services and coordinate their expansion at the community level.
Sector Inv'estments and Financing
1.05      Low service levels reflect inadequate levels of investment in the
sector which, In turn, result from a number of institutional weaknesses.



- 2 -
These include: (a) lack of internal cash generation by operating agencies
due mainly to Inadequate pricing and cost recovery policies; (b) too few
well-prepared projects; (c) Insufficient governmental support to the sec-
tor in the past; and (d) administratively inefficient agencies, often
unable to spend the Government budgetary funds which are allocated to them
for projects. If service levels are to increase to meet the requirements
of the rapidly growing population, the institutions responsible for plan-
ning and executing investments must be strengthened.
1.06      Between 1973 and 1982, a total of only Q142 million (US$142 mil-
lion) was invested in water and sanitation facilities. This amounted to
2.2% of the Central Government budget and 0.3% of the GDP. About 802 of
these investments were spent on water supply expansion and rehabilitation
and the remainder on sanitation.   Roughly two-thirds were destined for
urban areas.   Multilateral and bilateral development agencies have sup-
ported investments in the sector, including USAID, IDB, CIDA, BCIE, and
UNICEF. The total amount of exter,u's funds made available from 1973-82 was
US$55 million.
1.07      In 1983, COPECAS, supported by SEGEPLAN, prepared a National Plan
for the Water Decade. The plan aims at accelerating infrastructure devel-
opment in order to reduce enteric and diarrheal diseases, facilitate eco-
nomic growth, and improve the living conditions of the poor. The plan pro-
vides a useful framework for detailed programs of action, though its tar-
gets are too ambitious, because of the time required to improve the present
constrained fiscal situation, lack of adequate tariff and cost recovery
policies, and implementation weaknesses of sector institutions.
Bank Sector Strategy
1.08        This would be the first of a number of projects that the Bank
would consider assisting in the water and sanitation sector as part of its
strategy to support basic infrastructure and social services in Guatemala.
Bank assistance to the sector will aim at: (a) strengthening the manage-
ment and structure of the sector's institutions and raising their adminis-
trative and financial capability for increasing investment; (b) Improving
services which raise the health and productivity of the population; (c)
increasing the mobilization of domestic resources through the gradual
implementation of tariff structures and levels that impro-e cost recovery
while making services affordable  to the lowest-income groups;  and  (d)
improving operational efficiency and productivity, reducing water losses,
and promoting conservation.
1.09        Assistance in the sector by other multilateral and bilateral
development agencies has generally emphasized construction of works.
Except for some recent efforts through a UNDP-supported program, none of
these investments have focussed on institution-building and the provision
of substantial technical assistance. The proposed loan would be a vehicle
to transfer the experience the Bank has acquired in helping other member
countries to build stronger water and sanitation institutions.
1.10      The Government has requested that this first project be directed
toward the problems of Guatemala City, where a growing demand and deter-
lorating finances  in the water company require urgent solutions.   The



- 3 -
preparation of this project helped stimulate a greater recognition by the
Government of the need to strengthen sectoral institutions and policies.
At the Government's request, the project would incluade a sector study for
the identification of adjustments at the national level which could include
the restructuring of responsibilities for water extraction, distribution
and finance between Central Government and municipal agencies, and the
creation of autonomous enterprises.
The City and IHPAGUA
1.ll      Guatemala City is the largest and fastest growing city in Guate-
mala. It is estimated that the population will grow from 1.4 million pres-
ently to 1.8 million and 2.7 million in 1990 and the year 2000, respec-
tively. Guatemala City is served by a public water utility, EMPAGUA, which
provides most of its supply and about 85X of its connections.   About
875,000 people are served through house connections, while the remaining
population (525,000) receives water--some of it of questionable quality-
from standposts and private wells.
1.12      EMPAGUA is a subordinated branch of the Municipality of Guatemala
City.    ithough EMPAGUA owns assets and has its own executive management,
staff, and accounting system, it has no 4uridical personality and most man-
agement decisions are subject to Municipal Council approval. The lack of
autonomy has hampered EMPAGUA'e performance. Outside interference in staff
management and a lack of well defined personnel policies and systems have
led to some overstaffing and unevenly qualified and motivated staff. The
new management of the Municipality and EMPAGUA are committed to (i)
strengthening management, organization, and finances of the agency under
the proposed project and (it) preparing a program to increase the legal,
financial, and operational autonomy of EMPAGUA and implementing it
beforeJune 30, 1987.
1.13       A rapid population increase in Guatemala City during the 1970s
has created a need to modernize EMPAGUA's organization and policies in
order to satisfy its enlarged scale of operations. Because of a delay in
modernization, the agency has faced over the last five years serious prob-
lems in operations, management and finance which reduce its ability to
efficiently meet the demand for its services.
1.14      The water service in Guatemala City is deficient in quantity and
quality.   Water service is intermittent in most parts of the city (4-18
hours per day). Water pressure is uneven, and treatment is sometimes defi-
cient.   Inappropriate procedures, a lack of equipment and vehicles, and
gaps in information on the location of pipes have caused inadequate opera-
tions and maintenance.   Ineffective supervision affects the quality of
meter reading. Although unaccounted-for water cannot be reliably quanti-
fied,l/ water waste and unbilled use is known to be high due to a large
number of illegal connections,/ a high proportion of malfunctioning
domestic meters (40%), and frequent leaks in the distribution system,
mainly  due  to  inadequate  construction  and  pipe  Installation  in
1/ Because water production and consumption are not fully measured.
2/ About 7,000 illegal connections have already been identified in the
city areas with a municipal cadaster.



-4-
the older parts of the city. Electricity, which amounts to about 40% of
total expenses, is wasted as pumping stations are not operating effi-
ciently.   Accounting controls are acceptable to record project ixpend-
itures, although poor historical records and delays in introducing cer-
tain fixed assets into the accounting systems (e.g. the sewerage system of
the city, which was formally transferred from the Municipality in 1984)
have led to qualifications in EMPAGUA's external audit report regarding
fixed asset balances.
1.15      A unique but antiquated tariff system has discouraged water con-
servation and encouraged the proliferation of illegal connections.  This
system is based on the sale of water titles on the capital market to indi-
vidual customers.   Titles are based on multiples of a 'paja", a measure
equal to 60 m3 a month. The structure of charges consists of: (a) a one
time upfront charge for the title and connection; (b) a fixed monthly
charge up to the "paja" entitlement; and (c) a monthly charge for excess
consumption after the fixed charge.  This tariff structure is not suffi-
ciently sensitive to levels of water consumption as consumption allowed
under the fixed charge is generally higher than average consumption lev-
els. As a result, large consumers have no incentive to save water, while
users in the low-income group who consume less than the minimum allowance
end up paying a high price per m3 actually consumed.    Also, high entry
fees for title and connection make the system unaffordable to many of the
poor. EMPAGUA and the Government are aware of the difficulties created by
this water title system and have started to study alternatives to replace
it. The proposed project includes preparation and implementation of a plan
to modify the water title system and tariff structure (para. 2.04).
1.16        EMPAGUA has been aware of its problems for some time, and has
initiated pilot schemes to improve consumption metering, inspect for leaks,
ensure that consumption charges are billed appropriately, and overhaul its
computerized billing and accounting system. The planning process has been
improved, and units for physical, financial and institutional planning are
in place. Many of the managers and staff are dedicated, loyal and compe-
tent professionals and technicians, who are prepared to make the institu-
tional and financial changes which are needed to provide Guatemala City
with a satisfactory water and sanitation service. The change in January
1986 to a civilian government has generated substantial political support
for reform.   Since January 1986 EMPAGUA has had a new and experienced
General Manager who has successfully carried out reorganization efforts in
the city's telephone agency in the recent past.
II. THE PROJECT
Project Origin
2.01        The project was identified in February 1985, was prepared by
EMPAGUA, and was appraised in February 1986.   Negotiations were held in
Washington from July 7 to July 11, 1986.    The Guatemalan delegation was
led by Mr. Guillermo Salazar, Director, Ministry of Finance. The main fea-
tures of the loan and project are described in the Loan and Project Sum-
mary.  The project is part of a master plan for water supply improvement
and expansion in the metropolitan area prepared by consultants in 1981,
which recomended the urgent construction of deep wells in the valley of
Guatemala and Xaya-Pixcaya areas.



ProJect Objectives
2.0       The proposed project is a first main step in assisting EMPAGUA
become a more efficient organization, capable of providing good service
without recourse to operating subsidies from the Government, and able to
undertake the larger investments which will be needed in the future to
expand its services.  Detailed project objectives comprise:  (a) finance:
the establishment of a new tariff structure which will increase revenues,
eliminate operating subsidies, encourage conservation, and ensure an
affordable minimum supply to low-income groups; (b) administration: (i) the
improvement of EMPAGUA's methods and procedures of management and of its
organization; and (ii) the establishment of staff training programs; (c)
operations:  (i) the improvement of operations and maintenance in existing
facilities; (ii) the establishment of conservation programs (including leak
control and metering); (iii) an increase in the efficiency of existing
wells and pumping stations; (iv) increased production to meet water damand
through 1994; and (v) the establishment of an adequate capacity to repair
and maintain equipment and facilities; and (d) planning: strengthening of
existing planning for the expansion of the water supply systeme
Project Description
2.03       The project would mainly improve the functioning and efficiency
of the existing water and sewerage system through a program of operational
and administrative improvements.   Central to the concept of the project
would be the establishment of an association between EMPAGUA and a water
utility which has solved similar problems in another country and would act
both in an advisory and training capacity. Consultants associated with the
mentor company would assist ENPAGUA's management to design and implement
new operating systems.
2.04      The project comprises the following components (Annexes 4 and 5):
(a) Technical assistance for operational development and studies.
Consultants would diagnose, design, implement and document
improvements in the organization, management, methods and pro-
cedures of EMPAGUA. Separate studies would cover water resources
and groundwater potential, expansion of the distribution system,
structure of user charges (including the water title system),
inventory and revaluation of fixed assets and identification of
sector adjustments at the national level.
(b)  Training, including on-the-job training, training in local insti-
tutions and overseas visits.
(c) Operational improvements to support the technical assistance and
to increase the efficiency and quality of the existing water sys-
tem, including: (i) equipment purchase and installation to reha-
bilitate existing wells, pumping stations, and the distribution
system and to improve EMPAGUA's technical capabilities; (ii) pur-
chase of about 35 specialized vehicles for maintenance and
repair; (iii) minor distribution works (mainly replacement of



- 6 -
house connections and minor distribution mains); (iv) purchase of
imported chemicals for about one and a half years of operation;
and (v) installation of water meters and a meter repair shop.
(d)  System exDansion, through the construction of wells for incre-
mental production of about 0.6 cubic meters per second of water.
2.05      The proposed project would complement and make use of technical
assistance which is currently provided through bilateral sources or under
consideration, including a study financed by the French Government on the
flows in water distribution systems and a study financed by Japanese
assistance on the groundwater extraction capacity in the valley of Guate-
mala.
Project Cost and Financing
2.06         The estimated total cost of the proposed project, including
price and physical contingencies, is US$27.4 (Q68.8) million of which 74%
or US$20.4 (Q51.0) million is foreign exchange. A table at the beginning
of this report shows the breakdown by project components.  The base cost,
expressed in July 1986 prices, is US$21.5 (Q53.8) million.3/   Physical
contingencies of 10% were calculated on all elements of the project except
the sector adjustment study. Price contingencies, equivalent to about 16%
of the sum of base cost and physical contingencies, were calculated assum-
ing that local inflation decreases gradually from 25% in 1986 to 10% in
1989 and thereafter.  International inflation is assumed at 7.2% in 1986,
6.8% in 1987-88, 7.0% in 1989, 7.1% in 1990, and 4.0% thereafter. Total
finance required, including interest during construction, is estimated at
US$30.0 (Q75.0) million.
2.07       The Bank would finance US$23.0 (Q57.5) million, or 77% of total
financing required, representing the foreign exchange cost of project
investments of US$20.4 (Q51.0) million and interest during construction up
to US$2.6 (Q6.5) million (representing the interest expected to be due dur-
ing the first four years of the project). Counterpart financing would be
provided from EMPAGUA's internally generated resources, except for the rel-
atively small national sector study component, which would be provided by
the Government. The loan would be made to the Government, which would on-
lend to the Municipality4/ the quetzal equivalent of US$22.3 million, with
the same grace period, repayment t rm and interest rate as the Bank loan.
The Municipality would pass on the proceeds of the loan to EMPAGUA, which
will provide for the servicing of the loan and bear the foreign exchange
risk.   The financing by the Bank of interest during const'uction is
justified because of the time required to achieve the project's objective
of strengthening EMPAGUA's finances.  The execution of a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government and the Municipality would be a condition
of effectiveness.
3/ An exchange rate of Q2.5 - US$1 (the parallel market rate) will apply
to all transactions in Guatemala except debt service of Government
agencies which will apply the official exchange rate (US$ = Q1) until
December 31, 1987.
4/ About US$0.7 (Q1.75) million of the loan would be used by the Govern-
ment itself for the national sector study, and thus would not be on-
lent.

Project Implementation
2.08      Terms of reference of the consultants to be employed to assist in
carrying out the sector adjustment study would be furnished to the Bank for
its review by October 31, 1986. Terms of reference for all other consult-
ancies were completed during appraisal (Annex 8). Designs and specifica-
tions of equipment and works for the first two years of project implementa-
tion would be completed by the time of Board Presentation. Three utilities
in other countries have been identified for the provision of overall advis-
ory services.   EMPAGUA would conclude a 'twinning" arrangement and hire
consultants for operational development and training by May 31, 1987. The
signing of contracts with consultants for operational development would be
a condition of disbursement of civil works and purchases of equipment and
materials.   The water sector adjustment study would be completed during
1987-88 by an inter-agency task force led by the national planning agency
(SECEPLAN),5/ with assistance by consultants.
2.09      The program of operational consultancies and improvements would
be executed in phases.  Phase 1, scheduled from June 1 to July 31, 1987,
would Involve a coimprehensive assessment of EMPAGUA's organizational struc-
ture and its systems, procedures and practices. Based on the results of
Phase 1, the consultants would, during Phase 2 (August 1 through September
30, 1987), develop a plan of action for operational strengthening, includ-
ing proposals on how individual systems would be improved during the dura-
tion of the project and a detailed action plan for the first year of imple-
mentation.   The overall action plan would be implemented in subsequent
phases of 12 months each, subject to an assessment at the close of each
year of the accomplishments during the previous year and the development of
a detailed action plan for the following year.   The overall and yearly
action plans would be approved by both EMPAGUA and the Bank by September 30
of each year from 1987 through 1990. Adequate procedures for the use, con-
trol and maintenance of vehicles would be in plaee by September 30, 1987,
and would be a condition of disbursement for the vehicles to be purchased
under the project.  Under the project, EMPAGUA would achieve the annual key
performance targets specified in Annex 13A, and would carry out the actions
identified in the above overall action plan and annual ae.ion plans.
2.10      Project coordination and supervision of consultants would be car-
ried out by the existing Institutional Development Unit of EMPAGUA, which
would report directly to the General Manager. Equipment installation and
small construction works would be supervised by BMPAGUA staff attached to
the relevant operating units. The works would be carried out in part by
contractors and in part by force account (para. 2.11). Consultants would
assist in monitoring work quality and initiating new systems of
supervision,
5/  the legal documentation is flexible in permitting the Borrower to name
another agency, with the approval of the Bank, for this purpose.

international competitive bidding in accordance with the "Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", except for equipment and
materials contracts which are less than US$50,000 each which would be pro-
cured through local competitive bidding and limited international bidding,
and civil works contracts less than US$300,000 equivalent each. At the
Government's request, manufacturers of equipment and materials in member
countries of the Cantral American Common Market (CACK) would have a margin
of preference in bid a-7aluation of 15 percent of the C.I.F. cost or half
the amount of taxes on tne importation of such goods, whichever is lower.

Regional manufaeturers are likely to participate in bids for distribution
pipes. During negotiations, assurancer have been obtained that the local
procurement procedures to be applied are consistent with the Bank's
guidelines.   For contracts exceeding US$50,000 equivalent for goods and
US$200,000 equivalent for civil works (Annex 9), (i.e. about 90% of the
total estimated value of goods and 60X of the civil works contracts), the
Bank would review and approve tender documents before they are issued.
Disbursements
2.13      Proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed for (Annex 10):
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for all direct imports and the ex-
factory cost of locally manufactured goods internationally pro-
cured;
(b) 30X of expenditures for equipment and local materials locally
procured;
(c) 30% of total expenditures for civil works;
(d) OO% of total expenditures for consulting services and training;
and
(e) the amount due for interest and other charges on the Bank's loan
up to a maximum of US$2.6 million.
2.14      For civil works contracts valued at less than US$50,000 equiva-
lent, disbursement would be made against statements of expenditure certi-
fied by EMPAGUA. Documentation for these expenditures would be retained by
EIPAGUA for inspection by the Bank missions and would be annually audited
by independent auditors (para. 2.22).   All other disbursements would be
fully documented.   In order to expedite project execution, a Special
Account would be opened in the Central Bank of Guatemala with an initial
deposit of US$1.5 million by the Bank. Implementation (Annex 9) and dis-
bursement (Annex 11) schedules are in line with standard profiles of water
projects in the region.   The closing date for the loan would be Decem-
ber 31, 1994, six months after expected completion.
Retroactive Financinft
2.15      In view of the need to urgently start the repair and rehabilita-
tion of pumping stations, wells,  and distribution system, retroactive
financing of US$500,000 is proposed.
Financial Performance
2.16      8MPAGUA's finances are very weak, mainly due to a 40% decline in
tariffs in real terms since 1981, as nominal tariffs were not increased.
Income before depreciation showed an estimated loss of Q3.8 million in
CY1985, an amount equal to about 38% of tariff revenues and about 30% of
total revenues. This loss was financed, as in several previous years, by



10 -
deferring the payment of electricity bills. At the end of 1985, EMPAGUA
owed the Empresa Electrica de Guatemala (EEG) about Q26.8 million. Total
accounts payable by EMPAGUA at the end of 1985 were estimated to be more
than three times the operating revenues for the year.   Collection by
EMPAGUA of service charges is slow: the accounts receivable at the end of
1985 were equal to about seven months of sales.
2.17      By the beginning of 1986, EMPAGUA and the Municipality recognized
that tariff increases and cost containment measures were needed to prevent
operating losses from worsening considerably in 1986 and 1987.   A large
(40Z) increase in operating costs was foreseen, as the costs of imported
chemicals have more than doubled due to the new exchange rate; and labor
costs were expected to increase by at least 282.
Financial Objectives
2.18       Since assuming office in January 1986, the new administration of
RMPAGUA has taken decisive actions to improve the finances and operations
of EMPAGUA.   First, they have approved new tariff levels and structure
(Annex 16) which are expected to provide an increase of about 77% in reve-
nues from water sales. Second, they have introduced operational and admin-
istrative improvements which should lead to additional increases, though
modest, in billing and collections and containment of operating costs.
2.19        The new tariff levels are the result of increases in both the
fixed monthly charge and in the charge for consumption above allocated
quantities.   Increases in fixed charge range from Q1.75 for most users
(i.e. those with a 30m3 allocation) up to Q40 for the largest consumers.
Increases for excess consumption range from QO.40 to 0.65/m3. The rates
remain practically unchanged for users with a 20m3 allocation (i.e. all
low-income families).
2.20      The measures taken thus far will allow EMPAGUA to cover Its oper-
ating costs and debt service for the rest of 1986 and for 1987 (Annex 12).
However, additional financial and operational adjustment measures by
EMPAGUA are needed in order to continue to meet its obligations in a timely
manner and generate internal funds sufficient to cover a reasonable share
of its investment needs. The main measures include: (a) tilht control over
operating costs, especially for personnel and electricity'/; (b) substan-
tial inc-eases in operating efficiency, particularly through the reduction
of unaccounted-for water (para. 1.16) and water waste; (c) improved collec-
tions efficiency; (d) water tariff increases; and (e) the introduction of
charges for the operation of the sewerage system.
2.21      Under the proposed project:
(a) EMPAGUA would maintain tariffs and other charges sufficient to
cover operating expenses, working capital needs, debt service
6/ EMPAGUA expects to reduce its electricity expenditures by Q2 million a
year starting in 1987 through the use of lower rates associated with a
reduction in pumping during peak hours. Negotiations with EEG on this
are already well advanced.



- 11 -
payments and contributions to capital expenditures starting in
1987, increasing gradually to not less than 25% of three-year
average capital expenditures7/ for 1991 and thereafter.8/ This
would require water tariff adjustments roughly in line with
inflation, and the introduction and gradual increase of sewerage
charges starting in 1988, preferably through a surcharge on water
tariffs;9/
(b) EMPAGUA would maintain a ratio of current assets to current
liabilities for 1987 and thereafter of not less than 1.2;
(c) EMPAGUA would achieve the key performance targets for the years
respectively specified (Annex 13A and para. 2.09). which include:
(i) a decrease in accounts receivable to four months of sales by
1989 and to three months by 1993; (ii) a reduction in the working
ratio to .65 by 1993; (iii) a decrease in yearly operating cost
per connection from Q155 in 1986 to Q130 by 1993; (iv) an
increase in connections with working meters from 65% in 1986 to
95% in 1994; and (v) a decrease in the number of employees per
1,000 connections from 13.9 in 1986 to 9.4 in 1994;
(d)  EMPAGUA would submit to the Bank by November 30, 1988, detailed
plans for modifying the water title system and the structure of
tariffs, and implement such a plan by January 30, 1989;
(e) EMPAGUA would review the size and composition its a three year
investment program with the Bank by September 30 of each year
beginning in 1987, and capital expenditures in excess of $500,000
which are not included in the investment program reviewed by the
Bank will require Bank approval; and
(f) as a condition of effectiveness, the Government, EMPAGUA and BEG
would execute an agreement providing for the settlement of the
arrears of more than 60 days of EMPAGUA to KEG by December 31,
1986. A similar provision has also been agreed under the Power
Distribution Project approved by the Board on June 24, 1986.10/
7/ Capital expenditures are defined as average estimated capital
expenditures for the preceding year, the present year and the
forthcoming year.
8/ The use of rates of return as a measure of financial health is prema-
ture with regard to EMPAGUA due to inaccuracies in the asset base
(para. 1.14). However, given that the rates of return which have been
derived (Annex 12) are probably overstated, it is obvious that EMPAGUA
will need to continue to improve its finances even after the close of
the project.
9/   Sewerage surcharges are expected to start at 30% of water tariffs,
rising to 50% in two years.
10/ This is expected to be done through adjustments to the accounts of
EMPAGUA, BEG and INDE without additional cash outlays from the Govern-
ment, as the basis for the adjustment would be the routing of an
existing grant to INDE through EMPAGUA and EEG.



- 12 -
Operational Performance, Reporting & Audit
2.22       Under the project EMPAGUA would prepare the following reports In
order to facilitate the planning and monltorlug of Its operational and
flnancial performance:   (a) annual operational plans, which are due four
months after the start of operational consultancies and every year there-
after; (b) annual financial plans, due September 30 of every year; (c)
semi-annual progress reports, due ten months after the start of operational
consultancies and every six months thereafter; (d) annual audit reports,
due June 30 of every year; and (e) a completion report, due six months
after the closing date of the Bank loan. Annual operational and financial
plans would be linked to consultancy work (para. 2.09) and the Government
budgetary process. These plans would address the key performance targets
agreed under the project (Annex 13A and para. 2.09) as well as monitoring
indicators (Annex 13B) designed to track the achievement of improved oper-
atitg and financial efficiency and progress on the project. Key perform-
ance targets and monitoring indicators would be revised each year, based on
project experience and comments from the Government and the Bank. In addi-
tion, financial plans would include three-year financial projections and
investment plans and note specific measures, tncluding tariff and revenue
adjustments and other operational measures which are needed to comply with
covenants and agreed targets.   Semi-annual progress reports would cover
project implementation and achievement of key performance targets and moni-
toring indicators and EMPAGUA would have its financial statements, the Spe-
cial Account and statements of expenditures audited by independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Justification, Benefits and Affordability
2,23      The project would improve Guatemala City's existing water supply
and provide the minimum expansion consistent with near-term growth
expectations.   The project is an integral part of EMPAGUA's  Investment
program, which provides a least-cost solution to the expansion needs of the
water supply system.
Summary of Benefits
2.24        The benefits of the project would accrue from water quantity
lncreases, improved water quality and progressive improvement in EMPAGUA's
finances. Significant increments in water are expected from: (i) recovery
of water losses In the existing system;11/ (ii) improved operation of
pumping stations and deep wells; and (iii) additional production from new
wells.   Incremental water available through the project is estimated at
about 36 million cubic meters per year (Annex 14). Water quality would be
improved through implementation of better systems of maintenance and con-
trol,  particularly  at  treatment  plants.    EMPAGUA  finances  would  be
strengthened by increased water sales and revenues, containment of opera-
tional costs, Government assistance in reducing accounts payable, and post-
ponement of investments in water extraction due to the above increased
availability of water to the users.
11/ Some of the water made available through reduction in unaccounted-for
water (UFW) is already being consumed through illegal connections and
unbilled use.   Therefore,  only about  1/3 of the additional water
available for billing through reductions in UFW is considered as
Incremental water derived from the project through, for example,
reduction of leaks.



- 13 -
2.25         During the first three yoars of the project, the Incremental
water made available by the project would eliminate the present water defi-
cit and the related need  for widespread water rationing.   Operational
improvements and the new production will each year make more water avail-
able for extension of the system to outlying areas. In the medium term, as
more water becomes available, water from gravity and low-cost sources would
enable EMPAGUA to limit the use of the most expensive sources (wells with
high pumping costs) to periods of peak demand. The additional water recov-
ered or developed under the project would allow EWPAGUA to meet the demand
until 1994.
Economic Analysis
2.26       The economic rate of return for the project (Annex 14) is esti-
mated to be 212, which is above the range of the opportunity cost of capi-
tal in Guatemala (10-12Z). Its calculation is based on the expected reve-
nues derived from the Incremental water produced, the investment costs
(including technical assistance), and the incremental operating costs.
Sensitivity analysis shows that the rate of return would be 162 in case the
cost of Imports increases because of a shift of the exchange rate to Q3.0 -
US$1, and 18% in case the proportion of unaccounted-for water improves only
modestly, from 472 to 402.
2.27    The above estimates are only a measure of minimum benefits.   The
project is likely to generate additional benefits accruing from improvement
of public health and hygiene, enhanced property values, employment genera-
tion, and greater well-being of the population, which cennot be quantified
reliably and, therefore, are excluded from the above caicutlations.   The
consumer surplus is also excluded from the calculations.
Social Impact
2.28    About 902 of Guatemala City's population would benefit from the
project.  All existing users (of which 54X have a supply contract and 30X
receive water from EMPAGUA through standpipes, tankers, and illegal connec-
tions), would benefit from more reliable supplies and better quality.  In
addition, the incremental water produced in the project would facilitate
about 100,000 new connections serving 700,000 people, mainly in the outly-
ing marginal communities surrounding the city. At least 3/4 of the popula-
tion which would benefit from these connections is estimated to have
Incomes below the urban poverty threshold of $430 per capita per year.
About 60% of funds invested in the project would improve the quantity and
quality of water for the poor. In addition, under the project, the system
of water titles and tariffs (paras. 1.15 and 2.02) would be modified to
make charges more affordable to the urban poor.12/
12/  Present charges to a poor family include 02.50 per month for tariffs
and capital charges of Q333 for a water title and Q175 for a water
connection.   Although EMPAGUA tried to improve the affordability of
these charges by financing the water titles over five years, the
resulting monthly charges are more than 42 of the incomes of poor fam-
ilies (those with Incomes below the urban poverty threshold, a
relatively large amount for water, and many familites cannot save the
Q175 needed fur connections.



- 14 -
Management Inpact
2.29   The project would substantially improve EMPAGUA's operational effee-
tiveness and efficiency through the introduction of new anagement systems
in the following areas:
A.  Organizational Development.   Improved organizational structure and
information system.
B.  Operation and Maintenance of Supply Systems.  Improved procedures
for pumping stations and treatment plants, with emphasis on system-
atic periodic maintenance of electro-mechanical equipment and effi-
cient operation of treatment facilities.  Deep well supplies would
receive special priority.
C. Operation and Maintenance of Distribution Systems. Introduction of
modern methods to improve measurements and reduce waste, including:
(i) pitometer practices; (ii) iacrometering to measure flows of pro-
duction sources, treatment plant outputs and city sectors; (iii)
domestic metering and meter repair; (iv) updating and completion of
distribution system mapping; (v) detection and repair of leaks and
introduction of a program of preventive maintenance; and (vi) con-
struction procedures for replacement of small size pipe (flautas) in
the older parts of the city.
D.  Commercial Systems.   Improved meter reading, billing, collecting
practices, and customer relations. A survey of existing and poten-
tial customers would be completed.  An estimated 23,000 presently
illegal connections would be Incorporated into the system, and a
permanent system developed for detection and connection.   Public
relations systems implemented under the project would play a Key
role in improving EMYAGUA's public image.
B.  Financial Systems.   Emphasis on tariff structures  and improved
accounting systems.  The present system of "pajas de agua", which
encourages waste, would be modified to encourage conservation and
cross-subsidization of the poor.   The accounting system would be
improved to offer better support to management.
F. Personnel Systems. Modern personnel practices would be introduced,
including job descriptions, job qualifications, evaluations, struc-
tured promotions, merit pay and staff training.
G. Planning and Design. Better knowledge of water resources and costs
of expansion and operation would strengthen planning for future
investments and preparation of the investment program.   Design
standards will also be improved.



- 15 -
Financial Imact
2.30   Without the financial and physical measures proposed under the proj-
ect, large and growing operating and cash deficits, together with water
deficits, would continue. Service connections would expand only modestly.
The efficiency improvements and tariff increases envisaged under the proj-
ect would eliminate financial deficits, and thus, the need for subsidies
from the Government or the Municipality.   In addition, the reduction of
water losses and conservation measures under that project would permit a
five-year postponement of large investments which are needed for the next
stage of expansion of water sources.   This postponement is estimated to
have a present value of Q64 million, assuming a discount rate of 15S.
Invironmental Impact
2.31        The project would result in improvement in the sanitary and
environmental conditions in the metropolitan area of Guatemala City by
increasing access to adequate quantities of clean water and by improving
operations and maintenance in both the water and sewerage systems.  The
municipality has recently completed a series of projects financed by IDB
for a sewerage system. The system, which has been transferred to EMPAGUA
for operation and maintenance, would adequately dispose of most of the
incremental water produced by the project. Per capita consumption in mar-
ginal areas is relatively small; therefore, the water to be distributed to
marginal areas not covered by the sewerage system would be adequately
removed through individual disposal systems.
Risks and Safeguards
2.32   The main risk is a possible delay caused by opposition from certain
quarters to the strong covaitment of the management of EMPAGUA and the
Central Government for some of the proposed changes which are politically
difficult (e.g. reducing staff, charging more to larger users in order to
cross-subsidize the poor, requiring water conservation). Favorable circum-
stances however, are expected to minimize this risk.  First, there are new
civilian government authorities with  a political mandate  for change.
Second,  there  are  fiscal  constraints  in  Guatemala  which  limit  the
availability of Government subsidies.   And third, there is a new and
exp'rienced General Manager in EMPAGUA who has successfully carried out
reorganization efforts in the city's telephone company.
2.33        Another risk concerns the multiplicity of activities planned
under the project to achieve rapid and balanced institutional rehabilita-
tion. Some of these are novel for EMPAGUA and there is a risk of delays
because of staff resistance to certain changes. The project design reduces
this risk through yearly assessments and revisions of the operational
development program.  This would allow the management of EMPAGUA to take
actions which are both necessary and feasible at the appropriate time. The

WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT
Training Component
1.        The purpose of the training component is to provide EMPAGUA staff
with the skills and knowledge required to support institutional rehabilita-
tion and staff productivity. The training system would not be limited to
meeting project related training needs, but would also provide a continuing
capability to identify and meet human resource development requirements in
the future.
2.        Over the four years of the scheduled activities of the component,
during which time EMPAGUA staff is expected to remain stable or decrease,
the training component would facilitate the training of approximately 502
of EMPAGUA staff based on identified training needs.   This goal would
necessitate establishing a training section as part of the institutional
development unit.   The  training section would receive the appropriate
fae_lities, staff, and technical assistance to plan, coordinate, monitor,
and evaluate training activities. The training section would work closely
with the units and managers in EMPAGUA to identify training needs on an
annual basis and implement a training program based on these perceived
needs and the capabilities of existing personnel.
3.        Three strategies would be utilized in the annual training program
for strengthening the skills and knowledge of XMPAGUA staff: on-the-job
training, training by local institutions, and educational visits overseas
to a mentor water agency.
On-the-Job Training
4.          Training needs at the operational and lower levels of  *PAGWA
would be addressed by on-the-job training. On-the-job training would be a
formal planned activity conducted at the worksite using job tasks as train-
ing for the employees.   To implement on-the-job training, the training
department would first develop a training of trainers course which, over
the four years of the project, would train approximately sixty selected
DMPAGUA staff from all areas of EMPAGUA in training techniques. Consultant
services, contained under the technical assistance component of the
project, would participate in providing the necessary technical content and
assist the newly developed trainers to prepare the content base of their
on-the-job training activities.   Each potential trainer would design a
training  manual  and  on-the-job  performance  checklists.    Using  these
materials developed during the course, each trainer would then train
approximately ten   persons in his or her work area.  The key to this
formalized approach of on-the-job training would be the feedback provided
by the trained supervisor or colleague to the group of trainee employees

ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 3
about their work performance.   During  the projeet, approximately 600
workers would be trained on the job, mainly in the areas of operations and
maintenance and commercial. The majority of training would be conducted on
the Job.
Local Institutions
5.        In areas such as accounting, budgeting and computers where iden-
tified training needs cannot be met by EMPAGUA staff and the expertise
exists locally, EMPAGUA staff at all levels would attend selected courses
provided by loeal Institutions. A variety of loeal institutions such as
local universities, private consulting firms, and municipal and govern-
mental training organizations have indicated interest in conducting spe-
eialized courses at EMPAGUA as well as having EMPAGUA staff attend their
regu!.r course offerings.   During the project, approximately 135 staff
would be trai-ed using local institutions.
Vi,its Overseas
6.         Introdueing new tariff and technical systems as well as manage-
ment approaches would require that EHPAGUA staff, accompanied by SEGEPLAN
and key municipal personnel, visit a water supply agency similar to but
more developed than EMPAGUA. Selected EMPAGUA staff, predominately man-
agers and specific technicians, would study at the mentor (twinning) agency
for approximately a month, following detailed terms of reference.   This
twinning activity would be critical to project success because the EMPAGUA
staff upon their return would be responsible for working with consultants
also associated with the twinning agency to initiate and implement required
changes.   Approximately  fifty EMPAGUA  staff  and  four  government and
municipal employees would make visits overseas.
Four-Year Training Program
7.         The training program would be developed on a rolling basis each
year and would be perceived as an institutional commitment.   A central
training committee composed of mid- and top-level managers would be formed
to first develop a training policy and then guide and monitor the progress
of the training program.  At the unit level, monitoring groups would be
formed to identify training needs and monitor all training activities con-
ducted in the unit, especially on-the-job training activitib∂.  After ini-
tial project start-up, these groups would work together to annually develop
a training program based on an institution-wide training needs analysis
coordinated by the training department. An initial program is outlined in
Attachment A. The program's goal is to train the personnel required to
bring about the necessary institutional improvements.   It addresses all
areas of EMPAGUA but focuses on those areas of greatest training need,
namely the commercial and financial systems, operations and maintenance,
management,  and  human  resources.    The  program  is  integrated  with
consultancy services and complements other training activities sponsored by
bilateral and multilateral agencies.

Implementation
8.          The training component would include three stages.  The first
stage, development, would take one year and would involve establishnlg the
training  department,  converting  existing  facilities,  establishing  the
central and unit training and monitoring groups, establishing a moaitoring
system, formulating a training policy, and developing and implementing the
training of trainers course. The second stage, lplementation, would cover
the remaini'g tbree years. It would include coordinating the development
and implementatlon of the rolling training plan, monitoring approximately
twelve in-country training activities per semester, coordinating overseas
visits, and facilitating the entral and unit tralning and monitoring group
meetings.   The third stage, evaluation, would begin once Implementation
started.   Evaluation would involve developing an evaluation system and
conducting an annual evaluation. A final four-year evaluation would be
conducted to determine the effects of the training component.
Technical Assistanee
9.         Three areas of technical assistance would be required to imple-
umet the training component. A training specialist with expertise in the
water supply and sanitation area would be required for 24 man months upon
project start-up to assist in: (1) establishing the training unit and the
necessary committees within KMPAGUA; (2) identifying training needs; (3)
developing a training program; (4) facilitating the development of the
training of trainers program; and (5) initiating an ongoing monitoring
system. To conduct the four-year evaluation during the final semester of
the projeet, outside consulting services would be necessary.   Teehnical
assistance, for a total of nine man months divided over the four years of
the project, would also be required to assist BMPAGUA in using the new cus-
tomized computer services developed for the financial and commercial areas.

Specific Assignments
The work will be divided into at least three specific assign-
ments:   (A) operational consultancy to strengthen management,  adminis-
tration and operations for both water and sewerage services and to train
EMPAGUA staff; (B) engineering studies for future distribution system
expansion; and (C) water resources which would complement previous and
ongoing studies.   Assignment A may be further subdivided, with separate
consultancy  work  for  specific  tasks,  including,  for  example,  the
revaluation of assets and the formulation of elements of a human resources
management systems.   However, consultants for Assignment A will need to
have an overview over all the activities of EMPAGUA, including studies
which may be implemented separately.
Scope of Work
The consultants will conduct the work herewith described and
whatever other work is needed to attain the above objectives.   In accom-
plishing their assignments, the consultants should assess existing struc-
tures and modify, design and implement all the required elements for the
effective and efficient operations of EMPAGUA.
Training is an essential part of all assignments.  In addition,
consultants for Assignment A should prepare and implement a comprehensive
training program, using as a starting point the training program prepared
during the preparation of the overall project. This program is be carried
out in parallel with the operating improvements and rehabilitation works
included within the project.

optimization of the existing system) and Japanese bilateral
assistance (Ground Water Study);
(c) the introduction of new or improved systems and procedures will
require comprehensive assistance, i.e., the consultant will be
responsible for all aspects of the assistance, from diagnosis
through final implementation, including training (on-the-job or
formal practical training outside) and the identification and
acquisition of appropriate hardware and software;
(d) the design of the technical assistance program should look at all
facets of EMPAGUA, recognize and establish priorities amoag the
systems and procedures to be implemented, and take into account
constraints to EMPAGUA's capacity for absorbing new systems and
procedures; and
(e) the priority of any improvement measures should be judged on its
Impact on the quality of service to EMPAGUA's customers and
EMPAGUA's financial condition.
Reports and Manuals Requiretents
The consultants for Part A should submit the following teports to
EWAGUA's management:

ANmEX 8
Page 7 of 8
(i) Initial Report. Within four months of the starting date stating
the consultants' diagnosis of EMPAGUA's systems and a recommended
strengthening program.   This program should include detailed
information And schedules with quantitative targets (taking Into
account the key financial, operational and project indicators in
the World Bank's Staff Appraisal Report of the project) for the
first year of the program and preliminary designs of the manage-
ment systems and a work plan and schedule for the remainder of
the project. The recommendations will be discussed with EMPAGUA
management and with World Bank supervision teams before imple-
mentation.
(ii) Semi-Annual Progress Reports. Progress reports should be brief
and not take up a significant portion of the consultant's time.
(iii)  Yearly Action Plans.   At the end of the first and subsequent
three years of the project, the progress report should summarize
the achievements and problems encountered in the previous year
and prepare a detailed program for implementation during the sub-
sequent year.   This program should also take into account the
previously agreed upon key performance indicators.
(iv)  Final Report.   Three months before the closing date of the
assignment, consultants should submit a draft final report to
EMPAGUA management. The Final Report should be published after
incorporating EMPAGUA's comments.
(v)  Manuals.  The consultants should prepare manuals describing and
illustrating the procedures to be followed in the use of the
approved management systems. The manuals will be written in a
clear, easy-to-understand language. Sufficient effort should be
allocated in the work plan to conduct training and orientation in
the use of the manuals.
Scheduling
Management consultants for Part A will be appointed not later
than March 31, 1987. Implementation of the above work to strengthen the
management and operations of EMPAGUA would be completed by about May 1991.
Consultants for Part B (Planning and Design) and for Part C
(Ground Water Study) are expected to be appointed by mid-1987 and their
assignments would be completed by mid-1989 and mid-1990, respectively.

WATIR SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT
Empresas Municipales de AgMa (ENPAGUA)
Notes to the Finaneial Statements
General
1.       EMPAGUA's finanecal statements of 1983-84 are audited. Finaneial
statements for 1985 are estimated. Audited statements for 1985 are now
available, and do not substantially differ from the estimates included
hereinunder. Assumptions for water demand and produetion and population
growth are given In Annex 1.  Othor assumptions for projeeted fltancial
statements for 1986-94 are summarised below. Finaneial projeetions will be
reviewed and revised on a yearly basis by DMPAGUA, and will form the basis
for a financil plan for the following year whieh must be approved by the
Bank.
Revenues
2.        Water Tariffs. The average water tariff for 1986 Is based on the
previous tariff for the first six months of the year and implementation on
July 1, 1986, of a decision by the Board of Direetors of EMPAGUA to
increase water tariffs by 77%.   No further real lnereases are expeeted;
however nominal water tariffs are projected to increase in llne with infla-
tion in each year.
3.        Sewerage Tariffs.  The implementation of a sewerage tariff equal
to 30X of the water tariff is assumed to take plaee on January 1, 1988.
This Is eolcident to an expeeted off ielal devaluation of the Quetzal to
Q2.5 - $1, whieh will eonsiderably inerease debt serviee assoeiated with
the sewerage system. The sewerage tariff is assumed to increase to 402 and
50 of water tariffs in 1989 and 1990, respectively.
4.         Conneetion fees for both water and sewerage are expected to in-
crease In line with forecasted lnereases in the number of eonnections and
inflation. As has been the csse during the past several years, half of the
new subscribers are assumed to install the eomnections themselves, and will
pay no connection fee to ZMPAGUA.1/ Connection fees for sewerage are
included as a component of sewerage revenues. Finanee is extended to sew-
erage users for these fees over five years at an interest rate of 102 per
year.
l/ The non-involvement of KMPAGUA has some unsatisfaetory features with
reepeet to eontrol. The poliey regarding this is about to change; how-
ever, the details are not as yet known, and the finanieal projections
are based on the existing polley.

ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 8
5.          Other revenues are for miscellaneous fees ay  eharges (fines,
reeonneetion fees, ete.), whieh are expected to incr sse in line with
inflation.
Operatlng Costs
6.          Personnel.  Projeeted eosts for 1986 Include wage increases of
about 252 granted during mid-1985 and largely paid for by the Government
during 1985. Projected eosts after 1986 refleet decreases in personnel per
thousand eonnections, as shown in the Key Performanee Indieators (Annex
13), and real wage increases of 1-3% per year for several years for remain-
ing staff in order to Improve the competitiveness of EMPAGUA for qualified
staff. Personnel eosts for the sewage operations inelude the absorption
from the Municipality during 1985 and 1986, respectively, of staff asso-
eiated with the sewerage project unit and operation and maintenanee of the
sewerage system.
7.          Chemical Costs.  Sharp increases in the eost of chemicals are
foreseen during 1986 and 1987 due to the assumption that as of June 1,
1986, Imported chemieals must be paid for at an exehange rate of Q2.5 -$1.
About 852 of ehemicals are Imported. Remaining inereases in chemecal costs
through 1994 are assumed to vary with inflation and with water produetion
increases.
8.         Power Costs.  Power costs generally inerease with inflation and
water production increases. A reduetion in power eosts of Q2 million is
assumed to start in January 1, 1987 due to lower eleetrieity rates asso-
eiated with a reduetion in pumping during peak hours. Negotiations between
BKPAGUA and BEG (the eleetrieity eompany eoncerning rates and other mat-
ters) are nearly eompleted.
9.         Materials.   Projected to increase in line with new eonneetions
and inflation.
10.          Losses on Receivables.   Caleulated as 3% of billings whieh
refleets actual experience. Prior to 1986, losses on receivables were not
written off but were lneluded in a provision for doubtful debts on the bal-
anee sheet.
11.        Other.  Consists mainly of administrative costs, sueh as rent,
gas, paper ete.  Projeeted to Increase in line with inflation and eon-
neetion inereases.
12.        Depreeiation.  Based on a 3X depreciation rate on fixed assets.
Gross fixed assets and depreciation are revalued in line with inflation
starting in 1986. Gross fixed assets and depreeiation are also inereased
in 1986 by the transfer of the sewerage system from the Municipality and in
1990 by the transfer of the Xaya-Pixeaya Aqueduet from the Central Govern-
ment. Since fixed assets have not been inventoried nor revalued to date,
it is likely that gross fixed assets totals and depreeiation will change
appreciably onee inventories and revaluation have been eompleted.  The
inventory and revaluation of fixed assets is ineluded as a subeomponent of
the project.

Non-operatng_ Reeefits
13.        Mainly ineludes funds reeoived from the sale of water titles to
new users and betterment eontributions from users of the sewerage system.
The projections asemme that the water title system will eontinue during the
duration of the projeet, with the minor modifieation that water titles
would also be Issued against 70X of the recovery of unaeounted-for water,
onee the existing physical water defielt has been eovered. However, eon-
sultants finaneed by the project will study the system of water rights and
make reeommendations on ways to phase it out or modify it by January 1,
1989. Should water titles be phased out, other charges (most likely water
tariffs) would need to be increased to eompensate. Betterment contribu-
tions have already been assessed to sewerage system users under finanelal
terms which lnclude a repayment period of 5 years at 101 interest.
Working Capital and Other Assets Needs
14.        Accounts Reeelvable.  Projeeted on the basis of targeted annual
eollections-to-billings ratios with a gradual improvement from seven months
of billings in 1986 to three months In 1993. Collections to billing ratios
are identical to the ones used in the Key Performance Targets (Annes 13).
15.         Inventory.  Equivalent to three months supply of ehmlcals and
materials for operations, as well as a small stoek of supplies for invest-
ments.
16.        Accounts          and Other Current Liabilities.  Payables to EEG
declined from Q26.8 in 1985 to Q1.O million In 1986 due to a one time grant
by the Government of Q31.5 million to cover EEG payables as of October 30,
1986. This subsidy Is part of a settlement of accounts in which a grant
Intended for 1DM  is routed through SMPAGUA and E.G.  The payment of these
aecounts payable is a covenant and a condition of effeetiveness of this
loan and a Power Distribution Loan approved in June 1986. After 1986, cur-
rent liabilities (excluding the eurrent portion of long-term debt) decline
from 25X of operating costs and investments to IIZ in 1993. The reduetion
of these current liabilities is facilitated by an improved working capital
position of WIAGUA.
17.          Current Portion of Long-Term Debt.  Projeeted on the basis of
EMPAGUA*s existing and future debt servies requirements. Existing debt
service includes the transfer in 1986 from the Municipality of the debt
(whieh is denominated in US$) associated with the sewerage system, and the
trassfer In 1989 (in Quetzals at a 1:1 exchange rate) of the debt asso-
ciated with Stage 1 of the Xays-Pixcays Aqueduct and associated works.
Most existing debt is on soft terms (1-4Z interest with amortization over
40 years with 10 years of graee). Puture debt serviee ineludes the debt
serviee associated with the projeet, and the debt servies assoelated with
snother Investment projeet concurrent with the Bank projeet and financed by
a multilateral ageney on soft terms. Debt serviee assoeiated with the Bank
loan assumes the following:   US$15.0 million equivalent;  15-year term,

Page 4 of 8
which includes five years of grace; 8.23% average annual interest rate; and
0.75X annual commdttment fee on the undisbursed balance.  The Government
would pass on the Bank loan to EMPAGUA on the same terms of conditions with
which it receives it. EMPAGUA would assume the foreign exchange risk and
the interest rate risk.
18.          Other Assets.   Mostly feasibility and planning studies, the
costs of which have been capitalized. Expected to grow by 3X per year.
19.       Long-term debt.  See discussion under para. 16 above.  In 1987,
the portion of long-term debt associated with the sewerage system is
affected by the devaluation of the Quetual.
20.       Minimum level of cash is about one month of total operating costs
excluding depreciation.
Investments
21.          New investments include expenditures of: (a) US$24.4 million
equivalent on the Bank financed project; (b) Q1.2 million during 1986 for
well repairs; (c) Q27 million for a sewerage project to be executed at the
same time as the Bank project; and (d) an amount equivalent to US$150 (1986
prices) per connection for distribution network expansion.   The Bank-
financed project would be financed by a Bank million loan of US$22.3 and
internally generated funds of EMPAGUA. The well repair project is financed
by a Q1.2 million loan from the Central American Bank which was disbursed
prior to 1986.   The sewerage project is not yet fully prepared.  It is
assumed that 701 of its costs would be financed by another multilateral
development agency, and the remainder by the internal cash generation of
EMPAGUA.   The existing distribution network can absorb new connections
until 1988 when network extension and expansion will be required to permit
more new connections.   Water tariffs will be sufficient (given projected
increases) to finance about half of these new connections. The other half
would be financed by private developers.
22.         Investment transfers include the sewerage system in 1986 and
Stage 1 of the Xaya-Pixcaya Acqueduct in 1990.
Contributions
23.         Contributions include the disbursement by the Government of a
subsidy to -,over outstanding accounts payable for electricity and the
equity contributions associated with the transfer in 1986 by the Municipal-
ity of the sewerage system and the transfer in 1990 by the Central Govern-
ment of the Xaya-Pixcaya Acqueduct.

WATER SUPPLY RERAIILITATION PROJECT
Assumptions for the ERR and AIC Calculation
1.              cwIncremtal consumption was estlmated as the difference between con-
sumption "with the project" and consumption "without the projeet".
2.  Benefits were estimated from tariff revenues and water title sales.
3. Incremental operating costs of the project were conservatively
assused to be zero. The additional operating eosts assoeiated with the
gains in water quantities under the project would be eancelled out by
reductions in operating costs related to the substitutions of gravity
sources made possible by the project for more costly pumped water.
4. Incremental operating costs of major investments starting in 1994 was
estimated at 21 of investent cost.
S. Other investments inelude eomplementary improvents In existitg facil-
ities and well drilling.
6. Investment in future sources ineludes the expansion In the Xaya-Pixscya
project and the proposed Notaguas project.
7. Associate network investment excludes investments in secondary networks
by private developers.
8. Shadow wage rate same as actual cost, since unskllled labor is negli-
gible in the project.
9. Shadow exchange rate assumed at US$1 = Q2.5.
