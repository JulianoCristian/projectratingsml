                  Amendment of Project Agreement
Dear Sir,
      We refer to the Project Agreement, for the above referenced
project, between the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (the Bank) and Municipalidad de Guatemala
(Municipalidad), dated August 26, 1988 (Project Agreement).
      In response to your recent request, I am pleased to advise you
that the Bank agrees to amend the Project Agreement in order to a
allow EMPAGUA to postpone the implementation of procedures to
improve the use, control and maintenance of vehicles used in
EMPAGUA's operations, including the Project.
      Accordingly, the Bank proposes hereby to amend Section 2.07 of
the Project Agreement by the deletion of the date set out therein,
and the substitution, therefore, of the date July 30, 1989.
      If you agree with the proposed amendment, please sign and date
the enclosed duplicate original of this letter in the space below,
and return it to us.  The amendment shall come into effect on the
date of the counter-signature by you.
      On account of their interest on this matter, we are sending a
copy of this letter to the Minister of Finance and the Major.
                          Sincerely yours
