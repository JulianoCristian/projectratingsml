                  Loan 2759-GU
                  Amendment of Project Agreement
Dear Sir,
      We refer to the Project Agreement (Project Agreement) for the
above referenced project between the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Municipalidad de
Guatemala (Municipalidad), dated August 26, 1988.
      In response to your recent request, I am pleased to advise you
that the Bank agrees to amend the Project Agreement in order to
allow EMPAGUA to increase the amount of local competitive bidding
per contract from US$50,000 to US$200,000.
      Accordingly, the Bank proposes hereby to amend paragraph 1 of
Part C of Schedule 1 to the Project Agreement by deletion therefrom
of the amount "$50,000" and the substitution therefor, of the amount
"$200,000".
      If you agree with the proposed amendment, please sign and date
the enclosed duplicate original of this letter in the space below,
and return it to us.  The amendment shall come into effect on the
date on which the Loan Agreement for the above referenced project
and the Project Agreement shall become effective.
      On account of their interest on this matter, we are sending a
copy of this letter to the Minister of Finance and the Mayor.
                         Sincerely yours,
                      /s/ Rainer B. Steckhan
