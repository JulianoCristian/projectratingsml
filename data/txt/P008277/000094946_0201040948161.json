It has increased and stabilized the\n            area receiving irrigation water and had a significant impact\n            on water resources management by establishing Water User\n            Groups and assisting them to assume responsibility for\n            operation and maintenance for the tertiary and on-farm\n            levels of the irrigation system. In the early project\n            implementation period (1995-97), the major\n            \"outside\" factor which affected project\n            implementation was the general underdevelopment of the\n            private construction sector. In the latter years of the\n            project, the main external factor affecting the outcome was\n            the recurrent drought. In broad terms, the main lessons\n            learned during the implementation were: a) Using local\n            prices for project costing when project preparation takes\n            place in a highly inflationary environment should be\n            avoided. b) If clients are to be able to respond efficiently\n            to the evolving conditions, their financial management\n            personnel must have close contact with the design personnel\n            as well as with the procurement group. c) In the\n            institutional area, importance must be given to\n            institutional development as a prerequisite for achieving\n            efficiency and sustainability in the development and\n            management of irrigation and drainage systems."}, "docdt": "2001-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
