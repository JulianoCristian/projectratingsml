Nonetheless, it downgrades\n            sustainability to likely, though upgrades the Bank\n            performance to highly satisfactory. Lessons are addressed as\n            follows. Given that rehabilitation is only a partial\n            solution for most irrigation projects (i.e., symptom of\n            inadequate management and insufficient maintenance funding),\n            this experience clearly demonstrates that rehabilitation\n            should be supplemented by measures to foster creation of\n            efficient institutions, with the ability, inter alia, to\n            measure and manage water, and cost operation and maintenance\n            accurately. Most effective investments leading to higher\n            levels of efficiency in irrigation projects, are the\n            installation of a large number of water, and electricity\n            flow measuring devices, to be agreed - in consultation with\n            stakeholders - on operating rules. It is critical that\n            adequate attention be given during appraisal to investments\n            linking agricultural technology with the measures to improve\n            production, and marketing of outputs, to avoid jeopardizing\n            the ability of project beneficiaries to cover operation, and\n            maintenance costs. Social assessments are needed,\n            particularly given high levels of rural poverty, to help\n            ensure that infrastructure investments take into account the\n            beneficiaries' ownership, and their ability to\n            contribute towards maintenance of new facilities. In the\n            project, such an approach could have created\n            smallholders' cooperatives, or micro-credit groups,\n            that could have moved landowners beyond subsistence agriculture."}, "docdt": "2004-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
