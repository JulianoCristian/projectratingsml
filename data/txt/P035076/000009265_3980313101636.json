electricity at least cost and in an efficient, sustainable\n            manner to stimulate more and inclusive growth in the Zambian\n            economy. The project components include 1) rehabilitating\n            hydropower stations, as well as distribution and\n            transmission systems to improve technical efficiency and the\n            quality and reliability of supply; 2) implementing a\n            rehabilitation and development program for the Gwembe-Tonga,\n            a group unsuccessfully resettled during Kariba Dam\n            construction; 3) improving the efficiency of ZESCO, the\n            national electricity utility, through capacity-building\n            measures and a commercialization plan based on corporate\n            autonomy and management accountability, to enhance the\n            company's resource mobilization and include such\n            actions as separating the accounting for generation,\n            transmission, and distribution; and 4) providing technical\n            assistance to establish an institutional and regulatory\n            framework promoting private participation and implementing\n            Zambia hydropower and transsmission policies."}, "docdt": "1998-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
