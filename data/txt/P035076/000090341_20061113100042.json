    institutional development impact was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from the project:\n            critical policy actions need to be addressed up-front, when\n            including unrelated, but socially desirable components to a\n            project, care must be taken to ensure that the implementing\n            agency has the requisite skills and experience in\n            implementing them. Power rehabilitation projects are much\n            more complex than green field power projects. The elements\n            of power sector reform need to include, as a minimum,\n            commercialization of the power sector institutions, with\n            functionally independent generation, transmission and\n            distributions entities, and with clearly established\n            transfer pricing arrangement among these entities. Community\n            involvement in the design of IDA projects should be\n            encouraged, whenever such project impacts on people and the\n            environment. Governments should not use utilities to provide\n            disguised subsidies to special classes of consumers. The\n            Bank should help borrowers understand the full potential of\n            modern business information systems. Senior managers of\n            utilities need training. Cross conditions of effectiveness\n            with other lenders to the same project should be spelled out\n            in detail and included in the risk analysis of the PAD."}, "docdt": "2006-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
