2.   For the purposes of this Schedule the term "foreign expendi-
tures" means expenditures in the currency of a country other
than the Guarantor and for goods or services supplied from the
territory of any country other than the Guarantor.
3.   The disbursement percentages have been calculated in compli-
ance with the policy of the Bank that no proceeds of the Loan
shall be disbursed on account of payments for taxes levied by,
or in the territory of, the Guarantor on goods or services, or on
the importation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof; to
that end, if the amount of any such taxes levied on or in respect
of any item to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan decreases
or increases, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, increase or
decrease the disbursement percentage then applicable to such item
as required to be consistent with the aforementioned policy of
the Bank.
4.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no with-
drawals shall be made in respect of expenditures prior to the date
of this Agreement except that withdrawals may be made in respect
of Category A(3) on account of expenditures incurred by the City
Assembly or the Sarajevo Gas Borrower after June 1, 1974, for the
preparation of feasibility studies, final designs and tender docu-
ments for Part I of the Project, in an aggregate amount not exceed-
ing the equivalent of $300,000.
5.   Notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Loan or
the disbursement percentages set forth in the table in paragraph
1 above, if the Bank has reasonably estimated that the amount of
the Loan then allocated to any Category will be insufficient to


﻿- 49 -
finance the agreed percentage of all expenditures in that Category,
the Bank may, by notice to the Borrowers: (i) reallocate to such
Category, to the extent required to meet the estimated shortfall,
proceeds of the Loan which are then allocated to another Category
and which in the opinion of the Bank are not needed to meet other
expenditures; and (ii) if such reallocation cannot fully meet the
estimated shortfall, reduce the disbursement percentage then appli-
cable to such expenditures in order that further withdrawals under
such Category may continue until all expenditures thereunder shall
have been made.
6.   If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the procure-
ment of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the procedures
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expenditures for
such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan and
the Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting any other
right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement, by
notice to the Borrowers, cancel such amounr of the Loan as, in
the Bank's reasonable opinion, represents the amount of such ex-
penditures which would otherwise have been eligible for financing
out of the proceeds of the Loan.

SCHEDULE 4
Procurement
A.   General Procedures
1.   Except as provided in Part A.3 hereof, goods, works and ser-
vices shall be procured under contracts to be awarded in accordance
with procedures consistent with those set forth in the "Guidelines
for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published
by the Bank in August 1975, (hereinafter called the Guidelines),
on the basis of international competitive bidding.
2.   (a)  Foreign contractors shall not be required to register
in Yugoslavia as a prerequisite for submitting bids. In the event
that registration shall be necessary after a foreign contractor
has been notified that he will be awarded a contract, the Borrower
shall facilitate the registration.
(b) Contracts for civil works shall include a provision
allowing non-Yugoslav contractors to convert into foreign exchange
and to repatriate a reasonable portion of contract payments, and
to import specialized manpower and equipment as required to carry
out their services,
3.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph A.1 above, civil
works contracts under Part I A(e), (f) and (g) and Part II A (b)
and (c) of the Project estimated to cost less than the equivalent
of $500,000 and contracts for equipment and materials under Part


﻿- 58 -
I A(e), (f) and (g) and Part II A(b) and (c) of the Project estimated
to cost less than the equivalent of $200,000 may be awarded on the
basis of local advertising only and in accordance with the usual
local competitive bidding procedures of the Guarantor.
B.   Evaluation and Comparison of Bids for Goods; Preference for
Domestic Manufacturers
1.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the
supply of goods: (i) bidders shall be required to state in their
bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods, or the
ex-factory price for domestically-manufactured goods; (ii) customs
duties and other import taxes on imported goods, and sales and
similar taxes on domestically-supplied goods, shall be excluded;
and (iii) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight and other
expenditures incidental to the delivery of goods to the place of
their use or installation shall be included.
2.   Goods manufactured in Yugoslavia may be granted a margin of
preference in accordance with, and subject to, the following pro-
visions:
(a) All bidding documents for the procurement of goods shall
clearly indicate any preference which will be granted, the infor-
mation required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such
preference and the following methods and stages that will be fol-
lowed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
(b) After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in
one of the following three groups:


﻿- 59 -
(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in
Yugoslavia if the bidder shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank
that the manufacturing cost of such goods includes
a value added in Yugoslavia equal to at least
20% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods.
(2) Group B: all other bids offering goods manufactured
in Yugoslavia.
(3)  Group C: bids offering any other goods.
(c) All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared
among themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import
taxes on goods to be imported and any sales or similar taxes on
goods to be supplied domestically, to determine the lowest evaluated
bid of each group. Such lowest evaluated bids shall then be com-
pared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a
bid from group A or group B is the lowest, it shall be selected
for the award.
(d) If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (c)
above, the lowest bid is a bid from group C, all group C bids shall
be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group A
after adding to the c.i.f. bid price of the imported goods offered
in each group C bid, for the purpose of this further comparison
only, an amount equal to (i) the amount of customs duties and other
import taxes which a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the
importation of the goods offered in such group C bid, or (ii) 15%


﻿- 60 -
of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods if said customs duties and
taxes exceed 15% of such price. If the group A bid in such further
comparison is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award; if
not, the bid from group C which as a result of the comparison
under paragraph (c) is the lowest evaluated bid shall be selected.
C.   Review of Procurement Decisions by Bank
1.   Review of prequalification. If bidders are to be prequalified,
the Borrower concerned shall, before qualification is invited,
inform the Bank in detail of the procedure to be followed and shall
introduce such modifications in said procedure as the Bank shall
reasonably request. The list of prequalified bidders, together
with a statement of their qualifications and of the reasons for
the exclusion of any applicant for prequalification shall be fur--
nished by such Borrower to the Bank for its comments before the
applicants are notified, and such Borrower shall make such addi-
tions to, deletions from, or modifications in, the said list as
the Bank shall reasonably request.
2.   Review of invitation to bid and of proposed awards and final
contracts.
With respect to all contracts for (i) materials and equipment
estimated to cost the equivalent of $200,000 or more, and (ii) for
civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more:


﻿- 61 -
(a) Before bids are invited, the Borrower concerned shall
furnish to the Bank, for its comments, the text of the invitations
to bid and the specifications and other bidding documents, together
with a description of the advertising procedures to be followed
for the bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said
documents or procedures as the Bank shall reasonably request. Any
further modification to the bidding documents shall require the
Bank's concurrence before it is issued to the prospective bidders.
(b) After bids have been received and evaluated, the Borrower
concerned shall, before a final decision on the award is made,
inform the Bank of the name of the bidder to which it intends
