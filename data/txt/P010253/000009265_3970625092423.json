If proven feasible in the pilot\n            phase, the program will be expanded to cover up to four\n            million acres, and involve 7,500 public tubewells. The\n            project objectives are to develop a replicable package of\n            technical and institutional components for: (i) implementing\n            Government policy of transferring the resposibility for\n            groundwater pumpage in order to meet effectively both\n            irrigation and drainage requirements; (ii) confirming that\n            farmers, particularly smallholders, will be willing and able\n            to participate in the privatization of groundwater\n            development; and (iii) increasing agricultural production\n            and farm incomes through improved use of surface and\n            groundwater supplies, which are used conjunctively by farmers."}, "docdt": "1986-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
