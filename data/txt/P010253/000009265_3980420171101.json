The outcome of the\n            project was satisfactory. It fully achieved its ambitious\n            institutional objectives. Responsibility for\n            groundwater-based irrigation and vertical drainage was\n            successfully transferred to the private sector without the\n            angry demonstrations that had been anticipated. Despite\n            having to absorb irrigation and drainage costs, farmers were\n            able to increase their productivity enough to come out\n            ahead. The sustainability of the project is likely. The main\n            lesson from this pilot project is that Pakistan and the Bank\n            lost an early opportunity to save significant operations and\n            maintenance expenditures because they hung onto the public\n            sector SCARP model for too long. From inception of the idea\n            for a transition project in 1980, it took more than a decade\n            to prove it would work. In preparing the follow-on projects,\n            both the Bank and Borrower are mindful of the lessons of the\n            SCARP Transition Pilot Project. The new project will focus\n            its promotional efforts exclusively on community-owned wells\n            rather than a large number of underutilized individually\n            owned wells because community-owned wells will provide the\n            greatest social benefits."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
