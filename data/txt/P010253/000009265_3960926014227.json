The project achieved most of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            partially successful, sustainability is likely, and both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, in future projects,\n            diesel-operated tubewells should be favored over electrical\n            tubewells because their installation avoids costly\n            distribution systems and connections. Second, large\n            government subsidies are not needed to encourage farmers to\n            install their own diesel-powered tubewells. Third, project\n            supervisory consultants should be appointed at an early\n            stage, preferably before negotiations, in order to avoid\n            inordinate implementation delays. Fourth, increased IDA\n            assistance may be needed for procurement of equipment\n            through ICB procedures. Fifth, the responsibility for\n            reviewing designs of on-farm water management (OFWM) works\n            should be given to the project supervisory consultants in\n            order to ensure design consistency. Finally, more attention\n            should be given to monitoring and evaluation, particularly\n            in this type of pilot project."}, "docdt": "1993-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
