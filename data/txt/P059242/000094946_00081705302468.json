This\n            environmental assessment examines adversity on human health,\n            and the stocks of natural resources resulting from the\n            subprojects' implementation. Environmental screening\n            checklists have been developed as a baseline to mitigate\n            environmental effects, through a three step process:\n            location of the project, classification of subprojects, and\n            environmental analysis, which determines the specific\n            actions to be required. Besides the application of standard\n            environmental regulations, mitigation measures specify that:\n            1) new embankments to control flood, and soil erosion should\n            be in place; 2) construction of new multipurpose village\n            ponds should be avoided, to prevent surface water\n            contamination, as well as any changes in drainage patterns,\n            to control the spread of diseases to the population, or\n            adversity to aquatic habitat; 3) tubewells will be properly\n            cased to avoid groundwater contamination; 4) waste disposal\n            sites will be established, and, 5) compost pits will be\n            constructed to attain sanitation standards, and avoid health risks."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:28:05Z"}
