      poor, and vulnerable groups, particularly women, in meeting\n            their own social, and economic development activities,\n            through the creation of income security opportunities for\n            the rural poor, empowering disadvantaged groups through the\n            promotion of village organizations. The project components\n            follow. 1) Community investments will finance demand-driven\n            sub-projects, proposed by the Common Interest Groups (CIGs),\n            to be approved by the village development committees, and\n            discussed by district sub-committees. Based on social\n            assessments, it is expected that CIG subprojects will fall\n            into three categories: a) skills and organizations, such as\n            micro-enterprises; b) infrastructure, such as roads and\n            housing; and, c) livelihood security, such as\n            micro-irrigation. Village funds, established through\n            community cash contributions would finance operation, and\n            maintenance costs, and, Innovation Funds, would finance\n            demonstration projects, proposed by non-governmental\n            organizations. 2) Institutional, and human capacity building\n            will develop self-reliant, and self managed community based\n            organizations, focused on project administration, human\n            resource development, communications, organization\n            strengthening, and, monitoring and learning."}, "docdt": "2000-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
