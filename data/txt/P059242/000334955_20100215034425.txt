 There are different models of CBP, however due to the very demand driven nature of operations in
 CDD Projects; all of these share certain key characteristics and goals:

 ·    Community members are involved in identifying needs and selecting a sub-project. Control
      over project investment planning becomes increasingly decentralized and rural communities
      gain greater voice in planning, implementation and monitoring activities;
 ·    Community participation is encouraged throughout sub-project identification, preparation,
      implementation, operations and maintenance, and is usually done through an elected community
      project management committee.
 ·    Communities provide contributions in the form of labor, cash and/or materials. Their contributions
      promote community ownership and hopefully eventual sub-project sustainability

  Relationship Based Procurement (RBP) is a recent concept in procurement strategies. In RBP, trust plays the most significant
role between buyers and suppliers as the willingness to rely upon the actions of others, to be dependent upon them, and thus be
vulnerable to their actions and in this manner build collaborative partnerships.

                         Box 2: Relationship Based Procurement
 Relationship Based Procurement (RBP) is a recent concept emerging in procurement strategy. RBP
 partnering and alliancing was propagated in the construction sector to bring about a fundamental
 change in the industry traditionally characterized by disputes, fierce competitiveness and fragmentation.
 W. Derek and H. Keith in their book `Procurement Strategies: A Relationship-based Approach' argue
 that through a RBP approach, risk and crisis can be better managed and resolved especially in the
 construction industry. The key to successful implementation of RBP strategies lies in trust. In a paper
 titled `Building on trust: a co-operative approach to construction procurement' (2001) G. Wood, and P.
 McDermott defined trust as the willingness to rely upon the actions of others, to be dependent upon
 them, and thus be vulnerable to their actions and in this
 manner build collaborative partnerships.

 RBP can help move the buyers from a bottleneck
 situation to a strategic situation by using relationships
 to leverage the importance of the buyer in the limited                                              Competition/
                                                                                        Routine

 RBP, the supplier also benefits from repeat orders
 from the common goods and services created, which                                   Importance of the Buyer
 reinforces maintaining the relationship with the buyer
 on a mutually beneficial long term perspective.
 RBP as a method is more than Direct Contracting or Single Source Procurement, as the initial
 identification happens through a transparent market search among all available suppliers and as it
 includes vendor retention. Environmental factors like mutual dependence, trust and dependence,
 sharing of product and market information, and early involvement of suppliers determine the
 success of RBP on a longer term. An appropriate monitoring mechanism and social audit process
 in place could ensure that favoritism and complacency do not set in and value for money (VfM) is
 achieved in every transaction.

            a government stamp attestation.

5.0   Complaint Redressal System
      5.1   No framework or system for complaint redressal.
      5.2   Need expressed for a method. Or the current complaint redressal system is
