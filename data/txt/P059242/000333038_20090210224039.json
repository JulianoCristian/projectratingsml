were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: instead of operating stand-alone projects,\n            it is better to make them as part and parcel of mainstream\n            schemes so that the government can avail of all available\n            resources. The role of private sector in playing an active\n            role as a partner in Bank projects on livelihood and poverty\n            alleviation needs to be looked into for future projects. All\n            manual and guidelines should be prepared at the beginning of\n            the project itself and not after the project has started.\n            Capacity building should be given very high priority.\n            Implementation of sub projects should start only after\n            sufficient capacity building is achieved. Any attempt to\n            fast track without proper foundation can result in\n            manipulation and diluting project objectives. Enhancing the\n            capacity and skills of project coordinators to manage\n            projects through relevant training and exchange programs is\n            important for effective project implementation. It will be\n            important to provide them opportunities for platform for\n            sharing and cross-learning from the experience of other\n            projects in the country."}, "docdt": "2008-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
