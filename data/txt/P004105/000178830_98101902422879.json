It is expected that\n            about 160 high priority investment projects will be financed\n            under the credit component. The technical assistance\n            component is designed to support the process of financial\n            sector reform through overseas staff training and to help\n            improve the tax and credit information system."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
