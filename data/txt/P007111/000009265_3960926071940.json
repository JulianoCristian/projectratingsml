Ecuador's\n            recent earthquake, the primary objective of the proposed\n            project is to urgently restore oil production and export\n            flows. In addition, the project plans to help (i) minimize\n            the environmental impact of the disaster and related\n            reconstruction programs; (ii) enhance the National Oil\n            Company's (CEPE) capacity to deal with the crisis and\n            its aftermath; and (iii) enhance the Government's\n            preparedness to deal with future national emergencies.  To\n            this end, the proposed project consists of:  (i) equipment\n            and civil works related to the reconstruction of the\n            Trans-Ecuadorian crude oil and liquid petroleum gas (LPG)\n            pipelines; (ii) well-workovers and\n            rehabilitation/maintenance works required to avoid long-term\n            damage to the oil fields due to the interruption of\n            production and (iii) oil field development to boost oil\n            extraction to a level of about 320,000 B/D by the end-1987\n            in order to recoup lost production.  Finally, the project\n            entails (iv) technical assistance, including engineering,\n            management and inspection services, and consultants to\n            prepare a plan for the management of future national emergencies."}, "docdt": "1987-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
