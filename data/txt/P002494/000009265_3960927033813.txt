MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO SOMALIA
FOR A CENTRAL RANGELANDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE It
1.        The following report on a proposed credit to Somalia for SDR 14.7
million (US$19.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.   The credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years repayment. It would help
finance a Central Rangelands Research and Development Project - Phase II.
The project would be cofinanced with the African Development Fund (ADP),
which would provide a loan of FUA 8.6 million (USS 11.0 million equivalent),
and Government which would contribute US$ 3.3 million equivalent.
2.        Background.  Livestock products account for 35 percent of GDP and
80 percent of exports in Somalia. About 70 percent of the country -- 51
million hectares of land -- is given over to pastoralist, nomadic livestock
grazing. This is the traditional occupation of half of the Somali
population, and the dominant activity in the sector and the economy. The
national herd is estimated to include 16 million goats, 12 million sheep, 6
million camels and 4 million cattle. Exports of 1 to 1.5 million animals a
year are dominated by goats and sheep. Livestock exports were US$62 million
in 1986. In recent years exports have been mainly to the Saudi Arabian
market. The country is too dependant on the Saudi market. The Government
is seeking to increase exports and eiversify into new markets and products,
with assistance from USAID's Livestock Marketing Project. The Government
will also maintain and increase livestock production through improved range
mnagement and anim.l health services with the support of this project.
3.        The Central Rangelands occupy 149,000 km northeast of the Shebelli
River, between the coast and the Ethiopian border. Rainfall of 150-300 mm
sustains dense woodland in the southwest and low herb/grasslands in the
north and east. Some 800,000 people live there, with 11 million head of
livestock -- over AS percent sheep and goats, and the remainder camels and
cattle. The region provides about 401 of goat exports, and 20-252 of
exports of other animals. Vithin the Central Rangelands, total forage
production appears to be in reasonable balance with livestock feed
requirements in the average year. Rangeland condition is fair, although a
downward trend has been noted in specific high-use areas. Also, enclosure
and cultivation in the areas where rainfall and soils permit is increasing.
4.        A credit of US$8 million to support a US$46.3 million first-phase
project for the Central Rangelands was approved by IDA in 1979 (Credit 906-
SO). Cofinanciers included IFAD (US$9 million), USAID (US$15 million), WP
and GTZ. The project was designed to consolidate and improve range and
livestock production, increase pastoralist income, and foster gradual
concentration of pastoral communities. The project got off to a slow start.
Activities funded by the different financiers started at different times,
and delays caused inefficiency and frustration. GTZ replaced ODA in funding
the animal health component. Severe shortages of fuel and local funding
reduced the effectiveness of staff and scaled down accomplishments in the
field. The original design was overly optimistic in what would be
accomplished and in estimating the returns from range and water management.



However, the project has been successful on several counts. It has helped
to establish an organization capable of gathering and analyzing range and
livestock related information, and to identify and Intervene successfully in
areas of key interest to pastoralistso animal health services, water point
construction, and sand dune stabilization. Community level organizations
have been put in place, and management techniques that will help to sustain
rangeland productivity have been tested. Adjustments to the Institutional
aspects of the original project were consolidated at the multi-donor Mid
Term Review of March 1984. At this review, the project entity was given
increaaed autonomy from the National Range Agency (NRA), and supervision of
field activities strengthened. Phase II will take advantage of the
institutional base to further the investigative work and to put in place and
disseminate worthwhile interventions developed during Phase I.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement:  The Central Rangelands are vital
to the maintenance and increase of livestock exports which form the backbone
of the Somali economy. Important advances in understanding range use and in
maintaining and increasing productivity have been made in the first phase of
the project. A second phase is considered justified because of: (i) the
importance of rangelands for the economy; (ii) the need to minimize the
negative e&fects ef increased population pressure and cultivation; (iii) the
need to take advantage of productivity increasing techniques; and (iv) the
opportunity to use an increasingly effective range agency. This project
will serve an important testing and pilot function. Findings in this
project are potentially applicable in much of Somalia. IDA's involvement in
this project, in collaboration with ADF, GTZ and other donors, provides the
opportunity to bring together a successful effort in rangeland development.
6.        Proiect Obiectivess  The second phase of the project is designed
to maintain and improve the long term productivity of the Central Rangelands
and the living standards of pastoralists. This objective will be pursued by
minimizing the degradation of vegetation, improving on the understanding of
rangeland production systems, and increasing the productive efficiency of
livestock in the region.
7.        Proiect Description: Constraints encountered in tradit£onal
pastoral production systems will be addressed through research efforts and
specific interventions. The research will focus on improving the efficiency
and sustainabllity of livestock and crop production in the region.
Interventions will include setting up infrastructure and disseminating
tecbniques that contribute to production maintenance.
8.         The total cost of the six-year project is estimated to be US$
33.3 million. The project includes the following components (costs include
contingencies): (i) Systems Investigation and Monitoring (US$ 4.3 million)
to study production systems, formulate range management plans, and monitor
agroecological indicators; (ii) Extension (US$ 4.a million) to disseminate
improved technology, organize Range and Livestock Associations to manage
project infrastructure, and support village development initiatives, with
more attention to be given to women's role in production through the hiring
of additional female extension agents; (iii) Agropastoral Adaptive Trials
and Forestry (USS 2.4 million) to test improved agricultural practices,



-3-
produce improved seed, and expand forestry activities in the regiont (iv)
Animal Health and Livestock Production (US$ 2.7 million) to expand the
program of village-level livestack examination and treatment; (v) Water and
Infrastructure Development (US$ 4.3 million) to construct a..d provide
initial maintenance for boreholes, dugouts, and wells and to improve roads
and airstrips; (vi) Conservation (USS 3.1 million) to protect key flora and
fauna in the project area and the Northern Rangelands; (v) Training (USS
3.0) to provide continued support to the University and short-term and
medium-term training opportunities overseas, and (vi) Project Management
(USS 8.7 million) to manage project and NRA activities in the region.
9.        Issues and Actions:  To overcome the problems faLed during the
first phase, the Association has obtained Government agreement to (i) donor
financing of the direct import of fuel for project use; (ii) donor
contributions to local salary supplements, and the adjustment of local
salaries and allowances to maintain purchasing power; and (iii) tightened
control of vehicle use and maintenance.   The experience gained in
coordinating contributions from different donors during the first phase will
serve to streamline implementation. The second phase project will address
environmental concerns on rangeland use, including the implications of the
increase in private enclosure, charcoal production, and cultivation of
hitherto commonly-owned rangeland through research and trial programs. A
conservation compoLi-nt will focus on preserving endangered flora and fauna.
10.       Benefitss  The project will reduce degradation of the rangelands.
the most important of Somalia's productive resources. The project will
support associations of pastoralists and assist them to maintain and
increase livestock and range productivity: Small increases in livestock and
crop production are expected in the areas of relatively higher potential in
the southeast, and from animal health activities. Factors that might
undermine the livestock production potential of the country would be
identified and dealt with.
11.       Risks:  Continued shortages of fuel and inadequate local salaries
could reduce the effectiveness of implementation. Also, pastoralists may be
slow to adopt different approaches to range use. The project is designed to
minimize these risks.
12.       Recommendations: I am satisfied that the proposed credit complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
