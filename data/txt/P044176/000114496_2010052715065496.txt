(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Recipient shall furnish

Account, once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Grant, minus the total amount of all 
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of 
the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Grant Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Grant shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify 
by notice to the Recipient. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to 
the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on 
deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in 
making payments for Eligible Expenditures.

indicated by said Project Management Report to be remaining in the Special Account, 
shall not exceed the equivalent of $1,000,000.
