Lessons\n            learned from the project are as follows: Early involvement\n            of key stakeholders in project preparation, specifically\n            including local communities and influential decision makers,\n            is essential in order to ensure ownership and successful\n            project implementation. In order to achieve environmental,\n            social, institutional and financial sustainability,\n            conservation strategies, as well as applied research and\n            monitoring programs, must be site-specific and targeted to\n            provide direct support for effective conservation\n            management, addressing local issues and needs. Where\n            consumptive use of natural resources is an issue (e.g.,\n            logging, grazing, hunting, fishing, etc.), resource users\n            must be substantively involved in the design of sustainable\n            resource management systems, and effective monitoring and\n            control mechanisms need to be developed and applied. Small\n            grants programs targeted at local communities within and\n            near Protected Areas can be a very effective tool for\n            leveraging community efforts in the direction of\n            nondestructive livelihoods and building local capacity to\n            attract additional funds from various national and\n            international sources in support of these activities.\n            Existence of a well developed and stable anchor organization\n            is a key prerequisite for successful replication and\n            up-scaling of project results. Where such strong management\n            organizations exist, their technical capacity should be\n            carefully preserved and fully utilized. A critical enabling\n            factor for strong performance of project teams is the\n            ability of site managers to create and maintain strong\n            teams, based on a transparent and highly competitive staff\n            selection process. Using a PIU for project coordination can\n            be a strong project asset if run as a business, if the PIU\n            is lean and focused on a few management tasks, with\n            day-to-day decisions done without unnecessary bureaucratic\n            red tape."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
