The project contains four\n            components: 1) The component will strengthen the National\n            Framework for Biodiversity Conservation by participatory\n            review and revision of the legal and regulatory framework\n            for protected area management. 2) The component will develop\n            models for protected areas and forest park management\n            through establishing systems for planning and management of\n            biodiversity at the three demonstration sites. 3) The\n            component will build public support for biodiversity\n            conservation through preparation and implementation of both\n            national park level strategies and targeted action plans for\n            raising the awareness of specific stakeholder groups and the\n            general public about the importance of biodiversity\n            conservation. 4) Project management and monitoring will\n            establish a project coordination team at the national level\n            to oversee and support implementation of all project\n            activities in accordance with agreed monitable indicators."}, "docdt": "1999-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
