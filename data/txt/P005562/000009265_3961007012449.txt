MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Note on Syrian Arab Republic -
National Agricultural Extension Project (Loan 2621-SYR)
Attached is the Project Completion Note on Syrian Arab Republic National
Agricultural Extension Project (Loan 2621-SYR) prepared by the Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office.
The Loan of US$ 7.5 million, approved in 1985, was not made effective and was
canceled in November 1986 at the request of the Government.
The Note explains how the Higher Council in the Syrian Government considered
the use of most of the Loan funds for purchase of transport and equipment for an expanded
extension staff would be inappropriate  at the time.  Economic and fiscal difficulties
demanded a less ambitious program.
The Note is satisfactory. The Project is not rated and will not be audited.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
NATIONAL AGRICULTURALEXTENSION PROJECT
(Lm. 2621-SYR)
1.    This project was to be financed jointly by IFAD, with the Bank as the executing agency for
the entire project. The IFAD portion (US$ 7.5 million) was ratified by the Government early in
1986. That fulfilled the only specific condition for effectiveness of the Bank Loan (US$ 7.5 million).
Ratification of the Bank Loan, which was sought separately, was postponed a number of times and
finally rejected by the Higher Council.
2.    The Bank and IFAD staff explained that the Bank and IFAD loans were to co-finance the
project on a 50-50 basis and that the IFAD Loan covenant did not stand on its own as there were
cross effectiveness covenants. However, in November 1986, the Government requested Loan
cancellation. The Deputy Minister for Planning Affairs of the State Planning Commission and an
Advisor of the Ministry of Planning had participated in negotiations and the negotiated documents
were signed by the Ministry of State for Planning Affairs. Economic and fiscal conditions
deteriorated in late 1985 and 1986 which led not only to the postponement of loan effectiveness and
its eventual cancellation, but also to a suspension of all disbursements by the Bank to Syria in June
1986 due to growing arrears on loan repayments.
3.    Although no official reasons were given at the time of cancellation, in September 1986 Syrian
officials reported that the principal reason for the delay in obtaining their Government's ratification
of the Bank Loan was concern over the number of vehicles proposed for the project which was
considered by Syrian Government to be excessive (47 percent of project costs and 88 percent of the
Bank Loan were for vehicles and equipment); this issue had not been raised during negotiations.
They also stated that the Government continued to recognize the importance of restructuring and
strengthening the extension services and gave high priority to a project in this subsector. They
claimed, however, that economic and fiscal difficulties warranted a reduced project.
