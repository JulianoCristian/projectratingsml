The Syrian Government\n            ratified the IFAD portion in early 1986, but ultimately\n            rejected ratification of the Bank portion. Although no\n            official reasons were given for the cancellation of this\n            project, Syrian officials reported that the principal reason\n            was concern over the number of vehicles proposed for the\n            project. The Syrian Government considered the number of\n            vehicles to be excessive, although this issue had not been\n            raised during negotiations. While the Government continued\n            to recognize the importance of strengthening the extension\n            services in the agriculture sector, they claimed that\n            economic and fiscal difficulties warranted a reduced\n            project. Indeed, economic and fiscal conditions in Syria\n            deteriorated in late 1985 and 1986. This led not only to the\n            postponement and eventual cancellation of this project, but\n            also to a suspension of all disbursements of the Bank to\n            Syria in June 1986 due to growing arrears on loan\n            repayments. The project is not rated and will not be audited."}, "docdt": "1994-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
