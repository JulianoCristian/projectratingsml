  About this Report
      The Independent EvaluationGroupassesses the programsandactivitiesoftheWorld Bankfor two purposes:first, to
  ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessandto verifythat the Bank'swork is producingthe expected
  results,andsecond, to helpdevelopimproveddirections, policies, and proceduresthroughthedisseminationof lessons
 drawnfrom experience. As partof thiswork, IEGWBannuallyassessesabout 25 percentof the Bank's lendingoperations
 throughfieldwork. Inselectingoperations for assessment,preferenceisgivento thosethat areinnovative,large,or
 complex;thosethat arerelevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations;thosefor whichExecutiveDirectorsor Bank
 managementhaverequestedassessments;andthosethat arelikelyto generateimportantlessons.
      To preparea ProjectPerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examine projectfiles and other            '

 documents, interviewoperationalstaff, visitthe borrowingcountryto discussthe operationwith the government,and
 other in-countrystakeholders,and interviewBank staffand other donoragencystaff bothat headquartersand inlocal
 offices as appropriate.
      EachPPAR issubjectto internalIEGWBpeer review, Panelreview,and managementapproval.Once cleared
 internally,the PPAR is commentedon bythe responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe commentsas
 relevant.The completedPPAR isthensent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' commentsareattachedto the
 documentthat is sent to the Bank'sBoardof ExecutiveDirectors.After anassessmentreport has beensent to the
 Board, it isdisclosedtothe public.

 About the IEGWBRatingSystem
      IEGWB's useof multipleevaluationmethods offers both rigor anda necessary levelof flexibility to adaptto lending
 instrument, project design,or sectoralapproach.IEGWBevaluatorsall applythe same basic methodto arrive at their
 project ratings.Followingis the definitionand ratingscale usedfor eachevaluationcriterion(additional information is
 availableonthe IEGWBwebsite: httD://worldbank.om/ieq).
      Outcome: The extenttowhichthe operation's major relevantobjectiveswere achieved,or are expectedto be
 achieved,efficiently.The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevanceincludes relevance
 of objectives and relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives is the extenttowhich the project's objectives are
 consistentwith the country's currentdevelopmentprioritiesand with current Bank countryand sectoralassistance
 strategiesand corporategoals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers,Country AssistanceStrategies,             .
 Sector Strategy Papers,OperationalPolicies). Relevanceof design is the extent to which the project's designis
 consistentwith the statedobjectives.Efricacyis the extent to whichthe project'sobjectives were achieved,or are
 expectedto beachieved,taking intoaccounttheir relativeimportance.Efficiencyisthe extent to which the project
 achieved, or isexpectedto achieve,a returnhigherthan the opportunity cost of capital and benefitsat least cost
 comparedto alternatives.The efficiency dimensiongenerally is notapplied to adjustmentoperations. Possibleratings
 for Outcome: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,
 Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Riskto DevelopmentOutcome: The risk,at the timeof evaluation,that developmentoutcomes (or expected
 outcomes)will not be maintained(or beaked). Possibleratingsfor Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: HighSignificant,
 Moderate,Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.

Preface

This is an EnhancedProject PerformanceAssessmentReport (PPAR) for the Malawi
EmergencyDrought RecoveryProject (Credit No. 3715-MAI, GrantNo. H011MAT).
Besidesnatural disasters suchas droughts andfloods, there are core sectoralissues that
explain food crises inMalawi. To highlightthese factors, the Assessmentprovides areview
ofthe agricultural sector issues andstrategy, andthe Bank's assistanceto the sector.
The Projectwas approvedonNovember 5,2002, andbecameeffective on January 13,2003.
A combined credit ofSDR 22 million($29 million) and agrant ofSDR 15.9 million($21
million) was approvedto support Malawi's effort to overcome the effects ofthe 2001/2002
natural disaster causedby floods and drought. The credit andgrant were closed on schedule
onNovember 30,2004, with a cumulative disbursement o fUS$53.7 millionandatotal
project cost o f $55.2 million.
The PPARfindings arebasedon anIEGmissionthat visited Malawi inNovember 2006.
Additional informationcame fkom an in-depthreview o fMalawi's agriculture sector to
discern the structural causes of food crisis beyond the recurrent natural crises; project files,
including the Implementation CompletionReport (ICR); reviewof sector studies; the recent
IEGCountryAssistance Evaluation, Quality AssuranceGroup's Country Program
Assessment, andIEG'sevaluation ofBankassistancefor natural disasters. Interviews were
also heldwith officials ofthe Government ofMalawi including representativesofthe
MinistryofAgriculture andFoodSecurity (formerly theMinistryofAgriculture and
Irrigation, the ImplementingAgency) andotherproject implementing andrelevant agencies;
Malawi's developmentpartners, including the UN,multilateral andbilateral donors, and
NGOs; andthe Bank's Regional Staff. The PPARMissionvisited the SouthernRegion and
met with local government officials andcommunity representativeswho participated inthe
project.

Inaccordancewith standardIEGprocedures, acopy of the draft PPARwas sentto the
Borrower for review and commentsbefore it was finalized. The Borrower's comments are
attachedas Annex F.

Summary
InJuly2002, theGovernmentofMalawiapproachedIDAforanemergencyassistanceto
assist indrought recovery andimprove its emergencyresponsemanagement. The Bank
respondedquickly andpositively with a $50 million equivalent credit andgrant.

InMalawi, episodesoffoodcrisisarerecurrentandareattributedtolongstandingpolicyand
institutional failures exacerbatedby fiequent disastersincludingfloods anddroughts.
Malawihas experiencedsix natural disasters since 1991/92. The EDRPwas the thirdIDA-
assistedemergency operation inMalawi.

Mismanagementofthe strategic food reserve, disagreementwith donors on the available
domestic food supply, highmaize prices, risingchronic food insecurity exacerbatedby HIV
andAIDS, andpoor economic management, coupledwith floods in2001 followed by
drought in2002 triggeredthe 2001/02 food crisis.

The Project was primarilydesignedto provide a quick disbursingbalance o fpayments
support to finance highpriority agricultural inputsandequipment. The Project also included
a conditional cashtransfer schemeto generate income to drought affected populations while
creating andrehabilitating community assets andtechnical assistanceto improve the
Government's drought mitigationandemergencyresponse.

The project was successfully implemented, andthe crediugrant was fully disbursedinless
thantwo years andclosedonschedule. Theprivatesectorparticipationinthe quick
disbursing componentwas substantial. Nearly allthe imports financed underthe project
were suppliedby the private sector andmarketedthrough private sector outlets. Despite
initialdelays, the conditional cashtransfer for public works andthe in-kindinput (fertilizer
andseeds) remunerationfor assets, boostedincomes of, andprovided criticalinputsto, fann
households. The various studies, pilot projects andtraining programs contributed to
Malawi's ongoing effort to address chronic food insecurity.

IEGratestheproject's overall outcome as satisfactory. Theproject objectives anddesign
aimed at addressingthe immediate effects o fthe drought andthe measuresto respondto
long-term sectoralissues are relevant to the Bank's assistanceandGovernment's
developmentstrategies. The Project has also achievedthe stateddevelopment objectives with
efficiency. While the Bank's andBorrower's performance onquality at entry andpreparation
were satisfactory, their overall performance i s ratedmoderatelysatisfactory due to weak      '

supervision, reporting andmonitoring andevaluation onproject implementation andon
achievemento fdevelopment objectives. The Borrower's delayeddeclaration o fthe food
crisis exacerbatedthe crisis andthe loss of lives.

The Risks to Development Outcomes are significant. The ratingreflects Malawi's and the
projectbeneficiaryhouseholds' continued vulnerability to future drought episodes and
resultingfood crisis. There are encouraging signs ofa shift towards somewhatreducedrisk
withrespectto the way the Government responds. The Government's plannedAgricultural
Policy Framework andpilot risk management schemes are aimed at mapping a long-term

                                                X



strategyfor agriculture whichwill mitigate natural disaster shocks. These actions will take
time to materialize andsignificantly avert drought related risks.

Malawihas a functioning Vulnerability Assessment Committee that monitors incidence o f
householdfood insecurity as abasis for public assistance andhas established avaluable data
base for emergencyoperations. The project didnot establish a stand-alone Monitoring and
EvaluationSystem except for the progressreportingfrom eachimplementing agency. While
the Committee's databasewas usefbl inmonitoring food security indicators it lacked an
evaluationmechanism. IEGratesthe M&E System as modest.

Severalvaluable lessons, relevant to boththe Borrower andthe Bank emerge fkomthe design
andimplementation o ftheEDRP.

       Indisasterpronecountries,regularmonitoringandreportingof rainfallpatterns, food
       balances (domestic consumption, production, imports includinginformalcross border
       trade), andcrop prices is critical for timely mitigationandemergency response
       measures.

       Bankassistanceshouldpayparticular attentionto food security issuesincountries
       with chronic food insecurity andvulnerable to natural disasters. The Bank should also
        acknowledge inits Country Assistance Strategythat natural disasters inMalawi are
       recurrent risks to macro-economic stability andoverall development.
       Notwithstanding the importance of favorable rainfalldistribution duringthe crop
        growing season, sectoralandpolicyissues are also determinants o f agricultural
       production. This i s anurgentreminder for the needto address Malawi's core
        agricultural and food security issues.

       Reducing food insecurity requiresinteralia broad-basedsources o f livelihood
        including non-farm incomes.

        Effective managementof a strategic grain reserverequires the management o fboth
        in-kindandcashresources. SinceMalawiis landlockedwithweak logistical capacity,
        aminimumin-kindreservecoupled with disposable cashreserve equally accessible to
       private sector importers is imperative to respondto future emergencies.

        To addressfood insecurity aregional approachwhich promotesregionaltrade i s
       needed. Malawi should continue to actively participate inthe Southern Africa
       Development Cooperation (SADC) andthe New Partnership for Africa's
       Development (NEPAD) whichpromote regional trade. Facilitating regional trade,
       including the growing informal crossborder trade, is criticalto food security.

 1. IntroductionandSectoralBackground
 1.1     Malawi is a small, landlocked Sub-SaharanAfiican country covering about 118,000
 square kilometers with a population ofabout 12.6 million. Since independencein 1964,
population growth ratehasaveraged 3 percent per annumbut hasrecently droppedto about 2
percent due to the impact o fthe HIVAND AIDS pandemic andfamily planningprograms.
HIVAND AIDS hasclaimedthe livesofabout5 percentofthetotal labor force andlife
 expectancyhas declined from 51to 40 years. Malawi is one o fthe most denselypopulated
countries insub-SaharanAfrica with about 115people per square kilometer. O fthe total
area, 20 percent is coveredbywater and45 percent is consideredsuitable for cultivation.
Dueto highpopulationpressure on land, about 70 percent o fthe smallholder farmers, the

The Agriculture Sector
1.5     Agriculture isthe mainstayo fthe Malawianeconomy. The sector contributes about
39 percentofthe gross domesticproduct (GDP) and 87 percent ofthe total employment,
supplies morethan 65 percent ofthe manufacturing sector's raw materials, provides 64
percent o fthe total income ofthe ruralpeople, and contributes more than 90 percent o fthe
foreign exchange earnings. Ruralpeople account for more than85 percent o fthe population.
The majority o fthe ruralhouseholds are smallholder farmers who are mostlyreliant on a
single harvesto fmaize for consumption. There is chronic lack of access to seed, particularly
improvedvarieties, andfertilizer. Other food crops are also grown inlesser quantities,
includingcassava, rice, sweetpotato, millet sorghum, andIrishpotato. Foodsecurity in
Malawii s definedwith referenceto maize, which occupies about 70percent o fcultivable
landinanygrowing season. Tobaccois Malawi's largestexport cashcrop, accounting for 51
percent of export earnings, followed by tea and sugar. Tobacco production has declined in
recent years due to weather failures, and auction prices' have fallen, both o fwhich have
affected economic growth andsmallholder farmers' disposableincome.

Performanceof the Economyandthe Agriculture Sector
1.6     Duringthe past 10years, economic growth ingeneral and agricultural growth in
particular hasbeen elusive. Malawi's realGDP growth during 1995-2005 (Figure 1) has
been on a declining trend. Since 1998the growthrate i s far belowthe six percent per annum
growththreshold to reducepoverty significantly, with real GDP growth falling to less than 2
percent between2000 and2002.

 favorable weather conditions, resulted inagricultural GDP growth of 40 percent and 26
percent in 1995 and 1996respectively. Table 2 presents selected agricultural sector related

(MalawiVulnerabilityAssessment Committeereportand WFP, 2006)

 1.8     Since 2001, the impact o f erratic weather patterns has beencompounded by high
inflation andinterest rates, makingcredit inaccessible to the poor, andit also caused
uncertainty among businesses leadingto low real GDP growth. Inaddition, a poor tobacco
harvest (either inquality or quantity o f output) with depressedmarket prices created
downwardpressure on the MalawiKwacha. Tobacco harvest declined from 101.75 million
kilograms in2005 to 22.25 millionkilograms in2006. The value also dropped fiom $233
millionto $50.71 millionin2006.

1.9      Over the past 10-15 years, Malawi has shiftedfrom being a self-sufficient producer
o f maize innon-disaster years to beinga regular net importer dependent on foreign assistance
to achieve a national foodbalance. The Government has introducedvarious initiativesto
boost agricultural production and alleviate poverty. These includemarket liberalization
(1994), and agriculturalproductionsupport programs such as the Universal Starter Pack
(USP- 1998), andthe Targeted InputProgram (TIP-2002), which was replacedbyUniversal
InputSubsidy Program(UISP-2005). An Agricultural Productivity InvestmentProgram
(APIP) was also launched in 1996with EU-assistance to increase agricultural productivity
among smallholder farmers throughthe provision o f credit facilities. The programwas
closed in2005 with limitedresults and a highdefault rate. Despitethese and other
initiatives, agriculturalproductivity remains low, poverty remains pervasive and food
insecurityhas escalated since the food crisis in2001. Since 1998/99, hybridmaize
production, promoted under the input subsidy programs, has exhibited a decliningtrend
(Figure 2).

1.10    Despitethe resumption ofthe universal input subsidy, low rainfall levels inthe
2004/05 growing seasonreducedthe harvestby about 50 percent from the previous season.
Theproduction shortfall resulted in60 percent of farm families relyingon food aid and
subsidizedfood distribution. According to the Famine EarlyWarning SystemNetwork
(FEWSNET), Malawi's food deficit was estimated at about 390,000 metric tons inthe
consumptiodmarketing seasonfrom April 1,2005 to March 31,2006. The total net informal
cross-borderimports duringthis periodcontributed significantly to Malawi's food security.
However, due to uneven food distribution inthe country, householdfood insecurity existed
inmanypartsofthec0unt1-y.~Annex Epresents Malawi's.evolvingAgricultural Sector
Strategyanda review ofBank assistanceto the sector.

The 2001/02 Food Crisis

1.11 TheUNclassifies Malawi as bothaleast-developed and low-income food deficit
country with highrates o fpoverty andhousehold food insecurity. Inaddition, the rapidly
growing HlVAND AIDS pandemic has affected the availability of active farm labor andhas
exacerbatedhouseholdfood insecurity. Malawi is vulnerable to recurrent natural disasters.
Since 1997/98,the two severe food crisis seasons havebeen2001/02 and2004/2005 (Figure
3). According to anAction Aidreport: lack o f informationcontributed to the famine inthe
2001/2002 crisis inseveral ways. Crucial informationsuch as food availability-
domestically produced, and imported formally and informally, was either "plain wrong,"
concealed, ignored, or misused.These informationconstraints delayedbothcommercial and
public distribution responsesto the food shortage, and contributed to the process that saw the
food shortage deteriorate into a famine, inwhich an estimated 500 people diedofhunger and
hunger-relateddiseases.

1.12    Itwas only after civil society andthe mediadisseminatedinformation about the
severity ofthe crisis that the government acknowledged the problem and appealedfor
assistance, and stakeholderswere promptedinto action. OnFebruary 27,2002, the President
ofMalawideclareda "State o f Disaster," and appealedfor international assistanceto respond
to the crisis, stating "Malawi i s facing a catastrophic situation with upto 78 percent o f farm
families (2.2 millionpeople) beingwithout food." Malawi's vulnerability to food crisis i s
attributed to policy andinstitutional as well as weather failures.

StrategicGrain ReserveMismanagement-A Case of Policy andInstitutionalFailure

1.13    Prior to 1999, the AgriculturalDevelopment andMarketingCorporation (ADMARC)
was mandatedto managedomestic price support and the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR). In
1999, the government agreedunder the World Bank-assistedFiscalRestructuringand
DeregulationProgram and an IMFProgram to establishthe National Food ReserveAgency
(NFRA) as anindependent, autonomous agency for disasterreliefandto prepare ADMARC
to phaseout its price support program andto operate on commercial basis. Such an
arrangementwas also intendedto encouragethe participation ofthe private sector ingrain
trading and storage.

1.14    In2000, Malawihadanexceptionalmaizeharvestdueto theUniversal StarterPack
(USP) program and good rainfall. With the implementationofthe USP, total maize
productionincreasedfrom about 1.6 millionmetric tons in1998to 2.5 millionmetric tons in
1999 and2000. InAugust 2000 the NFRAhad 175,000 metric tons inADMARC-owned
storage facilities5 ByAugust 2001 the officialmaize reserveat NFRAwas emptied partlyas
aresult of anapparent lack o f clarity o fresponsibilities between ADMARC'Srolein
domestic grain marketingandNFRA's responsibility for managingbuffer stocks for relief.

Intheabsenceofaclear agreementbetweenADMARC andNFRA,bothwere selling SGR
maize, creating marketdistortions.6

1.15    The decision to sell the SGR maize followed an EU-supported study that had
recommendedthe SGRbe limitedto between 30-60,000 tons. Instead, almost all o fthe
reservewas sold, mucho fit to the local markets. Ithas also been alleged that the SGR-maize
was soldto localtraders, who stockpiled it andmadewindfall profits (Devereux 2002). A
subsequent attempt bythe government to cover the resulting food gap through imports
proved extremely costly. Beinga landlocked country, a series o ftransport and logistical
problemscaused fatal delays andanescalationofmaizeprices.

1.16    SGR grainlosses instoragewere also high.Audits ofNFRAfinancial accountssince
2001 indicate a loss instoragethat ranges from 3 percent of stock value in2001 to 42 percent
in2003, andlossesremainedas highas24percentin2004. These figures, especially from
2002-04, are significant given the averagereserveo f 60,000 metric tons per year. These large
lossesinstorage were a direct consequenceo fmismanagementbythe organization.

Disagreementbetweenthe governmentanditsdevelopmentpartners

1.17    In2002, government anddonorrelations were at their lowest point. Donorbalanceof
paymentssupport was suspendedwhen the government exceeded its agreed spendinglimits,
and following allegations o fcorruption andoverall weak g~vernance.~              When the government
declaredthe crisis andrequestedfood aid, the development partners disagreedwith the
assessment, and arguedthat the maize gap wouldbe coveredbylocalmaize strategic
reserves, roots andtubers, as well as formal and informalmaize imports. But according to the
MinistryofAgriculture, the evidencesuggestedthat the reported growth inproduction of
root cropswas not reliable. An expansioninproduction ofalternative crops could not
compensatefor a national shortfall inmaizeproduction. This i s becausealternative food
crops-cassava, sweetpotatoes, andrice-are not available inmost ruralhouseholdsduring
February (the hungriestmonth-when             farm householdshave depleted their previous year's
production). Their harvest comes later inthe year. Ironically, the cycle o f availability ofnon-
maize staple foods accentuatesrather than offsets that o fmaize shortages inthe hungry
season.

1.18    Unreliable production estimates of-cassavaand sweet potato ledto unrealistic
assumptionsabout consumption. The World Bank (2003) notedthat ifthe crop estimateshad
been correct, Malawiwould have producedbetween3,400 and 3,900 kilocalories per day per
capita between2000 and2003. Data from the IntegratedHousehold Survey indicate that
averageconsumption is only 1,s18 kilocalories per day. Since the disagreementbetweenthe
government and its development partners continued for some time, and there were no grain
reserves left, the government startedpurchasing 15,000 metric tons o fmaize per month.


6. These failings were notedinan audit report o fMay2003. The auditors also concludedthat NFRAmade
major losses throughpoor grain management andhandlingprocedures, confused lines ofauthority, decision
makingandreporting (EU2003).
7. ByNovember 2001, DIFID,EU, DenmarkandUSAID hadsuspendedtheir aidprograms. GOMhadyet to
comply withthe agreeddomestic borrowingand spending limits under the IMFUS$55 Poverty Reductionand

 Afler considerable delays due to cumbersome transport, payments, andprocurement
 procedures, the WRA received 94,000 metic tons by September 2002.

 1.19 The international community subsequently came to therescue andresponded
 positively to the government's repeated appeal with cash and in-kindpledges. The EDRP
 was anintegralpart o fthe relief andrecovery assistance. Following a meetingbetween the
 government andthe internationalcommunity, a Joint EmergencyFoodAid Program (JEFAP)
 consortiumwas created to respondto the crisis. The World FoodProgramledthe consortium
 andtargeted, delivered, monitored, the funds used andthe food aiddistributed. At the height
 ofthe 2002/03 crisis, 3.2 millionpeople throughout the country werebeingassisted through
government, donor and NGOoperations.

 1.20   Maize Prices. ADMARC administers pan-territorial prices to purchase and sell
maize. However, marketprices are often significantlyhigher signaling supply scarcity. A
rapidgrain price increase i s probablythe most reliable indicator o f an impedingcrisis. Figure
4 shows that grainprices increasedsharply starting as earlyas July 2001. These skyrocketing
food crop prices should have alerted the GOMand the donor community to the impending
crisis, but the warning signs were overlooked. Maizeprices peakedinthe 2001/02
consumption season. The data also shows the seasonalpatternofretailprices. Retail prices
generally rise as the seasonprogresses and decline at the time ofharvest. This patternreflects
theprevailingdemand andsupply conditionsinthe market.

1.22    Recent data show a worsening o f locallyproducedfood availability. The last year
Malawihad surplus food productionwas 2000/01 when the USP was being implemented.
After the termination o fthe USP, Malawihas never been able to produce enough staple food
to feed itself. The trend shows aworsening o fthe food availability as the domestic food gap
hasbeenwidening (Figure 6) andformal and informalimports and food aidhave become
critical to Malawi's food security.

1.23    Weak Economic Performance. Malawi's highinflation (Figure 5) has resulted
largely from poor public expenditure management. As a result ofthe previous government's
failure to control expenditure, particularly since 2000, Malawihad accumulated a large
domestic debt that threatened macroeconomic andfinancial stability, and servicing this debt
crowdedout other expenditures on social and economic services as well as investments, and
fueled inflation andhighinterest rates.

 1.24    Malawi's domestic borrowing was rising rapidly. In2002, domestic debt* had
reached 25 percent o f GDP while domestic interest rates hadrisento 46 percent. Interest
payments absorbed nearly 30 percent o f government expenditure. As a result, provisionof
basic services andpriority investments programsinagriculture and infrastructure received
minimalresources. Foreignexchange reserves also fell sharply after August 2001. This was
partlydueto the useofforeign exchange to import maize, andpartlyas aresult o fthe
suspension ofbalance o fpayments support. InMay 2002, Malawi failed to meet the agreed
benchmarks (among others the reduction indomestic borrowing) for the release o f $47
millionunder the IMF's PovertyReduction and GrowthFacility (PRGF). Onlyone review of
the PRGFwas successfully completed inOctober 2003. The combinationo f financing
through domestic credit expansion, andthe runningdown offoreign reserves ledto exchange
ratedepreciation and increasedinflation, which hadan adverse impact on investment and
growth. The MK fell to MK1OS/US$ (August 2003), comparedwith MK65/US$ two years
earlier at the start o fthe food crisis. Following a successful implementationo f an austerity
program inAugust 2005, Malawireached the HIPC CompletionPoint and qualified for the
MultilateralDebt ReliefInitiative (MDFU), which would reduce its external debt from 229
percent o f export earnings to 32 percent.


2.       Project Objectives and Design

2.1     InJuly2002, the Government o fMalawirequested emergency assistancefromIDA
to address the food crisis.' The Bankresponded positively, and quickly assembled a mission
to prepare and appraise the project inAugust. A $50 millionequivalent credit and grant (and
an estimated government contributiono f $0.5 million) was approved inNovember 2002 and

8. The debt of over US$75 millionwas due to be paidto commercialbanks with about 46% interest rate
9. Although signs offamine startedinmid2001, the GOM didnot declare anemergency untilFebruary2002.

declaredeffective onJanuary 13,2003. The EDRP was the thirdIDA-assisted emergency
operation inMalawi."

2.2       The objectives ofthe project, as statedinthe Memorandumo fthe President (MOP)
were highlyambitious: (i)    allow the government to maintainkey commitments to its
economic andinvestment priorities consistentwith PRSPprocesswhile averting famine; (ii)
help restoreproductive capability o fthe country; and(iii) long-term disaster
                                                                  support
management. The objectives inthe Development Credit Agreement (DCA) wereprudent and
focused onthe emergency: (i) improve the borrower's emergencyresponsemanagement;
                                  to
and(ii)assist inrecovery from drought. Whilethe development objectives formulated in
          to
the MOP, aimed at addressingthe longterm issuesby linkingthe project with the GOM's
commitment under the PRSPprocesswere desirable, the designo fthe projectwas largely
aimed at meetingthe emergencyneedswhile supporting selectedmeasuresto address the
long-term issues. This divergence poses a dilemma for assessingthe achievement ofthe
objectives. However, the Project outcomes are assessedbasedon the DCA's specification o f
the project objectives since these were more realistic andappropriate for anemergency
operation.

Project Components
2.3       Component 1:Quick DisbursingAssistance for Critical Imports ($40 millionor
80 percent of the creditfgrant). The project was primarilydesignedto provide quick-
disbursingbalanceofpayments support to finance criticalimports from an agreedpositive
list o f import requirementslinkedto the drought recovery efforts. As the Bank does not
finance food items" the agreedpositive list o fimports consistedof(i)             petroleum and fuel
products; (ii) agricultural inputs-primarily fertilizers; (iii)    agricultural andconstruction
equipmentandspareparts; (iv) livestock, animal products, andveterinary supplies; (v)
school supplies, medical supplies andequipment.The agreedlist was aimed at meetingthe
emergency goods and servicerequirements o f selectedsectors affected bythe drought.

2.4       Component 2: Income-GeneratingPublic Works and Sponsored Subprojects ($8
million or 16percentof the creditfgrant). To enhancethe purchasingpower of drought-
affected populations, the project included a series o f small-scalepublic works including
feeder roads, community afforestation, small water retention dams, andcanal clearance. This
component complementedthe ongoing Bank-assistedMalawi Social Action Fund(MASAF-

principles andprocedures, the requirement underthe EDRPwas to create temporary wage
paying employment for aperiodo f six months to generatehouseholdcash income.

be usedfor the emergency operation. Inthe 1992 drought recovery credit, the proceeds from the IDA hadbeen
used for foodpurchases.

2.5      Component 3: TechnicalAssistance and Studies ($2 million or 4 percent of the
credivgrant). This componentwas aimed at strengthening Malawi's capacity for future
droughtmitigation andmanagement.Theproceeds fkom the project were intendedto: (i)
 support full publicdiscussionandconsideration o fthe causes o fthe present crisis and
measuresto prevent recurrence, including the work o fthe technical subcommitteesofthe
Inter-Ministerial Task Force; (ii) Malawi's participationinefforts by the Southern
                                        support

prevention andmanagemento fcrises;'2 (iii)            diagnosethe keyproblems with agricultural
statistics and develop improvedandreliable methods for annual crop estimates; (iv) finance
regular meetingsof atechnical steeringcommittee to monitorimplementation ofthe present
program; (v) put inplace a mechanism for monitoringand evaluating the impact ofthe crisis
andmitigationefforts; (vi) provide short-term support to strengthenthe agricultural advisory
services available to small farmers to develop drought-resistant farmingsystems, andto
focus on ways o fimproving water andsoilmanagement, mitigatingthe impact of fUtue
disasters; and(vii) finance studies, inter alia, to develop a food security andnutrition
strategy.


RetroactiveFinancing
2.6      Dueto the emergencynature oftheproject andMalawi's mountingdemandfor
foreign exchange, retroactive financing of $10 million (20 percent o fthe credit/grant) was
also approved. Paymentsmadeby the borrower form its reserves four months before signing
the Credit andGrant Agreementswere eligible for retroactive financing to be disbursed
immediately after siping,

3.       Implementation

3.1      Credit effectiveness was subject to the establishment andstaffing o fthe Project
Coordinating Unit (PCU) inthe Ministryo fAgriculture and Irrigation(MAI),later renamed
the MinistryofAgriculture andFood Security (MoFS), designing andapproving aproject
implementation manual, financial management, andproject auditing arrangements.Timing
was critical for theproject. Although the credit was successfully negotiated on September 19,
2002, the Governmentdidnot meet the requiredconditions untilJanuary 13,2003. This
delay meantthat, except for the Retroactive Financing, Malawiwas unable to use the
credivgrant proceedsto finance itspriority agricultural inputsintime for the 2002/03 crop
season, which started inNovember 2002.

3.2     Overallproject coordinationwas assignedto the PCU. A NationalSteering
Committee (NSC) was also established. It was chaired bythe M o A Iandconsistedo f the
Secretariat o fthe MASAF, NGOs, andthe ReserveBank o fMalawiresponsible for receipt
andreleaseofcreditlgrant proceeds. TheNSCmetregularly andinFebruary 2003 approved
the Project Implementation Manual (PIM), the PCU's work planandproposed budget.
Although there was anunusually highturnover o fPermanentSecretaries o fMoAIduringthe

12. The JohannesburgWorld Summit was heldinSeptember2002 inthe midst ofthe food crisis inSouthern
Africa and there was anurgent call for regional collaboration.

                                                       12


period, this hadminimalimpact on the timelydecision makingandimplementation o fthe
project.

3.3      Followingthe useofthe Retroactive Financing, the Quick Disbursing Component
was expedited andbyNovember 2003 nearly$32 million, or 80percent o fthe allocation,
was committed anddisbursed. Private sector importers obtained foreign exchangeby
depositingthe equivalent inlocal currency intheir private banks. Procurement o fimported
goods-petroleum,        fertilizers, agricultural equipment, etc.-was inaccordancewith the
commercial practices o fprivate sector importers, which were acceptableto the Bank. Private
sector importers accountedfor nearly99percent ofthe total import billunder the project and
only the Department o fAnimalHealthandIndustryusedthe balance to import veterinary
drugs. The importeditemswere subsequentlysold inthe domestic market throughprivate
sector outlets. However, therewas no provisioninthe project to trace the enduseo fthe
importeditems, a common feature inbalance o fpayments support.

3.4      Balance o fpayment support operations occasionally require the establishmento fa
special account to deposit the local currency proceedsfrom the sale o f foreign exchange. The
MalawiKwachaproceedsfiom the sale o f dollars for imports were deposited inthe Reserve
BankofMalawiinaGovernment BudgetControlAccount. ForEDRP, access to such
proceedswould have financed additional income-generatingpublic works under the MASAF
program andother relatedexpenditures inthe agriculture sector. MAImade repeated
attemptsto access the account. However, as part o fa packageo fmeasuresto stabilize the
economy andreduce its accumulateddomestic debt, the Bank advised the RBMto usethe
proceeds, estimated at about M K 5 billion, to retire government debt as agreedwith the IMF.
Since the useo fthe localcurrency proceedswas only mentionedinthe MOP andthe
Technical Annex andwas not reflected inthe DCA, M A I ' s claimwas not legally binding.

3.5      ThePublic Worksand SponsoredSubprojects Componentdidnot start untilMay
2003, nearlyfour months after effectiveness. This was the periodwhen M A S A F was
finalizing the preparation o fMASAF 111.The appointment o fproject staff andputtingin
placethe implementation arrangementsinthe District Assemblies took longer than expected.
While the intentionwas to adopt the ongoing IDA-assistedM A S A F I1Project
implementation framework for EDRP, the identification o fsubprojects andbeneficiaries
alongwiththe contracting o fthe works, andthe cashpayments arrangements took some time
to finalize. Moreover, the DistrictAssemblies who were responsible for identifyingthe
subprojectswere fully engagedinimplementing the ongoingMASAF 11-financedprojects
andweredelayed insubmittingnew subprojectsdue to capacity limitations. This component
was intendedto quickly create income for the drought-affected populations who hadbeen
under stress since mid2001. The delayed start-up meant insome cases resorting to distress
sales of meagerhouseholdassets andentering into debt.13

3.6      MASAF, through the District Assembles, subcontractedthe public works to local
contractorswho were requiredto hire localresidents. This modalityintroduced aparallel

                                                               -
13. The sale of assets duringnaturaldisasters is oftencitedinMalawiandelsewhere. However, actualsurveys
onsuchsales are not always readily available. Interviews withparticipatinghouseholdsduringthe PPAR
Mission indicatedthat such distress sales ofhouseholdgoods have occurred.

mechanismto the ongoingM A S A Fproject design whichrequiredbeneficiary contributions
inexchangeforcreatingandimprovingcommunity assets. Implementationpicked-upinthe
 secondyear following a slow start-up. To acceleratethe implementation o f the PWP, a
memberofa Consortium ofNGOsmanaging the Sustaining Productive Livelihoods through
Inputsfor Assets (SPLIFA) programinMalawiwas selectedto implementacomplementary
public works program. The focus was on improvingfeeder roads and, unlike MASAF's
PWP, the laborerswere paidinkind-fertilizer     andseeds. Another subproject was the
SponsoredSubprojects (SSPs) which financed income-generating projects to benefit the
disabled, orphans, HIV AND AIDS patients andthe elderly who were not able to participate
inthe labormarket. SeveralNGOs, engagedinsimilarongoing activities were selectedto
implement the SSPs inallthe 28 Districts.

3.7      The TechnicalAssistanceand Studies Componentwas implemented throughout the
duration o fthe credit andone major study, the FoodSecurity andNutrition Strategy was
completed inJuly 2005, seven months after the credit was closed. The Strategy was later
presentedto a Committee ofPermanentSecretariesfor review. Followinga series of
consultations the Strategywas split into two parts, a Food Security Strategy andaNutrition
Strategy. Thenewly establishedDepartment ofNutrition, HIV,andAIDS inthe Officeo fthe
PresidentandCabinet i s responsible for the implementationofthe Nutrition Strategy. The
Food Security Strategy is acomprehensive document with a view to addressingpolicy (input
andoutput subsidies), servicedelivery andinstitutionalreforms (theroleo fADMARC and
the operation, financing andmanagementofthe National FoodReserve Agency).

3.8     Another keydocument identified for preparation under the technical assistance
componentwas,the completion o fthe National Disaster Management Plan, which was started
in1997.InJanuary2004, after aseriesofrevisions andconsultations withUNDP andthe
UNOfficefor Crisis andHumanitarianAffairs (OCHA), the DepartmentofPovertyand
DisasterManagementAffairs inthe Office o f the Vice President andCabinet finalized the
Plan. The Planhasbeendiscussedat aninterministerial meeting andthe Departmentis now
preparinganOperational Manual. The Departmenthasalso contractedBundaCollege,
UniversityofMalawi, to trainDistrictAssembly agriculture staffondrought mitigationand
management.

3.9     Incollaborationwiththe FoodandAgriculture Organization(FAO), apilotproject to
promote cassavaproduction was also undertakenineight Districts with a view to providing
farmhouseholdswith adrought-resistant crop. Another programwhichwas successfully
implementedunderthe project was the preparation ofan Information Educationand
Communication (IEC) packageto briefcommunities on the project, disseminate improved
agricultural practices(such as the adoption o fwinter cropping) for water-stressed areas and
drought-awarenesspackagesfor community training. Consultantswere hiredto prepare
simpletechnicalmessages. The credit also financed apilotprogramto promote the
manufacturing oftreadle pumps for irrigation. Importedpumps are usedinMalawi but are
very expensive. As a drought mitigationmeasureandto complement water harvesting, a
technical studywas conducted andtraining programs were impartedto small-scale private
sector manufacturers.

3.10      A summary ofAppraisal andActual Project Cost Summary ispresentedinTable 4.
Dueto the appreciation ofthe SDRanddepreciationofthe Malawi Kwacha, the totalproject
cost increasedfrom $50.5 millionto $55.2 million. This increase shouldnotbe viewed as a
cost overrunsince the project was able to finance additional importsandpublic works made
possible bythe appreciation o fthe SDRandthe government's increased allocation to the
emergencyoperation.

3.11 Three separate SpecialAccounts were opened for the three project components
allowing the implementing agenciesready access to resourcesandreplenishment. To
expedite implementation andtimelyavailability o fresources, the MASAF SpecialAccount
was raised fiom $1millionto $3 million.The project Disbursement Profile is presentedin

underEDWwas relatively fast. Nearly40percent o fthe credivgrant was disbursedat the

3.12    A mid-ternreview was carried out inDecember2004 and recommendedthe
recruitment o fNGOsfor the implementationo fthe SSPs andreallocations fiom the technical
assistancecomponent to the Quick DisbursingandPublic Works components. Overall, the
implementation of EDFW was uneventful. There were no major issues duringthe life o f the
Project andBank SupervisionReportsratedProject Development Objectives andProject
Implementation Status Satisfactory and HighlySatisfactoryrespectively.


4.      Outputs and Outcomes

4.1     The Project ImplementationManualhadlisteda series o fambitious outcome
indicators to monitor the implementation o fthe PRS commitments. One indicator was that
the budget allocation for educationandhealth in2002/2003 would bemaintained inreal
terms to the 2000/2001 budget level as agreedunder the PRSP. Other ambitious targets, for
maizeproduction andpricelevels, and for morbidity and mortality, were also included.
These indicators reflectedthe ambitious objectives stated inthe Memorandum ofthe
Presidentbutwere neither monitorednorreportedduringimplementation. The indicators in
the DCA were more prudent and appropriate for an emergency operation. They were oriented
more toward outputs rather thanoutcomes andincluded: the value ofimports under the
Quick DisbursingComponent, the physical works completed and number o fbeneficiaries
underthe Public Works Component, andthe contributions ofthe technical assistance and
studies toward improvingdrought mitigation andmanagement.

4.2    Supplyof priority agricultural inputs augmentedavailability: The Quick
DisbursingComponent, which accountedfor 80percent o fthe credit/grant proceeds,

                                                  16


financed alist o fpriority imports and supplementedthe government's efforts to alleviate the
input shortages createddue to scarcityo fforeign exchange. ThePPARMissionwas not able
to gather actual quantities for eachimporteditem. Except for the value ofimports, indicative
physicalquantities ofimports underthis component were not presentedinthe
MOP/Technical Annex or inthe ICR. Basedon the total value o fimports under the project
andthe average totalmonthly import billofMalawi o f$60million, the total foreign
exchangetransfer contribution ofthe Quick DisbursingComponent ($44 million) is about 73
percent o fone month's import bill. Considering that the total creditlgrant o f $50 millionwas
disbursedover two years, the roject's impact instabilizing the MalawiKwacha, increasing
the foreign exchangereserve ,easinginflation, and spurring GDP growth couldnot have
                                IF
been significant.

4.3      One ofthe key agricultural inputsprocured under the project was fertilizer. Since
2001/02, fertilizer consumption had shown amodest increase, reaching apeak in2003/04
untilit declined againin2004/05 (Figure 8), the last year ofthe TargetedInputProgram
which also coincided with a more severe drought episode.

4.4      Imports o f fertilizer underEDRPworth $10million accountedfor about 12percent o f
total annual fertilizer consumption. The annual average fertilizer consumption duringthe
EDRPimplementation period(2002/03-2004/05) was about 200,000 tons valued at about $80
million. EDRP has contributedmodestly to the supply o f fertilizer for the 2003/04 maize
growing season (November 2003-February 2004). After reaching2 milliontons in2002/03,
the thirdhighest level since 1990/91, maize productiondeclined by 15percent in2003/04
(when most o fEDRP financed inputswere actually imported), and dropped another 30
percent in2004/05 (Figure 3). Maizeproductionreboundeddramatically in2005/06

reaching anall time highof2.6 milliontons. Inview ofthe small quantity offertilizer and
other inputs procuredunder the project andmarketednationally, the linkbetweenthe
project's input contribution andnationalmaizeproductionin2002-2004cannot be
substantial.

4.5       The project also contributed to the domestic transport cost o f food imports by
procuring petroleum. Imported food was sold at subsidizedpan-territorial prices giving
priorityto severelydrought affectedareas such as the Southernand Central Regions. To
attract studentsback to school andto increasehousehold food consumption, theproject also
financed the operational cod5ofWFP's school feeding andtake-homerationprograms.
W P andthe EUprovidedthe food andthe EDRPpaidfor the transport andother
operational costs. An estimated 115,000 studentsbenefited from this program inabout 145
schoolsin 10selectedDistricts andanadditional 200,000 studentsreceivedtake home
rations. Vulnerability Analysis andMapping (an analytical tool adoptedbyWFP) was used
to identi@ andtarget food-insecurebeneficiaries. The project input was instrumental in
reversingthe primaryschool drop out rates, especially duringthe hungryseason. The animal
vaccines procured underthe project helped arrest the spreadingfoot andmouth disease. The
programwas effective andsavedthe most valuable livelihood-livestock--                          for rural
households.

4.6       Wageand inputpayments, and assets created have boosted household incomes and
improved livelihoods: The Public Works and SponsoredSubprojects Component in.ected
liquidity, andcreatedandrehabilitatedphysicalassets, provided multisectoral training, and
social assistanceto the disabled, elderly, orphans and female-headedhouseholds. Table 5                    .

inthe designo fthepublicworks programwas to ensurethat 60percentofthe subproject cost
wouldpay for unskilled labor. Once the LocalGovernmentsidentified villages to participate
inthepublic works program, the selectionofindividuals for employment was leftto the
community. A total of 134,000laborers were employed for an average of four hours a day
for six months to ensurethat they would be able to allocate the rest o ftheir time to their farm
activities. The dailywage rate o fMK43'* was equivalent to 3 kgs. o fmaize for atotal wage
billofabout MK252 million. Duringthe mission's visit to project Districts, householdswho
benefited from public works employment indicated that they usedtheir earnings to buy food
andpay for clothing andeducationfor their children. Underthe NGO-managedpublic works
(feeder roads), an estimated 100,000 beneficiariesreceivedfertilizer and seeds as wage
payments andmet their inputrequirements for the 2004/05 production season. While these
are commendableachievements, the delayed start-up o f the public works and sponsored
subprojectscomponent alsodelayedthe income that the affectedpopulation urgentlyneeded.
Anecdotal evidenceindicatesthat duringthe interimperiod, the affectedpopulationhadto
relyonrelieffood distributions, borrowingfrombetter-off acquaintancesor by selling their
meager household assets. The total numbero fbeneficiaries under this component exceeded
the appraisalestimate by 38 percent.

4.8      Thevarious studies, institutional strengthening interventionsandpilot projects
have enhancedMalawi's emergency mitigation and management capacity. The Project has
resulted inanumberofoutputsunder the Technical Assistance and Studies Component.
Nearly20 studies, pilot projects, andtraining programs were completed duringthe two-year
implementation period. Flexible managementandallocation o fresources for newly
identified studieswas instrumentalinthe successofthis component.

4.9     Despite the delays incompleting the FoodSecurity andNutritionStrategy
(subsequentlysplitbetweenFoodSecurity, andNutritionandHIVAND AIDS strategies),
andthe Tobacco Sector Studies, these studiesprovidedthebasisfor the formulationofsector
strategies andpolicyformulations. The Food Security andNutritionStrategy report is a high
profiledocument that hasbecomethe principaldocument for the ongoing preparationwf an
Agricultural PolicyFramework (APF). To addressthe long-term issueso f food security, the
timely completion ofthe APF is a long-awaited action. A series o f food security monitoring
andevaluation indicators havebeendeveloped whichwillbeintegrated into the overall
performance indicators for the APF. The Department o fNutritionandHIV andAIDS has
also completed an operationalplanfor implementation. The national campaign to improve
nutritionstandards inMalawirequires a shift from a maize-baseddiet to a mix ofessential
balancedproducts including, among others, cassava, a drought resistant plant. The EDRP's
support to the pilot cassavaproject was highlysuccessfbl andthe FA0is assisting the
government indisseminatingthe results to other partso fMalawi andwill support the
implementation o fthe NutritionStrategy.

4.10    One ofthe issues identified under the Tobacco Sector Studywas the needto improve
the tobacco supplychainbyreducing government levies. This was pursued under IDA'S
reform agenda for the FiscalManagement andAccelerated GrowthProgram Adjustment

 continuesto interfere inthe tobacco market.

 4.1 1   The completion ofa draft NationalDisaster Management AndPlanin2004 with
 EDRPassistanceis alandmarkachievement. The preparation startednearly 10years ago
 andhadundergonea series ofprotractedreviews. The Operational Manualwill outline the

 4.12    Malawi's participation inthe SADC Workshop onthe "Regional Strategic Food
 Reserve" was an opportunity to debate the regional food security issues, includingthe role o f
 Regional Strategic Reservesinmeetingemergencyneeds. The outcome o fthe workshop was
 to establishaRegional StrategicReserveCommittee with a view to exchanging information
 onunfolding emergenciesandhow the regionalmarkets could betapped to meet country-
 specific emergencies.Toward this end, the needs for strengtheningcountry-basedearly
warningsystems, including the timelyreleaseo freliable weather reportswere agreed. In
 Malawi, there is a growing awarenessthat collective regional actions andpolices influence a
 country's food security. A notable exampleis the contribution made to Malawi's food supply
byinformalcross-bordermaizetrade.

4.13     Results ofpilot projects, includingproduction and storagetechnologies (winter
maize, cassava, livestock, water harvesting) researchare available for dissemination. Special
refreshertrainingprograms for extension staffhave equippedthemwithnew skills. To
promote the manufacturing oftreadlepumpslocally, a training program for small-scale
entrepreneurs was organized successfully. Affordable irrigationpumpswould expandsmall-
scale irrigationschemes. Strengtheningthe National Statistics Office andthe Departmentof
Meteorology, andparticipation inRegional (SADC) meetings on drought management and
mitigation strategies enhancedthe availability o ftimely andreliable crop andweather data.
Simpleextension messages were developedandmore than20,000 copies weredistributed to
communities duringthe life ofthe project.


5,       Ratings

5.1     The project's overall Outcome is ratedSatisfactory on account of: i)relevanceto the
GOM strategy andthe Bank's CAS for food security; ii)efficacy, by achievingthe stated
project development objectives; andiii)cost efficiency-comparable low cost per
beneficiary andtimely completion. While the PPARmissionrecognizesthat Malawi's food
crisis is often associatedwith recurrent floods anddrought, such episodes are equally a result
ofpolicy andinstitutional failures. Appropriately designed, targeted, andtimely emergency
operationscouldprovide effective reliefinterventions especially when linkedwith follow-up
long-term actions. Bankassistanceto the agricultural sector only resumedin2004 with the

approval ofthe Community LandDevelopment Project andin2006 with the launching ofthe
Irrigation, RuralLivelihoods andAgricultural Development Project. These operations are
appropriate, since they are intended to transfer assets to smallholders, providetechnical and
marketing services, and avail irrigationfacilities to commercially oriented smallholders.
Timely and successfulimplementation o fthese operations coupledwith other complementary
pro'gramsininfrastructure andcredit wouldpromote agriculture crop diversification andease
the heavyreliance onthe dominant drought prone maize crop. The impact andwider
coverageof suchinterventions would not beimmediate.

5.2     Theproject objectiveswere relevant to the recently completed 2003 CAS, consistent
with Pillars 11,aimedat establishing aplatformfor sustainable growth, andPillar 111,focused
on strengtheningthe safetynet." The newlyissued2007 CAS, has a strong focus on
agriculture andidentifies food security as apriority objective while fully recognizing the risk
ofnatural disasters, especiallydrought. EDRPis also relevant to Pillars IandI11o fthe
Malawi GrowthandDevelopment Strategy (MGDS), the successorto itsPoverty Reduction
Strategy, anditscommitment to the MDGs. The project designwas also relevant to the
objectives o fthe project. At the peak o fthe food crisis, Malawineeded an urgent financing
o fpriorityinputsandfood imports. The project respondedappropriately by allocating 80
percent o fthe IDACreditIGrant for a quick disbursingimport financing. Similarly, the
drought affectedpopulationlackedthe purchasingpower to meet their basic needsandthe
inclusion of conditional cashandtransfer was equally appropriate. Finally, to strengthen
Malawi's capacity to respondeffectively to future food crisis, the technical assistancewas
designedsuitably to fillthe prevailing gaps.

5.3     Assessingthe achievementsofproject objectives under atwo-year drought
emergencyoperation raises several questions. Ifthe project i s designed largely to assist the
Government inbalanceo fpayments support, is the measureo fsuccess the utilizationo fthe
credit for the agreedpositive import list? Or is the Government's capacity andperformance
to meet the foreign exchange requirements ina subsequent drought (2004/2005) the measure
o f success? Cansuchanoperation address the causes ofthe food crisis which are rooted ina
series of core sectoralandeconomy-wide issueswhich require long-term interventions? This
assessmenttakes the view that the hybridoperation has long andshort-term objectives with
the latterbeingthepredominant project objective.

5.4       Notwithstanding the apparent disconnect between the MOP andthe DCA in
formulating the project objectives, the eficucy o f the project is assessed basedon two shared
objectives. The first objective was to improve the borrower's emergencyresponse
managementcapacity andis ratedsubstantial. The principal achievements are: i)enhanced
emergencyassistancecoordination capacity at central and locallevels o fgovernment; ii)
improvedearlywarningwith timely weather data dissemination; andiii)the application o f
the various study andpilotproject results inefforts to address the long-term food security
issues. The completion ofvarious studies, implementation o fpilot projects andprovisiono f
equipment andstafftraining, describedinparas. 4.8-4.13 have enhancedthe Government's
long-term disastermitigation andmanagementcapacity. The disastermanagement training
program for the District Assembly staffhas developed local skills to better coordinate future

 disasters. The Government's improved managementandcoordination o f the 2004105
 drought, (with effective donor in-kindandfinancial support) the worst since 2001/02, is
 testament to the sustainability o fthe achievementsunder EDRP.The Government isnow
 better equippedwithweather forecasting andhas an effective Malawi Vulnerability
 Assessment Cornittee W A C ) that issues credible early warning food security
 assessments. The IEC was also considereda very successfulinitiative. It was instrumental in
 mobilizing communities for the implementationo fthe public works component and
 disseminating results from the pilot projects. With continued improved economic
 managementandperformance, Malawii s inabetter position in2007 thanin2002 to respond
 quickly and effectively to future droughts.

 5.5     The secondobjective was to assist inthe recovery from drought andisrated
 substantial. EDRP, as anemergency operation hasprovidedbothreliefandrecovery
 assistance. Priority imports under the Quick Disbursingcomponent which account for 80
percento fthe credivgrant were delivered on time. The keydesign features o fthe two-year
EDRPoperationhascontributedto theurgentneedsofthe affectedpopulation. Nearly 80
percent o fthe IDA credit/grant financed short-term expendableitems such as farminputs,
petroleum, andmedical andschool supplies. In2003 and2004, these imports contributed to
the overall agricultural production, livestock diseaseprevention, school attendance, andfood
distribution to the hungry.The incomes generatedandthe inputsprovided referredto in
paras. 4.6-4.7, albeit for a short-term, boostedthe beneficiaries' capacity to copewith the
food crisis. A notable shortcoming i s the delayed start-up o fthe conditional cashtransfer
linked to community asset creation andrehabilitation. Since the food crisis started in2001,
thedelaymayhave forcedthe affectedpopulationto resort to other copingmechanisms
includingentering into debt andpossible saleo ftheir important source o flivelihood,
livestock. Notwithstanding the delay inlaunching the public works, the project achievedits
objectives with an extensionperiod o f six months. Without the project, those who
participated inthe conditional cashtransfers would have continued to survive on one or
maximumtwo mealsa day, lost their remaininglivelihoods, andschool dropouts would
haveincreased. For thosewho receivedfertilizers as payments for participating inpublic
works, they were able to resume food production. The improved feeder roads havealso
opened access to villages and facilitated the delivery o fservices includingemergencyneeds.
Although the project's objectives havebeen achieved, the drought affected population that
benefited from the project is still vulnerable to natural disasters.

5.6      A key factor for the efficacy oftheproject objectives is that the institutional
arrangement was anchoredonongoing govenunent programs andassignedto implementing
institutions with aproventrack record andapproved procedures. The Quick Disbursing
Componentrelied on the private sector andthe bankingsector for imports; the Public Works
andSSP Componentwas similar to theprogramdesignedto achievethe objectives pursued
underthe ongoingMalawi Social Action Fundandthe NO-led Sustaining Productive
Livelihoods through Inputsfor Assets program.

5.7     Although there was no explicit or implicit eflciency measureapplied to the appraisal
ofthe project, the PPARmissionhas derivedcost effectivenessindicators. The total
expenditureunderthe Public Works andSSP Component is $9.2 millionto benefit 0.4
million food insecurepeople at an averagecost o f $23 perbeneficiary which compares

                                                 22


favorably with the standaloneBank-assistedMASAF Projects. The cash for work public
works subcomponentwas also more efficient thanthe direct food aidprogram. Participants
under the project were paidincash andreceived anaverageofh4K 1,880 for the duration o f
their employmentequivalent to 125kilograms ofmaize. The cash-for-work payment hadan
added forward linkage benefit. Additionalpurchasingpower ina community sufferingfrom
loss ofincome creates demandfor goods andservices andpromotesthe revival o fmarkets.
Project beneficiaries usedtheir cashincomes to purchaseconsumer goods andpaidfor farm
inputssuchas fertilizer andseeds. Sincethe objective ofthepublicworks subproject was to
generateincome for the drought-affectedpopulation while buildingandor rehabilitating
assets, the PPAR mission concludesthat the project designwas cost-effective andwas
completed on time despite initialstart-up delays. Another measureo fproject efficiency i s
the share o ftotal operating cost to total project cost. EDRP's overheadis about 2 percent of
total project cost which comparesfavorably withsimilar projects. Table 6 summarizesthe

5.8      The Risks to Development Outcomes are significant. The ratingreflects Malawi's
vulnerability to future drought episodesandresultingfoodcrisis, as occurred again in
2004/05. In2005, the government faced another severe drought andrequired similar
interventions and assistancefor amuchlarger affected population. Timely government
appealsto the international community, enhancedcapacity to manage emergencies, andthe
strengthened early warning systems improved Malawi's response. InSeptember 2005, the
Bankapproveda$30milliongrant to mitigate the impacts o fthe 2004/05 foodcrisis.
Introduction o finnovative methods o fmaize procurement from the South Afi.ica Futures
Exchange (SAFEX) andthe pilotingo f the weather-basedinsurance for groundnut farmers
are new risk reducing measures. However these measuresare at pilot stages. The number o f
rural householdsexposedto food security risks inMalawi is still very highandrecurrent
droughts and floods trigger increasednational food insecurity. Untilthe core agricultural
sectoralissuesare fully addressed, Malawiwill remain exposedto natural disasterrisks. With
respectto the assets createdor rehabilitated, the arrangement for the continued maintenance
o fthe feeder roads is yet to be finalized. Maintenance o fsuch improved dirt roads is the
responsibility o fthe District Assemblies, which are expectedto organize communities to
provide free labor supportedby technical advice andprovisiono f simple tools. The feeder
roadsvisited require minor works especially following the rainyseason. Users around the
water pump service areas have the primaryresponsibility for maintenance andmakecash
contributions to purchase spareparts. The maintenance arrangementsfor water pumpsappear
better organizedthanfor the feeder roads.

5.9      The Bank's overall performancei s rated moderatelysatisfactoryweighing its
performancebothonquality at entry and supervision. Withrespectto Bankassistanceto
quality at entry, the Bank's performance i s ratedsatisfactory. The Bank sharedits
international experienceand focusedthe design largely on the financing of critical imports.
TheBank's interventionalso assistedindesigning a component aimedat enhancingaccess to
food andother necessitiesbycreating wagepayingemployment while creating and
rehabilitating physical assets. The Bank also paidattention to the need for strengthening
resilience to fbture shocks. InJuly 2003, the Quality Assurance Group ratedEDRP's Quality
at Entryas satisfactory. Sector andcountry managerswere closely involvedinthe design and
later followed up on agreed actions withthe borrower.

5.10     The Bank's project supervisionwas delegatedto the Country Officewith substantial
support fkom headquarters, which facilitated regular interactionwith the PCUandthe
implementingentities. Duringthe two-year implementation period, the Bankcarried out 4
review missions andhas issuedsix Project StatusReports (PSRs) with atotal staff input of
13 staffweeks per year comparedwith the Bank-wide average supervision coefficient o f 12
staffweeks per year. Specialists from headquarterscomplemented Country Ofice staff
skills. The Bank's intensive supervision o fthe operation assistedinthe timely completion of
the project.

5.11 However, a notable shortcoming inthe Banksupervisionwas the quality o f its
reporting. Another area ofBankmoderateperformance is inthe Project's monitoring and
evaluation. While the Bank Team was effective inreviewingthe design ofthe system, the
follow-up on implementationandutilization was weak. The Supervision Missions,
particularly the last two, were adequatelystaffed. Fiveout o fthe six Project StatusReports
andthe accompanying documentsmerelyreportedonthe value ofimports (without                 .
presentinginformation on, for example, the quantity andtype o ffertilizer delivered) andthe
numberofsubprojectsandstudies completed. Althoughthe Task Teamsroutinelyvisitedthe
project Districts, they didnot document what the project assistancemeant for the households
theyvisitedandthereby shedlightonthe achievement ofobjectives andindicators. Onlythe
last statusreport presenteda table onperformance indicators showing GDP andagriculture
growthrates, number o fpublic works subprojectscompleted andtheir beneficiaries.
Attempting to link the project outputs with the reported growth rateso fthe economy andthe
agriculture sector is heroic. The Bank's performance inthe quality o f supervision is rated
moderatelysatisfactory.

5.12    Although the Bank's overall country economic surveillance andengagement is not
the subject o f this assessment, the PPAR Missionalso questions whether the Bank could
havebeenmore proactive inthe thenunfolding food crisis. The government declareda food
crisis inFebruary2002 after a series o fNGO andreligious organizations hadearlier reported
the widespreadfamine andrelateddeaths. To be sure, the Bank respondedwith speedonce
the Government sent a request for assistance inJuly 2002. However, an earlier Bank
engagement would have gainedmore time for the project to finance the critical agricultural
inputsintime for the 2002/03 season andthe income-generationcomponentwouldhave
startedmuch earlier andperhapsavertedthe distresmle ofhousehold assets andpremature
harvesting o fmaize. Another issue that needsto be flagged is the near absence of the Bank
from direct support to the sector following the EDRPoperation untilFY04when the

                                               24


Community-Based Rural LandDevelopmentProject was approved. The Bank's analysis of
the causes ofthe foodcrisis correctly pointed to core structural andpolicy issuesresultingin
poor performance. While the Bankwas engagedinaddressinginstitutional issues with
respect to the role of ADMARC, tobacco marketingandlandissuesunder the FIMAG, the
absenceo fdirect investment assistanceto the sector andthe "ad hoc policy dialogue" linked
with othermacropolicyreform agendawas inadequate.*%uring this period, the GOMwas
constantly changingits input subsidypolicy andthere is little evidence o f Bank dialogue with
the GOMon such animportant issue.

5.13     The overall Borrower's performanceis ratedmoderatelysatisfactorybasedon
the combinedratingofthe Government's andimplementingagenciesperformances.
Whydidthe Governmentwait untilJuly 2002 to approachthe Bankfor assistance,nearlya
year after firmindications o f food crisis beganto appear?Unfortunately the then Country
Manager andTask Manager are bothdeceasedandthere i s no recordon the depthandextent
o fdialogue betweenthe government andthe Bankprior to July 2002. The government was
obviously reluctant to declare a state o fhumanitarianemergency untilthe mounting
internationalpressureandmediapublicity o fthe humantragedy was widely publicized.
Moreover, the continued mismanagementofthe economy, including the unauthorized sale o f
the entire strategic reserve following the inaccurate assessmento f expectedbumper harvest
o fcassavaandother root crops, resultedinthe slow responseofdonors to the government's
initial appeal. Therefore, up to the periodleading to the preparationofthe EDRP, the
government's performance inmanagingthe loomingcrisis is widely acknowledged as
unsatisfactory. Although these eventspredatethe project, they are closely linkedto the
subsequentdevelopmentsthat ledto the involvement o fthe Bank inemergency assistance.         .

5.14     Notwithstandingthe Government's poor handlingof the early stages o fthe food
crisis, the Government's letter ofAugust 2002 to the Bank clearly set its overall drought
mitigationandmanagementplanand embracedthe need for bothshort and long-term
interventions andpolicyreforms. Itprovided abroad evaluation and estimate ofthe likely
negative impact ofthe food crisis. Bymid2002, humanitarianfood assistancewas arriving,
andthe governmentandtheprivate sectorhadstartedmaizeimports. Inanticipation ofIMF
andWorldBankfinancial assistancethe Government hadalsorationeditslimitedforeign
exchangereservefor importation o fpriority inputsespecially for agriculture. These actions
demonstratethe government's strong commitment to the overall emergency assistance. An
importantfeature o fthe projectwas the wide consultationorganizedwithvarious focus
groups onthe origin ofthe food crisis, its implications andthe role ofthe public andprivate
sectors, NGOs, andcommunities incombating the crisis. Thesepublic discussions were
financed underthe project andwere greatly appreciated by allparties andcontributed to
confidence building. Overall, the Government's performance i s rated satisfactory.

5.15     TheProject SteeringCommittee, consisting o fimplementing agencies andother key
ministries anddepartments, met regularlyandprovided strong support to the PCUandthe
implementing agencies. When differences arose among the participating agencies these were
amicably resolved. One suchcase was the proposal to recruit anNGO to help implementthe
Inputfor Asset programto assistMASAF andensuretimely completion. MASAFwas not


21. The 2005 MalawiCountryAssistanceEvaluationhas raisedthis concern seongly.

                                                 25


 pleasedwith the proposalbut later acceptedthe Steering Committee's decision andthe DCA
 was amendedto include anNGO. Thiswas a goodmanagementdecision and expedited
project completion. While the PCUcompiledthe project progress reports from the
 implementing agenciesandregularly submitted Quarterly ProgressReport to the Bank and
 the Steering Committee, the breadth anddepthof the reports were inadequate. For example,
the reportsdidnot include: beneficiary household data; the quantity ofthe inputsimported
 under the Quick Disbursing Loan; the distribution ofthe inputto end users; andfood security
 andnutritionstatusindicators. Thesedatawereextremely importantfor management
decision makingandevaluating the outcomes ofthe project. The Borrower also took an
unduly longtime to finalize the food security strategy andthe DisasterMitigationPlanand
Operational Manual. The implementingagenciesperformance is rated moderately
satisfactory.

 5.16   Theproject didnot formulate a monitoringandevaluationsystemalthoughthere
was provisionto designaproject specific M&E system. The experiencewith Bank-assisted
projects shows that after project start-up it oftentakes aminimumo f two years to design a
hctionalM&E systemfor a traditional project, andthencollect andanalyzebaseline data.
For a short-duration emergency operation, an appropriateM&Edesign should havebeen
basedon a set o fcase studies contractedto experiencedresearchersto supplement well
designed progressreports. Case studies would haveprovided valuable lessons on the
implementation, output, andoutcome ofthe project. Inview o f the scale ofthe emergency
andthe implications for health, mortality, nutrition, food security, agricultural production,
income, andemployment, the Government's decisionto establish the Malawi Vulnerability
Assessment Committee ( W A C ) was appropriate. The W A C becamethe authoritative
source for identifyingthe food insecure anddetermining the assistanceneeded, and servedas
a guide for government andexternal assistance. This annual exercise employs ateam of
specialistswho collect andanalyzedatabasedon sample surveys. The W A C works closely
withthe WFP's Vulnerability Analysis andMapping Team. The annualreports are
recognizedas credible andthe MVAC's annualreport serves as anumbrella food security
monitoring report. What is lackinginthe MVAC's reports is the evaluation o fdrought
recoveryinterventions. Dueto this lacuna, the M&E o fthe project i s rated as modestwith
respect to allthree M& E elements, design, implementation andutilization.


6.      Lessons
6.1     Notwithstanding the Bank's 1995 Operational Policy 8.50 which statesthat
EmergencyRecoveryLoans are       "...inadequateinstruments   for recurrent disasters such as
floods and slow-onset disasters suchas droughts," the EDRPwas effective inproviding
balanceofpayments support as well as inincome generation and financing highpriority
technical assistance. Malawiis vulnerable to natural disaster shocks, including drought and
floods that haveresultedinrecurrent food crises. Inthe past 15 years, Malawihas hadsix
devastatingdroughts and floods. To mitigate the recurrent food crises, Malawihas to address
the corepolicy andinstitutional issues facing the agricultural sector andrestore
macroeconomicstability to foster broad-based growth. InAugust 2006, Malawireachedthe
HIPC Completion pointpavingthe way for substantialdebt reduction. The dividend from

security inMalawi. Maintaining macro-economic stability coupledwith addressingthe long-
term policy andinstitutional issueswould combat the effects ofrecurrent natural disasters.
Lessons fiomthepilot ex-ante risk managementinstruments-such as weather-based
insuranceand entering futures commodity markets shouldbe carefully reviewedwith the
view to integrating the successfulmethods inthe Malawi's Drought MitigationStrategy.

6.2    Severalvaluable lessons, relevant to boththe Government andthe Bank emerge from
the design andimplementationofthe EDRP.

       In disasterprone countries, regular monitoring and reportingof rainfallpatterns,
       food balances (domestic consumption,production, imports including informal
       crossborder trade), and cropprices is criticalfor timely mitigation and emergency
       responsemeasures: Ifthe government had appealedfor internationalassistancewhen
       there were adequatesigns o f apending food crisis in2001, the humanand financial
       costs could havebeenreduced. This also raises the roleo fthe BankinCountry
       Offices. One rationale for a Bankpresence inclient countries is to be "a heartbeat
       away" from unraveling developmentsinthe country. Indisaster-pronecountries like
       Malawi, tke Bank shouldliaise closely with relevant Government institutions and
       organizations likethe FAO, WFP andbilaterals to monitor foodproduction, imports,
       domestic food requirements, crop prices andrainfalldata. IDAhasprovided four
       emergency credits to Malawi since 1992 andmay consider establishinga formal
       information exchangeon emerging food crises with relevant organizations inMalawi.

       Bank assistance shouldpayparticular attention tofood security issues in countries
       with chronicfood insecurity and vulnerableto natural disasters: Malawiis
       vulnerable to recurrent natural disastersthat exacerbatehousehold food insecurity and
       triggermacroeconomic imbalances.Notwithstanding the importance ofa favorable
       rainfalldistribution duringthe crop growing season, sectoral andpolicyissuesare
       also determinants of agriculturalproduction. Basedon various sector strategyand
       policy documents, the government is formulatinganAgricultural PolicyFramework.
       This urgent task needsto be completed with a view to mapping a long-term
       commitment to address the core issues o f food insecurity. The Bank should be
       engagedactively with the Government and other aid agencies and share relevant
       international practices. The Bank should also acknowledge inCAS' that natural
       disasters inMalawi are recurrent risks to macro-economic stability andoverall
       development.

       Reducingfood insecuri@requires inter alia attention to broad-based sources of
       livelihood includingnon-farm incomes. Povertyis pervasive inMalawi. Inpoor
       households, non-farm income contributes significantly to the total household
       disposable income. Income from agriculture is volatile andhouseholdsrely on
       temporary employment inneighboring estate f m s , urbancenters, andevenin
       neighboring countries. One ofthe major challenges for Malawi i s to ease the pressure
       onoverpopulated andover cultivated landandpromote conservation farming

                                       27


practices and small-scale irrigationthat will raiseproductivity, andsupport other
sources oflivelihood such as non-farm ruralincome.

Eflective managementof a strategicgrain reserve requires the management of both
in-kind and cash resources: One o fthe triggers ofthe food shortagein2002 was the
mismanagementofthe Strategic Grain Reserve. The government has since entrusted
the buyingandselling authority ofthe Strategic GrainReserveto an autonomous
body comprisingrepresentativesofthe government, private sector, andbilateral aid
agencies. This is amove inthe rightdirection. However, Malawi should also continue
to use the fbtures market bykeepingasidecashto complement the minimumphysical
reserve. Promotingprivate sector participation ingraintrading and imports along
with access to credit and foreign exchange would facilitate timely responsesto food
shortages.

Toaddressfood insecurirg,a regional approach whichpromotes regional trade is
needed: The SouthernAfrican statesbelongto SADC and sharemanycommon
development challenges-food insecurity, HIV and AIDS, weak Governance, and
recurrentnatural disasters. Inorder to meet their individual food security objectives,
the member states frequentlyput trade barriers inplace, despite their commitment to
free trade agreedunder the Common Market for EastandSouthern Africa
(COMESA). However, giventhe porous borders especially o f landlockedcountries
likeMalawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, affectedpopulations arebenefiting from the
growth ofinformalcross border trade especially infood. The humantoll o f the
recurrent food crisis inMalawiwould have beenmuchhigher hadit not been for
crossborder mobility o f labor andgoods. The NewPartnership for Africa's
Development-supported framework for promoting food security, one o fthe Pillarso f
the ComprehensiveAfrica AgriculturalDevelopment Program, i s a suitable forum to
pursuethe regional approachto food security.

 Annex C. Poverty Profiles and Strategies

 The Poor-Who, Why, andWhere
 1.      About 56 percento fthe ruralpopulation and25 percent ofthe urbanlive below the
 povertyline. Regional andgender variations inthe incidenceo fpovertydo not appearto be
 significant. The incidence o fpoverty inSouthernRegion i s 68 percent comparedto 63
 percent inthe Central Region and63 percentinthe NorthernRegion. Poor householdsin
 Malawi tendto be larger thanthe non-poor householdsandhave a higher number o fwomen
 andchildren. Female-headedhouseholdsaccount for about 30 percent o fallthe households
 andthey aremore likelyto bepoor thanthe male-headedhouseholds.

2.       Income distribution is highlyunequalinMalawi. The Gini coefficient for income is                 .
 0.88 for urbanareas and0.72 for rural areas andthe Gini coefficient for expenditureis 0.57
 for urbanareas and0.44 for rural areas. The 2005 M S figures indicate that there hasbeenno
significant progressinreducingpoverty over the past 10years. Ifthe current trendcontinues,
Malawiis unlikelyto achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) andMalawi
Poverty ReductionandStrategyPaper (MPRSP) target o fhalvingextreme povertyby 2015.

3.       A recent AfkicanDevelopment Bank(2005) report concluded that poverty inMalawi
is the result o f severalconstraints: (i)rapidenvironmental degradation andlimited access to
land; (ii) levels ofeducation, poorhealthstatus, HrVandAIDS, lack o foff-farm
           low
employment, persistent highpopulation growth, gender inequality; and(iii)            limitedaccessto
credit. All o fthese factors are exacerbatedbyweak institutional capacity, a distorted policy
environment, a weak incentive structure, and low levels o feconomic infrastructure and social
capital. Moreover, manyruralhouseholdswho live inabsolutepoverty are vulnerable to.
externalshocks andare chronically food insecure. The landless ruralpopulation, HIV and
A I D S orphans, female-headedhouseholds, andthe elderly are the most vulnerable segment
ofthe population.

HouseholdCopingStrategies

4.      The recent IntegratedHousehold Surveys reportedthat the majority o fhouseholds
own very few assets, implyingthat there is little to sell duringa crisis. Where poverty is
deep, there is virtually no scope for normal coping mechanismsthat promote resilience.
Therefore, a food insecurehouseholdwill attempt to copebyreducing food consumption-
cutting the number o fmeals a day from three to either two or one. The wealthier households
sell assets and livestock while the poorer households rely on "piece-work" or gunyu' labor.
The reliance ongunyu labor also deepens poverty as household labor is diverted from the
family's ownplot at criticalplantingandweeding seasons. Intimes o fcrisis, the supply o f
potentialgunyu labor exceedsdemandanddepresseswage rates andexacerbatespoverty.

GovernmentPoverty ReductionStrategies

6.      Inthe 1970s,Malawiexperiencedrelativelybetter economicgrowth thaninthe
recentpast, but that growth was mainlyattributable to estate andlarge-scale agriculture and
didnotbenefit thepoor. Inthe 1980s, StructuralAdjustment Programs(SAPS)achieved
relative economic stability, but that was not translated into broad-basedeconomic growth,
due to lacko fnational ownership andpoverty focus. Inthe 199Os, there were periods of
equitable growth driven by the smallholder agricultural sector, but this growthwas not
sustaineddueto external shocks andfrequent policyreversals.

7.      In2002, theMalawiPovertyReductionStrategy Paper(MPRSP) was formulatedto
combat severepoverty. The home-grownpro-poor strategy aimed at producing sustainable
economic growthand empoweringthe poor. The strategy had four pillars. Two of these
pillarswere: PillarI SustainablePro-poor Economic Growth, andPillarI11-Improvingthe
                      -
Quality o f Life for the MostVulnerable.

8.      Regardingthe implementation andachievementso fMPRSP, the Government Annual
ProgressReports (2002/03,2003/04 and2004/05) andthe World Bank and IMFintheir
MPRSP-ProgressReport andthe 2003/04 Joint StaffAssessment (JSA) have concluded that          .
nearly all the macroeconomic targets, including those for pro-poor expenditures, were not
achieved. Malawi failed to meet the crop production targets for maize andkeycashcrops,
andtheplannedirrigation developmentswere 50percentbelow the PRSPtarget. The IMF-
World BankJSA furthernotedthat virtually no progress was made inimplementingthe
MPRSP due to weak fiscal mismanagementthat ledto a reduced levelo fbudgetary
resources. Inlight ofthese shortcomings and lessons learned fiom implementing the MPRSP
andto reflect the Government's 2020Visiondocument andthe commitment to the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the new Malawi GrowthandDevelopment
Strategy (MGDS) documentcovering the period 2006-2011hasbeen launched. The MGDS
has beenformulated with awide participatory approach, whichreinforces ownership and
accountability. Since the rural space harbors the majority o fthe poor, the MGDS has
accordedhighpriorityto the development ofthe agriculture sector andthe attainment o f food
security as critical to poverty reduction.

 Annex D. Structure of and Selected Issues inAgriculture

 STRUCTURE OFAGRICULTURE SECTOR

 1.       The agricultural sector inMalawi istraditionally dualistic, comprising smallholder
 andestatesubsectors. The two subsectorshavebeendelineatedbydifferent legal and
 institutional rulesregarding crop production, marketing arrangements, pricing, and land
 tenure. The smallholder subsectori s the largest inMalawi's agrarian economy. The subsector
 comprisesthe majority o fthe ruralpopulationworking on small landholdings mostly under
 customary landtenure system.

 2.       Therapidincreaseinpopulation hasresultedinreducedlandholding per farm family.
 It is estimatedthat 1.8 million smallholder farm families cultivate 1.8 millionhectaresof
 land, andapproximately 72percent cultivate anaverageoflessthan 1.O hectare. The
 subsector is mainly subsistence, producing food crops and cashcrops such as groundnuts and
burleytobacco.

3.       The estatesubsectoraccounts for about 10percent ofthe total landarea, which is
mainly under freehold or leaseholdtenure. The maincashcrops grown bythe estate
subsector are tobacco, tea, andsugarcane (20 percent each). Overall, the estate subsector
generates 80 percentofthe country's foreign exchangeearnings. According to the Ministry
ofAgriculture andFoodSecurity, however, the smallholder tobacco growers haveincreased
innumber inthepastdecade dueto structural changesinthe tobaccoproduction subsectors.
The smallholders now produce about 70 percent o fthis cashcrop, dominated byburley
tobacco, while the estates havebecome lessviable andunable to compete with the
smallholder farmers as world tobacco prices have beensharplydeclining. Iti s also reported
that as many as 40-45 percentof estates are believedto have left the sector inthe past decade
(Annual Economic Report, 2005).

4.       The total potentialirrigable landinMalawi is estimatedat about 400,000 hectaresof
which the estate andsmallholders irrigate 29,000 haandan additional 62,000 hais irrigated
onwetlands. About 75 percent ofthe total irrigated area is controlled bythe estate sector
growing industrial crops. Smallholder irrigated agriculture is limitedmainly dueto lack o f
access to credit facilities. Table 1presents the distribution o firrigated areas inMalawi.

5.       With lessthan 10percent ofthe irrigable landdeveloped, there is avast potential to
develop the irrigated agriculture andpromote highvalue crops, double cropping, ease the
landpressure, andsubsequentlymitigate food crises dueto recurrent drought. Despite the
transfer o fthe Irrigation Departmentto the Ministryo fIrrigationandWater Development,

AnnexD                                           38


the Ministry ofAgriculture andFoodSecuritycontinues to promoteirrigation development.
Inthe2006,the government has startedimplementationo fa $50millionWorldBank-
assisted irrigation-based agriculturalproductivity enhancement project. The project would
rehabilitateexisting government-owned irrigation schemes anddevelop new irrigation
perimeters on a total areao f about 2,800 hawith a view to transferring management to water
user associations, includingthe provision of demand-driven advisory services.

Selected Issues

6.      The agriculture sector faces policy, institutional, technical andresource constraints.
Exogenous risks such as droughts andfloods are also inherent to agriculture inMalawi.
Variousreformsthat havebeenimplementedinthepast haveproducedmixedresults. The
overallweak performance o fthe sector inthe last five years has been compoundedby the
recurrent droughts. Programs designedto enhance agricultural productivity anchored on
fertilizer and seed subsidies and provision o ftechnical services have not been successful and
are not fiscally sustainable.

7.      Maize Yields are Low: Malawi i s one o fthe highestper capita consumer o fmaize in
Africawith about 69 percent of caloric intake per day coming from the crop. Food security
analysis for the country has been carriedout withreference to this crop. However,
investments inresearch and extension to improvemaize yields have beenlimited and
ineffective. As a result, maize yields (Figure 1) havebeendeclining since 1989/99.A number
o f factors or constraints are associated with this trend.

8.      Low application o fimprovedtechnologies, notably fertilizer and hybridseed, and
weak provisiono ftechnical services are the leadingyield determinants. Due to rising
populationpressure, soil fertility i s declining andlanddegradation is expanding. Limited
access to credit bythe majority o f smallholder farmers, poorroadinfi-astructure and the
recurrent droughts also explainthe low maize yields inMalawi. The GOM's principalpolicy
instrumentto boost agricultural development ingeneral and maizeproduction inparticular
has beeninput subsidies--fertilizer and seeds, and ADMARC'Sintervention inmaize

                                                39                                      Annex D


 markets.The fiscal impact oftheseprograms hasbeensubstantial. Since 1998, the
 Governmenthas experimentedwith three inputsubsidyprograms with mixedresults. While
 the USP was credited with the bumper crops o f 1999/2000,maize yields since 2001have
 beendeclining despite the continued input subsidyprograms. The unpredictability and
 frequent changesofGOMsupportprogramshavenot beenconducive to long-term
 investment decisions. Attempts to reform ADMARC to operatewithout budget support and
 provide effective marketoutlets to smallholder maizeproducershavebeenprotracted.

 9.      Resources for AgricultureareInadequate:Annual expenditures for the agricultural
 sectorhavestagnatedat lessthan 10percent o fthe total government budget for the past 5
 years. The 2006 Public SectorInvestment Program (PSIP) document shows that from the
 overall government developmentprogram expenditure (MK56 billion), the Ministry o f
 Agriculture hasbeenallocatedonly 7.3 percent, outpacedbyNationalRoadsAuthority (18.4
percent), National AIDS Commission (17.5 percent), Ministryo fEducation (9.8 percent),
 andMinistryofHealth(8.6 percent). The budget share o fthe MinistryofAgriculture is much
 lower when comparedto the contribution ofthe sector to the country's economy. The
ministry accordshighpriorityto smallholder fanners andvulnerable groups inrural areas
when distributing its limitedbudget amongmanycompeting demands. For the past 15 years,
most ofthe allocated budget was not usedfor agricultural development programs, but rather,
for administration and subsidies.Often field offices are not well equipped and becauseo f
limitedtransport facilities are unableto provide services to farmers.

10.      Expenditure on administration andextensionhas stagnatedwhile that for researchhas
declined (Table 2). In2000, Malawi's development partners hadjointly recommendedthat
the government shift expenditures from administration (which also includes subsidies, food
reserve, andoverheads) to extensionandresearch, which are the priority mandateso fthe
ministry. This situation is compoundedbythe ever-rising administrative costs ofsuch
programs at the expense of other priorityprograms. The decline o f researchwas due to the
closure in 1999o fthe World Bank-assistedAgriculture Services Project (ASP) that was the
major source of funding for researchactivities under the development budget.

11.      For the past 10years, the flow o ffunds to the sector hasbeen unstable, largelydue to
erratic and low levels of aid inflows. According to the Malawi Justice Network, out o fthe
expectedMK16 billion ofdonor support in2002/03, only 56 percent was disbursed because

the government didnot comply with agreedloancovenantsandbecauseo f slow project
implementation.

Private Sector Input Providers Get Mixed Signals

12.      Despite efforts to improve the enabling environment for private sector development,
the businessclimate is generally not conducive to vibrant private sector investment. The
private sectorinMalawihasbeenhamperedby a numberofconstraints, including
macroeconomic instability, hightransport costs, highinterest rates, andlimitedlending
facilities. The tax regimeimposesa significant burdenon anarrow formal private sector and
underminesthe incentives for entrepreneurship. Malawiis largelyuncompetitive inthe
regional market, with limitedtransport infrastructure-including      poor access to ports, limited
air links andrailcapacity, andpoor roads. Utilities, including electricity, water, and
communications, are unreliable and expensive. The HIV AND AIDS pandemic hashada
major impact on rivate sector development, through lossesof skilled technical and
managerial staff. P

13.      Mistrust inthe private sector's ability to deliver criticalservices inthe agriculture
sector limitsthe expansionofprivate sector participation inkey service deliveries. Maize,
tobacco, fertilizer, andsugar account for over $200millioninmarket value, but only
fertilizer hasbeenpartially characterizedby a competitive private sector presence. The
fertilizer market was liberalized over 10years ago. Since then ahealthy competitive private
sector hasdevelopedinthe import, local production, anddistribution o f fertilizer. Various
reports indicate that the competitionhasbrought about lower prices andmore retail outlets in
rural areas andfertilizer consumptionhas increased fiom an average o f 125,000 tons (1991-
93) to anaverage of200,000 metric tons (2002-04).

14.      The private sector is very cautious to commit long-term investments due to
government's protracted intervention inthe maize market. Sugar is characterized by a
monopoly from Illovo andthere is anoligopoly inthe tobacco auction market, where there
are only two mainplayers (inthe local andworld markets).

 Annex E. Toward anAgricultural Sector Strategy

 1.       PolicyPapersAbound-The               government has numerous agricultural
developmentandnaturalresourcemanagementpolicies and strategiesrelatedto
technology development andtransfer, andcapacity development to increase
agriculture production andproductivity. The majorityo f government efforts have
beento support capacity ofthe smallholder farmers to produce enoughfor their own
consumption and for export market. However, these strategyandpolicy
announcementsare short on action dueto lack ofpoliticalcommitment andweak
institutional capacity.

2.        StrategicAgenda-In 2005, the Malawi Strategic Agenda for Economic
Development andFood Security identifiedthe following key sectoral andcross
sectoral issues: inadequateinstitutional capacity; weak intra- andintersectoral
linkages; poor infrastructure (road network, communication facilities, microfinance
institutions, markets); poor access to agricultural inputs, low application rate o f
improvedtechnologies, and landdegradation, includingthe expanding cultivation of
marginallands.23

3.        The New Agricultural PolicyFramework-In 2006 theMinistryo f
Agriculture andFoodSecurity (MOMS) proposedanAgricultural PolicyFramework
to synthesizeandconsolidate 45 existingpolicy documents developedduringthe past
several years by sectoralministries. MOFAS is takingthe lead inharmonizing the
existing agriculture policy documentsinto one action-oriented agriculture policy
framework andwill remove any overlaps or contradictions andestablishsynergies.
Aninter-ministerialworking group hasidentified andendorsedseveralpolicyareas at
macro, sector, or subsectorlevels affecting the agriculture sector. The agriculture
policy framework draws heavily on the food andnutritionpolicypaper andi s being
fiamedalongthe same lines as the MGbS,24MaZuwiand theMDGs,~~ Vision                  and
2020.26

4.       The New Agricultural Policy objective is to promote andfacilitate agricultural
productivity to ensure food security, increasedincomes andcreation o f employment
opportunities. The objectives and strategies are organized around four mainthemes or
aspects of food security: sustainablefood availability, access to food, utilization, and
stability infood andnutritionavailability andaccess. Food availability refers to food

that is sufficient inappropriatequantities andqualities suppliedthroughdomestic
production and/or imports (including food        Furthermore, the policy specifies
the factorsdeterminingfood availability including: (i) available food stocks of the
Malawi six food groups at farm level, commercial, and government stocks; (ii)   the
volume and stability ofproduction (subsistence andmarket oriented); and(iii)   food
imports (commercial and food aid). To achieve the objectives ofthe Agricultural
Policy Framework, a set o fImplementation Pillarshavebeenidentifiedthat will be
monitored by a Steering Committee, with adequatecoordination mechanisms at
district andnational levels.

5.      The Policywould promote sustainablemanagement and use ofnatural
resources, adaptive researchandeffective extension delivery system, promotionof
value-addition, agribusinessandirrigationdevelopment. The specific food security
strategieswould include: (i)  buildingcommunity-based capacity infoodprocessing
andnutritioneducation; (ii)  empowering communities through diversified income-
generating activities; (iii)supportingwater harvestingtechnologies to increase off-
seasoncrop production; (iv) developing an effective farmer/extension/research
linkage; (v) developing food-processing technologies to expand on ago-based
industryandhouseholdfood availability; (vi) attaining sustainablehousehold and
national food security andimprove nutritionalstatus o f the population; (vii)
conservingthe naturalresourcebase; (viii) generating anddisseminating appropriate
anddemand-driventechnologies; (ix) providingagricultural informationsystemsto
stakeholders; and(x) providing quality control services on agricultural produce.

6.       Partnership: The government andits development partnershave learned
fiom the 2001/02 food crisis that proper consultation andcoordination o f activities
are critical to timely andeffective program formulation andimplementation. Thejoint
work to consolidate the 45 strategyandpolicy documents into a single action oriented
document is an exemplary partnership.A number ofMalawi's development partners,
including the World Bank, haveplayed animportant role inthe formulation o fthe
Agricultural PolicyFramework. Discussions are also under way on apossible Sector-
Wide Approach Program(SWAP), investments, nonlending support, cofinancing,
and/or parallel interventions to achievethe MGDS.

7.       The MGDShasbeenusedas amodelto strengthenpartnership to ensure
alignment andharmonization o fdonor programs. The Bank's proposed activities have
benefited fiom close strategic coordination with development partners (EU, Global
Fundfor HIVANDAIDS, UNICEF, EC, DfID, andGTZ) throughthe development
o fthe MGDS. Somekey strongpartnership features include agricultural and food
security, private sectordevelopment, infiastructure development, health, responseto
HIVAND AIDS, governance, andpublic sectormanagement.TheBankwillalso
continue to support strongpolicyimplementation with development credits andwill
support the Common Approach for Budget Support (CABS) to further integrate
policy dialogue withkeypartners.

                                   fiscal planning andpublic expenditure reform; (iv)
 civil serviceandwage reform; and (iv) emergencyassistance. The 1998 CAS
programwas scatteredacross anumbero f expectedoutcomesthat dilutedthe Bank's
ability to adjust to weak implementationcapacity ofthe strategies. Learningfrom the
previous CAS, the Bank's 2003 CAS was not only aligned to the goals andpriorities
of the government's MPRS o f2002, but also designedto addressthe economic
mismanagement andto prepare for the changes inthe politicalenvironment.28The
2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) hadthree pillars: (i)   strengthen economic
management andaccountability; (ii)    establishaplatformfor long-term sustainable
growth; and(iii)   improve service delivery and strengthen safety nets. The 2003 CAS
focused onpoverty reductionactivities alignedwiththe MPRS goals andobjectives.
According to the World Bank's Malawi CAS Completionreport (2006)' the 2003
CAS was designed as atransitional program to help the government move from a
relatively reactive anddisjointed development program that was already
overstretching capacities, to amore proactive, focused, andintegratedprogram that
would addresskey constraints to growth andpoverty reduction andurgent
developmentissues inMalawi. On agriculture, the 2003 CAS outcome sought to
improve agricultural productivityandrevenuefor bothcash crops (tobacco) and
consumption crops through access to input andoutput markets, as well as land
markets for the smallholder farmers.

9.      Despitethe alignment o fthe 2003 CAS to the MPRS goals andobjectives, as
well as financial andpolicy formulation supports fromthe Bank, agricultural
production andproductivitycontinue to decline, causingfood shortagesandmost
social indicators show worsening conditions inthe country. For example, chronic
malnutrition (44 percent o fpre-school children are stunted-low   height for age),
maternal andchildmortality rates and life expectancycontinue to deteriorate.

10.     The Bank-assistedagricultural sectorprojects that were approved inthe 1990s
havebeenclosedwith unsatisfactory and moderately satisfactory results. Figure 1
presentsthe Bank's agricultural lendingby subsector. An IEGreview ofMay 1998
had also concluded that only 8 of 17IDA agricultural projects (47 percent) were
satisfactorily completed. Five other operationsthat were closed inthe late 1990sand
early 2000 were also rated unsatisfactory. The 2005 Country ProgramAssessment
ratedthe quality ofthe Bank's portfoliomarginally satisfactory and the 2006 IEG
Country Assistance Evaluationratedthe Bank's overall assistanceto the
ruraYagricultura1sector as unsatisfactory. Except for the two active projects
(Community-Based Rural LandDevelopment (FY04, $27million) andIrrigation
RuralLivelihoods andAgriculture Development (FY06, $40 million), the Bank had
Virtually withdrawn from direct lendingto this important sector after the closure o f

the Agricultural Services Project in2001. The failures or unsatisfactory results o f
most agriculturalprojects since 1998 couldbe attributedto a numbero f factors. The
Government, donors andthe Bank collectively didnot addressthe implementation
constraints adequately. The Governmentrecognizes its limitedhumancapital and
implementation capacity. Direct policy dialogue with the secotral ministryhas been
characterized as"ad hoc". The policy reform agenda pursued for the agriculture
sector has been inthe context of an economy-wide adjustment lending without
resource additionality for the sector's priority expenditures. Weak sectoral donor
coordinationhas also resulted ina plethora o f scattered projects with minimal impact
on achievingthe core sectoral objectives.

11.      In2004, theBankpreparedanAgricultural PolicyOptionspaperthat
identifiedfour priority agriculturalissues to be includedunder FIMAG's reform
agenda: (i)  reforming the Ministry o fAgriculture; (ii)  landmanagement; (iii)   food
security, markets, andADMARC; and(iv) reforming the tobacco levies at all levels.
These issues were inputs to the designo fFIMAGprogram. The final design included
a reformpackage for ADMARC, the tobacco sector, and landuse, but didnot include
the reform o f the Ministryo f Agriculture. Progress is slow and uneven on these
selectedkey issues.

12.      Ondecentralizing the Ministry o fAgriculture andFood Security, there is
some progress at the district level that budgetary allocation from the government is
directly transferred to the district assemblies, but, this lacks a functional management
system. The decentralized activities are not functioningproperlybecause of limited
humanresource capacities andbudget constraints or unavailability o f adequate
finances from the central government. A common financing issue is when extension
staffi s assignedto field offices but lack an operating budget to provide services in
farmers' fields.

 13.     To enhance efficient utilizationof agricultural land, the government in
 consultation with stakeholders developed a new landpolicy which was approvedby
 theparliamentin2002. Dueto the sensitivityo flandissues inMalawi, progress in
 implementingthe new market-oriented policy i s slow. The voluntary sellingo f landis
 limited as most estates or those who are willing to sell find the offered prices low. In
 addition, the coverage of landtaxation issue is not comprehensive with respect to tax
 incidence. While most households inMalawi have an income less thanUS$1 per day,
 tax collection from this segment o fthe population seems unlikely. The prospects for
 landconsolidation anddeterring landfragmentation are also bleak. Cooperatives are
 gradually emerging and mayhelp to create viable landsizes for efficient use o f
 available technologies such as irrigationsystems and adoption o f improved farming
 systems. The Bank-assisted FIMAGprogram andthe Community Rural Land
 DevelopmentProjects are facilitating the implementationo f selected aspects o f land
management reforms.

 14.     One issue that has defiedrepeated attempts to reform i s the role o fpublic and
privatesectors inagricultural marketingand trade which are critical to Malawi's food
security objective. ADMARC has beenon the reform agenda for several years. The
Bank has been supporting the agreed reform package under FIMAG. However, while
someprogress has beenmade inredefining and reconstitutingthe role o f ADMARC,
the second and last tranche under FIMAGhas beendisbursed with a waiver on a
pendingactionrelated to the reform ofADMARC.

 15.    Reformingtobacco levies at all levels inthe supply chainwas also a focus
under FIMAG.Inspite of various proposals to cut institutional levies inthe last four
years, the tobacco industryis facing various difficulties such as low production levels,
poor qualities o f tobacco anddeclining prices at auctionfloors. The smallholder
tobacco farmers receive low prices which hardly cover production costs. Key
challenges inthe small holder tobacco subsector include improved marketing
channels, enhancing productionquality tobacco and reviewing the direct and indirect
levies.

16.     A challenge for the government is to mobilize long-term externalassistance
for the new Agricultural Policy Framework, which combines actions onpolicy and
institutionalreforms while investing inprovenhigh-prioritysectoral programs. The
Bankhas also assistedthe GOMto launchapilot Weather-Based Insurance scheme
coveringgroundnut farmers andto access the SouthAfrica Futures Exchange
(SAFEX)for maizepurchases as ex-ante risk management measures. Theresults
fiom these innovativepilots will help Malawi indesigninga combinationo f ex-ante
and ex-post drought mitigationmeasures.

DISTRIBUTION OFEXTERNAL         ASSISTANCE
17.     In2005/06, budget support andhumanitarianaid accounted for nearly40
percent o f external assistance (Figure 2). The World Bank's EmergencyRecovery
Grant (2005/06) is included as humanitariansupport. DfID, the World Bank, the EU,

Annex E                                        46


andNorway are themajor contributors tobudget support. Agriculture andirrigation
andwater supply are receivinglittle hndingfromdonors inspite ofthe government's
effort to reduce dependency onrain-fed agriculture.

18.      The sectoral distribution o f external assistancehas implications for Malawi's
commitment to achieve the MDGunder which agricultural development i s considered
a highpriority. Figure 3 shows the total cost ofMDGactivities, amount o f external
assistance disbursedin2005/06, and the gap that exists for the MGDS' activities for
poverty reduction.

 19.    Therequiredvolume offundingto fhlly implement the MGDSis currently
 estimatedat MK311billion, andthe external resourcesdisbursedhitherto amount to
 aboutMK 52 billion, implyingasignific&t financial gap which couldhinderthe
achievementofthe MGDS.According to the 2006/07 Summary o fExtra-Budgetary
Support to Malawi, some31percent o fexternal assistanceis outside the budget, as
their finances arenot administeredbygovernment ministries, clearly representinga
significant volume o fsupportbeingnot aligned to the government investment
program. Someofthese expendituresmay narrow the financing gap for the MGDS
priorityprogramsbutalsoriskofbeingmisaligned.

20.     The Bank's agricultural assistanceto the MGDS under the draft 2007 CAS
calls for "Improved smallholder agricultural productivityandintegration into agro-
processing." This isrelatedto the MGDS goal o f "Medium term economic growth
throughsmall-scaleagricultural andago-procesding andfood security." The planned
lendingincludes:(i)  Agricultural andFood Security Program (FY08), which will
support agricultural developmentprograms comprisingirrigation, market
development andweather risk mitigation; (ii)   FoodSecurityRural Development
Credit (FYlO), whichwill support expanded agricultural andfood security programs;
and(iii) NationalWater Development I1(FY07), whichwill help to improve water
resourcesmanagementincluding irrigation. The two ongoing andplannedrural-based
operations are expectedto achieve increased smallholder agriculturalproduction and
productivity.

21.     Notwithstanding the overall unsatisfactory outcomes o fthe Bank's assistance
to agriculture, the Bank is determinedto reengage inthe sector. It has strengthenedits
Country Office capacity through staffrecruitment andthe 2007 CASwould be a
suitable vehicle to addressthe core sectoral issues. Toward this end, the Bank
recognizesthat Malawi i s vulnerable to natural disasterrisks-most   notably the
recurrenceofdroughts-and measuresto minimize these risks wouldbe central to the
success ofBankassistance.

 Dear Mr Aklilu,

 Iwould liketo commenton paragraph4.11on page 19of the report.

The NationalDisasterManagement Planhas not yet been completedand approved.The
document is still in draft form. Fundsfrom the EDRPwere used to undertakeconsultations on
the plan which resultedinthe draft NationalDisasterManagementPlan. As the Department
of Povertyand DisasterManagementAffairs was working on finalising the plan, it received
comments from stakeholders.Some indicatedthat the departmentshould havestarted with
developinga Policybeforethe Plan. Others pointedout that the document in its current
format could not be calleda plan because, amongstothers, it had a lot of background
information.This resultedin the departmentputtingthe processof finalising the documenton
hold.

Earlythis month, during a meetingof the NationalDisaster Preparednessand Relief
Committee, members informedthe departmentto finalisethe plan becausea lot of effort went
into it already. They pointedout that after a Disaster Risk ManagementPolicy is developed
the necessaryadditionswould be made to the plan. This decision was made becausethey
realisedthat it would take a longtime to developthe policy. The Departmentwill, therefore,
beworkingto finalise the planwith the involvementof other stakeholders.

Ithought Ishouldinformyouthisbecauseparagragh4.11givestheimpressionthat the Plan
was completed.

Best Regards
