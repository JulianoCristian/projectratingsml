   Recovery Project are to allow the Government maintain key\n            commitments to economic priorities, and investments\n            consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)\n            process, and fulfill immediate obligations to avert famine.\n            Moreover, the project will help restore the productive\n            capability of the populations, and support longer term\n            disaster management by the Government. Activities financed\n            by the project will complement relief efforts, contribute to\n            recovery, facilitate continued progress on key economic\n            priorities and investments, and address the needs of\n            vulnerable groups during this difficult period of crisis.\n            The components include: 1) a quick disbursing assistance to\n            support critical imports, 2) support for expansion of public\n            works programs, and essential social investments, and\n            services to vulnerable groups; and, 3) support for\n            implementation, technical assistance, and studies to\n            facilitate economic recovery. Risks however point at\n            potential delays in the delivery of pledged humanitarian\n            assistance by other donors, and, given the magnitude of the\n            effort and logistical challenges, relief may not be fully\n            successful. To mitigate this, donors have sent a joint task\n            force to coordinate, monitor, and report on pledges,\n            shipments and disbursements. Risk of mismanagement of\n            project funds will be minimized by establishing effective\n            mechanisms to ensure transparent utilization of resources,\n            through strict auditing, and reporting requirements."}, "docdt": "2002-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
