Several lessons were cited including the\n            following: (1) A technically sound emergency operation can\n            only be designed on the basis of sound statistics and\n            credible policy. (2) For emergency recovery loans to be\n            successful there should be no impediments in the\n            institutional arrangements that could slow down\n            disbursements as this would defeat the purpose of the loan.\n            (3) To make the fullest impact, emergency projects have to\n            demonstrate quick wins in the shortest possible time. This\n            entails starting with income transfer programs and quick\n            disbursements that gain momentum rapidly and reach their\n            peak in the first year. (4) Since the emergency operation\n            should focus on impacting the affected target group\n            immediately, it is important that safety nets be given a\n            high priority and be appropriately costed. (5) To be readily\n            responsive to Government in an emergency setting, it is\n            essential that the supervision task team is country office\n            based. (6) To avoid being in a response mode all the time,\n            Government needs to look at ways of developing ex-ante\n            instruments for responding to and managing extreme\n            weather-based shocks to the system. (7) Especially for\n            Emergency Relief Operations, an efficient monitoring and\n            evaluation system needs to be developed and implemented in a\n            very short time. (8) Disbursements based on prior claims and\n            the submission of detailed supporting documents and original\n            receipts are not ideal for Economic Recovery Loans, nor for\n            speedy disbursements, nor suited for an environment where\n            foreign exchange transactions are liberalized."}, "docdt": "2005-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
