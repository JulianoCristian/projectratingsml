FOR\n            ECONOMIC MGMT.,TF029868-PUBLIC EXPENDITURE &\n            FINANCIAL ACOCUNTABILITY (PEFA)", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Capacity Building for\n            Economic Management Project (CBEMP) for the Gambia were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: in countries with very limited public sector\n            capacity, a major overhaul of public sector management\n            systems on multiple fronts simultaneously is likely to\n            require a programmatic approach to lending rather than a\n            single investment loan. The downscaling of initiatives\n            during CBEMP implementation, the additional financing and\n            the extension of the closing date for the project indicate\n            that the full implementation of the project initiatives\n            under a single credit was unrealistic from the beginning.\n            Fundamental reforms in the Government's way of doing\n            business require a long term perspective. When such reforms\n            are attempted under a single project, inevitably it leads to\n            implementation delays and significant risks to\n            sustainability due to the lack of time for the reforms to\n            become entrenched. For this reason, a second CBEMP is\n            currently under preparation in order to sustain and deepen\n            implementation of key initiatives under the first CBEMP.\n            Commitment to the project at the top levels of Government is\n            a necessary but not sufficient condition for timely project\n            implementation. A fully satisfactory outcome ultimately must\n            have the backing of the line managers in charge of\n            implementing the project's components. For CBEMP, it\n            was not until there was a change in the relevant management,\n            several years after the start of the project that\n            substantial work on the Integrated Financial Management\n            Information System (IFMIS) began in earnest. It is\n            recommended that a clear and transparent mechanism be\n            established in advance on how best to address instances of\n            protracted lack of commitment by a beneficiary, including\n            triggers for the removal of the beneficiary through project restructuring."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
