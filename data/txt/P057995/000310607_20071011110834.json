The proposed additional\n            financing would help finance costs associated with some of\n            the original Project activities which have experienced cost\n            overruns. The additional financing would allow the\n            Government to complete ongoing initiatives, thereby\n            contributing towards the achievement o f the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) and the sustainability of the\n            initiatives. Neither an expansion nor a scale-up of the\n            original Project activities are proposed. The specific\n            activities to be financed are the continuation of the: (i)\n            establishment of the Integrated Financial Management\n            Information System (IFMIS) and building local capacity in it\n            s usage; (ii) establishment of the Gambia Revenue Authority\n            (GRA) and strengthening its operational capacity; and (iii)\n            streamlining of customs procedures and upgrading of the\n            Automated System Customs Data Administration Information\n            Technology (IT) System (ASYCUDA). The expected outcomes from\n            these activities are improved public financial management,\n            both for revenue and expenditures. Ongoing Project\n            initiatives will become more effective and sustainable due\n            to strengthened local capacity."}, "docdt": "2007-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
