Project components\n            aim at: 1) strengthening macroeconomic analysis, and policy\n            formulation, through the provision of technical advice to\n            the Department of State for Finance and Economic Affairs\n            (DOSFEA) on economic, and social policies, oversee the\n            economic planning design, participate in the preparation of\n            the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and expenditure\n            reviews, and, promote consistent social, and economic\n            policies, including assistance for budget implementation. To\n            this end, reliable statistics are needed, based on a\n            strengthened data collection on national accounts,\n            employment, expenditure, and social aspects, factors which\n            will be improved by building the Central Statistics\n            Department's capacity, and upgrading statistical\n            analysis to meet international standards; 2) strengthening\n            public resource management, by restructuring the Central\n            Revenue Department (CRD), to improve accountability, and\n            management, and, by setting up a tax payers unit to control\n            revenue collection. CRD's processes will be\n            reengineered, computerization will improve tax assessments,\n            while consulting services, and training will support the\n            review of legal frameworks, public expenditure, and\n            financial management; and, 3) facilitating private sector\n            development, by building capacity, primarily on the legal,\n            financial, and regulatory sectors."}, "docdt": "2001-07-06T00:00:00Z"}
