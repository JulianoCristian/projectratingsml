 (a) reduce the Government's response time for reacting\n            to national food crisis, (b) improve the targeting of food\n            security programs to concentrate on low income groups in\n            drought-prone provinces, and (c) provide a data base and\n            logistic frame for rational decision-making on food security\n            and nutritional issues.  The project will provide assistance\n            for: (1) an institutional focal point within the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Livestock (MOAL) for food security\n            management; (2) an integrated Early Warning Systems, and\n            improving the data gathering and analysis capacity of the\n            MOAL; (3) income earning opportunities in some of the most\n            drought-prone provinces during the dry season and period of\n            low labor demand; (4) income generating activities directed\n            predominantly at women, which is essential for improved\n            nutritional status of children; and (5) a nutrition\n            Information, Education Communication campaign to bring about\n            behavioral changes in child weaning and feading practices."}, "docdt": "1992-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
