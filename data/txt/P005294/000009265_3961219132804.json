Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) a key lesson learned is that deeper and more\n            fundamental changes in the housing delivery system are\n            required to ensure the replicability and economic efficiency\n            of providing formal private sector housing. Such efforts\n            must necessarily have the full commitment and support of the\n            Government at both the national and local levels; 2) private\n            sector involvement in housing delivery increases the number\n            of the stakeholders and decision makers involved in the\n            process. As a result, the \"enabling environment\"\n            within which these stakeholders are required to work becomes\n            increasingly important. The UDP3 Project has helped the\n            Government to cross a major threshold in favor of\n            establishing an enabling approach and to accept less direct\n            control over the ultimate housing outcomes. Housing\n            production under such an enabling approach is generally more\n            incremental and time consuming than direct public sector\n            intervention; 3) both the Bank and the Jordanian Government\n            have learned that they will need to make fundamental changes\n            in their thinking and approach to the delivery of housing\n            for low and moderate income households. The follow-up\n            Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project (HFUSR)\n            based on studies conducted as part of UDP3, will\n            substantially contribute to this process; and 4) the\n            introduction of more democratic processes into community\n            decision making and management dramatically increased the\n            importance of communication and coordination within housing\n            projects between the providers and the users. As communities\n            become increasingly more politically aware and articulate,\n            greater attention needs to be paid to the issues of equity\n            in determining the physical improvements to be made and the\n            costs to be charged."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
