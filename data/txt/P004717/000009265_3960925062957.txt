PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
FOURTH INDUSTRIAL FINANCZ COPLORATION OF THAILAND PROJECT
(Loan 1956-TI)
PREPACZ
This is the I'roject Completion Report (PCR) on l.oan 1956-TH, the
Bank Group's fourth loan to the Industrial Finance Corporaition of Thailand
(IFCT). The loan of US$30.0 million was approved by the Board on March 19,
1981 and was closed on March 29, 1985.
This report reviews the overall institutional dovelopment of IFCT
during the project period and the subprojects financed under the loan, with
the aim of assessing t.. what extent the project objectives were achieved.
The PCR was originally prepared by the Industrial Development and
Finance Division of the Projects Department, East Asia and Pacific Regional
Office, on the basis of a brief draft prepared by IFCT staff and a review of
the project file. Because of the reorganization of the Bank starting in the
summer of 1987, the report's finalization was delayed, and was completed by
Country Department II of the new Asia Region. The repart was sent to IFCT for
their review. Their comments have been taken into account in finalizing the
report and are attached as Annex 19.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COKPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
FOURTE INDUSTRIAL FINANCE CORPORATION OF THAILAND PROJECT
(Loan 1956-TN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.        Loan 1956-TH was the fourth loan given to IFCT aimed at providing
medium and long term finance to private industries with the attendant
objectives of emphasizing better regional dispersal of new industrial
investments and more effective resource mobilization for long term industrial
investment (para 1.4).
2.        Fund utilization of the loan has been satisfactory both in terms of
commitments and disbursements. In the first year, commitments and
disbursements were much faster than established at appraisal (para 3.5).
3.        The Bank financed 47 subprojects and although no specific targets
were set for opezational and economic performance, their overall performance
have been satisfactory. The extent of estimates set for cost overruns,
project completion, employment creation and export generation were reasonably
accomplished. It was the intent at the time of appraisal that lending to
small and medium private industries be dispersed to the areas outside of
Bangkok. This regional dispersion of loans has not been achieved as lending
has been concentrated in the Greater Bangkok and Central regions of the
country (para 3.5). Based on the data provided by IFCT, the financial
performance of the subprojects was also satisfactory. Although IFCT was
required to calculate ERRs for all subprojects financed under the loan, only a
few subprojects had actual ERR data available. As of December, 1986, about
two-thirds of the resulting subloan portfolios appear to be sound while the
remaining third was in arrears (para 3.19).
4.        Institutional progress has been satisfactory.  Project appraisals
and supervision for large-scale projects and the streamlining of small-scale
projects have improved. Economic analysis has been strengthened through
dialogue with the Bank (para 4.5) and the staffing problem caused by a high
turnover of staff in the past has been corrected by an improvement of iFCT's
benefit package (para 4.4).
5.        IFCT's financial position continued to be satisfactory throughout
the period (para 5.5). The arrears situation which has been monitored since
1980 for improvements remains essentially manageable but unchanged (para 5.7).
In the area of resource mobilization, although its exposure in foreign
currency continues to be high, IFCT has diversified into several currencies to
minimize single currency exposure. LFCT has enteted into an agreement with



- vi -
the Government whereby the Government will protect IFCT from any large and
sudden devaluation of the baht (para 5.11).
6.        As to its developmental role, IFCT continues to be the only
institution in Thailand providing long term capital to the private industrial
sector, and the only institution which bases its investment decision primarily
on the project appraisal rather than on collateral. It has played a
pioneering role in the capital market by helping set up the Thai Securities
Exchange and has continued to diversify its activities to improve its
profitability by introducing such mechanisms as mutual funds and leasing.
Finally, it is in the forefront of financial packaging and syndicated
activities (paras 6.1-6.3).
7.        For the most part, the loan to IFCT has been successful beyond
expectations in its impact on the institutional development of IFCT. In
retrospect, the following lessons have been learned from the project:
%a) The objective of increasing the regional/geographical dispersal of
loans was not based on a clearly defined program, and as a result,
this objective was not achieved.
(b)  The Bank should assess more realistically the need for Economic Rate
of Return analysis for small projects. It has been observed that an
ERR analysis has not prdven to be a very useful criterion for
.rojects other than very large investments. In the case of small
projects, the required data are normally not available, time
consuming to gather and uneconomical and, as a result, ERR estimates
by IFCT are computed in a superficial fashion and do not serve their
purpose as a gauge of project merit. ERR analysis should be
required for larger projects only. For smaller projects, partial
economic indicators would be more useful.



PROJECT CONPLITION UtPORT
THAILAND
FOURTB INDUSTRIAL FINANCE CORPORATION OF THAILAND PROJECT
(Loan 1956-Ti)
I  INTRODUCTION
1.1       Over the past quarter century, the industrial sector in Thailand has
contributed significantly to the country's rapid growth and diversification of
economic activity. Industrial growth, spearheaded by manufacturing, averaged
11.6% per year during 1960-70 and 10.4% during 1970-79. This well exceeded
the rate of GDP growth, which averaged 7% in 1970-79. In the early eighties,
the Thai economy was substantially affected by the two oil price shocks and by
the ensuing international economic upheaval. As a result, indus.rial growth
slowed to 5.8% per year in 1980-85. Thailand's exports lost competitiveness
during 1981-84, but due to the devaluation of the baht by 14.8% in November
1984, manufactured exports rose 13% in real terms in 1985. More recently, in
1987, the Thai economy has done very well, spurred by the continued growth in
exports.
1.2       The Thai Government has helped to spur the country's economic growth
through its support to the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT)
which was established in 1959. IFCT is Thailand's only development finance
institution established for the purpose of assisting private sector indlcstrial
and capital market development. It acts as the Government's mechanism for
channelling long term funds to the private &ectir for industrial development
which is vital to the nation's economic growth and overall development. At
present, the Government holds about 26% of total IFCT shares while the rest
are privately owned.  (Annex 1 gives IFCT's present ownership structure.)
Although primarily privately owned, IFCT has always enjoyed a close
relationship with the Government, which has guaranteed some of its borrowings
and alto provided partial protection for a fee against foreign exchange risk
for IFCT's foreign currency borrowings. The Government also provided the bulk
of IFCT's domestic currency resources until the end of 1970s; this dependence
has significantly declined in recent years. The Government expected IFCT to
be a major source of medium- and long-term finance to private industries and
help the Government in achieving its policy objectives, including regional
di.persal of industry and development of export-oriented enterprises. The
Government has two representatives on IFCT's Board of Directors, one is
appointed by the shareholders in its capacity as major shareholder, and the
other appointed directly by the Government according to the Industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand Act. The latter is normaLly elected Chairman of the
Board.



1.3       The Bank's association with IFCT dates back to 1961, bnen the Bank
assisted the Goverraent in defining how IFCT should be reorganized. After
this was successfully carried out, the Bank approved the first IFCT loan
(Ln. 370-TH) of US$2.5 million in March 1964   The second loan (Ln. 992-TH) of
US$12.0 million was approved in May 1974 and the third loan (Ln. 1327-TH) of
US$25.0 million in September 1976. A Project Performance Audit Report
(No. 5054) on the second and third loans was prepared by the Bank in 1984.
That report concluded that the objectives of the two loanR, i.e., resource
transfer to high priority projects and institution building, had generally
been achieved.
1.4       The fourth loan was identified in the context of the Government's
emerging industrial strategy, which emphasized better regional dispersal of
new industrial investment, more employment creation, a shift toward estab-
lishing export-oriented industries, and more effective resource mobilization
for long-term industrial investment. The loan was aimed at achieving these
objectives insofar as they related to IFCT's operations and at meeting part of
IFCT's resource requirements to help it continue its support of the private
industrial sector, regarded by the Government as a priority area. IFCT had a
special role to play in the economy since it was the only specialized
financial institution in Thailand providing long-term capital to private
industry. Its resource allocation performance had been satisfactory and by
the time the fourth loan was made, it had assumed a leadership role in the
country for appraisal of medium and large projects and in arranging financial
packaging for such projects.
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
Objectives
2.1       The project was to continue the institutional development and
strengthening of IFCT. It had two more specific objectives: (a) to encourage
IFCT to emphasize specific priority areas in its resource allocation func-
tions; and (b) to encourage IFCT to be more active in its resource mobiliza-
tion efforts. The specific priority areas in its resource allocation func-
tions were agreed to be: (a) projects located outside the Greater Bangkok and
surrounding areas; (b) smaller rather than very large projects; (c) export-
oriented projects; and (d) labor-intensive projects. In relation to the
second specific objective, i.e., greater emplkasis in resource mobilization, it
was intended that IFCT would make a concerted effort to raise more domestic
currency resources to meet its lending targets and also to diversify its
sources of foreign borrowings.
Description
2.2       The loan proceeds were to be used to finance a part of the to.al
costs of individual subprojects. Disbursements were to be at the rate of 100%
of the foreign exchange cost of directly imported goods and services. 65%
(representing the foreign exchange component) of the cost of goods purchased



from domestic suppliers or manufacturers, and 35% (representing the foreign
exchange component) of civil works. However, for subprojects located more
than 100 km from Bangkok, which were expected to be small-scale with low
foreign exchange component, IFCT could request financing for 100% of its
subloan, up to a maximum of 50% of total subproject costs, including some
local cost financing. All .ubloans amounting to more than US$1 million
required the Bank's prior approval. IFCT's standard lending rate (which was
14.5% when the project was approved) was to apply to all subloans financed
from the Bank loan.
2.3       The project was appraised in March/April 1980 and was approved by
the Board on March 19, 1981. The Loan Agreement was signed on April 15, 1981
and the loan became effective on June 18, 1981.
III. UTILIZATION OF THE BANK LOAN
Rate of Utilization
3.1       Annex 2 gives the schedule of estimated and actual disbursements of
the loan. IFCT's utilization of the loan has been satisfactory. Commitments
and disbursements for the first year were much faster than estimated at
appraisal. The loan closed on the original Loan Closing Date of December 31,
1984, but disbursements were permitted up to March 29, 1985, when the
remaining undisbursed balance of US$110,667.43 was canceled. Overall, the
rates of commitment and disbursements were satisfactory.
Sub2roiect Characteristics
3.2       Data on subprojects financed under the loan are summarized in
Annex 3. The Bank loan financed 47 subprojects, of which 8 were "A" sub-
projects (above the free limit of US$1.0 million). All "A" subprojects were
submitted to the Bank for approval, and only one "A" subproject was approved
without comment. Four "A" subprojects with negative economic rates of return
were discussed extensively in the field and modified based on these
discussions. IFCT has acknowledged that Bank comments on IFCT's calculation
of economic rates of returr. for these projects helped improve staff's
understanding of economic aspects of project appraisal.
3.3       The free limit of USl.O million had beenl increased from US$0.75
million under the previous Ln. 1327-TH in view of the improvement in IFCT's
appraisal standards. To safeguard against the possibility that a major
portion of the loan would be used to finance very large borrowers and to make
just a few large subloans, it was agreed that (a) at least one third of the
proposed loan amount would be used to make subloans not exceeding US$500,000
each and to borrowers with total fixed assets not exceeding US$5 million; and
(b) the size of an individual subloan would not exceed US$5 million. Both
stipulations were adhered to.

3.4       Sectoral Distribution.  The metals industry (30% by value) and
transport/communications (24%) received the majority of Bank loan funds (Annex
4). Chemicals and nonmetallic mineral products, which accounted for 40% of
funds under the third loan, received only 20% under this loan.
3.5       Refional Distribution.  The dominance of the Greater Bangkok and
Central regions continue,' during the project implementation period. Under the
loan, funds allocated to the two regions accounted for 62% by number and 85%
by amount (Annex 4).  These percentages under Ln. 1327-TH were 78% and 71%,
respectively, reflecting the investment opportunities in these regions. The
intended industrial dispersal away from the Greater Bangkok area was, there-
fore, not achieved. The relative lack of success in dispersing funds to
outlying regions is due to the restrictions on the utilization of the loan
proceeds. As most provincial industrialists use machinery and equipment
produced in Thailand or equipment that has already been imported into
Thailand, they are not able to make full use of the Bank's loan. In addition,
both the cost and risk of lending in the regions are higher than in
metropolitan areas thereby necessitating more intense screening of projects.
At that time, IFCT had only 3 regional offices during the loan utilization
period (1981-1984) which could not fully serve provincial lending operations.
IFCT corrected this by establishing Branch Operations and Small Industries
Department and three additional branch offices in order to boost its presence
in the provinces. IFCT now has 6 offices outside Bangkok.
3.6 IFCT attaches the highest level of importance to regional dispersal of
loans and has set the target of approving at least 60% of loans approved each
year in regional areas including the central region which still require
industrial development and infrastructure. From IFCTs incorporation until
1987, loans made to regional borrowers amounted to 68% of all loans approved.
3.7 Diversification of investment from the capital city to the countryside is
therefore very actively pursued by IFCT. The branch and regional offices are
enhanced in terms of efficiency and power to provide better service to
clients. Seminars are regularly organized in order to disseminate
information, knowledge and ideas among provincial industrialists.
Operational and Economic Performance of Sub2rojects
3 8       Annexes 4 to 8 give a consolidated picture of all subproject financ-
_..g and performance. An analysis of some main aspects follow.
3.9       Subloan duration.  Most lending went to medium to long term subloans
with a preponderance of subloans (62% by number and 87% by amount) ranging
between 7 to 11 years. The average duration of the subloans approved under
the loan is estimated at 7 years and 5 months.
3.10      Asset Size and Employment.  At the time of appraisal, s.aere were 13
subprojects whose asset size was up to B 10 million each and 22 with B 50-100
million each; only one subproject had assets over B 100 million. However at
completion, there was an increase in the number of medium-sized borrowers,
particularly those with asset base of B 50-100 million each.



- 5 -
3.11      Project Completion.  Of the 47 subprojects approved under Loan 1956,
14 experienced delays while 8 subprojects were completed before the estimated
completion tlme. There were 2 subprojects whose actual completion time could
not be determined: one subproject was wound up while the other subproject had
no data available because the borrower prepaid his loan obligation in full.
3.12      There were 3 subprojects with delays over 6 months:  one had a
9-month delay because the company encountered techni sl problems with its
water treatment, hence delaying its obtaining of a factory permit; the other
had 13 months delay because the company switched the project from production
of radio cassette recorders to colored TV sets, requiring a certain period of
time for a new feasibility study; while another had 17 months delay due to
delayed procurement of imported machinery and equipment.
3.13      Cost Overruns.  Data on cost overruns are available for each 47 sub-
projects in Annex 4. The cost overruns ranged from 2% to 94% and the average
is 13%. Only 2 subprojects experienced overruns above 50%. One of these was
a subproject for the expansion of a tinplate and tin free steel plant. The
subproject cost was estimated at appraisal at B 860 million but the actual
total cost amounted to B 1,299 million. The cost overrun amounted to 51%.
The reason given was that the company made an investment other than for the
appraised project and the cost of the machinery for that was well over its
estimated cost. The other subproject on which cost overrun exceeded 50% was
for the expansion of an aluminum and tube company. This subproject, too,
expanded the scope of the project beyond what was originally agreed by
undertaking additional construction resulting in a total project cost overrun
of 94%.
3.14      Employment Creation.  IFCT has estimated an incremental employment
for the 47 subprojects at 6,196. Actual figures estimated new jobs totalling
5,333 which does not take into account other subprojects where labor statis-
tics are not available because of early loan settlement or non-submission of
financial statements. Data on individual incremental employment and cost per
job per sroject appear in Annex 4.
3.15      Exoort Feature.  Loan 1956 was designed to contribute to export
earnings of the country by financing projects which generate significant
export sales. Export-oriented projects were defined as those projects
exporting over 50% of their output. IFCT has developed a program to boost its
lending to export-oriented projects by itensifying project promotion and
development and adopting a sectoral approach in identifying these projects.
Sixteen of the 47 subprojects were considered as export oriented; estimated
export sales from these 16 subprojects amounted to B 2,666 million. However,
only B 1,263 million in export sales were realized from 15 subprojects.
Annex 5 gives a detailed account of the export performance of these
subprojects.
3.16      Financial Performance.  Of the 33 subprojects under the loan for
which data are available, 17 were profitable while the remaining 16
subprojects sustained losses, with the worst case at 151% of equity. Four
subprojects turned a profit equal to or better than the appraisal estimates



- 6 -
and only 7 subproiects showed a return of at least 15% to 20% on networth. On
the average, act .l results were off by about 22% from IFCT estimates.  With
regard to the 4'nancial rate of return, 6 subprojects (from 22 subprojects for
which FRR was zomputed) had return equal to or better than estimated at
appraisal. Later and more complete data (from IFCT's quarterly report for the
period ended June 30, 1987) showed that there were 37 subprojects (from 46
subprojects computed) with financial rate of return equal to or better than
estimates.
3.17      A review of the financial ratios show a mix of subprojects with less
than half being liquid and most being highly leveraged (2 cases show a debt
equity ratio of 17 and 18 to 1). Annex 8 gives the financial performance of
each subproject financed under the loan.
3.18      Economic Rate of Return.  IFCT was required to calculate ERRs for
nearly all subprojects financed under the loan. However, there are only 8
subprojects for which actual ERR data are available (Annex 7). Of these there
were only 3 subprojects with ERRs below 10%. Only 2 subprojects (of the ones
for which data is available) showed a gap between estimated and actual
figures. One was for a container lines company which had an estimated ERR of
24% but an actual figure of 19% and the other was for a tinplate company with
estimated ERR at 10% but had an actual ERR of 5%. (The company's factory has
been closed since August 1984.)
Other Features
3.19      Capacity Utilization.  All 47 subprojects had been estimated to
operate at full or nearly full capacity ratios. Actual figures showed only 4
out of 29 subprojects with utilization rates below 50%. The actual average
capacity utilization is estimated at around 70% for the subprojects for which
data were available. Two subprojects closed their operations in 1984. Both
were related companies in the vegetable oil business and total subloans to
these companies amounted to $900,000.
3.20      Foreign Exchange Savings.  There was an estimated foreign exchange
savings from 12 subprojects of about B 2,574 million. Actual savings realized
from the 5 subprojects for which data were available amounted to only B 695
million. Comparison of actual with the original estimate is not meaningful
because of inadequate data.
3.21      Ouality of Subloan Portfolio.  Total outstanding in respect of the
47 subprojects amounted to B 660 million as of December 31, 1986, of which 79%
were in current status, 13% (B 87 million) were in arrears (of which 97% were
in arrears for over 6 months) and 8% were either partially or fully prepaid.
In terms of number of subprojects, IFCT has rescheduled 4 subloans; 13 loans
were in arrears, 10 of which were in arrears for over 6 months. Six subloans
have been fully repaid while 2 subloans have been partially prepaid. Details
are given in Annex 9.
3.22      Two subloans account for 3/4 of total arrearages of over 6 months.
Total arrearages of these 2 subloans amount to B 53 million or 62% of the
total. One of them, with a total arrearage of B 34 million (40% of total



arrearages) was experiencing technical and production difficulties which
affected its financial condition. This subloan rescheduled its loan in 1984.
The other subloan is actually 2 subprojects which closed their operations in
August 1984. Both are related companies in the vegetable oil business and
total Bank loans to them amount to $900,000. As of year-end, combined IFCT's
total exposure to these subprojects reached B 38.8 million. Their arrearages
total B 19 million (220 of outstanding).
3.23      IFCT recognized as early as 1981 the seriousness of the arrears
problem and developed an action program to deal with it. This program
envisaged making more conservative appraisal estimates, tighter equity
requirement safeguards, and itensification of supervision of problem projects.
There is no specific information on how effective this program has been but
the portfolio affected by arrears as a percentage of total portfolio declined
somewhat in subsequent years and was in the range of 8% to 10% during 1983-86.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Manavement
4.1       Board of Directors.  IFCT has a ten-member Board which is chaired by
a former Minister of Finance and includes IFCT's President. Two Board members
represent foreign shareholders, who, at the end of 1986, held 40% of total
shares.  Eight of the ten members .ave a finance/banking background while the
remaining two represent the manufacturing sector. The Board meets monthly to
review policv matters and to approve loans.
4.2       Executive Committee.  IFCT's Executive Committee comprises four
Board members including IFCT's Chairman -id the President. In order to
decentralize loan decision making to the next level of management and provide
more efficient service to clients, there have been changes in authorizations
regarding loan approvals. The Board of Directors' loan authorization
increased from B 20 million or more to B 50 million or more, the Executive
Committees, from B 5 million-B 20 million to B 20 million-B 50 milion and th4
President's from up to B 5 million to B 20 million per project.
4.3       The President, who assumed his post in 1979, is responsible for day-
to-day management. He is now assisted by a Senior Executive Vice President
and three Executive Vice Presidents responsible for operations, financial
management, and general administration, respectively. At the time the loan
was made, the Bank suggested that IFCT establish an Engineering Department,
and although this did not materialize, a post for an Engineering Adviser was
established.
Staffing
4.4       IFCT's staff increased from 352 in 1981 to 556 in 1986 as operations
grew. Much of this increase was in professional staff (from 210 to 399 for
the same period).  Despite the increase, sta:2 turnover, which was a problem
in 1980, subsided considerably from 7.8% in 1981 to 4.2% in 1986, thanks to
the improvement of IFCT's benefit package. Details of IFCT's staffing are
given in Annex 10.



Procedures and Standard.
4.5       ProJect Apraisal.  IFCT's capability to carry out project
appraisals remains satisfactory. As a development finance institution, IFCT's
main criterion for selecting projects is the soundness of the proposed project
rather than collateral. IFCT procedures for undertaking economic analysis of
projects have been strengthened through dialogue with the Bank. For small-
scale industry projects, IFCT has streamlined its appraisal procedures to cut
down the processing time.
4.6       Project Sugervision.  As the number of problem customers increased,
the supervision of projects has been strengthened. Special attention has been
given to problem projects. IFCT has systematic classification and reappraisal
procedures for problem projects, and monthly reports are prepared to monitor
the progress of these projects.
4.7        rocurement.  IFCT has tried to ensure that appropriate goods are
procured at the best possible price. For the first time under the Bank loans,
one subproject procured goods through international bidding, as the cost of
goods was more than US$400,000. Limited competitive bidding was most commonly
used and accounted for 53% (by value) of total costs of goods procured under
the loan. The proprietary method was used for 34% of total procurements,
decreasing considerably from 61% under Loan 1327-TH. Details are given in
Annex 11.
4.8       Interest Rate.  A historical record of interest rates charged by
IFCT appears in Annex 12. For comparison purposes, interest rate structure
for Thailand during 1970-86 is given in Annex 13. The interest rate structure
has been steadily dropping from 1980-86. A significant change related to the
rates for foreign currency deposits which were pegged at 12% between 1970-75
but since 1980 have been quoted on a floating rate bases. Rates on medium and
short term time deposits, savings deposits, loans and overdrafts, call loans
and loans obtained from the Bank of Thailand have declined from a range of
8%-19% to 5.5%-15%.
4.9       During the project implementation period, IFCT's interest rates were
generally slightly lower than those changed by the commercial banks. It was a
period during which inflation had flared up in Thailand although by
international standards it was quite low. Given the very low inflation rates
in Thailand historically, borrowers were very reluctant ;n borrow long term
from IFCT at what they considered to be unsustainable high and fixed rates.
4.li        Therefore, IFCT, to remain competitive with a liquid banking
sector had to change slightly lower rates. The costs involved, including time
cost, in project based lending involving detailed appraisals was also a
factor. Nevertheless IFCT's rates remained positive in real terms.
4.11      IFCT reviews its interest rate periodically as required under the
Loan Agreement. In order to be competitive, IFCT has historically pegged its
interest rates for medium and long terms loans at slightly lower than the
rates charged by commercial banks for short term loans. The reason for this
is IFCT's desire to entice (1) borrowers not familiar with project appraisal



procedures (which require full disclosures, longer processing time and
continuous supervision throughout the life of the loan), and (2) borrowers,
who in anticipation of lower inflation rates, would not accept long term loans
at higher interest rates, particularly since coiercial banks traditionally
roll-over short term loans as a matter of course. However, even though IFCT's
interest rates are below the prime rate and have generally been lower than the
rates charged by the comercial banks to their prime customers, IFCT's rates
have remained positive in real terms.
V. OEERAIONALP ORKNE
O2erational Performance
5.1       Loan Ogerations.  IFCT's loans may be in either local or foreign
currency. Although the baht is freely convertible, IFCT attempts to match the
currencies of disbursement with those of its resources. As shown in Annex 14,
on a yearly basis, actual approvals have substantially exceeded projections
made at the time of loan appraisal.  Actual loan approvals increased from
B 1,028 million in 1980 to B 2,211 million in 1984, which was the last year
for which the appraisal report made projections. In 1985, loan approvals
reached an all time peak of B 3,007 million before falling substantially to
B 1,450 million in 1986, because of excess liquidity in the financial system.
Foreign currency loans have always exceeded domestic currency loans. IFCT
has, historically, found easier to raise funds in foreign currencies, from
official as well as private capital market, than in domestic currency. In
more recent years, the picture is changing, e.g., in 1986, IFCT raised B 600
million by issuing bonds in the domestic market.
5.2       Guarantee Ogerations.  IFCT's guarantee operations relate largely to
letters of credit opened on behalf of clients importing machinery and
equipment with the proceeds of IFCT loans.
5.3       In 1984, IFCT established the Small Industry Credit Guarantee Fund
(SICGF) to provide guarantees to small-scale projects without sufficient
collateral. The scheme was established mainly to assist collateral short
borrowers and operated with an initial capital fund of B 200 million
contributed as follows: GOT (B 100 million), IFCT (B20 million), Krung Thai
Bank (B 20 million) and 15 commercial banks (B 60 million). The SICGF, which
operated in 1985, granted loans of B 200,000 to B 5 million each to eligible
small scale enterprises or those firms having 'ixed assets of B 10 million or
less. As of end 1986, SICGF outstandings amoui ted to B 8.4 million. Since
SICGF is an independent legal entity, IFCT's exposure is limited to the extent
of its investment in its capital.
5.4       Equitv Investment Ooerations.  IFCT makes equity investments to help
alleviate prospective investors' equity capital shortage and to generate
confidence in the enterprise. The equity portfolio increased from B 115
million in 1979 to B 469 million in 1986, but accounted for only 3% of total
assets.



- 10 -
Financial Performance
5.5       Financial Position.  A comparison of IFCT's financial statements and
ratios for 1980-86 with those forecast at appraisal for 1980-84 is given in
Annex 15. IFCT's financial position has been satisfactory throughout the
paiiod. As of *nd-1984, total assets amounted to B 10,867 million (US$460
million) showing a substantial average annual growth of 27% since 1980. Total
assets were 30% higher than the projection due largely to a substantial growth
in 1984. Of IFCT's total assets at end-1984, 72% were financed by long-term
debt (65% by foreign currency), 16% by equity and 12% by current liabilities.
Since 1984, IFCT's assets have grown further, to B 17,916 million at the end
ef 1986. At end-1986, foreign currency debts accounted for 67%. IFCT's paid-
in capital amounted to B 1,000 million in 1984 and to B 1,300 million in 1986
compared with B 400 million in 1980. Reserve and retained earnings also
increased from B 324 million in 1984 to B 782 million in 1984. The long-term
debt to equity ratio was 4.4 in 1980, 4.5 in 1984, and 5.8 in 1986, well below
the covernanted limit of 8:1. The total debt to equity ratio increased from
4.7 in 1980 to 5.1 in 1984, and 6.5 in 1986. IFCT's current ratio improved
from 2.6 in 1980 to 3.6 in 1984 and further to 5.9 in 1986.
5.6       Profitability.  IFCT's projected and actual audited income state-
ments for 1980-86 are given in Annex 16. Since 1981, interest on loans has
been consistently lower than projected at the appraisal time; however, due to
the increase of interest on temporary investments since 1982, gross income has
been higher than was projected. IFCT's administrative expenses as a percent-
age of average total assets have not exceeded 1.3%. Net income as a
percentage of average total assets ranged from 1.8% (in 1986) to 3.1% (in
1985) and is satisfactory. During the project period, IFCT paid out dividends
every year.
5.7       Portfolio Ouality.  At appraisal, IFCT prepared a plan to reduce its
arrears. The plan had three elements: preventive action, more intensive
supervision and specific actions for loans already in default. At present,
the arrears situation is manageable but has not improved, as the following
table indicates (details are given in Annex 17).



- 11 -
1980      1983        1986
Total loan arrears
(B million)                                 274        392         619
Arrears as percentage
of outstanding portfolio                   8.0%       7.6%        7.8%
Percentage of number of
clients in default                        25.8%      27.3%       30.1%
Percentage of portfolio
affected by arrears                       14.9%      21.1%       20.7%
At end-1986, 30.1% of all IFCT clients were in arrears, with overdue payments
of 7.8% of the total loan portfolio; 91% of that amount had been in arrears
for more than a year.
5.8       According to IFCT, to address this recurring problem, it has ir.
place 3 action plans aimed at scaling down loans in arrears as follows:   (1)
Preventive Action: At appraisal, the projects are conservatively analyzed and
during loan supervision, the projects are closely followed-up and monitored
with regards to the early warning signals. (2) Ouick Action: Seriously
ailing projects are transferred to the Legal office for further legal action.
Decision-making at this stage is prompt and timely to avoid any damage to the
collateral security. However, legal proceedings are normally complicated with
several steps which takes 2-3 years or more on average. (3) Specific Action:
To assist in coping with problems facing projects which still have a bright
future, a special loan unit in the Loan Operations Department was set up.
IFCT staff participate directly in the business operation and serve as an
adviser to the problem company. In addition, IFCT sends staff members as
representatrives in the company's Board of Directors and Executive Committees
as well. Such assistance takes time, depending on the seriousness of the
problems. It takes more than 2 years before IFCT can assess the problem and
find ways to restructure the company's management and operations. One of the
obstacles which hinder IFCT from tackling the client's problems quickly is the
limited number of IFCT experienced and efficient staff. IFCT has therefore,
given more importance to this matter and has tried to build more working
teams. IFCT has already succeeded in turning around several problem clients.
Provisions
5.9       As of end-1984, reserves and retained earnings as a percent of the
outstanding portfolio reached 15.1% as compared with the projected 14%. In
addition, B 215 million (42% of outstandings) were set aside as provisions for
doubtful accounts. This is considered by the external auditors as adequate,
given the current loan arrears.



- 12 -
Audit
5.10      IFCT's account has been audited by independent auditors, and the
audit reports have been unqualified during 1980-86.
Resource Mobilization
5.11      Details of IFCT's borrowings are given in Annex 18.  IFCT succeeded
in mobilizing resources over the period 1980-84, allowing total resources to
increase at 27% p.a. and enabling the loan portfolio to grow at 17% p.a.
However, this was largely achieved by mobilization of foreign currencies.
Total long-term borrowing, which has been a major source of IFCT financing,
amounted to B 6,004 million during 1980-84, while domestic funds amounted to B
560 million or only 9% of the total. IFCT has raised a great deal of funds
abroad in the past due to the lack of capital and financial instruments within
Thailand which would satisfy its needs. Although at appraisal it was realized
that "direct domestic resource mobilization has been and will continue to be
modest ....., the result during the project implementation period should be
considered less than satisfactory. It should be noted however that due to
improvements in the domestic market, IFCT has intensified its domestic
resource mobilization effort and has been quite successful more recently. In
1986, IFCT issued debentures in the local capital market amounting to B 600
million and in the first six months of 1987, it made two new issues totalling
B 675 million.
5.12      IFCT exposure in foreign currency continues to be high with more
than 90% of its outstanding long term debts in foreign currency. IFCT has
tried to minimize the risks of foreign borrowings by diversifying the
currencies of exposure: it has borrowed in Yen, Asian-dollar, DM, Euro-
dollar, and other currencies.  Most of the Yen loans obtained by IFTC carry
low interest rates and have very long maturity periods. The portion of Yen in
IFCT's liability portfolio has increased, compounded by the recent surge of
the Japanese currency in recent times.  IFCT's exposure to the Yen is
therefore high and the Corporation has taken measures to reduce this including
making use of long term cross-currency swaps. It should be noted, also, that
IFCT has an agreement with the Government which protects it from large and
sudden devaluation of local currency.
VI. DEVELOPMENT ROLE OF IFCT
6.1       As a DFI, the most direct and tangible contribution of IFCT has been
to finance developmental projects, thereby creating new activity in the
economy. It has done that on the basis of proper appraisal of project
proposals. It has been mentioned that IFCT is the only major source of medium
and long term finance to private industries. It has provided its finance on a
long-term basis so that projects have been appropriately capitalized. In that
respect, IFCT has been successful in assisting small, new, or risky ventures
to find adequate and appropriate financing. Although debt is ideally not the
appropriate instrument to finance risky ventures, IFCT's long-term debt
financing was still better than no financing or short-term financing.



- 13 -
6.2       Statistically, IFCT's development role during the period 1980-June
198j is measured in Annex 14. During this 5-1/2 year period, IFCT financed a
total of 416 projects. On an estimated basis, these projects involved total
investments of B 8,764 million. As a 7esult of the implementation of these
projects, it was estimated that the annual incremental sales would amount to
B 80,608 million of which B 22,581 million annually would be exports. Foreign
exchange earnings/savii&gs were estimated to amount to B 37,336 million
annually. These 416 projects were estimated to provide B 14,600 million
annually in incremental value added and generate some 44,570 new jobs.
6.3       There are also other developmental aspects by which to measuie
IFCT's performance. IFCT has undertaken some pioneering work through its
subsidiaries and affiliated companies (Thai Factory Development, Thai Orient
Leasing and Thai Mutual Fund Company). These companies are by and large
successful and introduced new economic activities in the country. It also
provided impetus to the national capital and securities markets by being
actively involved in setting up the Thai Stock Exchange and it continues to
assist government in appraising and arranging financial packages for large
projects of national importance.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.1       The fourth loan to IFCT approved in March 19, 1981 was identified in
the context of the government's emerging industrial strategy. The Bank's
major broader industrial and financial sector objectives at that time called
for better regional dispersal of industrial investment, mnore employment
creation, a shift towards export-oriented industries and development of long
term capital market for equity as well as dobt instruments. The loan to IFCT
was aimed at achieving these broader objectives insofar as they related to
IFCT's operations and at meeting IFCT's resource needs to help it continue .ts
support of private industry. A principal aim of the loan was to continue the
institutional development and strengthening of IFCT. Two more specific
objectives were to encourage lending to specific priority areas and to
encourage IFCT to be more activ,e in its resource mobilizatiun.
7.2       Fund utilization has been satisfactory in terms of both the rate of
commitments and disbursemcnts.  The Bank loan financed 47 subprojects with
only a third of the loan used to finance large scale subprojects with the rest
financing small and medium scale subprojects. The sectoral allocation of the
loan has been satisfactory, too. Lending has been concentrated in the Greater
Bangkok and Central regions accounting for 85% of loan amount, generally in
line with the geographic distribution of industrial investment in Thailand.
Although no quantitative target was set for the geographic distribution of the
subprojects financed, it was expected that the share of regions other than
Greater Bangkok and Central regions would be better than the historical
pattern of industrial investment in the country. In this sense, one of the
objectives of the project was not realized. IFCT gave higher priority to

selectinS good projects and timely commitzent and disbursement of the loan.
Subprojects selected were generally of good quality that were completed with
minimal delays and cost overruns averaging about 13% only. By mid-1987, all
the subprojects had been completed and in operation, with three-fourths of the
loans in current status.
7.3       The project was successful beyond expectations in the institutional
development of IFCT. It has measurably gained in stature and prestige and is
now regarded as a major financial institution in the country. IFCT's total
assets increased 28% between 1980 and 1986. Loan approvals also increased
from B 1,028 million in 1980 to B 3,007 million in 1985 before falling
substantially to B 1,450 million in 1986 arnd B 957 million in June, 1987 due
to excess liquidity in the system. It has diversified its resource base.
Appraisals of large scale projects has further improved, while for small scale
subprojects, appraisals have been streamlined to cut processing time. Project
supervision has been strengthened with greater a'tention to problem projects.
The staffing problem which was a cause for concern in the beginning because of
increasing staff turnover has also subsided considerably.
7.4       The .inancial position and profitability of IFCT has remained
satisfactory throughout the period. The arrears situation is manageable and
essentially remains unchanged since 1980.

Dear Mr. Nowicki
Many thanks for sending us a copy of your Project Completion Report on
the Fourth Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand Project (Loan 1956-TH).
IFCT is of the opinion that the report is a useful one and should assist us in
reviewing our own operations in general and also the results of the Fourth Loan
from the World Bank.
As requested, we are enclosing our comments on the report which we hope
will be useful to you in finalising your work. We look forward to receiving the
Final Report from your fine bank in due course.
Sincerely yours,
Sukri K.n1,-qrprv

Relations between the Government and IFCT
IFCr is Thailand's only development finance institution established
by the Government for the purpose of assisting private sector industrial and
capital market development. The Corporation acts as the Government's mechanism
for channelling long-term funds to the private sector for industrial development
which is vital to the nation's economic growth and overall development. IFCT
enjoys close relations with the Government which ha3 two representatives  on
IFCF's Board of Directors, one is appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as
being a major shareholder, and the other appointed directly by the Government
according to the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand Act. The latter is
normally elected Chairman of the Board.
Regional dispersal of proceeds of the 4th loan from the World Bank
The relative lack of success in dispersing funds to outlying regions
is due to the restrictions on the utilisation of the loan proceeds.   As most
provincial industrialists use machinery and equipment produced in Thailand or
equipment that has already been imported into Thailand, they are not able to
make full use of the loan from the World Bank. In addition, both the cost and
risk of lending in the regions are higher than in metropolitan areas thereby
necessitating more intense screening of projects. At that time, IFCT had only
3 regional offices during the 4th Loan's utilisation period (1981-1984) which
could not fully serve provincial lending operations. The Corporation corrected
this by establishing Branch Operations and Small Industries Department and three
additional branch offices in order to boost IFCT's presence in the provinces.
IFCT now has 6 offices outside Bangkok.

IFCT's general dispersal of financing in the regions.
IFCI attaches the highest level of importance to this and has set
the target of approving atleast 60% of loans approved each year in regional
areas including central region which still require industrial development
and infrastructure. From the Corporation's establishmernt date until 1987,
loans made to regional borrowers amount to 68% of all loans approved.
Diversification of investment from the capital city to the country-
side is therefore very actively pursued by IFCT. The branch and regional
offices are enhanced in terms of efficiency and power to provide better
service to clients. Seminars are regularly organised in order to disseminate
information, knowledge and ideas among provincial industrialists.
Portfolio Quality
IFCT sets 3 action plans for the purpose of scaling down loans in
arrears as follows:
Preventive Action - Conservatively analyse the projects
- In the loan supervision process, the project
will he closely followed up and monitored with
regards to the early warning signals
Quick Action       - Seriously ailing projects will be transferred to
the Legal Office for further legal action.
Decision - making at this stage must be prompt
and timely to avoid any damage of the collateral
security.    However,  legal  proceedings  are
normally complicated with several steps which
takes 2-3 years or more on average.



38 -                         ANNEX 19
Page 4 of 5
Specific Action    - To assist in coping with problems facing projects
which still have a bright future, a special loan
unit in the Loan Operations Department was set up.
IFCT staff participate directly in the business
operation and serve as an adviser to the problem
company. In addition, IFCT sends staff members
as representatives in the company's Board of
Directors and Executive Comittees as well.
Such assistances take time, depending on the
seriousness of the nroblems.  It probably takes
more than 2 years before we can assess the
problem and fine ways to solve such problems so
that the company's management can carry on its
operations alone. One of the obstacles which
hinder IFCr from tackling the client's problems
more rapidly is the limited number of experienced
and efficient staff. IFCr has given more importance
to this matter and has tried to build up more
working teams. IFCT has succeeded in solving the
problems for several clients already.
Fund aobilisation
IFCr has raised a great deal of funds abroad in the past due to the
lack of capital and financial instruments wi.thin Thailand which would satisfy
the Corporation's needs. However, improvements in the domestic market have
led to IFCr emphasise borrowing in Baht.



- 39 -                        ANNEX 19
Page 5 of 5
Most of the Yen loans obtained by IFCr carry low interest rates and
have very long maturity periods. The portion of Yen in IFCT's liability
portfolio has increased, compounded by the recent surge of the Japanese
currency in recent ties. IFCT's exposure to the Yen is therefore high and
the Corporation has taken measures to reduce this including making use of
long term cross-currency swaps.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
You  are of the opinion that for small projects,  partial  economic
indicators  are  more useful than ERR when making  economic analysis.   IFCT
normally takes into account economic indicators such as employment rather than
using ERR as the latter requires gathering data which takes up too much time
and is not ecornomical for small loans.
Decentralising loan approving power.
In order to provide more efficient service to clients, there have
been changes in authorisations regarding loan approvals. The Board of Directors
approves loans worth Bt. 50 million or more, the Executive Committee approves
loans of over Bt. 20 million but not exceeding Bt. 50 million and the President
approves loans of up to Bt. 20 million per project.
