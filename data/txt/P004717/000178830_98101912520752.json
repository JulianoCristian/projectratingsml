{"cdata!": "This project is designed to enhance the\n            developmental role of IFCT and increase its support of the\n            Government's industrial development strategy which\n            emphasizes dispersion of investment in the provincial areas,\n            and assistance to labor-intensive and export-oriented\n            industries. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the\n            foreign exchange costs of industrial subprojects; however,\n            in the case of subprojects located more than 100 km from\n            Bangkok, the loan may be used to finance 100% of IFCT's\n            subloan, up to a maximum of 50% of total subproject costs,\n            including some local costs. There are no special risks\n            associated with the project; IFCT undertakes rigorous\n            appraisal of projects prior to lending, and its exchange\n            risk coverage agreement with the Government adequately\n            protects IFCT against possible exchange risks."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
