(i) rehabilitation and extension of an existing\n            sugar plantation, including provision of equipment for land\n            preparation, cultivation and harvesting; (ii) rehabilitation\n            of transport infrastructure, and provision of equipment for\n            sugar cane transport and track maintenance; (iii) civil\n            works for the rehabilitation and expansion of processing\n            facilities and construction of offices and staff housing;\n            (iv) design and implementation of an applied research\n            program on sugarcane; (v) purchase and installation of a\n            data processing and management information system; (vi)\n            staff training; and (vii) pilot projects to promote foodcrop\n            production. The Project faces few technical, commercial or\n            managerial risks. There are some risks of delays in Project\n            implementation due to the general economic conditions in\n            Zaire. The main risks will be a deterioration of the\n            Company's financial situation if the government failed\n            to increase sugar prices to reflect production costs, or to\n            provide foreign exchange to purchase agricultural inputs,\n            spare parts and supplies. To reduce these risks, the\n            Government has agreed that sugar prices will be reviewed\n            whenever required and has established a mechanism to\n            allocate foreign exchange to Compagnie Sucriere."}, "docdt": "1980-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
