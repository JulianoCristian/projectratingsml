INTERNATIOIAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE FEJCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A FIRST LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of US $7.5 million
to help finance the Government's livestock development program.   The loan
would have a term of 14 years including 6-1/2 years of grace, with interest
at 7,1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.     A report entitled "Philippines:  Prospects and Problems of the
Economy" (EAP-21 dated March 31, 1971) was circulated to the Executive
Directors on April 5, 1971.   An economic mission visited the Philippines
in October-November 1971 and again in March 1972.   Its report will be
distributed to the Executive Directors in the next few days.   It will also
be distributed to the participants of the Consultative Group for the
Philippines as a basis for discussion at the Group's second meeting to be
held in Tokyo in late June.   Basic data on the country are given in
Annex II.
3.     The Philippines is endowed with favorable potential for economic
growth.   The country's principal economic assets are good natural resources,
a literate labor force and a dynamic and well-developed private sector. The
political system has remained democratic, and despite intermittent and widely
publicized outbreaks of violence, relatively stable.   A nationwide two-
party system has existed since independence and an equal number of Presidential
elections have been won by the Liberal and Nacionalista Parties.   Public
administration still remains uneven in quality, but the influx into the
top levels of public service of a highly able class of administrators has
contributed to an improvement in the implementation of public sector programs
during the last several years.
4.     The Philippine economy has grown at an average rate of about 6
percent during the past decade.   The ratio of gross fixed capital formation
to GNP rose from an average of about 13 percent during 1960-62 to about 20
percent during 1968-70 and the marginal saving rate was around 20 percent.
However, notwithstanding the impressive growth in total investment, there
was a relative neglect of infrastructure and agricultural investments
reflecting mainly tée continued low level of public investment.   Almost 90
percent of total investment is in the private sector and raising the share
of public investment to about 15 percent of total investment is an important
objective of the Four-Year Development Plan (FY 1972-75).



2
5.     A serious weakness of the economy during the last decade was the
failure to make headway in strengthening the balance of payments.  While
exports expanded by less than 5 percent per annum during 1960-69, imports
rose by around 8 percent annually during this period; the current account
deficits rose to well over 4 percent of GNP during 1968 and 1969.  A large
part of the external borrowing to finance these deficits took the form of
suppliers' credits and short- and medium-term loans to the Central Bank.
The Philippine economy was thus confronted with a serious foreign exchange
crisis at the end of 1969 which was aggravated by a large fiscal deficit.
The stabilization program adopted in February 1970 consisted of a number of
measures aimed at reducing excessive liquidity in the economy and-limiting
the growth of short-term external debt.   The program also provided for-
adoption of a floating rate of exchange for the peso and liberalization of
most import restrictions.   During the last two years, the stabilization
program has been implemented with determination by the Government and has
contributed to improvement in the fiscal, monetary and foreign exchange
situation.   Partly as a result of the stimulus provided by the de facto
devaluation of over 40 percent, export earnings increased by 24 percent in
1970 and showed a further increase of 6 percent in 1971 despite a sharp drop
in the prices of copper and coconut products.
6.     During the last two years, the Government has also made a concerted
effort to improve debt management and instituted control over medium- and
short-term borrowing.   But the heavy burden of external debt remains a crucial
problem for the economy.   Of the total medium- and long-term debt of $1.7
billion at the end of 1971, not in itself a large sum for an economy of this
size, about two-thirds is payable within the next four years.  Debt service
accounted for 28 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1971 and this ratio
is not iikely to decline significarntly until the latter part of the decade.
7.     In the fiscal field, the large ravenue deficit during FY 1969-70
was replaced by a surplus of P 539 million (us $84 million) during FY 1970-71.
Tax revenues increased by 39 percent during FY 1971 in part due to the
imposition of an export tax and ars likely to increase another 12 percent
during the current fiscal year.   The ratio of GovernLment revenues, including
those of the social security system and local governments, to GNP is about
13 percent, lower than in many developing nations.  The Government recognizes
the need for further improvement in ;mobilizing public resou:;ces and has
submitted new tax measures to Congress for consideration in the current session.
8.     The stringent financial measmares adopted under the Stabilization
Program in early 1970 no longer seem -o be seriously restricting the level
of economic activity.   The gross national product which expanded by 5.0
percent during 1970, is estimated to have risen by 6.5 percent during 1971.
The opportunities opened for indastrial and agricultural growth by the major
exchange rate adjustment are becoming evident and investment, at least in the
public sector, has begun to pick up.   Thare is also considerably greater
foreign investment interest in the Philippines than could have been foreseen
a year ago.   On the other hand, a sharp detarioration in the terms of trade



3
during 1971, estimated at some 18 percent, has bee.n a major setback to the
balance of payments and has aggravated the strains on the foreign exchange
position arising out of the heavy burden of external debt.  At the same
time, the inflationary pressures triggered by the 1970 devaluation continued
during 1971.  A major factor in the rise in consumer prices of 23 percent
during the year, compared to 15 percent in 1970, was the 30 percent rise in
food prices, resulting from rice shortages which emerged for the first time
since 1967.
9.     Per capita income in the Philippines is about $200 and incomes are
unevenly distributed.  Income disparities have probably widened during the
last two years because a large part of the benefit of higher export earnings
has gone to a relatively small group of exporters of sugar, minerals and logs.
The Government has recently become increasingly aware of this problem and land
reform legislation has been enacted which limits the level of land rents and
reduces the maximum size of landholdings.  Other social sector programs now
receiving increased attention which may contribute to improved living standards
of large segments of the population are rural electrification, family planning
and housing.
10.     The management of the foreign exchange and debt position will
continue to require skill and tight discipline in the next few years.
According to the recent Bank economic mission estimates, merchandise exports
are expected to rise by 7 percent per annum during 1972-75, with export
volume rising by about 5 percent a year.  The heavy debt repayments, and the
expected further deterioration in the terms of trade during the next two or
three years, would leave little scope for an increase in the real level of
imports, unless there is a marked increase in quick disbursing official
assistance.   But even if this occurs only a modest growth in real imports
of around 2 percent a year during 1972-75 will be possible.  In order to
maintain a manageable balance of payments position, much of the burden of
adjustment will therefore fall on the side of imports.  To avoid the
potentially disruptive effects on output and employment that would tend to
follow from raw material shortages induced by lack of foreign exchange, most
of the projected growth in imports would have to be in raw materials and
intermediates.  There would be little scope for increases in the level of
capital goods imports and there would be a need to keep consumer goods imports
to a minimum.  The development task will not be made any easier by the need
for such curbs on imports.  Moreover, the current account deficit would
still average about $130 million a year during 1972-75.  Allowing for
amortization payments, gross external borrowing requirements would average
$445 million annually during this period, although the average net transfer
of such capital (disbursements less amortization and interest) would only
be about $20 million a year.
11.     The success of the Government's efforts to stimulate agricultural
production, curb import demand and ensure better utilization of existing



4
industrial capacity will be critical to the maintenance of the present growth
rate of 6 percent a year during 1972-75.   At the same time, there is a need
to shift.the structure of investment from the private to the public sector
to overcome the infrastructure bottlenecks that have arisen from past
inadequate levels of public investment.   Despite the recent improvements
in raising public revenues,.the Philippine development program will require
funds in excess of expected local savings and foreign capital which would
become available by financing the foreign exchange component of development
projects.   Moreover, there are a number of development projects in various
stages of preparation in the Philippines which have strong economic and
social justification, but a low foreign exchange component.   In such cases,
which.include this project, limited local cost financing by the Bank is
justified.
12.     Because the external debt and payments problems facing the
PhilippD  3 are. congiderable , they should clearly obtain as much of their
external financing as possible on concessional terms in order to improve the
structure of the debt.   Considering the strong resource potentials of the
country and its capabilities for export expansion the Philippines will
continue to be creditworhty for some additional borrowing on conventional
terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13. .   The Philippines has received 16 Bank loans and on6.DA credit totalling
$270.8.million, net of cancellations.   A little over half of the Bank Group's
lending, about $140 million, has been for priority infrastructure projects
in power, transportation, water supply and education.   The remainder has
been divided equally between the productive sectors: about $65 million in
agriculture for irrigation, agricultural credit and rice processing and about
$65 million in industry for three loans through the Private Development
Corporation.of the Philippines (PDCP).
14.     Of the total Bank Group's lending of $270.8 million, one loan and
one development credit totalling $32 million were made earlier in April this
year and have not yet became effective.   Of the remaining Bank lending of
$238.8 million, the undisbarsed balance on March 31, 1972, was $68 million,
almost all of which was accounted for by the five loans made during the last
three fiscal years.   Disbursements for four of the five loans have been
progressing satisfactorily and disbursements under the loan for the Second
Raral Credit Project-are si-gnificantly ben.iind schedule.  Sub-loan demand under
this project was adversely affected by t>he change in the value of the peso
in February 1970 which resulted irn a sharp increase in the cost of imported
equipment.   The Bank agreed in October 1971 to a number bf proposals of the
Central Bank for increasing disbursements; e.g. a reduc.tion in farmers' and
rural banks' contributions-and a more diversified range of crops and items to
be financed under the project.   these changes and recent'increases in the
price of rice, which have helped to rns--vore far.mers' investment incentives,
have led to a substantial -increase in .e ra-Ge of disbur.aments under the Bank
loan during recent months.



15.     In the next few months I expect to recommend a loan of $20 million
for a fourth development finance companies project for PDCP awd a second
education project to assist the Government in its efforts to irprove the
quality of secondary education.   The Bank Group's future lending program will
continue to concentrate on financing public in.frastructure which has been
neglected in the past because of the scarcity of public resources, but which
is essential to the future development of the economy.   Highway and ports
projects are currently being prepared for possible future Bank financing.
Bank assistance to agriculture is also expected to increase as it is the
largest sector in the economy and the Government is mounting a major effort
not only to stimulate foodgrain production to eliminate shortages which have
necessitated substantial rice imports during the last year but also to
encourage some diversification with emphasis on livestock and feed grain
production.   The Bank will continue to provide assistance for general
agriculture, including rice, through loans for irrigation and for agricultural
credit through the rural banking system and for rice processing through the
Development Bank of the Philippines.         The Bank also expects to assist
the Government's efforts to diversify agricultural production and increase
the protein content of the diet of the Philippine population through loans
for livestock and fisheries.
16.     The inaugural meeting of the Philippine Consultative Group in April
1971 endorsed the need for quick disbursing aid on favorable terms and both
Japan and the United States have responded by announcing major increases in
their level of assistance to the Philippines.   Given the poverty of the
Philippines, the magnitude of the debt problem, the overall improvement in
the management of the country's econony and the fact that the Bank, as the
Chairman of the Consultative Group, has recommended that the members provide
concessional aid to the Philippines, it is appropriate that the Bank Group
now provide some IDA funds for the Philippines.   The $10 million IDA credit
to help finance the Fifth Power Project was the first IDA credit for the
country.   For the next year or two I expect to propose some further IDA
lending to the Philippines.
17.     IFC has made total commitments of $47.2 million of which $10.2
million has been sold, repaid or cancelled.   Investments have been made in
several areas: development banking, power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles,
paper, petroleum and nickel mining and refining.   The Central Bank placed
restrictions in 1970 on the repatriation of equity investments by foreigners
in non-export oriented projects.   IFO is continuing to discuss this matter
with the Government, but in the meantime will concentrate mainly on export
oriented industries.   A statement of Bank loans, IDA credit and IFC
investments is given in Annex I.
PART III - THE PROJECT
The Agricultural Sector
18.     Agriculture is the largest sector in the Philippine economy
generating about one-third of gross national product, accounting for three-
quarters of export earnings and providing employment to about half the



6
population.   Food crops, mainly rice and corn, take up over 60 percent of
the total land under cultivation.   Most of the remaining-land is devoted
to the production of the major export crops: sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapples
and tobacco.
19.     The sector grew at a rate of almost 7 percent during the latter
part of the 1960's.   The main stimulus for this growth was the breakthrough
in rice production following the increased use of high-yielding varieties,
fertilizer and irrigation water.   More recently, typhoons, poor weather
and crop diseases have adversely affected agricultural production and the
growth of the sector was only 3.1 percent in 1970 rising to about 5.0 percent
in 1971.   As a result, importation of about 400,000 tons of rice and
30,000 tons of corn were necessary during 1971.   Despite the rapid spread
of new technology during the last few years, considerable scope remains for
increasing rice production as only about 60 percent of the cropped area in
Central Luzon was irrigated and only 35 percent is under high-yielding
varieties during 1970.
20.     Philippine agriculture will be significantly affected by Government
land reform and credit policies.   A land reform program was initiated in
1963, which was designed in the first instance to replace sharecropping
with a leaseholding system with fixed rent in special "land reform areas"
and subsequently to convert leaseholders into landowners by paying the
owners of the land full compensation through the Land Bank.   Dissatisfaction
with the slow progress in implementing this program, led to the enactment
of new legislation in 1971 which provides for the spread, of the leaseholding
system to all areas of the Philippines producing foodgrains, the reduction
of the upper limits of landholdings from 75 to 25 hectares and the
integration and strengthening of existing land reform institutions.   This
legislation reflects the growing awareness of Philippine authorities of the
need to promote social justice in rural areas, but if the program is to be
fully successful a growing financial commitment will be required to finance
land transfers.   Also necessary will be a whole range of organizational
and institutional changes related to credit supply, extension and marketing
arrangements to provide for the requireinents of smaller farmers.
21.     The most important sources of institutional credit for agriculture
are financial institutions either fully or partially capitalized by the
Government.   These are the Philippine National Bank (PNB), the Development
Bank of the Philippines ;(DBP), private development banks (PDBs) which are
partially owned by DEP,-the rural banks and the Agricult-aral Credit
Administration (ACA) which together account for 65 percent of institutional
credit.   The balance comes from private commercial banks.   PNB and the
private commercial banks provide mainly short-term credit to large producers
and agro-industry;  the rural banks, PDBs, AGA and, to some extent, DBP,
provide credit to the small to medium size farmer.   Non-banking
institutions, including:fertilizer dealers, farm machinery suppliers,
shopkeepers, marketing and processing firms, landlords and private money
lenders, still provide a substantial amount of the total credit used in the
agriculture sector.   Prevailing rates of interest from institutional



7
sources are 8 - 14 percent per annum.  The effective cost of credit from
suppliers is 15 - 18 percent.  The Government recognizes the need for a
considerable expansion in the volume of institutional credit and has made
some provision for this by increasing the funds available for relending
by ACA, the rural banks and DBP.  However, budgetary constraints continue
to be significant.
22.     Livestock and poultry production account for about 15 percent of the
value contributed by agriculture.   The Philippines is not yet self-sufficient
in meat and imports amounted to $5 million in 1970.  Beef cattle which
number about 2 million heads',are largely small native types with concentrations
in Southern and Northern Mindanao and Central Luzon.  Most beef cattle are
found in ranching areas, but the grazing of cattle under coconuts has assumed
increasing importance in recent years, particularly in Mindanao.  Carabaos
(water buffalo), which number about 5 million heads, are found all over the
country with the highest concentrations in rice producing areas where they
are used extensively as draft animals.  According to Government estimates,
there are about 12.5 million pigs in the Philippines and the number slaughtered
annually ranges between 6 - 9 million animals.  Pigs are found throughout the
Philippines and backyard units contribute about 90 percent of pork production.
The poultry population is estimated at almost 100 million with commercial
production mostly concentrated around Manila.
23.     The Four-Year Plan (1972-75) projects an annual rate of growth for
agriculture of 5.3 percent.   It attaches high priority to increasing rice
production to attain self-sufficiency in this major staple, and improving
the quality of the Philippine diet through increased production of feed grains
(yellow corn, sorghum and soy beans) and livestock. Yellow corn output is
projected to more than double from about 150,000 tons in 1971 to 325,000 tons
in 1975 and meat production is projected to increase from about 640,000 to
820,000 tons during the same period.  These objectives are to be realized
through a substantial expansion in credit and extension services supporting
livestock and feed grain production.
The Project
24.     The proposed project was prepared by two missions under the IBRD/
FAO Cooperative Program which visited the Philippines in 1969 and 1970.  It
was appraised in June and July 1971.  Negotiations for the proposed loan
were held in Washington in January 1972.   The purpose of the project is to
assist the Government in carrying out its livestock development program by
providing funds for supervised credit to be administered by DBP.  The
proposed project would provide medium and long-term loans to farmers for
development of about 1,450 smaller to medium size pig, poultry and integrated
coconut and beef cattle farms; 25 larger beef cattle breeding ranches, and
three small slaughterhouses.   It would also include the employment by DBP
of technicians.
25.     The lending arrangements would be similar to those for the Philippine
Rice Processing Project (Loan No.720-PH).  The Bank loan would be made to



8
the Government which would bear the foreign exchange risk and relend the
proceedd to the DBP under the terms of a subsidiary loan agreement.  DBP
would on-lend the Bank funds e%ther directly to private sector sub-borrowers
or to private developmeht bank3 for releriding.
26.     DBP, a wholly owned Government institution, has total resources of
about P 3.3 billion (us $515 million), making it the largest development bank
in the Philippines and an important channel of finance for agriculture and
industry.   It has a professional staff of more than 700, including about 200
agriculturalists and engineers, and has wider experience in livestock lending
than any other institution in the Philippines.  While DBP's overall financial
position has in the past given cause for concern, DEP came under new
management in early 1970, as a part of President Marcos' policy of bringing
in well qualified administrators to run Government agencies, and the
organization's financial situation has improved steadily since then.  The
rate of collection on direct loans has practically doubled over the past year
and DBP is receiving substantial repayments against advances previously made
under foreign loan guarantees.   DBP's interest rate was raised from 9 to 12
percent in August 1970 which should contribute to further improvement in DBP's
financial position.
27.     This loan would afford the Bank the opportunity to work with DBP
in building up and rationalizing its livestock operations.  DBP is in the
process of setting up a livestock and poultry group, responsible for all of
its livestock lending.   The head of the group would be a senior officer,
appointed after consultation with the Bank.  He would be assisted by a
technical specialist and two production specialists, one for beef/coconut
production and the other for pig and poultry production.  These specialists
would assist in the appraisal and supervision of sub-projects, provide
technical advice to the group and assist in the training of staff.  These
arrangements would help the livestock and poultry group to begin its
operatoons on a sound technical and organizational basis and would assist
DBP in pursuing its policy of moving from security to technical and project
criteria in building up an effective program of supervised livestock credit.
An amount of $500,000 has been provided in the Bank loan for firancing the
services of technical specialists, but if DBP is successful in securing
bilateral assistance for this purpose, as is expected, these funds would be
used to make additional sub-loans under the project.
28.     The total cost of the project is $15.5 million, and the Bank loan
of $7.5 million would finance almost 50 percernt of this cost.  It is estimated
that the loan would be used to cover about $4.8 million of foreign costs and
$2.7 million of local costs.   About 35 percent of project costs would be
provided by DBP and PDBs and the remaining 15 percent by sub-borrowers.
29.   Most sub-borrowers would contribute about 10 percent to the cost of
their projects and repay their sub-loans to DBP at an interest rate of 12
percent per annum."Large", farmers, however, would be required to contribute



9
50 percent and pay a one-time technical service: fee of 2 perzcent of the
amount of the sub-loan.   These arrangements reflect the greater financial
capability of large farmers.   The 12 percent interest rate on sub-loans is
the same as DEP' q overall lending rate and would give DBP a sp^aed of about
5 percent over its average cost of funds for the project which wauld be
adequate to cover o,verhead and administrative costs and to leave a margin for
reasonable profits and reserves.   Sub-loans would be committed over a
three-year period and w6uld have repayment periods of up to 11 years.   Given
these terms and DBP's resulting project cash flow position, it is appropriate
that bofh the Bank loan and the subsidiary loan have a term of 14 years including
6-1/2 years of grace.
30.     Turnkey contracts of about US $200,000 for each of the three
slaughterhouses would be awarded after international competitive bidding.
Turnkey c6ntracts would be used because several types of equipment from
different manufacturers will be needed for each slughterhouse.   A single
contractor must be given overall responsibility to ensure that the individual
items of equipment are compatible and delivered at the right time.   No
customs duties apply to the turnkey contracts as such, but contractors would
pay duties on items they import.   Import duties on slaughterhouse equipment
range from 10 percent to 20 percent, averaging about 11 percent for the
facilities proposed.   Under the Laurel-Langley Treaty items imported into
the Philippines from the United States are assessed at 90 percent of the
normal duty.   The preferential arrangements under the Treaty will be phased
out by December 1973.   Procurement would begin late in 1973 and be spread
over several years.   Goods for on-farm investments and incremental working
capital inputs would be acquired through existing commercial channels as
the items to be procured are diverse and the likely size of individual
purchases small.   The Philippines has a good network of dealers in agricultural
supplies and competition is keen.
31.     Total incremental production under the project after full development
is estimated to be about US $17 million per annum.   The financial rates of
return to sub-borrowers vary between 19 and 47 percent and should be
sufficiently high to make the proposed investments attractive.   The economic
rate of return is estimated at 36 percent.   Sensitivity analysis indicates
that the project remains economically justified over any likely range of
variation in investment costs, physical production and crop prices.
32.     The project would produce earnings from expanded copra exports
resulting from beef aid coconut sub-projects and foreign exchange savings from
the substitution of domestic meat production for imports which together would
have a total value of about US $56 million over the life of the project. In
addition to the approximately 1,500 small to medium farmers who would receive
sub-loans, about 1,700 people living in rural areas would benefit by new jobs
created by investment under the project.
