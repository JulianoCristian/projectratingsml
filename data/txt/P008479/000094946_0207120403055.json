sustainability highly likely, and the institutional\n            development impact substantial. Lessons point primarily at\n            the importance of the Government's active program of\n            privatization, and regulatory development, which ran in\n            parallel with the investments financed by the project,\n            allowing maximum benefits deriving from the liberalized\n            energy markets, both Hungarian, and European. However, the\n            reluctance of the Government to expose Hungarian consumers\n            to the full costs of electricity supply - though\n            understandable, but a factor rather to be placed in the\n            context of anti-inflation and other policy considerations -\n            constraints the ability of the Hungarian Power Company, to\n            confidently plan sector needs, weakening the company's\n            creditworthiness. Thus, the issue of independent energy\n            regulation and economic pricing, remain indicators to\n            monitor, and evaluate, well after restructuring, and\n            privatization. Nevertheless, the highly professional, and\n            motivated management provided by the power company, was a\n            crucial ingredient for success, which underlines the\n            importance of ensuring institutional, and management arrangements."}, "docdt": "2002-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
