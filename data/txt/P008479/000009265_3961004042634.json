In\n            addition, the project will support continued environmental\n            improvements in the power sector, and assist in improving\n            institutional capabilities. The project will consist of the\n            following components: (i) construction of the gas-fired\n            combined cycle co-generation unit of 235 MWe and 240 MWt at\n            the Dunamenti Power Plant site about 30 km southwest of\n            Budapest; (ii) upgrade of Hungarian Power Companies Ltd.\n            (MVM Rt's) existing Energy Management System (EMS);\n            (iii) assistance to: (a) develop an Environmental Master\n            Plan, (b) reinforce the environmental management and\n            monitoring capabilities of MVM Rt; and (c) install water\n            pollution, ambient air and noise level monitoring equipment\n            at selected sites; and (iv) assistance to upgrade the human\n            resource management, training and institution-building\n            capacity in the power sector."}, "docdt": "1994-01-19T00:00:00Z"}
