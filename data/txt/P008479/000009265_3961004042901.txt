MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE HUNGARIAN POWER COMPANIES LTD.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY
FOR THE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Hungarian Power Companies Ltd. (MVM Rt) with the guarantee
of the Republic of Hungary for the equivalent of US$100 million to help finance
the Energy and Environment Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including five years grace
period.
2.    Country/Sector Backqround.    Hungary is a middle-income ccentry, with an
estimated per capita income of US$2,980 in 1992, and a population of 10.3
million. The country has been a front-runner in the economic transformation
taking place in Central and Eastern Europe.  It has been experimenting with
reforms since 1968, but it was not until a democratic Goverament was elected in
1990 that the country became fully engaged in introducing a market economy. In
the energy sector the reform.s are gradually reducing the governmentIs operational
role, giving more autonomy to the enterprises, encouraging competition and aiming
to attract private capital. During the last three years the government control
over energy imports and the prices of petroleum products, coal and fuelwood was
removed and nearly all other energy prices were increased to cost-covering
levels. Government subsidies for energy used by households were eliminated. The
State-owned petroleum and electricity enterprises were corporatized for more
efficient operation in preparation for privatization, and a program has started
to phase out uneconomic coal mines and coal-based power stations.
3.    The power sector has no cash flow problems at present, and it no longer
depends on government subsidies. This is, however, a short-run phenomenon, which
results largely from the low level of investment required at present, given the
depressed demand for energy. Current tariffs are, in fact, below the long-run
marginal cost of production. The appropriate economic price of power depends on
factors such as the price of fuels, the expected evolution of demand for power,
the elasticity of substitution between energy and other factors of production,
etc. As such, it is not constant over time, and needs to be periodically
reassessed. Nevertheless, based on the outlook for demand and future investment
requirements, the Hungarian Government recognizes that current tariffs are likely
to be below economic price and that increases are required to allow internal
generation of resources for expected future upgrading of capacity. The gaps are
more significant for residential customers, although their tariffs have been
increased to cover about 70%-80% of the estimated full economic price. The
Government has committed itself to eliminate the remaining gaps within three
years.   This policy would result in increases in real prices of acceptable
magnitude. Non-residential rates are closer to economic price, and will be
adjusted as necessary. In addition, work is ongoing to establish a regulatory
framework which would allow a transparent process for determination of tariffs.
A new Electricity Act has been presented to Parliament and its promulgation is
expected in early 1994. In response to the governmentts response, the Bank is
providing support and assistance in all these efforts.
4.    Prolect Oblectives.  Like other former socialist countries, Hungary has
above average energy intensity and heavy dependence on a faltering, single
geographical source for nearlv all of its energy import. The proposed Project
is complementary to programs underway to reduce the country's dependence on
energy imports from a single source; to increase efficiency, reliability and
flexibility in the production of electricity and heat; and to establish the
necessary basis for interconnections with the UCPTE grid.  In addition, the



-2-
Project would support environmental improvements in the power sector and assist
in improving institutional capabilities.
5.    Protect Descri2tion.  The Project would include: (i) construction of a
gas-fired combined-cycle cogeneration unit of 235 MWe (electrical) and 240 MWt
(thermal) at the Dunamenti Power Plant site, about 30 km southwest of Budapest;
(ii} upgrading of MVM Rt's existing Energy Management System (EMS); (iii)
assistance to: (a) develop an Environmental Master Plan, (b) reinforce
environmental management and monitoring capabilities of MVM Rt and (c) install
water pollution, ambient air and noise level monitoring equipment at selected
sites; and (iv) assistance to upgrade the human resource management, training and
institution-building capacity in the power sector.
6.    The Project would include civil works, equipment and materials, technical
assistance, and training. The total financing requirement is estimated at
US$242.5 million equivalent (including interest during construction) with a
foreign exchange component of US$168.9 million ('i0O). At the request of MVM Rt,
retroactive financing of US$2.7 million representing expenditure incurred after
April 1, 1993 for engineering services necessary for early project start-up, has
been included in the costs. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and
the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bark Group operations in Hungary are given
in Schedules C and D respectively. A map showing Project locations is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11582-HU, dated January 19, 1994, is
being distributed separately.
7.    Prolect Implementation.  The Project would be carried out over five-and-
one-half years. MVM Rt's Project Management Team would be responsible for the
ProjectIs management and coordination and for the timely allocation of resources.
The Director of Development of MVM Rt will be the head of the Team, and to
facilitate implementation, team leaders responsible for the operational
directives of the various Project components will be accountable to the Director.
On completion, the investment components, such as the cogeneration plant and the
environmental facilities at Dunamenti, would be transferred to the companies
which would own and operate them. Regarding the major project componert the
cogeneration plant, which represents over two-thirds of the project cost, MVM Rt
ard Dunamenti Rt, as a condition of loan effectiveness, will enter into an
Operational Agreement satisfactory to the Bank, to cover implementation, and
ownership arrangements, financial performance obligations and other matters
relevant to the Project. For smaller Project components similar arrangements are
not necessary.
8.    Environmental Aspects.  The Project was placed in Category "A" and an
Environmental Assessment (EA) was submitted to the Bank prior to Project
appraisal. The EA was considered of good quality and acceptable; the summary of
which was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 16, 1992.
9.    The critical issues identified by the EA were air and noise pollution at
the Dunamenti site. These issues were satisfactorily addressed. Regarding air
pollution, both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions would be within both
the current Hungarian technical emission standards and the World Bank Guidelines
for either a gas or an oil-fired cogeneration plant. The same applies to ambient
air quality standards. Regarding noise pollution, a mitigation plan was included
in the Project design to ensure acceptable noise levels.  As an additional
assurance, the Project's environmental component will include instrumentation to
monitor the adequacy of the mitigating measures taken.



-3-
10.   Lessons learned.   Generally, performance of previous energy loans in
Hungary has been satisfactory. Intermittent problems were related to somewhat
complicated procedures occasionally leading to slow commitment of fands and
delayed commissioning of plants and equipment. With the recently increased role
of local authorities and the more acti"re participation of the population in
investment decision making, and as procedures ard areas of authorities are still
being defined, some constructisn activities have been unduly delayed.   The
proposed project builds on this experience. Early licensing for the cogeneration
plant has been secured and streamlined project implementation arrangements,
simplified project management and loan administration procedures are provided
together with timely and frequent interfacing with decision making authorities.
All the preparatory work necessary for the Project's successful implementation
will be  completed prior  to  loan  effectiveness.    Various  technical  and
institutional implementation aspects have been taken care of by training
arrangements, by involvement of consultants and by well defined Bank supervision
program.   The various agreements and monitoring measures would assist in
maintaining the technical and financial integrity of the power sub-sector.  The
organization  of  the  Project  Management  Team  reflects  flexibility  and
simplification that was based on the accumulated experience.
11.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's country assistance strategy for
Hungary supports policies and investments aimed at restoring economic growth and
social development as the country proceeds with transition to a market-oriented
economy. The emphasis is on structural reforms and private sector development,
leading to more efficient allocation of resources, while strengthening a social
support system targeted at the most vulnerable segments of the populatlor.. The
proposed Project would assist in this strategy by helping to reinforce the
economic supply of electric power and heat with improved environmental control.
it would also establish a strong base for expanded international power exchange
with neighboring countries as well as ith the Western European Power Pool
(UCPTE). Also, the Project is complementary to important ongoing action programs
such as the development of a regulatory framework for the power sector,
establishment of an economic cost-based, market-oriented tariff structure, an
essential element of demand efde management, and commerciali3ation of power
companies.   The primary focus of the environmental component  is on the
Environmental Master Plan, and in line with Bank policy, on strengthening the
Borrower's environmental management capabilities.
12.   Purincr necotiations, the following actions, assurances and agreements have
been reached:
-         With the Government:  (i) regular exchange of views on electric.&Ly
pricing policy and its implementation; and (ii) as long as the
Government controls electricity pricing it will enable the Borrower to
fulfill its obligations under the Loan Agreement including compliances
with the financial covenants.
-         With MVM Rt:  (i)  detailed programs and terms of reference for
management and environmental training and technology transfer; (ii)
establishment of an appropriate Project Management Unit; (iii)
procurement  arrangements  with  specific  provisions  to  ensure
appropriate interfacing between the various Project components; (iv)
providing to the Bank annUal and 3-year (rolling) investment programs
and related financing plans; (v) financial targets including (a)
annual break even ratios not less than 0.98 in 1994, increasing to
0.99 in 1995 and 1.1 in 1996 and thereafter; (b) internally generated
annual cash surpluses not less than 55* of annual capital expenditures
and (c) debt services coverage not less than 1.9 in 1994 and 2.5 in
1995 and thereafter; and (vi) audit and reporting requirements.



With DUnamenti Rt: ji) closing the BEAD (old cogenerating) plant .hen
the new cogenerating plant starts to operate; (ii) annual (a) working
ratios of not more than 0.8 (b) break even ratios of not less than 1.1
in 1994, 1.2 in 1995 and thereafter, and (iii) audit and reporting
requirements.
13.       Condition of Loan Effectiveness.  MVM Rt and Dunamenti Rt will enter
into contractual arrangements (Operational Agreement) satisfactory to the Bank
for the implementation, ownership, financial and other responsibilities relevant
to the Project.
14.       Benefits.  The Project would help finance the next investment in the
national least-cost power generation investment program. The optimum timing of
the Dunamenti component is 1996 for the combustion turbine alone, and 1997 for
the full combined-cycle unit. These coincide with the project timetable. The
economic rate of return (ERP.) of this component, representing about two-thirds
of the total Project cost, is a satisfactory 161. The component would improve
energy efficiency and environmental conditions at one of the most important
Hungarian power stations and would reduce dependence on electricity imports.
Benefits for the EMS component would include fuel savings, reduced reserve
requirements and avoided outages resulting from better generation scheduling,
real-time economic dispatch, network monitoring and security control.   The
environmental component would contribute to improved control oi power sector
emissions, develop a least-cost approach to pollution control and strengthen MVM
Rt's institutional capabilities to address environmental issues.  The human
resource management component would establish a modern management system, a basic
prerequisite for successful corporate operation.
15.       Risks.  The major risk is related to possible delays in obtaining
licenses from various authorities for new investments.   This risk has been
minimized by preparation of a satisfactory comprehensive environmental assessment
with public involvement, and by having secured the construction license from the
local authorities for the cogeneration plant. Other risks such as lack of gas
supply and reduced demand for heating will be mitigated by p,roviding a dual-fired
(natural gas and gas oil) combustion turbine at the power station to cope with
possible short-term emergency gas supply shortfalls, and by ensuring that the new
combined-cycle unit can generate electricity even in periods of low demand for
heat.
Recommendation
I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed Loan.
