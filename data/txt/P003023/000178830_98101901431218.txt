ADJUSTMENT OF PARITY OF THE ZAIRE
1.        On March 12, 1976, the Zaire was aligned with SDRs, one Zaire being
equivalent to one SDR. This values the Zaire at approximately US$1.18 in
comparison with the former official rate of US$2.00.
Economic Analysis
2.        In the economic analysis of the project (para. 5.04) and the tariff
analysis (para. 6.06) a shadow rate of US$1.25 was used. This is close
enough to the new rate to validate the essential conclusions of the appraisal
report.
Project Cost
3.        Total Project costs, taking into account the new parity, are as
follows (with the figures in para. 4.32 shown in parentheses).
Foreign
Local Costs      Currency Costs      Total Costs
Million US$           16.8 (28.4)      42.0 (42.0)       58.8 (70.4)
Million Zaires        14.2 (14.2)      35.6 (21.0)       49.8 (35.2)
Cash Flow
4.        Regideso will have to find, in 1976-1978, about Zl.0 million more
to meet the increased indirect foreign exchange content of the Project as
well as about Z1.7 million for increased cost equivalent of debt service.
In order to generate the additional cash required, Regideso would have to
increase its water tariff by about 10% early in 1977.  Such an increase is
foreseen in para. 6.06 and Regideso is required, in any event, to raise its
tariffs in order to comply with the financial covenant in Section 4.08 of the
Credit Agreement.

APPRAISAL OF WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
i.        This report appraises the first Bank Group water supply project in
Zaire. In 1973/74, in the framework of the WHO/IBRD cooperative program,
WHO carried out a study of the water supply, sewerage and drainage sector.
The study revealed enormous needs in the sector, and recommended a substantial
and continuous development program, starting with water supply in the major
cities, as well as a comprehensive training program to upgrade and augment
the technical staff of the National Water Supply Corporation, Regideso.
The proposed Project represents a first stage in the implementation of the
sector study recommendations.
ii.       Until recently, low priority had been given to the development of
the sector. Regideso obtained Z 8 tillion in Government grants during the
period 1967-1973, and invested the greater part in the rehabilitation and
expansion of water production facilities in Kinshasa. Supply mains in the
capital are currently being extended with the help of a FED-EIB Z 3.5 mil-
lion loan. Additional funds are now being provided by the Government and
smAll scale rehabilitation and extension projects are under construction in
other towns. Public sewerage systems have a lower priority in a country
where urban density generally is low and consequently private systems usually
suffice. However, there are a few critical areas (e.g., Lubumbashi and
Matadi, where the lack of a sewerage system may endanger public health) and
the Project provides for sewerage feasibility studies.
iii.      The Project will improve the supply of water in six of the major
cities of Zaire: Lubumbashi, Kisangani, Kananga, Mbuji-Mayi, Mbandaka and
Kamina, whose aggregate population is estimated at 1.5 million, out of a
total urban population of about 6 million. The project will provide waterto
0.7 to 1 million additional people the majority of whom fall in the category
of the urban poor. The feasibility studies were carried out by two consultants
engaged and paid for by Regideso. Production facilities will be rehabilitated
and supplemented to provide continuous service, and distribution systems will
be expanded to supply the entire urbanized area of the six cities; at present
only about one-third of their population has access to piped water. Distri-
bution is to be expanded primarily through standpipes. The Project has been
sized to assure the supply of water to the whole population of the six-cities
by 1980.
iv.       It is estimated that the Project will cost around US$70 million,
out of which about US$42 million would be in foreign currency. The Project,
which represents about half of Regideso's investment program for 1976-78,
provides for distribution network extensions, pumping equipment, treatment
facilities and civil works, a comprehensive training program, consulting
services, feasibility studies for subsequent projects, and an estimated



- ii -
amount for rehabilitation of existing works (the balance of which is expected
to be financed outside the scope of the Project by Regideso). Except for the
part of the Project specifically financed by AfDB and the laying of secondary
distribution (which would be carried out under force account by Regideso),
procurement will be according to Bank/IDA guidelines. IGIP, of Darmstadt,
Germany, has been selected to engineer the Project, and to supervise and
manage its construction in four cities. IGIP will also train Regideso's
staff in project management and supervision as well as in leak detection and
correction. IEU-Dumons, a French consortium, has been engaged for the other
two cities, Kisangani and M'bandaka. Construction would normally take two
years, but delays of about eight months have been allowed.
v.        Local currency expenditure and indirect foreign exchange costs,
amounting to about US$31 million, are to be met out of Government grants and
Regideso's internally generated cash. Direct foreign exchange costs (about
US$39 million) are to be financed by an IDA credit of US$21.5 million, an
ABEDA loan of US$10 million, an ADB loan of about US$6.2 million equivalent,
and a grant from UNDP of about US$1.5 million (for training).
vi.       The IDA credit will be on-lent to the executing agency, Regideso.
vii.      The Project represents only a part of Regideso's broad investment
program in water and power. Sooner or later all existing facilities will
have to be rehabilitated and/or expanded, and a start made on constructing
new systems in the smaller towns.
viii.     Regideso is a state owned organization entrusted with urban water
supply throughout the country and electricity in all but the largest centers.
It is directed by statute to operate along the lines of a commercial enter-
prise. Its organization structure is sound, although heavily centralized,
and its administrative services and accounting department are adequate. It
has retained, in advisory positions only, a few of its former expatriate
employees. Regideso's major weakness is its shortage of trained technical
staff. The Project will seek to renedy this, through the training program.
ix.       As a result of a steep increase in water tariffs in 1974 (although
this was partly offset by a reductiDn in thermal power tariffs), Regideso is
expected to generate a substantial amount of cash and will finance the local
currency component and $3 million equivalent of the indirect foreign exchange
cost of the Project, as well as some other smaller investments. The finan-
cial covenants of the credit agreement are designed to maintain the substantial
cash generation needed by Regideso to help finance its expansion program.
Government arrears for electricity and water have been a problerni, but the
Commissioner of State for Finance has agreed to repay these thru monthly
installments.



S- iii -
x.        The Project is expected to substantially reduce the high incidence
of vaterborne diseases among the urban poor. It i8 however, subject to a
higher than usual risk element arising from the unpredictability of local
costs and the possibility of delays in delivery to the sites and in construction.
xi.       The Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$21.5 million.

APPRAISAL OF WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1973 the World Health Organîzation (WHO) made a study of the
Water Supply, Severage and Drainage Sector within the framework of the WRO/
IBRD Cooperative Program. Their report (Report No. 324a-CK, March 29, 1974)
concluded that there were enormous needs in Zaire for safe water and recom-
mended a substantial development program, starting with the major cities.
The Project, which proposes to implement the first stage of this program,
is the first Bank Group operation in the water supply sector in Zaire.
1.02      With Goverument support, Regideso, the National Water Supply Cor-
poration and Project executing agency has already begun lmplementing the
sector study recommendations.  Grants were obtained from Goverument for fea-
sibility studies and in April and July 1974 Regideso appointed two consulting
firms to carry out feasibility studies in six major cities: IGIP 1/ (Germany)
in Lubumbashi, Kananga, Mbuji-Mayi and Kamina, and IEU-Dumons 2/ (France) in
Kisangani and Mbandaka.
1.03      The Project vas appraised in January-February 1975 by a mission
composed of Messrs. R. Prevost, D. Coyaud snd P. R. du Mec, assisted by the
Resident Mission in Zaire (Messrs. J. Doyen and R. Chadwick) and by two
training consultants, Messrs. Leroy from SOPEA 3/ and Pavoncello from ORT 4/.
This report drave on information contained in the WHO/IBRD Vater Supply,
Severage and Drainage Sector Study; information provided by Regideso; the
fcasibility studies carried out by the consultants, IGIP snd IEU; the report
by the traîning consultants; and the findinge of the Appraisal Mission.
2. THE SECTOR
Background
2.01      Zaire (Map 1) extends over 2,346,000 km 2 (about one-fourth of the
size of the USA) astride the equator. About one quarter of its surface,
the central basin and the North, le covered by equatorial raîn forest,
bordered to the East and South by hilly or mountainous savanna. The geo-
graphy ls dominated by the Zaire River, which drains virtually the entire

country.  Rains are abundant everywtere with an average annual rainfall of
1 to 1.8 m; there is a dry season oxl.1y in the South, with little or no
rainfall for about four months.
2.02      The average density of Zaire's population ie low, about 10/km2.
The rate of growth of Zaire's population of some 23 million is about 2.6%
per year. GDP per capita is currently about US$100, with large differences
between regions, and is several times higher in urban than in rural areas.
2.03      Zaire's urban population increased threefold after independence,
between 1960 and 1970, when the average growth rate was about 10%, but the
rate of urban population growth is now stabilized and should not exceed 6%
per year over the next decade. Population data are uncertain and should in
all cases be considered as estimates. There are 11 cities with a population
of over 100,000 and about 100 towns wlth more than 2,000 inhabitants. Zaire's
urban population is more than six million and is expected to pass the eight
million mark by 1980.
2.04      Generally, in spite of theLr post-independence population explosion
and unplanned expansion, Zaire's towns and cities have grown in an orderly
fashion, although mostly without serzices.  In the new suburbs or "citès",
groups of individual rectangular plots are separated in an orderly pattern
by wide paths or unpaved roads.  Urban population density remains low on the
whole (60 to 100 inhabitants per hectare, 8-10 persons to a plot) which leads
to a hlgh per capita cost of utilities.
Organization of the Sector
2.05      Urban water supply ij  the responsibility of the state corporation,
Regideso, the proposed executing agency of the Project described in Chapter 3;
rural water supply comes under the Agriculture Department (Office for
Rural Development); severage and drainage are, in theory, the responsibility
of the Public Works Department (Service of Land Uses and Urban Roads).
2.06      The budgets and personnel of the Office for Rural Development
and the Service of Land Uses and Urban Roads are quite inadequate. In
Lubumbashi, where, exceptionally, soute consideration is given to sewerage,
the labor force assigned to this task is merely one-tenth of its pre-
independence strength. Virtually no developments, repairs or maintenance
are carried out in connection wvth rural water supplies 1/ or sewerage,
and both need thorough institutional reorganization. Drainage, however,
has benefited to some extent from current road construction and maintenance
programs.
Health Aspects
2.07      Although partial and incomplete, available data indicate a high
incidence of waterborne diseases in all regions of Zaire, and the prevalence
1/ Regideso has recently been designated to rehabilitate existing rural
schemes, but has neither the means nor the personnel to do se.



of endemic, debilitating diseases. The lack of safe vater is a primary
aspect of unhygienic environment which facilitates the spread of such di-
seases. Inadequate disposal of human and other vastes and the general un-
awareness of sanitary practices are aleo major contributory factors.
Urban Water Supply
2.08      There is no piped vater in the post-independence suburbs, or in
about 50 towns with more than 2,000 inhabitants. Thus, more than two-thirds
of Zaire's urban population have to draw their vater from pits and vells or
from the nearest springs or streams. The 55 existing urban vater supply
systema serve about 126,000 connections, or less than 3 per hundred urban
dwellers; connections are increasing by only about 2% per year. Domestic
consumption of those served by piped vater averages about 100 lcd, which
appears to be a reasonable overall figure, but one which hides large
variations between classes of users. Annex 7, page 8, gives the distribution
of consumption by class of consumers in the six cities of the project. There
are very few standpipes:  about 700 altogether in the urban areas (Kinshase
has only two). The average quantity of vater available for domestic con-
sumption is about 10 lcd in Kananga, Mbuji-Mayi and Mbandaka, and the highest
average consumption in Zaire is about 380 lcd in Lubumbashi.  The average
price of water is currently K 13.2î/m or, in line with an adjusted rate of
exchange (see para 5.04) US$0.17/m (US$0.65/1000 gal), which is about
average for African cities.
2.09      Ample vater is usually available at a short distance from most
urban centers. The major source is large rivers. Since river water requires
treatment, treatment plants are in widespread use; they give rise to operating
problems and require skilled personnel.  A few cities rely on groundwater,
which deserves greater consideration as a potential source of supply because
of its lower cost and better quality.
2.10      Existing facilities have been allowed to deteriorate.  Available
installations generally cannot cope with demand; reservoirs and mains are
cften empty; internal corrosion is a cause of heavy leakage; unaccounted-
for water is as high as 30 to 50%. The quantity of water distributed in
urban areas is usually inadequate and often of questionable quality.
2.11      Between 1960 and 1966 there was no investment in the sector.  With
the help of Government grants of about Z 2.8 million Regideso rehabilitated
some parts of its vater and electricity supply systems between 1967 and 1973.
As a part of this rehabilitation Regideso constructed 1 treatment plant and
a pumping station capable of producing about 100,000 m /day, thus doubling
production capacity in Kinshasa.  The construction of additlonal mains and the
extension of storage reservoirs for Kinshasa is nov under way, financed by a
FED-EIB 1/ loan of Z 3.5 million. More funds have now been made available
by Government and small scale extensions and rehabilitation works are also
proceeding in Mbuji-Mayi, Lubumbashi, Matadi, Gemena, etc.

2.12      The WHO/IBRD sector study (March to June 1973) identified the
constraints to be overcome in order to develop the sector in a rational
manner, and recommended a development program which Regideso, supported by
Government, has already begun to carry out.
2.13      The constraints with which Regideso is presently confronted are
(i) a shortage of technical staff - Regideso increased its training budget
in 1973-1974; (ii) insufficient cash flow - tariffs vere increased in
July 1974; and (iii) the lack of feasibility studies to start projects - the
firet studies in six cities were commissioned in April 1974, financed by a
Government grant, and form the basis of the Project.  Studies in another
fourteen localities have since been commissioned and the Project makes pro-
vision for further studies (see paragraphs 2.20 and 2.21).
2.14      The development strategy outlined in WHO's sector study gives
priority to the major cities, which are also the regional or zone capitals.
The rationale is that in these cities the risks to public health are more
serious, the cost per person served would be less, a greater number of people
would benefit, in particular a concentration of urban poor vith few alter-
native resources. Moreover, there would be less strain on Regideso's
thinly spread qualified technical staff.
2.15      The WHO study recommended that the distribution of water be
extended mainly through public standpipes, as the best way of satisfying,
at least partially, the extensive needs with the least capital investment.
At the same time an appropriate system of collecting charges for water
supplied by standpipe would have to be instituted, together with a program
of groundwater research and a study of rural water supplies.
2.16      Regideso has requested, through Government, UNDP assistance for
preinvestment studies in severals major cities not included in the present
Project, and UNDP has agreed to conisider three out of these cities: Likasi,
Bukavu and Matadi. Sewerage in these cities is to be included in the studies,
at the request of the Ministry of Health.
2.17      In November 1974, Regideso commissioned CADIC 1/ to carry out
feasibility studies and detailed engineering for new water and power systems
in eleven smaller towns with populations of from 7,000 to 50,000. The
Project provides for further studies in the six cities of the proposed
Project and other localities to be designated.
Rural Water Supply
2.18      Before independence there were numerous small rural water supply
systems; it is estimated that there vere about 1,500 standpipes and about
the same number of wells in the villages. The number of these facilities
was still far from sufficient to meet the country's needs, yet many of them
have fallen into disrepair.

2.19      The need for potable vater ln rural areas, where the population
lives mostly in large villages having easy access to relatively unpolluted
surface water with continuous flow, is less urgent than in the over populated
cities. The proposed strategy ln rural vater supply vas to set up a amall
unit vithin the Agriculture Department to start rural "self-helpt' schemes,
and to train personnel who could thereafter assist in the expansion of such
rural systems 1/.
Sewerage and Drainage
2.20      Except in the heart of the larger cities, Zaire has no sewerage.
Considering the normally ample flow of the rivers, sevage treatment plants
have low priority; public severage is not essential where density i low and
disposal of vastes by means of private systems is possible. Private systems
should be encouraged and means to provide the technical guidance needed
should be a part of a long-range program implemented by agencies such as the
Department of Health. Existing public sewerage systems have mostly fallen
into disrepair, creating sanitary problens in high density areas, e.g., in
Lubumbashi. In the special case of Matadi, where dwellings are built on a
steep, rocky hill with little top-soil, there is no system at all and wastes
usually stagnate in open natural drains.
2.21      Heavy rainfall and rainstorme are frequent in Zaire.  Storm water
drainage usually consiste of roadside ditches. Existing drainage ditches
in the center of the cities are often in poor condition or blocked, thus
causing flooding which often results in damage to the highways. It ls also
desirable that roadside drainage be built in peripheral townships, where
erosion results. in spectacular damage to roads and dwellings. For example
in Kinshasa, hundreds of "cité" dwellings each year slide into gullies.
3. REGIDESO
Background
3.01      The origin of Regie des Distributions d'Eau et d'Electricite de la
Republique du Zaire (Regideso) goes back to the 1920's when it was set up by
the colonial government to supply vater in urban areas. It was also directed
to supply electric power in some towns which were not connected to the main
grids of Shaba, Kinshasa or Bukavu and where it already supplied water.
3.02      In 1967, following independence (1960) and an unsettled period
during which operation and maintenance of many of its installations were not
kept up, the management of Regideso was entrusted to Cominiere, a private
1/   Regideso has recently been deslgnated to rehabilitate existing rural
schemes, but has neither the means nor the personnel to do so.



- 6 -
foreign group. This arrangement continued until 1971 when a Zairian, the
present General Manager (Delegue General), was appointed.
3.03      Regideso operates all urban vater supply systeus in the country;
there are 55 such centers and Regideso plans to increase them. Regideso
also distributes electric pover in 42 of these cities and towns and operates
diesel generating plants in 26 of the localities which do not have accesa
to cheaper hydro-electric sources.  Roughly two-thirds of Regideso's
operations relate to water supply and one third to electricity.
Present Institutional Framework and Organization
3.04      Its charter establishes Regideso as a public enterprise with
commercial characteristice. Regideso's General Manager is appointed by the
President of the Republic. There is no board of directors. Apart from the
setting of tariffs and the formal approval of its annual revenue budget and
of major items of capital expenditure by the Commissioners of State for Finance
and Energy, the General Manager bas full authority. Regideso's organization
chart is in Armex 1.
3.05      Regideso's Direction Generale (Head Office) is located in Kinshasa,
the capital. The General Manager in assisted by the Directors of the Tech-
nical, Administration, Personnel, Legal and Purchasing Departments. The
Technical Department supervises operations and is responsible for development.
The Department of Administration includes a Central Accounting Section. A
special section is responsible for billing all Government consumption.  The
newest Department, Training, was rec:ently split off from Personnel to
emphasize the present importance of training in the expansion of Regidesols
operations.
3.06      There are nine regional of'fices, located in the chef-lieu (prin-
cipal commercial center) of each region, and one "sub-regional" office
(Kamina, Shaba). Regional Direc tors have line responsibility for water
supply and electricity operations In their region. They are assisted by a
Chief of Operations and a Regional Accountant.
3.07      Regideso's administration operates satisfactorily; its statutes and
structure are workable and no change is proposed at this stage.
Staffing
3.08      Regideso's somewhat excessive staff numbered 3,390 in February 1975,
subdivided as follows:



Executive (engineers, managers, senior technicians) 129
Supervisory                                            826
Water production                                       472
Water distribution                                     523
Electricity production                                 253
Electricity distribution                               234
Clerks, meter readers, drivers, etc.                   953
3,390
Included in the 129 executives are 16 expatriates, none of whom occupy
line positions and about half of whom are provided under bilateral aid.
Regideso has gradually reduced its expatriate staff from more than 100 in
1971; nevertheless, an acceptable degree of management competence has been
maintained, and there is able leadership supported by goodwill and obvious
enthusiasm. Regideso has, in addition to some competent senior staff, been
able to attract some able young executives in the last two or three years.
3.09      Regideso's main problem is the shortage of trained technical
staff; its technicians are now thinly spread. There are few trade achools
in Zaire and competition for their graduates is keen; the level of training
is low and students obtain little more than superficial theoretical instruc-
tion. Regideso's management is conscious that it has to provide extensive
complementary training for its existing and newly recruited personnel. On
the other hand a 1974 manpower inventory revealed that about 400 of its
sxisting staff were hardly trainable; it is intended to phase them out gra-
dually. Regideso is making strenuous efforts to train the remainder 1/, and
the training element of the project is designed to assist Regideso in
systematising these efforts by setting up a comprehensive training program,
which is discussed in more detail in paragraphs 4.26-4.29.
Accounting and Auditing
3.10      Since 1967, financial control has gradually been introduced, and
it is becoming reasonably effective, enabling annual revenue and expenditure
budgets, monthly cash flow statements, sales statistics, details of arrears,
etc. to be produced with a reasonable degree of reliability. However, such
1/   A new extension of the Kinshasa Head Office serves as a temporary
training school. Regideso already runs 3 months' orientation courses
for middle management and courses for accountants. It also makes use
of INPP (institut National de Preparation Professionelle), mainly a
retraining organization, which trains carpenters, welders, pipe fitters,
electricians and auto mechanics.



statistice and statements are still produced with too much delay for ef-
fective use as tools of management, and improvements in this area will be
sought in the course of supervision missions (paragraph 5.13).
3.11      Regideso's annual financial statements are currently verified by
two officials appointed by the Government. Regideso has agreed to employ
professional auditors to audit their accounts. This undertaking has been
incorporated in the Credit Agreement (4.01(b)(i)).
4. THE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The Project represents approximately half of the 1975-78 slice of
Regideso'l overall investment program. Its components are:
(a)  construction of new production facilities and/or expansion
of existing facilities to provide continuous service
in six major cities: Lubumbashi, Kisangani, Kananga,
Mbuji-Mayi, Mbandaka and Kamina;
(b)  reinforcement and extension of distribution systems in
these clties to serve the entire urban area, primarily
through standpipes;
(c)  rehabilitation and modernization of the six cities' water
supply systems where it is economical;
(d)  a comprehensive training program and further technical
assistance to Regideso; and
(e)  feasibility studies for further extension of water supply
in the cities of the Project and in other towns, and for
severage in critical urban areas.
4.02      The following paragraphs sum up the present situation in the cities
of the Project, their problems and the remedies the Project would bring.
Existing facilities and details of the proposed improvements and additions
are described in more detail in Annex 2; essential data on the systems,
as they stand now and as they will appear after the completion of the Project,
are alseo shown on maps in the Annexes.
Lubumbashi
4.03      Lubumbashi is the capital city of Shaba Region.  It is the head-
quarters of a number of mining companies, an administrative center and a
place of university education and training, second only to Kinshasa in



- 9 -
economic importance. The population of Lubumbashi and its suburbs has
grown from about 200,000 in 1959 to an estimated 400,000 in 1973, and is
expected to exceed 550,000 by 1980. Population density varies between 20
to an extreme of 200 inhabitants per hectare. The standard of living in
Lubumbashi is probably the highest in Zaire.
4.04      The existing water supply system has a production capacity of about
61,600 m3/day, all from ground w ter. Average recorded consumption is
41,000 m /day, of which 17,000 m are sold to domestic consumers. Three-
quarters of the urban agglomeration ls served, but service is inadequate in
two-thirds of the areas supplied. At the end of 1973, there were about 20,500
connections and only two public standpipes were in operating condition.
Consumers with access to service used about 110 lcd on average.
4.05      The proposed new source is the Kasapa springs, whose yield is
estimated to be above the city's immediate requirements.  A study of ground
water resources around Lubumbashi is necessary in respect of longer term
requirements, and will involve close cooperation between Regideso and
Gecamines, the state-owned mining company, since in the area groundwater is
likely to be found in the same geological formations as copper.  Gecamines
is prepared to do the drilling required for the study. Funds from the
proposed Credit would be available for this study.
4.06    3 The proposed Project would increase the capacity of the system to
85,000 m /day, which corresponds to the needs of all the urban population up
to 1980. Three new storage reservoirs, establishing three pressure zonjs
instead of two, would bring the total storage capacity to about 9,000 m ,
only 10% of peak day demand. Th¶ Project would also include two pumping
stations, of 34,000 and 10,000 m /day effective capacity, 16 km of trans-
mission mains, 37 km of primary distribution pipes, secondary distribution
with about 90 km of pipes and 300 standpipes.
Kisangani
4.07      Kisangani, located at the confluence of the Tshopo and Zaire
Rivers by the Stanley Falls, 1,700 km upstream from Kinshasa, is a transit
and communications center with a university, but with only a few small
industries. Kisangani is the capital of Haut-Zaire Region and has been
designated as the focal point of a "Third Development Pole".
4.08      Kisangani's population has grown from about 125,000 in 1959 to
about 200,000 and is expected to reach 300,000 by 1980. The left bank
suburb (Lubunga).has some 35,000 inhabitants.
4.09      The main production facility is a treatment plans and pumping
station sn the Tshopo River, capable of producing 12,500 m /day out of the
14,500 m /day total production capacity, the balance being provided by
springs. The treatment plant is badly in need of rehabilitation. Domestic



- 10 -
consumption is about 5, 00 m3/day; industry and government (including the
Army) use about 2,000 m /day each; about 30% of the treated water is un-
accounted-for.3 At present, the effective capacity of the storage reservoir
is about 100 m , about 1% of the average daily consumption. The primary
distribution system is inadequate. There are 5,600 connections (3 per 100
inhabitants) and only four of the 39 public standpipes are in operating
condition. Served domestic consumers use an average of 75 lcd, but this
represents snly 14 lcd overall.  By 1980, domestic consumption is 3estimated
at 14,000 m /day, industry and government consumption at 11,000 m /day and
peak day demand at 34,500 m
4.10    3 The Project provides for a new treatment plant with a capacity of
20,000 m /day to be constructed beside the existing treatment plant,-and which
will also draw water from the Tshopo River.  New transmission mains totalling
82 km and 10.4 km of primary distribution mains would be added to the          3
rehabilitated distribution îystem, including two new water towers of 1,000 m
capacity each and a 3,000 m clear water storage reservoir. In addition, a
small treatment plant, pumping station and distribution system would be
built on the left bank.
Kananga
4.11      Kananga, located on a sandy plateau deeply indented by erosion,
is primarily a railway station and a major army camp. Its present popula-
tion of 405,000 is expected to exceed 550,000 by 1980. Kananga's population
density is relatively high, about: 200 inhabitants/ha.
4.12      At present, a 7,250 m 3day treatment plant uses most of the flow
on the Nganza River, whose water is heavily pol. uted. The treatment plant
is deficient, and water never reaches the 750 m water tower. About 40%
of the population is presently served, through 4,600 connections and
67 standpipes, many of which aie not in operating condi5ion. Total con-
sumption averages some 6,600 m /day; with about 3,000 m /day used for
domestic purposes.
4.13    3The proposed Project would increase production capacity to
24,000 m3/day. The 450,000 persons living in urbanized sections by year
1980 will be served, about 30% through private connections and 70% through
standpipes. The water would be drawn from the Tshibashi River and pumped a
distance of about 7 km to a treatment plant near the c nter of the city which
w9uld incorporate full treatment facilities, a 2,000 m reservoir and a 24,000
m /day effective capacity pumping station. The existing treatment plant
would be maintained as a standby unit, mainly to supply the nearby power
station. There would be four distrib4tion zones instead of a single zone;
two new water towerX of 500 and 300 m  capacity, bringing total storage
capacity to 2,150 m , or 9% of the increased production capacity.  20 km of
transmission mains would be laid, as well as 20 km of primary and 24 km of
secondary distribution pipes. Some 130 additional standpipes would be
installed to make piped water available to all.



4.14      Kananga currently suffers from a shortage of electricity, and
therefore a 500 kW diesel generator has been included in. the Project to
provide power to the pumping stations during peak hours.
Mbuj i-Mayi
4.15      Mbuji-Mayi, the capital of Eastern Kasai, has grown around Miba
(Societe Miniere de Bakwanga), a diamond mining company. Mbuji-Mayi was a
small town of about 40,000 people before 1960 and consisted almost exclusively
of the mining compound but, during the unsettled years which followed inde-
pendence, its population swelled to over 200,000 and is expected to reach
300,000 by 1980.
4.16      Mbuji-Mayi is located on a plateau astride a limestone - dolomitic
formation which contains an extended aquifer from which large crystal clear
springs well out near the city. Qne of these, the Muya spring, is tapped by
Regideso and yields more than 4 m /sec.  Thus there will be no problem of
water resources in Mbuji-Mayi, even in the long term.
4.17      Although the mining compound has an adequate water supply, the
growing city relies on a skeleton system which cur5ently is being improved.
Pumping capacity at the present supply was 3,600 m ~day in 1973, when total
consumption - primarily domestic - averaged 2,000 m /day. The quantity
of water available to those served through 1,600 connections averages
130 lcd, but is less than 10 lcd overall.
4.18      The Project would expand the pumping station of Muya Spring to a
peak capacity of 16,000 m /eay, allowing an average domestic consumption of
up to 7,000 m /day (2,500 m /day thïough standpipes) and government and com-
mercial consumption of some 3,700 m /day.  A transmission main 3.6 km long
would connect the Muya Spring to the downtown boos5er station, which would
be restoied and expînded to a capacity of 12,000 m /day. Two new reservoirs,
of 840 m and 500 m capacity, would be constructed, and there would be three
instead of two distribution zones. The increased storage capacity would
reach 15% of peak day demand. The distribution system would include 20 km of
primary and 55 km of secondary distribution mains and 130 additional stand-
pipes.
Mbandaka
4.19      Mbandaka, capital of the Equateur Region, lies on the navigable
stretch of the Zaire River, close to Important plantations. Its population
of 120,000 is expected to reach 180,000 by 1980.
4.20      The city draws its water supply from polluted waters of the Ruki
River n ar its confluence with the Zaire River.  T tal consumption is about
4,800 m /day compared with a production of 7,500 m /day. Two-thirds of
the consumption is for domestic purposes. There are 3,250 connections in the
city, and four water towers in poor condition.



- 12 -
4.21      1980 consumption is estimated at 12,000 m 3/day, of which large
consumers Nould use 4,000 m /day; peak day demand is projected at 17,500 m /day.
A 10,000 m /day treatment plant and pumping station near th5 Zaire river
would be constructed. A treated water reservoir of 2,000 m would be built
near the new treatment plant.  Pipes to be laid would comprise 1.3 km of
transmission mains, 46 km of primary distribution mains, and secondary
distribution pipes to supply 340 hectares. The existing treatment plant
would be rehabilitated.
Kamina
4.22      Kamina, the administrative center of a sub-region of Shaba, îs an
important junction of the Shaba-Kasai and Shaba-Kivu railway lines and also
an army depot.  Kamina's population is just under 100,000 and is expected to
reach 120,000 by 1980.  The existing water works draw water high in iron
content from seven boreholes in the sand aquifer beneath the city. The
treatment3plant is no longer operating adequately, and water does not reach
tle 300 m  capacity storage tower.  Sroduction capacity is less than 3,000
m /day; total consumption of 1,600 m /day is mainly domestic (1,100 m /day).
There are about 1,800 connections.
4.23      Demand is projected at 4.200 m3/day by 1980, three-fourths domestic.
Peak demand is estimated at 6,300 m /day. New boreholes would be dug and
the existing tratment plant rehabilitated.  Primary and se ondary distribu-
tion mains, 9.6 km and 7.5 km long would be laid. A 650 m water tover and
about 30 standpipes would be inclucled in the system.
Standpipes
4.24      In the sections of the six cities which at present are inadequately
served or not served at all, about 60% of the population would be supplied
through public standpipes at a consumption rate averaging 20 lcd; the
percentage of population served through standpipes would go up to 90% in the
very low income suburban villages. The design criteria chosen to determine
the required number of standpipes to be installed are a maximum distance of
330 m between the consumer's house and the public standpipe (5 minutes' walk)
and the 10 m3/day maximum flow of a standpipe tap. The number of persons
served by one tap would approximate 400; the area supplied by each standpipe
would depend on the number of taps installed, the population density in the
section, and the percentage of people to be supplied through standpipes, but
would in no case exceed 22 ha.
Rehabilitation
4.25      It is not feasible to determine the full extent of the work required
to repair leaks in the pipe system and the reservoirs and to recondition
pumping stations, treatment plants and meters; this will be known only after
detailed surveys or while construction is in progress. Because of this, the
cost of rehabilitation cannot be accurately estimated. A minimum figure has
been included in the cost estimates of the Project, plus the fees agreed with



- 13 -
the consulting engineers. However, rehabilitation is an essential component
of the six cities Project; this work will be given high priority and its co0t
in excess of the amount provided will be financed by Regideso (Annex 9
page 2 line 6200).
The Training Program
4.26      IDA's consultants carried out a complete study of Regideso's man
power requirements and have drawn up a training program which Regideso is
anxious to implement as soon as possible. The objective of this training
program (extracts in Annex 3) is to ensure that Regideso has enough trained
staff to operate its new and existing installations efficiently. At present,
a shortage of competent technicians and engineers leads to excessive division
of responsibilities at all levels and, therefore, to overstaffing as well as
poor operating results. Existing institutions of learning in Zaire cannot
satisfactorily train the number of staff Regideso needs in the different
fields; therefore, Regideso must take steps to meet its own training needs.
Although Regideso believes that it might operate as many as 81 water supply
centers by 1980, the proposed program is devised for a more realistic number,
60 (55 are presently in operation). 445 staff, of which 173 have yet to be
recruited, need tO be trained over the next five years in order to man the
60 centers adequately. However, since most of them would have to follow more
than one training course (of 2 to 8 weeks duration). a total of 1,128 man/
courses would be needed (Annex 3).
4.27      The proposed program is made up of on-the-job, workshop training,
classroom teaching and "retraining" classes; seminars would be organized for
managerial staff; overseas training also would be considered for specialists
or managers. The program is addressed to managers as well as stores clerks,
pipe fitters, plant operators, maintenance personnel, etc., with emphasis on
multi-skilled artisans in water and power operations. Training of specialists
for power production and distribution are not included in the program; the
future of Regideso's power operation is unclear, and in any case, it may be
possible to arrange for their training in conjunction with SNEL 1/ at SNEL's
new training facility.
4.28      Twelve resident expatriates (including specialists on short term
assignements) are needed to start the program and to staff it for the first
five-year period; their major task will be to select and train the Zairian
instructors to progressively take over the program. Training would be given
mainiy in Kinshasa (the training center would include classrooms, workshops,
practice sites, dormitory, copying equipment, etc.).
4.29      The training program 2/ is a key component of the Project and the
funds required for its implementation are a matter of high priority. A
request is being made by the Government for a UNDP grant ot USS1.4 million,
I/   SNEL:  Societe Nationale d'Electrlcite.

which would cover the foreign currency compensation of expatriates. Other
foreign costs, e.g. equipment and some training overseas, would be financed
by IDA (paragraph 4.37). Local currency expenditure would be paid for by
Regideso.
Cost Estimates
4.30      The estimated cost of the Project is summarized in the next page
and detailed in Annex 4.
4.31      These cost estimates were prepared by the mission and are expressed
in mid-1975 prices. They are based on data provided by the consultants who
carried out the feasibility study. Unit prices have been adjusted on the
basis of tenders received in February 1975 for the Kinshasa water mains proj-
ect financed by FED-EIB. The engineering costs for the new works are about
10% of construction costs and will ,over detailed engineering, construction
supervision and, in addition, survey and investigations to gather essential
data. The consultants' fees for rehabilitation of existing water works in
the six cities include detailed engineering for the restoration of existing
treatment plants, pumping stations and reservoirs, a leak detection program
and assistance for repairing the systems. 1/
4.32      Physical contingencies (15%) have been added.  Price contingencies,
calculated in line with recent information and experience average 48% for
local costs, somewhat higher than average for the country in view of the
uncertainty regarding local contract:ors; and 24% for foreign costs (see
Ainnex 4 page 3).
1/   It is expected that Regideso personnel will receive training for leak
detection mainly in Lumbumbashi and will carry out their own leak
detection program and repairs ili the other cities of the Project.

Financing
4.33      The financing of Regideso's overall investment program for the
years 1975-78 1/, of which the project represents about 50%, is discussed
in paragraphs 6.13 - 6.16.  The Project itself i8 intended to be financed
as follows:
Z million         US$ million
IDA credit                       10.7                21.5
ABEDA loan                        5.0                10

35.2               70.4
Procurement
4.34      All contracts over Z 50,,000 financed by the proposed credit will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines on procurement, allowing for the usual preference to
domestic suppliers and contractors. The laying of secondary distribution
pipes and the installation of standpipes do not lend themselves to large
scale construction contracts, since they usually consist of a scattered
number of relatively amall jobs. Regideso may therefore carry out these
works under force account.
4.35      Reforms are taking place in the construction lndustry.  The Gov-
ernment has recently nationalized all local contracting firms, although they
continue to operate essentially as before, with no apparent restriction on
competition.
Customs Duties and Taxes
4.36      Materials imported directly for Regideso's IDA Project are exempt
from customs duties and taxes. However, many construction materials for the
civil works would be purchased by contractors in the local market and hence
would be taxed. The amount of import duties and taxes is estimated at
US$6.3 million equivalent, or 9% of the total project cost.
1/   Financing has been calculated to correspond with committed expenditure
(Annex 4).

The estimated disbursement scheduiLe is given in Annex 5. It is based on the
construction schedule (Annex 6) wlich allows for a alippage of about eight
months in the construction of the Project. It provides for a delay between
the times when expenditures are incurred and payments are actually made.
4.38      Retroactive financing up to an amount of US$1.4 million is pro-
posed for paynents made to the consultants after August 1, 1975 for the
preparation of detailed engineering from the site survey stage to the bid
evaluation stages.
4.39      Subject to IDA approval, any possible undisbursed amount of the
credit after completion of the Project would be used for extension of
distribution systens or further improvement of production or transmission
facilities in the cities of-the Project, or for further feasibility studies
for subsequent projects.
Project Administration
4.40      Regideso has agreed to set up a "Project Unit" of at least nine
engineers and technicians vithin its Technical Department to administer and
supervise the construction of the J'roject with the assistance of the con-
sulting engineers.
4.41      Regideso has signed contracts with the consulting firm IGIP
(Darmstadt, Germany) in respect of four cities, and IEU-Dumons (Paris, France)
for Kisangani and Mvbandaka, _the terms of which are satisfactory to IDA.
Regideso is employing the same consultants to execute the Project. Details of
consultancy fees are given in Annex 13.
4.42      The consulting engineers will take responsibility for Project pro-
gress reports and documentation, and the contracts make explicit provision
for the training of members of Regldeso's staff in contract administration,
construction documentation, and project supervision.
Construction Schedule
4.43      Detailed engineering started in September 1975 in 4 cities.  If the
proposed schedule is adhered to, the major contracts could be awarded by
June 1976 and construction completed two years later (June 1978). However,
problens of delivery and of inland transportation (delay, loss and damage)
and a shortage of qualified interested contractors may lengthen the construc-
tion period.  Provision, therefore, has been made for a delay of about eight
months in the supply of equipment to Zaire, the completion of civil works
and the installation of equipment. This extended construction period of about
two and a half years (June 1976 to December 1978) has been taken into account
in the cost estimates, disbursement schedule, construction schedule and
financial projections (Annexes 4, 5, 6 and 9). It is expected that the new



- 19 -
installations will be in full operation at the end of 1978, even though the
payment of final invoices and retention monies may not actually be made until
vell into 1979.
Ecological Implications
4.44      No significant adverse effects can be expected from the Project.
Hovever, there are a few high density areas in the cities of the Project,
particularly Lubumbashi, where the availability of more water would increase
existing wastewater disposal problems; this makes sewerage an important con-
sideration in the next stage of investment projects in the sector. The Pro-
ject provides for severage studies, but availability of funds to undertake
major sewer construction projects is a problem which has to be taken into
considération in the light of other government priorities. Individual house-
hold systems and facilities can be effectively employed in many of the cities
because of the comparatively low density and the generally permeable soil
conditions.
5. JUSTIFICATION AND BENEFITS
Physical Objectives and Benefits
5.01      The project would make safe water available to the bulk of the
inhabitants of six major cities, less than a third of whose population is
now served, inadequately and intermittently. Outside of Kinshasa, this is
the first large scale project the objective of which is to satisfy essential
needs in major, urban agglomerations, particularly in the post independence
suburbs (cités) where migrants from the country have settled "en masse"
over the past 15 years. The project would provide safe water to about 0.7
to 1 million additional urban poor; it is also expected to reduce signifi-
cantly the high incidence of mortality and disease caused by the prevalence
of water borne agents.
5.02      While the Project would substantially improve the existing situation,
it is not designed to bring water supply facilities up to a standard usually
considered adequate for serving ample quantities of water to all potential
consumers. The scope of the Project has had to be limited and a 1980 horizon
set owing to the scarcity of funds available for investment. Moreover, basic
data regarding population, potential consumers, ability to pay for water, and
demand are so unreliable that it is considered preferable to risk under-
estimating overall demand and still serve the basic needs of more people
in more cities, than to possibly over-design and reduce the number of cities
in the Project to match available investment funds. However, the new facili-
ties would be designed for subsequent expansion.



- 20 -
5.03      The Project combines urban type production facilities with rural
type distribution systems through standpipes in low income areas; more than
half of the new consumers are intended to be served by public standpipes;
those served by private connections will pay for the cost of connection to
the main (see paragraph 6.07). Meters are to be provided by Regideso outside
the scope of the Project. The ovterall investment cost of about Z 20 - 40 per
additional person served is reasonable. Annex 7 (pages 1-6) gives an estimate
of actual and forecast operating results in the six selected cities from
1973 to 1980.
Long-Term Marginal Costs
5.04      The return on investment averages 8% without using shadow prices,
and ranges from a low of 4% in Kananga to a high of 11% in Kisangani (Annex 8,
page 1). Shadow pricing foreign exchange at 160% to reflect the adjusted
economic value of foreign exchange to Zaire, and unskilled labor at 75%, the
average rate of return is 6%, with a low of 2% and a high of 8%. These figures
do not demonstrate the economic merits of the Project, but do indicate that
water price levels tend to be low. The long-term marginal cost of supplying
water in each of the six cities has been calculated at varying discount rates
between 8% and 12%, with and without shadow pricing foreign exchange and un-
skilled labor as above (Annex 8, page 2).  Using a discount ïate of 10% and
shadow prices, the overall long-t,erm marginal cost is 20 K4m , about 50%
higher than Regideso's current average tariff of 13.25 K/m . There is, how-
ever, a wide disparity in the long-term marginal costs, city by city,3as
shown in Annex 8 (less than 14 K/m  in Mbuji-Mayi to more than 30 K/m  in
Kananga).  By charging the long mn marginal cost price for potable water
the Government will be assured that increments in the consumption of potable
water are valued by consumers at least as much as the national resources which
are consumed in providing those increments, i.e. water consumers will be able
to indicate by their behavior tha1: the benefits of the additional water supplied
are greater than the costs. Furthermore, it is recognized that to the extent
that charging the real long run marginal cost of water will slow the growth
in consumption and otherwise allow production cost savings to be achieved it
may be possible to postpone the need for future water supply, capital expendi-
tures by a few years. Also, a consistent pricing of water at a level equal
to the long run marginal cost of providing that water will help commerce and
industry to make informed decisions about the need for water saving technology
and potable water substitutes, and. about where it is best to expand operations
and/or locate. Therefore, the Government and Regideso have undertaken, to
commission a tariff study and to review the present tariff structure and
levels in line with its results before June 30, 1977 (Section 4.03 of the
Credit Agreement).
Demand Forecasts
5.05      Annex 7 (page 7-8) gives the data available regarding consumption
and production in the six cities of the Project and for Regideso as a whole.
Metering is deficient at both production and consumption points; there is a



- 21 -
severe shortage and a marked lack of accuracy in metering equipment. Fixed
charge billing based on past records, a usual and normal expedient to cope
with deficient meters, is unduly widespread. Such practices render consump-
tion statistics and estimates of unaccounted-for water unreliable. Most
systems operate at maximum capacity; service is intermitent in many served
areas, and about two-thirds of the new urban settlements are without any
water supply at all; consequently, there is a sizeable unsatisfied demand
but this cannot be estimated with any accuracy. Furthermore, available
population data are very unreliable, and the reaction of the population in
unserved areas to the availability of piped water for which they have to pay
cannot be predicted.
5.06      As a result of this situation, the consultants have estimated:
(a) the domestic demand by areas in the cities on the basis of
recorded consumption where available. Where there are no
records, it is proposed to provide 50 to 80 lcd to the 40%
of the population who would be privately connected and 17
to 20 lcd to the 60% to be served through standpipes. The
50 to 80 lcd projection for private consumption is a low
figure, but new connections will include more small consumers
from lower income groups than at present. Population growth
has been assumed at 4.5 - 6% per annum.
(b)  the consumption of industry, commercial establishments,
Government, etc. separately, with an allowance for further
growth and probable new developments.
5.07      Seasonal fluctuations have been estimated at 110% or 120% and
unaccounted-for water has been calculated at 20% or 25%; design of the dis-
tribution system is based on peak hour consumption being twice as high as
average hourly consumption of the peak day; storage reservoirs are generally
designed to hold 10% to 15% of estimated peak day demand. These criteria are
reasonable and modest for present conditions.
Alternatives
5.08      The consultants have selected the most economic alternative to meet
the criteria discussed above and achieve the service objectives described in
paragraph 5.01 for each city of the Project. Ground water is being relied
upon wherever practicable, taking into consideration known availability and
urgency of the works. Existing waterworks will be rehabilitated, with the
exception of the Kananga treatment plant, whose raw water supply is excessively
polluted.
Institutional Objectives
5.09      Regideso's energetic management, as evidenced by its initiatives
to implement the WHO/IBRD sector study recommendations, has contributed to



- 22 -
the organization's improved performance. The Project is expected to accele-
rate this process, primarily through the expansion of training (paragraphs
4.26 - 4.29). Improvements are also expected as a result of on-the-job
training by the consulting engineer, particularly in such areas as design of
facilities, construction supervision, leak detection, project management,
and the operation of new installations.
5.10      Regideso could only impLement this sizeable project in six cities
with the assistance of experienced consultants, and should be able - as a
result of the training component of the Project, which would yield its first
group of trainees just before construction is completed - to staff and
operate the new and rehabilitated waterworks in the six cities at an
acceptable level.
Problems, Monitoring and Supervision
5.11      The following problems are likely to be encountered during the
execution of the Project:
(a) Local costs could escalate beyond the'estimated contingency
allowances.
(b) Inland transportation and construction of civil works may
be major causes of unforeseen delay, even though an additional
eight months have been added to the construction schedule.
(c) Inflation and other factors may cause Regideso's operating
costs to exceed present estimates, thus reducing the internal
funds earmarked for the Project. In this case other invest-
ments would have to be curtailed, tariffs raised, or Govern-
ment participation increased.
(d) The introduction of a system of charges for vater at public
standpipes is likely to present problems.
5.12      In view of these risks and its complexity, the Project will require
close supervision and monitoring. A list of monitoring indicators has been
drawn up and is given in Annex l1.
6. REGIDESO'S FINANCES
Background
6.01      Until 1973, Regideso's statutes required only that it should cover
its operating costs and provide depreciation on its own assets (but not on
the bulk of the assets for which lt: was responsible, which vere provided by
Government); Government was expected to pay for aIl new facilities. Regideso 's
revenues barely met its operating outlays (and in some years did not). How-
ever, no debts were incurred, and consequently there vere no debt service
charges.



- 23 -
6.02      Under its new statutes (paragraph 3.04), Regideso is expected to
finance a substantial part of its investments out of internal cash generation
and borrowings.  From July 1, 1974, Regideso's water tariffs were increased
and its electricity tariffs reduced (paragraphs 6.06 - 6.08).
Financial Results
6.03      Until 1973 approximately two-thirds of Regideso's revenues were
derived from water and one-third from electricity.  Owing to a high thermal
tariff, Regideso's electricity operations were profitable, but water supply
resulted in a small loss.  Under the new tariffs (paragraphs 6.06 - 6.08)
1975 projections show that 85% of Regideso's revenues vill be derived from
water and only 15% from electricity operations, which vill result in a loss
of about Z 1.1 million while the net income on vater supply operations are
forecast at Z 5.3 million. Regideso's financial statements for 1973 and
1974 and projections for 1975-1980 are given in Annex 9. Regideso's rate
of return on average net fixed assets in operation was barely positive in
1973, but, as a result of the new water tariff, rose to about 12% in 1974
and is expected to exceed 14% in 1975-1977. It is then likely to drop
sharply to about 4% in 1979 and 1980 because the book value of the asset base
will be more than tripled in 1979 by the commissioning of the Project. This
îs acceptable in view of the fact that Regideso's average depreciation is
high (4.4%) and Regideso's projected cash flow is substantial.
6.04      Records of Regideso's assets were not properly maintained between
1960 and 1967, so that the book values of its fixed assets are understated.
A revaluation exercise was carried out at the end of 1973. Regideso has under-
taken to incorporate the resultant surplus (about Z 6.2 million) in its books
(Section 4.01 (c) i of the Credit Agreement). This sum has been lncluded in
the financial forecasts (Annex 9).
6.05      Regideso's water supply operations extend over 55 urban centers
with populations varying between nearly 2 million (Kinshasa) to a few
thousand only. The distribution of consumption between the 55 centers is
quite uneven. Two centers, Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, consume about two-thirds
of all the water sold and produce about two-thirds of Regideso's water sales
revenue. Newer and smaller centers, where the cost of production per m3 is
higher, are generally subsidized by older and larger ones.
Tariffs
6.06      On July 1, 1974 a revised national water tariff vas introduced
(Annex 10), which maintains the former increasing block structure. The
revised tariff has increased Regideso's vater revenues by about 135%. The
revision was in line with Regideso's statutes (paragraph 6.02) and with
the recommendations of the WHO/IBRD sector study that tariffs should be
raised, and has substantially restored Regideso's financial situation.  Uti-
lizing an adJusted rate of exchange (paragraph 5.04) the average tariff of
K 13.25 per m (US$0.65 per 1000 US gals.) is about the average for African
cîties, but operating medium sized systems and supplying low density areas is



- 24 -
costly, and periodical tariff increases will be needed to offset the effect
of inflation on operating costs, and to ensure that Regideso's cash flow 's
sufficient to maintain a reasonable self-financing ratio of investments
(paragraph 6.19).
6.07      The rates for the lowest and highest blocks of the present tariff
(Annex 10) are in the ratio of 1 to 19. Even when the minimum charge of K5
per month and the meter rental are taken into account, the lower block is
well below cost.  More ver this lower block tariff is available for a con-
sumption of up to 15 m /mont , a quantity which exceeds normal low income house-
hold consumption (nearer 5 m /mornth). When water becomes available, the high
prepayable connection charge, which represents more than two months of an
average tradesman's wages, may deter many low income families from having
private connections. In those established sections where it is proposed to
install individual connections, it may be advisable to allow consumers to pay
for the connection charge over orLe year or more. Regideso is already allow-
ing some latitude in the payment of connection charges, and is aiming to
systematize this method of spreading the payments.
6.08      At the same time that water tariffs were raised, Regideso's thermal
electric tariff, which was substantially higher than the hydroelectric tariff,
was abolished in favor of a national electricity tariff, which is approximately
50% higher than the old hydro tariff, but still only about one-fifth of the
diesel production cost. Although Regideso sells roughly three times more
electricity of hydro origin than thermal electricity, the abolition of the
diesel tariff, coupled with the world price increase of fossil fuels, is
expected to result in operating losses (before overheads) on its electricity
operation of about Z 1.1 million in 1975 and Z 1.2 million in 1976. Since
Regideso's 27 diesel systems distribute only about 1% of the electricity
consumed in Zaire, it is not proposed to ask for the restoration of a higher
thermal tariff at this stage.
6.09      It has been assumed in the financial projections that Regideso
will receive subsidies to cover its operating losses on electricity starting
with 1977 (Annex 9, p. 1, line 5020). This would take the form of Government
grants, or possibly be provided by a small surcharge on all electricity
accounts, including those of SNEL's clients. This subsidy or surcharge
would also cover all of Regideso's investments in new power facilities and
would obviate a cross subsidy from the water consumers, which is undesirable.
Government and Regideso have agreed, at negotiations, on the institution of
such an electricity surcharge or subsidy by 1977 (Section 4.04 of the Credit
Agreement).
Standpipe Charges
6.10      The Project proposes distribution by public standpipes for more
than 60% of the new consumers to be served, primarily because this is the
most economic method of providing service to the most people with the funds
available. This method of distribution creates the need for a system of



- 25 -
recovering the associated charges. The predominant cause of Regideso's
unwillingness to expand standpipe service was the nonpayment of such charges
by the municipalities. Regideso intends to charge the current average price
of 13.25 k/m at the standpipes for water drawn. The introduction of charges
for water at standpipes has usually presented problems, but it is expected
that Regideso will be able to overcome these problems. The arrangements for
the proposed system, which is subject to introductory trials at existing
standpipes during the project construction period, were agreed at negotiations
(Section 4.05 of the Credit Agreement). These proposals are summarized in
Annex 12 and any changes to the proposed system will be subject to IDA's
approval.
Accounts Receivable
6.11      Private consumer's arrears are expected to be reduced from an
average of six mohths in 1974 to four months in 1977 because Regideso is
applying a strict disconnection policy in respect of delinquents. On the
other hand, Government departments and para-statal organizations had accumu-
lated, at the end of 1975, arrears of more than Z 5 million (about one year's
consumption). The State Commissioner for Finance undertook on February 7,
1975, as a condition of the FED/EIB loan, to pay for the current monthly
consumption of all Government agencies in full, by means of a monthly
payment of Z 450,000 p.m. including Z 172,000 on account of past arrears.
This undertaking is reportedly being complied with, but the monthly payment
will have to be increased to about Z 720,000 per month starting in January
1976, in order to liquidate the arrears by the end of 1977. This was agreed
at negotiations and the Government's undertaking is contained in of the Credit
Agreement (Section 4.06).
Regideso's Investment Program
6.12      In order to supply Zaire's urban areas, Regideso is faced with
enormous needs and a potentially large investment program. However, in view
of the limited availability of investment funds and the shortage of technical
staff, a relatively modest investment program (of which the project is only
part), is envisaged for the period 1975-1978. The estimated cost of this
program is as follows:

67.1
/1   This program covers expenditures committed in 1976-1978 (see Annex 4)
although some payments wvould in fact be made in 1979 due to normal
delays in billing, retention money, additional work, etc.
A few studies are under way in respect of some of the proposed investments
(see paragraph 2.20), but with the exception of the FED/EIB and IDA pro-
jects, no feasibility studies or f'irm proposals are yet available. UNDP will
be asked to finance a study of ground vater resources in a number of existing
and proposed distribution centers. With the exception of the proposed Pro-
ject and of the EIB Project, which is under construction, the figures in the
above table are indicative and no inflation co-efficient has been applied to
them.
6.13      Regideso's investments for the years 1975-78 will probably be
financed as follows:
Z million
Project external financing
-    IDA Credit             10.7
-    ABEDA loan               5.0
-    AfDB loan               3.1

Government budgetary appropriations (paragraph 6.16)                8.0
Government additional contribution (paragraph 6.09)                 8.9
Consumer Contributions                                              0.8
Total                                                         67.1



- 27 -
6.14      Details of Regideso's proposed borrowings and the debt service
thereon are given in Annex 9, pp. 4 and 5 ADB's loan vill be for period of
15 years including 4 years grace at 7% interest. Lending terms of the ABEDA
loan and onlending terms of the IDA Credit are 25 years with a 5 year grace
period; the rate of interest is 4% for the ABEDA loan'and 8-1/2% for the
IDA Credit. Regideso is expected to finance, out of internal funds, about
40% of its investments in 1975-78.
6.15      Cash generated by Regideso over the expected four year period of
the project (1975-78) is estimated (Annex 9, page 2) as follows:
Z million
Net income before interest                        15.9
Depreciation                                      10.8
Decrease in Working Capital including cash /1    2.1
28.8
Less:  Debt Service                                2.5
26.3
/1   Including repayment of Government arrears (see paragraph 6.11).
Regideso should be able to finance, from internal resources, all local currency
coste of the Project including about Z 1.5 million indirect use of foreign
exchange.  Should Regideso's cash flow projections prove unduly optimistic,
or if other factors e.g. inflation in excess of the amount provided (Annex 9,
page 1, line 4700), should adversely affect Regideso's cash flow, some non-
project investments would have to be dropped.
6.16      The Government undertook, in 1973, to provide a budgetary appro-
priation of Z 2 million annually during the years 1974-78 for Regideso invest-
ments in new facilities. The continuation of this funding, at least until
1978, has been confirmed during negotiations (Section 4.07 of the Credit
Agreement).
Financial Convenants
6.17      The FED/EIB Kinshasa mains project, which is already under way,
together with the proposed IDA Project would have precedence over any major
new works. At negotiations, the Government undertook to provide the funds
required to complete the Project and, in order to achieve this, to curtail,
if necessary other investments (except the FED/EIB Kinshasa project) until
after its completion.



- 28 -
6.18      In view of Regideso's anticipated rapid growth, it is considered
desirable to link its cash flow to its fixed asset base, if only to ensure
that it can self finance a reasonable proportion of future investments. The
Guarantor has convenanted, in the Credit Agreement (Section 4.08), to
maintain tariffs (and operating subsidy for power, see paragraph 6.09)
at a level that would allow Regideso's net internal cash generation 1/ in
any calendar year to be at least equal to seven percent of the net value
of fixed assets in operation, periodically revalued, plus construction
work ln progress.
6.19      To avoid excessive borrowing and the consequent heavy annual debt
service charges, Regideso has agreed to obtain IDA's agreement before incur-
ring debt in excess of Z 2 million (EIB and Project loans excluded) per year
in any of the five calendar years 1976-1980. Regideso also agreed to give
IDA a detailed list of its ongoing and intended construction projects as of
December 31, 1975, and review with IDA, each year until 1980, its investment
program and cash flow projections for the next three years (Section 4.10 of
the Credit Agreement).
6.20      Regideso's power and water accounts are kept separately, with
the exception of central and regional overheads. Sound financial management
implies the pricing of each service to reflect as accurately as possible
actual costs. Regideso has agreed to proceed to an allocation of overheads
in accordance with accepted accounting principles 2/. This was confirmed at
negotiations (Section 4.01 (c) ii of the Credit Agreement).
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
(a) Regideso's annual financial statements will be audited
annually by independent accountants acceptable to IDA
(paragraph 3.11).
(b) Regideso will carry out the training program recommended
(Annex 3) and provide the funds necessary out of their
investment and recurrent: budgets (paragraph 4.31).
(c)  Regideso will employ engineering consultants satisfactory
to IDA in carrying out the project (paragraph 4.41).
(d) Goverument and Regideso will commission a study of its
present tariff structure and residential connection
policy (paragraphs 5.04).
1/   Definition of Net Internal Cash Generation:  Net income before interest
plus provision for depreciation, less debt service and increase in
working capital.
2/   Such an allocation has already been made in respect of the 1974 results.



- 29 -
(e)  The 1973 assets revaluation will be incorporated in
Regideso's books (paragraph 6.04).
(f)  The expected deficit in Regideso's power operations will
be covered by a subsidy or a surcharge (paragraph 6.09).
(g) A system for standpipe water charges is being tested, and
its general implementation is subject to IDA's approval
(paragraph 6.10).
(h)  Government will pay periodically, in full, to Regideso its
current water and power consumption plus a monthly payment
on account of arrears (paragraph 6.11) so that arrears
are settled by December 1977 at the latest.
(M)  Government will maintain its annual budget allocation
for Regideso water projects at a minimum of Z 2 million at
least until the end of 1978 and will also provide the full
investment cost of all electricity projects (paragraph 6.16).
(j) Government and Regideso will maintain the water and power
tariffs at a level that, with any power subsidy, will
allow Regideso's net internal cash generation in any
calendar year to be at least equal to 7% of the net value
of fixed assets in operation plus work in progress
(paragraph 6.18).
(k) Regideso will seek IDA's agreement whenever consideration
is being given to borrowings of more than Z 2 million per year
(1976 to 1980) and will review annually with IDA its investment
program. Regideso vill also submit to IDA, at each year end,
cash flow projections for the next three years (paragraph 6.19).
(1) Regideso will allocate its central and regional overheads to
power and water operations in accordance with sound accounting
principles (paragraph 6.20).
7.02      The Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$21.5 million.

ZAIRE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Existing Facilities and Description of the Project
1. LUBUMBASHI
Existing Facilities
1.1       Lubumbashi, except for Gecamines and a few private organizations
(which have their own adequate water supplies), is supplied with ground water
fromi the Kimilolo springs and from3the Ruashi boreholes with a combined in-
stalled capacity of about 61,000 m /day.
1.2       The Kimilolo plant, 8 km southwest of the town taps karstic sp5ings
near the river Kimilolo3and, after chlorine disinfection, pumps 56,000 m /day
of water into a 3,500 m downtown reservoir. The plant is in good condition
but the maximum water yield of the site is reached. The three Ruashi bore-
holes, irilled in an old copper ore quarry 10 km northeast of the town, yield
4,800 m /day3of water which is pumped, with the help of a booster station,
into a 650 m downtown res rvoir. The pump sets need to be replaced, but
no more than about 5,500 m /day can be obtained from this aquifer.
1.3       The distribution netowrk3consists of two zones.  The low3level
zone is supplied by a main 3,500 m  reservoir aud the Ruashi 650 m  reser-
voir. îhe high level zone is served by a 500 m reservoir supplied by a
7,200 m /day booster station near the main reservoir. The network covers
about 75% of the urban area, but about two-thirds of the network needs rein-
forcement. Roughly 87% of the 20,500 connections are metered. The5e are
now only two piblic standpipes. Total production is about 61,600 m /day, of
which 17,000 m /day (42%), is used by domestic consumers. Overall consumption
per capita of the 375,000 persons having access to service is about 108 1/day
but domestic consumption is only 45 1/day, the rest being consumed by
Government, trade and industry.
Water Sources
1.4       There are two large waterbearing limestone or dolomite formations
in the mining area of Shaba which yield large quantities of water and can be
tapped for the water supply of large towns or cities. Copper ore usually is
associated with the largest of these formations: If this ore is mined, pre-
sent and potential future water sources could be affected. Because of this,
the Ruashi boreholes and the projected borehole in the "Etoile" mine are
precarious supplies.
1.5       As an alternative other similar springs in the vicinity (i.e., 10-
15 km away) could be tapped. However, gauging of flow and ground water



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 10
exploration are practically non-existent, although records over a long period
(say a minimum of 6-10 years) vould be necessary for rational planning of
source development. As there is no possibiltty of delaying the provision
for additional supplies, it is proposed to tap the Kasapa springs, the
closest available sources, the combined safe yield of which is estimated to
exceed 24,000 m /day, and to design the Project for this yield.
The Project
1.6       The project is designed t:o supply piped water to all of the 550,000
people expected by 1980. It is assumed that in the areas which are not now
served, about 40% of the population will be supplied through private connections
with 50 l/capita/day and 60% through public standpipes with 17 1/day. Assum-
ing unaccountei - for water of 20% the total production required by 1980 is
about 71,000 m /day, of which some 38% will be provided for domestic use and
the remainder for Government, trade and industry.
1.7       The new works required to met these needs consist of:
-    the protection3and the tapping of the River Kasapa springs
and a 34,000 m /day effective capacity pumping station
(315 KVA). Provision will be made to contruct a filtration
plant in the future if it becomes necessary;
3
-    a new 10,000 m /day effective capacity pumping station
(500 KVA) near the main reservoir to supply a high level
area;
-    a 600 mm diameter, ll km long transmission main from the
river Kasapa to a dountown reservoir;
-    a 300 mm diameter, 4.5 km long transmission main between
the Ruashi boreholes and a downtovn reservoir;
-    reinforcement of and extension to the primary distribution
network (37.4 km of 100 m to 500 mm diameter mains) which
will be expanded to three distribution zones from the present
tvo;
-    extensions to the secondary distribution network (90 km
of mains up to 100 mm in diameter) with about 290 public
standpipes; and
-    three service reservoirs of 3,500 m 3, 1,400 m3 and 750 m3
capacity; and



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 10
2. tISIJCAUI
Existing Facilities
2 1       Near the river Tshopo on the outskirts of the city, a 12,500
m /day treatment plant and pumping station produce 86% of the water distri-
buted in Kisangani. A pumping station draws the raw water from a diversion
canal supplying a hydropover station and delivers it to the nearby vater
works.  The treatment consists of aeration, flocculation, sedimentation, fil-
tration, pH adjustment and disinfection. Three pumps high-service draw the
treated vater from two 350 m3 reservoirs and deliver it to the network.
2.2       The remainder of the production (2,000 m /day) comes from three
springs located 4 km and 10 km to the east of the city in the university
area, and from one spring which supplies the part of city located on the
left bank of the Zaire river.  The related facilities comprise collecting
pipes or adits, a section reservoir, and a pumping station with provision
for disinfection. Filtration facilities also exist at the 10th km and at
the left bank spring but they are often out of service.
2.3       All the facilities are in rather poor condition but restoration
is possible.
2.4  3    The network's three elevated reservoirs have a combined capacity of
320 m  but two of them are always empty, vater production being substantially
less than demand.
2.5       The distribution network is 214 km long and includes pipe up to
300 mm in diameter. The pipes mainly are made of steel (97%) with the
remainder of asbestos-cement. There are some 5,600 connections. Since un-
accounted-for Nater is about 30% of pioduction, water sales amount only to
about 10,000 m /day, of vhich 3,000 m /day is for domestic use and the rest
for Government, trade and industry. Out of the 220,000 people living in the
city, it is estimated that only 36% (i.e. 79,200) are served by piped water.
Average consumption per capita of the people served is 126 1/day and domestic
consumption only about 38 1/day.
Water Sources
2.6       Four alternatives have been considered for the new production works.
The geology of the area shows that there is very little prospect of tapping
substantial amounts of water through deep boreholes; further, a series of
shallow vells constructed in the alluvial plain of the Zaire system of rivers
appears to be an expensive solution due to the number of wells needed and
the distance between the wells and the city; moreover, it could not be im-
plemented until after a year-long investigation had been completed. Ground
water therefore, is not a practical alternative for this Project. The three
other alternatives involve drawing surface water from the Zaire river, either



ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 10
upstream or downstream of the city,, or from the Tshopo river. The last
alternative is the least costly. This has been selected because it permits
location of the new treatment plant: beside the existing one and thus leads
to economies in the cost of operating the future and the existing water
plants and also reduces the cost of rehabilitation of the existing plant
(there would be a single worksite)..
The Project
2.7       The Project is designed 1:o supply water to all of the 300,000
persona expected to be living in the city by 1980. It is assumed that the
45% of the population will be supp]ied by private connections and will con-
sume an average of 80 lcd. The remaining 55Z supplied by public standpipes
vill consume an average of 20 lcd. Assuming unaccounted-for water of 20%,
peak production requirements by 1980 would be 34,000 m per day, of which
56% would be required to meet domestic needs.
2.8       The new works required to meet this demand consist cf:
-    a new intake on the3river Tshopo; a raw vater pumping
station; a 20,000 m /day treatment plant with flocculation,
sedimentation, filtration, pH adjustment and disinfection
facilities ,3together with a treated water pumping station
of 20,000 m /day effective capacity;
-    transmission mains 8.2 kul in length and 500 mm in diameter;
-    a primary distribution network 10.4 km long consisting of
mains ranging from 200 mrn up to 400 mm diameter in size
and a secondary network with standpipes (the network would
cover about 950 hectares',; and
-    one ground level reservoir of Î,000 m  capacity, and two
elevated reservoirs of l,000 m each.
3. KANANGA
Existing Facilities
3.1       Kananga presently is senred by two water treatme5t plants.  The
larger one, on the river Nganza, has a capacity of 7,250 m /day. The
treatment is comprehensive and comprises flocculation, sedimentation, filtra-
tion and disinfection. The raw water, which is drawn downstream from the
city, is of poor quality. The quantity abstracted from this small river is
already the maximum flow available. Although constructed in 1950, the plant
already is obsolete and in poor condition. A pumping station located adjacent
to the treatment plant delivers the treated water into the distribution
system.



ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 10
3.2       The second treatment plant is smaller (1,970 m3 /day) and the
treatuent is simpler (neutralization and 4isinfection). The vater is
pumped to the military camp vhere a 600 m elevated reservoir is located.
3.3       A 750 m3 service reservoir located downtown is in quite good con-
dition but is always empty due to the water available (6,620 m /day) being
less than half the demand.
3.4       The distribution network (128 km of mains up to 250 mm diameter)
provides service to about 800 ha, only 44% of the urban area. All of the
network needs reinforcement. About 65% of the mains are steel while the
other 35% are asbestos cement. Practically, all of the 4,200 connections
are metered.3 Unaccounted-for water approximates 30%, with salsa averaging
only 6,620 m /day. Domestic consumption is 46%, i.e., 3,050 m /day with
the rest consumed by Government, trade and industry. Of the 405,000 city
residents only 250,000 are served and their average consumption is 27 lcd,
although domestic consumption is only 12 lcd.
Water Sources
3.5       The least-costly alternative consists of an intake in the Tshibashi
river about 7 km from the city, supplying raw vater to a treatment plant to
be located in the city. There is no prospect of ground water since the more
or less permeable formations overlying the "crystalline" basement rock are
too small to yield significant supply for a large city, and the basement rock
has little ground water potential (see the geological maps). Other rivers
located more distant from the city also exist. There are no gauging records
for any river in the area3 although the estimated minimum flow of the
Tshibashi 5iver (over 2 m /sec) far exceeds the Project requirements (less
than 1/4 m /sec), so that there is no risk of failure of the source.
The Project
3.6       The Project is designed to supply piped water to all of the town's
450,000 inhabitants expected to be living in in the urbanized sections by
the year 1980. It is assumed that 130,000 people about 29% of the population
would be served through private metered connections with average consumption
of 50 lcd and 320,000 people (71%) through public standpipes with consumption
averaging 17 lcd. Assuming unaccountei-for water of 20%, the total product-
ion required by 1980 is about 19,500 m /day, of which 72% vill meet the
domestic needs.
3.7       The new works comprise the following:
-    an intake in the river Tshibashi and a 24,000 m /day
effective capacity raw water pumping station (starting
power required 2,000 KVA). The civil works will be
designed for the 19853horizon, i.e. for eventual
extension to 60,000 m /day capacity;

a treatment plant vith flocculation, sedimentation 3and
filtration of the river Tahibashi vate , a 2,000 m
treated water reservoir and a 24,000 a /&fy treated
vater pumping station (pover required 315 KVA);
a transmission main, 500 mm in diameter, 7.5 km long,
between the new raw water pumping station and the treatment
plant and three other mains (13 km total length of 300 mm,
400 mm and 500 mm diameter pipes) between the treated water
pumping station and the three service reservoirs;
a primary distribution network (20 km of 100 mm to
600 mm diameter mains);
a secondary distribution network (24 km of mains up
to 100 mm in diameter) with about 130 public standpipes;
two sirvice reservoirs having a capacity of 500 m  and
300 m ; and
-    a 500 kW diesel generator.
Pover Supply
3.8       At present, Kananga is short of pover and its generation plant is
operated vithout standby capacity; Regideso is adding tvo second hand 1,000
kW diesel generator sets to the existing poverhouse. Unsatisfied demand is
estimated at the capacity of one "new" generator but could be much greater.
Taking into account the need for standby capacity, the pover plant will still
not be capable of producing the additional 500 kW needed for the water when
the Project is completed. Further extensions of the pover plant are as yet
in the early planning stage (a Belgian consulting firm has been appointed
to conduct a study). A 500 kW diesel generator therefore has been included
in the Project to serve as power supply during peak hours; it could be moved
elsewhere when the paver supply in Kananga is normalized.
4.   MBUJI-MAYI
Existing Facilities
4.1       Mbuji-Mayi's piped water Ls drawn from a beautiful karstic spring
called Muya.  Existing facilities are inadequate tq meet present demands.
The pumping station can only deliver about 3,5703e /day, through two trunk
mains, 200 mm and 300 mm in diameter, to a 920 m reservoir located downtown.
From this reservoir the lowest part of the city is supplied by gra3ity while
the highest part is supplied through a booster station and a 460 m reservoir.
The distribution network consists o:E 70 km of mains up to 350 mm in diameter
and mainly (99%) of steel. It covers 2,004 hectares, or approximately 70%

of the urban area. Of the 1,680 existing connections only 938 are metered.
Since u accounted-for water approximates 43% of production, sales total only
2,050 m /day of which 72% is used by domestic consumers. Of 220,000 inhabi-
tants, only 155,000 are served. Average consumption per capita of those served
is about 13 1/day, although domestic consumption is only 10 1/day. There are
15 standpipes, but most inhabitants obtain their water from neighbors' taps.
Water Sources
4.2       Mbuji-Mayi developed on a plateau at whose base lies a large lime-
stone-dol9mitic formation which extends (see geological map) over more than
10,000 km and which contains an extended aquifer from which huge crystal
clear springs well out near the city. Two of them are tapped, one by the
mining company which supplies its own facilities and residgntial compound 3the
second Muya spring by Regideso, which yields more than 4 m /sec (350,000 m /
day). Thus, no water resource problem exists in Mbuji-Mayi even in the long
term. Cave-ins which are usual in this type of geological formation are
numerous on the plateau and there is a water pollution hazard associated with
them. The region also is affected by occasional earthquakes.
The Project
4.3       The Project is designed to supply piped water to all of the
300,000 people expected in the town by 1980. It is assumed that about 39%
of the population would consume 50 lcd through private connections, and 61%
would consume 17 lcd through public standpipes. Assuming unaccounted-for
water of325% of production, the total production required by 1980 is about
10,000 m /day of which about 65% will represent domestic consumption.
4.4       The new works required to meet these needs comprise:
-    the restoration of the Muya spring pumpin§ station and
the expansion of its capacity to 16,000 m /day (power
required 200 KVA);
-    a transmission main, 500 mm in diameter and 3.6 km long,
between Muya spring and the booster station;
-    the restoration of the downtown boost r station and the
expansion of its capacity to 12,000 m /day (power required
200 KVA);
-    a primary distribution network (23.5 km of 100 mm up to
250 mm diameter mains) and a secondary distribution network
(54.4 km of mains up to 100 mm in diameter) with about 130
public standpipes; and
-    two service reservoirs with 840 m3 and 500 m  capacity
respectively.

Power Supply
4.5       There is at present a tight situation in the power supplied by
the mining company to the township (total peak load of 1,400 kf). This is
due to equipment breakdowns in Miba's hydro and diesel plants. SNEL is
moving four 3,200 kW diesel generating sets from Kinshasa to Mbuji-Mayi to
supply the town's system. They should be commissioned well before the new
waterworks become operational.
5. M'BANDAKA
Existing Facilities
5.1       All the water supplied in M'bandaka comes from a waterworks located
at the outskirts of the city near the3confluence of the rivers Ruki and
Zaire. Its capacity is about 7,500 m /day. The raw water is drawn from
the Ruki River but unfortunately close to the mouth of a small stream which
is heavily polluted by the city's wastes. Water is pumped to the treat-
ment plant which includes flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, pH
adjustment and disinfection facilities. The plant is an old design (1930)
similar to Kisangani's but operated mo e efficiently. A pumping station
draws the treated water from a 1,000 m ground level reservoir and boostes
it to the distribution network. The facilities are not in good condition
and require restoration.
3
5.2  3    The3system's frur elevated reservoirs have capacities of 700 m
350 m , 100 m , and 60 m , all of them in poor condition, only one of them
still in use. The distribution network is 135 km long and consists of
steel mains up to 250 mm in diameter. There are 3,250 connections, and
10 public standpipes which are not in operating condition. 3Since unaccounted-
for vater approxim tes 35%, water sales total about 4,800 m /day, of which
62% (about 3,000 m /day) are used for domestic purposes. Of the 130,000
people presently living in the city, only 21% (27,300) are served by piped
water. Average consumption of those served is about 175 lcd of which domestic
consumption is about 109 lcd.
Water Sources
5.3       The situation at M'bandalca is similar to that at Kisangani relative
to the availability of ground and surface water. The least-cost alternative
for the additional supply required includes provision for a treatment plant
and an intake on the Zaire river, downstream of the port, despite the pollu-
tion that city and port create.  Tke Ruki river, which flows into the Zaire a
few miles downstream, will continue to supply M'bandaka. The large sustained
flows of the rivers reduce the significance and extent of possible pollution
provided the intake extends sufficiently far out (the design is to extend it
to 30 m far from the shore) but adequate precautions must be taken to prevent
it from being damaged by passing barges.



ANNEX 2

The Project
5.4       ?he Project is designed to suDply piped water to the 180,000
persons projected for the town by 1980. It was assumed that 70,000 persons
(about 40% of the population) would be served through private connections
at an average consumption of 80 lcd and 60% through public standpipes at
20 lcd. The production capacity required by 1980, based oj maximum day
demand and unaccounted-for water of î5%, is about 17,500 m 4day. Average
consumption is estimated at 12,000 m /day, of which 8,000 m would be for
domestic needs.
5.5       The new works required to meet this demand are:
-    a new waterworks with a capacity of 10,000 m /day and
comprising an intake in the river Zaire downstream of
the port, a raw water pumping station, a treatment plant
including flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, pH
adjustment and disinfection facilities and a treated
water pumping station;
-    a transmission main (1.3 km of 500 mm diameter pipe) coneecting
the new waterworks and the existing reservoir of 1,000 m
capacity;
-    reinforcement of and extensions to the primary distribution
network with provision for about 90 standpipes. The new
secondary network is to serve about 340 hectares;
-    a ground level reservoir of 2,000 m  capacity near the
new water treatment plant; and
-    the existing treatment plant would be rehabilitated and
the existing intake would be improved.
6.   KAMINA
Existing Facilities
6.1       Seven shallow wells about 2 km nor5h from the city are bored in the
Kîlaharian sands; they each yield about 15 m /hour (a total of about 2,500
m /day). Pumps draw raw water from the wells, but they are poorly installed
and some of the9 are inadequate; consequently the combined pump production
is only 1,840 m /day. A small treatment plant removes the iron and the
carbonic dioxide contained in the raw water. The process includes aeration
in a reservoir and filtration through pressure filters filled with sand
and alkaline products. Disinfection facilities were originally installed
but are now out of service. Four pumps deliver the water to the city. All
these existing facilities are about 20 years old and are in poor condition.



ANNEX 2
Page 10 of 10
The local brewery has its own borehole and there are about 700 private wells
many of which are3suspected to be polluted due to the lack of sewers. In
the city, a 300 m elevated reservoir in quite good condition is always
empty, due to water production being less than the demand. The distribution
network covers 545 hectares, (95%) of the urban area. It consists of 38 km
of mains up to 250 mm diameter. Out of the 2,200 connections about 1,800
(82%) are metered. 3Since unaccounted-for water is only 15%, water sales
total about 1,570 m Iday of which 72% is used by domestic consumers. Average
consumption of the 8,000 inhabitant:s served is about 19 lcd, but domestic
consumption is only 14 lcd.
Water Sources
6.2       The original project proposed by the consultant was to replace the
existing ground water supply by a surface supply and treatment facility.
The geological situation is similar to Kananga's, although the rather shallow
sand formations (30 m depth) are more extended, and therefore the aquifer
has a much larger potential thîn in Kananga. The aquifer in this area is
able to yield 6,000 to 8,000 m /day. For this Project, at least, Kamina
should be supplied from ground water since this appears to be the least-cost
solution particularly since it permits maximum use of the existing facilities.
The Project
6.3       The Project is designed to supply piped water to all of the 1980
population of 120,000 persons. About 47,000 persons (39%) of the population
will be served through private connections at an average consumption of
50 lcd, and the remaining 73,000 persons (61%) through public s andpipes at
17 lcd. The total production required by 1980 is about 5,250 m /day of which
73% will be provided for domestic use.
6.4       The new works required to meet this demand are.
-    renovated boreholes supplying 6,300 m /day to the raw
water §umping station;
-    a treatment plant3providing neutralization and disinfection
and a new 6 300 mn /day treated water pumping station (power
required 100 KVA);
-    a primary distribution network (9.6 km of 100 mm to
350 mm of mains up to 100 mm in diameter) with about
30 public standpipes;
-    a 650 m3 service reservoir, which would increase the
storage capacity of the reservoirs to 15% of the peak
day demand.

Remarques
-  The total number of trainees to partic:ipate in the training program is 1128.
This arises fror the fact that certian employees will attend several courses.
- The actual number of persons to be trained is 445, of which 173 will have
to be recruited.
- The trainees will be divided into 72 different groups, which gives an average
of approximately 16 trainees per group.
-  The total time required to complete the training of Regideso's staff is
estimated at 575 weeks, broken down as follows:
192 weeks for retraining
325 weeks for initial training
59 weeks for upgrading
575 total weeks
-  Since the training course is to be spread over 5 years, the adoption of
alternative 2 will require the engagement cf 6 expatriate-specialists (in addition
to the training program director and the ccordinator of studv.

2/   For foreign exchange (160%) and unskilled labor (75%)
3/   These figures should be considered asan upper limit because they take into account  the total cost of the
new treatment plant while the existing treatment plant should be abandoned as far as drinking water supply                M
is concerned.  The new treatment plant should serve not only the additional but also the existing population.             o
The long-term marginal cost would be less if only a proportion of the new treatment plant costs vas charged
to the costs of additional water to be supplied.                                                                          M

Zaire - Regideso
Assumptions made in the preparation of Regideso's
financial projections 1975 - 1980
A.        INCOME STATEMENTS
1.   Revenues
Sales volume and average price of water and electricity is
given in the table below.  Tariffs were changed on July 1, 1974
and average prices from 1975 onwards correspond with the July to
December 1974 billings.
1973   1974   1975    1976    1977    1978    1979    1980

Line Reference    2.   Operating Costs
Projections are based on 1974 experience.
4640 - 4720              a)   Purchased water and power:  increase in line with sales volume.
4680 - 4710             b)   Production and Distribution Labor:  Although economies of
scale are possible, an increase in line with sales volume
has been assumed in each case.
4715                    c)   Electricity production fuel:  is taken at the latest price
and efficiency average of K 5.39 per kWh of projected thermal
power sales.
4950 - 7570             d)   Depreciation:  4.4% (average rate) is calculated on re-
valued gross fixed assets.  In 1973 and 1974 the actual
depreciation charged by Regideso is shown.
4975                    e)   General expenses:  Volume increases of 10% per annum have
been provided from 1975 to 1980.



Page 6 of 7
4700                   f)  Cost Contingency (water):  This represents 5% of projected
water expenses (excluding depreciation) plus general ex-
penses. The 5% has been compounded from 1975 until 1978,
i.e. 10.25%, 15.76% and 21.55% for 1976 - 1978 respectively.
In 1979 and 1980 the provision is calculated at 21.55%.
No provision is made for any escalation in electricity
expenses, since the loss on electricity operations will
be the subject of a subsidy from 1977 onwards.
4977             3.   Other Income
This consists mainly of connection fees from 1975 (it used to
include intra-company sales until 7.1.74). An increase of 3% per
annum is projected.
5040             4.   Interest
Includes commitment fees, and is as shown in the summary section
of the Debt Statement (Annex 9, page 4). Interest during construc-
tion is not being capitalized. All interest payable is therefore
shown in the income statement.
B.        CASH FLOW
6090             1.   Working Capital Requirements
This represents changes in accounts receivable, and in 1975-1977
reflects the gradual refund of Government arrears, together with the
reduction of average outstandings from six months in 1975 to four
months as from 1977. The other items of current assets and current
liabilities offset each other (both debit and credit items increase
by Z 150,000 p.a.).
2.   Debt Service
6100                   Is as shown in the last line of the debt summary statement
(Annex 9, page 4).
3.   Routine Construction
6200
6210                   This is assumed to include small extensions, rehabilitation,
vehicles, etc. and is set at Z 1 million p.a. for water and Z 0.4
million each for electricity and other items such as vehicles, etc.,
total Z 1.8 million p.a.
4.   Major Construction
6220
IDA Project:  Z 34   million 1975-1978.
6230                   Other Major Water:  Includes the Z 3.5 million Kinshasa mains
project, financed 100% by FED/EIB.
Major Power:Regideso's estimate for electrification of more centers.
This is expected to be financed entirely by Government subsidy
(line 6430).
6240

6245                     Other Major Works          represent three office buildings, in-
cluding a new head office in Kinshasa, and an airplane.
5.   Borrowings and Grants
Terms assumed are as under:
6350                IDA onlending of the credit is at 8-1/2% over 25 years with five
years' grace
6340                EIB 1% over 30 years, four years' grace, 0.25% commitment charge.
6360                AfDB 8% over 18 years, three years' grace, 0.75% commitment charge. S
6380                ABED A - 4Z over 25 years vith five years' grace, 0.5 
commitmnent charge.
C.        BALANCE SHEETS
7560                1.   Plant in Operation
At cost plus revaluation of Z 6.203 million at 12.31.1973.  This
revaluation surplus has not yet been incorporated in Regideso's books.
7630                2.   Cash
7631
This computer program shows operational requirements, which
Regideso estimates as Z 0.8 million at any one time. The balance
is shown as temporary surplus (or overdraft).
7640 - 7645  )      3.   Current assets and liabilities
)
8040 - 8050  )           See Bl above.
8055 )
4.   Grants and Contributions
7870
Include Government grants for construction in both power and water,
consumer contributions and UNDP grant. Unfortunately this computer
program lumps them all together in the Balance Sheet. However, in the
Cash Flow Projections (Annex 9, page 2), they are shown in detail and
each item is totalled over the project period.
8010                5.   Balance of Long Term Debt
This computer program does not show current maturities separately,
so that they are included in this figure, which corresponds with the
appropriate "balance" line in the Debt Statement Summary (Annex 9,
page 4).
1/  The actual terns of this loan (see paragraph 6.14 of the text) is 15 years
including 4 years of grace at 7% interest. The difference is quite small and
accordingly the projections were not recomputed.

l/   Under the old tariff the first two tranches were cunulative, but all of the
consumption of large consumers was charged at K 7.2/m3. According to the
new tariff, large consumers also benefit from the lower prices of the first
two tranches.

ANNEX 12
ZAIRE VWATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Outline of the system proposed by REGIDESO for the distribution
of water through standpipes and method of collecting the charges for
consumption.
1. Type of installation
Standpipes with one or more taps, up to a maximum of 4, mounted
on a solid post or eventually in a cabin. Spilled water will be drained either
by an absorption pit or by open drains.
2. Organization
The standpipes will be in the care of a contractor, responsible for
distribution of water in exchange for tickets.
The tickets, printed. for REGIDESO, will be on sale at all Regideso's
offices, including suburban offices, at a price of about 10K per book of 18
tickets.
This price covers:
- installation and naintenance of standpipe and printing
costs of tickets;
-  a fee of about KO.175 per ticket payable to the
contractor;
- sale of water at the average price of K13.25 per m3.
The contractor's average remuneration will depend on the number of
taps at the standpipe.
3. Time of service
The times at which the standpipes are open for business will depend
on local customs, however there will be a minimum number of open hours daily,
including weekends and public holidays.
4.        Regideso proposes to tryout this system before the project is
complëted. Certain details may be modified according to experience gathered
from pilot schemes, but IDA's assent will be sought before a permanent system
is introduced.

Engineering Consultants Fees
The fees of both Consultants, IGIP of Darmstadt (W. Germany) and
IEU/Dumons of Paris/Toulouse (France), in respect of detailed project studies
and the preparation and evaluation of tender documents will be a lump sum
while supervision of construction will be paid for on a time basis.
1. IGIP
1.1     Detailed project studies, preparation and evaluation of tender
documents will cost $1,164,000. This corresponds to about 152 man-months.
Additional work in Europe will be paid on a time basis at the fzllow-
ing unit prices (subsistence and transportation excluded).
Engineer                      $178 per day
Draftsman                     $ 91 per day
1.2     Supervision of construction would require about 250 man-months at an
average price of $7,634 per man-month, the unit prices agreed being:
Senior Engineer               $9,565 per month
Engineer                      $6,957  ' 
Technician                    $6,087  "
These unit prices include salaries, subsistence, transportation and
overhead costs but exclude site office costs.
1.3     It is estimated that the IGIP contract will amount to some $3,1
million equivalent providing about 400 man-months overall.
2. IEU/Dumons
2.1     Detailed project studies, preparation and evaluation of bid documents
will cost $468,000. This corresponds to about 60 man-months.
Additional work will be paid on a time basis at the following unit
prices (subsistence and transportation excluded).
In Europe             In Zaire
Senior Engineer        $333 per day          $488 per day
Engineer               $244  "    "          $400

2.2     Supervision of construction would require about 130 man-months at an
average price of $7,755 per man-month, the unit prices agreed being:
Senior Engineer                  $10,444 per month
Specialized Engineer             $ 8,758  "
Engineer                         $ 8,333  *
Technician                       $ 1,778  "
These unit prices include salaries, subsistence, transportation
overhead as well as site office costs.
2.3     Taking into account additional work it is estimated that the
IEU/Dumons contract will amount to some $1,5 million equivalent providing
about 190 man-months overall.
