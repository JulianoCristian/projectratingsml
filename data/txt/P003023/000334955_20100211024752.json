In 1973/74, in the\n            framework of the World Health Organization\n            (WHO)/International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n            (IBRD) cooperative program, WHO carried out a study of the\n            water supply, sewerage and drainage sector. The study\n            revealed enormous needs in the sector, and recommended a\n            substantial and continuous development program, starting\n            with water supply in the major cities, as well as a\n            comprehensive training program to upgrade and augment the\n            technical staff of the National Water Supply Corporation,\n            Regideso. The project represents a first stage in the\n            implementation of the sector study recommendations. The\n            project will improve the supply of water in six of the major\n            cities of Zaire: Lubumbashi, Kisangani, Kananga, Mbuji-Mayi,\n            Mbandaka and Kamina, whose aggregate population is estimated\n            at 1.5 million, out of a total urban population of about 6\n            million. The project will provide water to 0.7 to 1 million\n            additional people the majority of who fall in the category\n            of the urban poor. The feasibility studies were carried out\n            by two consultants engaged and paid for by Regideso.\n            Production facilities will be rehabilitated and supplemented\n            to provide continuous service, and distribution systems will\n            be expanded to supply the entire urbanized area of the six\n            cities; at present only about one-third of their population\n            has access to piped water. Distribution is to be expanded\n            primarily through standpipes. The project has been sized to\n            assure the supply of water to the whole population of the\n            six-cities by 1980."}, "docdt": "1976-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
