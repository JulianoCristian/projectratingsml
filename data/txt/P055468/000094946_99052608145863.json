Consolidation\n            and Modernization Project extends the Basic Education and\n            Training Project (report no. 13568). This project aims to a)\n            maintain and consolidate the recent reforms in primary\n            education and in demand-driven training and apprenticeship\n            programs initiated under the earlier project; and b) assist\n            the government of Cape Verde in carrying out a comprehensive\n            sector study, addressing issues of quality and equity, in\n            order to identify cost-effective options for the sustainable\n            development of the education/training system (ETS) through\n            the medium term. The project also provides the underpinnings\n            for a human resource development program which the\n            Government intends to launch in 2001. The project has four\n            components. The first reinforces the integration of basic\n            education by improving primary school infrastructure and\n            increasing textbook supply and teacher guides; and\n            reinforces training and apprenticeship programs,\n            strengthening the sector's policy and advisory bodies\n            and improving the quality and efficiency of employment\n            surveys and job placement services. The second component\n            funds a qualitative assessment of education subsectors. The\n            third component supports field-testing of selected options;\n            and supports consultation, information, and communication.\n            The fourth component builds the capacity of the education\n            and the employment and training ministries."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
