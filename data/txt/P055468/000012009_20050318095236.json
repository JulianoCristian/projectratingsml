Notwithstanding,\n            lessons of experience outline, and are suggested as follows.\n            It is reinforced that policy dialogue between the Borrower\n            and the Bank requires flexibility, particularly when dealing\n            with the evolving educational context. Specifically, the\n            Bank responsiveness to the Borrower's needs was prompt,\n            misunderstandings were timely reduced, all of which\n            conducive to mutual confidence. In the context of sector\n            reforms, the Government's political commitment was\n            critical to the Project success: reforms were pursued in the\n            basic education, and professional training sector with\n            support being provided from across two ruling parties.\n            However, the integration of the Project Unit (PCU) into the\n            regular structure of the Ministry of Education (MOE)\n            required capacity-building, and a good communication\n            strategy, implemented through a gradual process.
