"Ratings for the Maharashtra Rural Water\n            Supply and Sanitation \"Jalswarajya\" Project for\n            India were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was low, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            clearly demonstrated that investing in participatory\n            processes to identify, articulate, and satisfy the demand\n            for Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) services at the level\n            of the Gram Panchayats (GPs) might start slow, as it\n            requires time to develop local capacity and decentralize\n            delivery, but that the process pays off over time. In fact,\n            the project registered a slow disbursement curve during the\n            first two years of implementation and a very fast\n            acceleration over the last three years, once capacities and\n            local systems for service delivery were in place. Initial\n            capacity building is an important activity to prioritize\n            before the formation of local committees. Despite the fact\n            that fully sustainable operation and maintenance of the\n            assets delivered by the project has not yet been achieved\n            across all the target GPs, the project created a basis for\n            future sustainability by introducing the culture of paying\n            for a service. A key lesson emerging from project\n            implementation is that communities can be more effectively\n            mobilized in smaller villages with more cohesive social\n            backgrounds. Adaptation of fiduciary requirements to the\n            demand-driven approach and large-scale intervention approach."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
