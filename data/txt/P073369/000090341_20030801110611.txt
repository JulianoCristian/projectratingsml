A. Project Development Objective

1. Projectdevelopmentobjective: (see Annex 1)
The development objectives o f the proposed project are to: (i)increase rural households' access to
improved and sustainable drinking water supply and sanitation services; and (ii)institutionalize
decentralization o f Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) service delivery to rural local
governments and communities.

The State o f Maharashtra faces a severe problem with regard to ensuring supply o f safe and adequate
drinking water to its rural population, 57 million, living in 11 million households in 86,681 villages and
habitations. The state's ground water sources are constrained due to natural factors such as geology and
spatially variable rainfall with extremes of high monsoon precipitation in some areas and drought
situation in others. These factors have a dramatic impact on sustainability o f sources for water supply,
especially duringFebruary-May. The situation i s exacerbated by unregulated groundwater abstraction for
purposes o f irrigation and industrial uses. The holistic management o f ground and surface water
resources i s typically absent.

According to a recent assessment, out of 86,68 1villages and habitations, only about 62,000 o f them have
established facilities capable o f providing adequate and safe water. Out o f the remaining 24,681 villages
and habitations, as many as 7000 have either no water supply and access to safe water or a very limited
supply o f 10 lpcd and below. The remaining 17,681 villages and habitations have facilities that are
designed to supply water only to the extent o f 10-30 lpcd with much reduced quantities available during
summer. Moreover, many o f the existing water supply facilities are reportedly not functioning up to their
designed potential or have stalled due to lack o f necessary repairs and replacements, exacerbated by lack
o f access to power due to non payment o f dues to the state electricity board.

Maharashtra's resource requirements for the rural water supply and sanitation sector, based on 40-lpcd
norm, could range from $3.7 to $4 billion over the next 10 years. According t.o recent Government o f
Maharashtra (GOM) estimate, the resource requirements o f the 10th Five Year Plan (2002-07) and the
last two years o f the project (2008-09) would be about $2.5 billion. Using on-going funding programs as
the base, during this period, GOM expects to mobilize about $1.0 billion (excluding community
contribution). These resources would be derived from the Minimum Needs Program ($185 million);
market borrowings ($305 million) and special Government o f India (GO1)-GOM supported programs
(including ARWSP, SRP, TSC, Scarcity, and Swajaldhara) ($467 million); and external assistance from
KfW ($31million). Giventhe resource constraints, both at the national and state levels, GOM's on-going
10th Five Year Plan (2002-7) estimates an outlay o f only about $850 million. While on a broader fiscal
front, GOMhas launched a medium term fiscal reformprogram with a focus on improving tax collection,
containing growth in government spending, and enhancing efficiency o f government expenditures, its
ability to raise additional resources from the general budget to fill the existing gap remains significantly
constrained. The proposed project which partially fills the resource gap, would likely be the first o f a
series o f dovetailed RWSS projects, which could be potentially supported by the Bank Group and other
donors if GOM could demonstrate that it has utilized IDA assistance available under the first project
effectively, ina timely manner, and consistent with the reform program introduced.

B. Strategic Context
1.Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number:22541            Date of latest CAS discussion: 12/17/2002

Overall CAS Goal and Strategy:            The proposed project i s consistent with CAS objectives o f
strengthening the enabling environment for development and growth and supporting interventions o f
special benefit to the poor and disadvantaged.        It will implement the CAS strategic principles o f
partnership and a programmatic approach. The project provides an opportunity to strengthen the Bank
Group's partnership with India, Maharashtra, donors and NGOs in improving RWSS services.

The proposed project would specifically implement CAS program priorities of: (i)      supporting effective
and inclusive decentralization by empowering local communities in rural areas and creating appropriate
institutional arrangements for ensuring delivery o f services by local governments in an efficient and
accountable manner; (ii)   building and implementing consensus on key policy and institutional reforms;
(iii) investmentsinruralinfrastructurelinkedtoreformsinservicedelivery; (iv)usingNGOs
      funding
and alternative service providers; (v) promoting cost sharing; (vi) targeting the poorest areas and most
vulnerable groups; and (vii) integrating interventions for maximum impact.

The project supports the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of: (i)        promoting gender equality and
empowering women (Goal 3, Target 4); (ii)    sustainable access to safe drinkingwater (Goal 7, Target 10);
(iii)improved access to sanitation (Goal 7, Target 11); and (iv) increased proportion of Official
Development Assistance for basic social services (Goal 8, Target 12).

Sector-specific CAS Strategy: IDA'Scurrent approach to supporting rural water supply and sanitation
i s based on the joint GOI- Bank Group Sector Review (1998), the Bank's Generic Project Concept
Document (June 1999) and the Bank's updated RWSS strategy (2003) endorsed by GOI. The approach i s
aimed at demonstrating viability o f the reforms in improving service delivery and sustainability by
developing, testing and implementing the reform approach, in selected states, on a pilot basis.

Two recent IDA-supported RWSS projects        - Kerala and Karnataka 11- are following the above reform
approach. The Uttar Pradesh (UP) RWSS Project started in 1996 also adopted a demand-responsive
approach empowering user organizations, but did not involve rural local governments. Drawingupon the
success o f these projects, from April 2000, GO1launched its own nationwide Sector Reform Pilot (SRP)
Project covering 26 o f 28 states, committing US$5.50 million and benefiting 70 million people.
         -

The project i s also consistent with the recent Bank Group Sector Assistance Strategy Note (November
2002), endorsedby GOI, that outlines the overall framework and guidingprinciples for the Bank's RWSS
work program inIndia for the next 2-3 years. It reflects lessons learned from implementation experiences
o f the current approach, and addresses major emerging challenges, notably the need for scaling up in a
sustainable manner. The Bank would support RWSS projects in states that demonstrate ownership,
political will, and commitment to implement reforms. Priority will be given to states that: (i)decentralize
RWSS service delivery responsibility to rural local governments for single village water supply schemes;
and (ii)adopt a reform approach state-wide. The main challenge for the states now i s to expand and



                                                    - 3 -

spread out the reform approach. This i s required to meet GOI's policy objectives o f accelerating RWSS
coverage and ensuring sustainability, and to achieve MDGs. Establishing necessary institutional
arrangements, buildingcapacity, and bridgingfinancial gaps to implement scaling up agenda are also the
key priorities o f the proposedproject.

2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
At the national Level

Rural drinking water policy in India i s at an interesting crossroad. Although GO1has launched a major
reform program in the RWSS sector, most states still follow traditional, top-down financing and delivery
o f RWSS services. Significant subsidies continue to be provided by GO1 and state governments to
finance local agencies for delivering engineering intensive systems with little attention to community
demand, choice o f technology; users willingness to pay, and longer term sustainability exacerbated by the
lack o f due attention to water resource availability and quality o f RWSS services. This results in
government-dominated, supply driven programs that have proven to be unsustainable institutionally,
financially and environmentally. Not surprisingly, the level o f failure o f this approach i s widespread and
well documented. Against this background, states like Kerala, Kamataka, Uttar Pradesh have
implemented the reform program in varying degrees. The state o f Maharashtra, which has taken up this
challenge state-wide since July 2000, can potentially show the way forward.

At the State level
Over the past several decades, Maharashtra has been making substantial investments in RWSS funded
mainly by grants from both GO1 and GOM, marginally supplemented by donor-funded programs.
However, a large proportion o f Maharashtra's rural population i s still without access to sustainable and
safe drinking water and sanitation. The state's ground water sources are constrained due to natural
factors such as geology which provides a limited natural storage, undulating and steep topography that
leads to high run-offs in highrainfall areas; and drought situation in others. The situation i s exacerbated
by unregulated groundwater abstraction for purposes o f irrigation and industrial uses and the lack o f
holistic management o f the totality of ground and surface water resources, with required priority given to
drinkingwater. Additionally, water quality issues interms o f chemical and bacteriological contamination
need to be systematically addressed over the long-term in conjunction with the program for rural water
supply. Overall, the RWSS sector inMaharashtra is characterized by:

(a)      Ineffective and unsustainable public expenditures: Past government RWSS programs focused on
construction and neglected source and financial sustainability aspects. This led to unsustainable and
poorly managed assets;
(b)      Lack o f ownership, poor maintenance o f facilities and n o cost recovery for 0 & M: Evidence
from India and elsewhere shows that communities having greater control over scheme planning and
operation and management are willing to pay. However, past government schemes have lacked
community participation and meaningful involvement. This led to the selection o f unsustainable options
andpoorly maintained water facilities;
(c)      Lack o f capacity in local governments and communities to effcientlv plan, implement and
operate new investments: The main challenges o f decentralization are the local institutions' lack o f
capacity to plan, construct and manage RWSS schemes, and the use o f non performance-based criteria
for funds allocation; and
(d)      Absence o f effective monitoring and evaluation capacity: The government at state, district and
village level lacks capacity to identify and address problems and take corrective actions in a timely
manner, and to the satisfaction o f local communities.

GovernmentActions

Government o f India (GOI) Strategy and Actions

GO1 recognizes the need to make RWSS sector more effective and responsive to the needs o f
communities and has initiated significant reforms in funding the sector. Starting with the Ninth Five
Year Plan (1997-2002), GO1 i s committed to principles that: (i) water as an economic good; (ii)
                                                                     treat
increase peoples' participation; (iii) 20% o f funds to states promoting sector reforms; (iv) create
                                       reserve
stronger links o f RWSS to watershed programs; and (v) control overextraction o f groundwater.           In
allocating 20% o f sector reform funds to states, GO1requires the state and local governments to: (i) adopt
a demand-driven approach to RWSS development and empowerment o f user communities; (ii)            focus on
capacity building to support demand-driven investment program in RWSS; (iii)ensure an integrated
approach to water supply, sanitation and hygiene; (iv) obtain a partial capital cost recovery and 100%
O&M financing by the users; and (v) promote groundwater conservation and recharge measures. GOI's
Tenth Five Year Plan goal aims to provide minimumwater supply o f 40 lpcd to uncovered and partially
covered habitations by 2004; and to habitations reemerging with problems by 2007, and sanitation
coverage to 50% households by 2015. Under the Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission, GO1 had
introduced a three year US$550 million pilot program to operationalize the demand-driven RWSS
systems in 67 districts in 26 states, under which 2.9 million households have contributed US$ 16.8
million for the community led drinking water schemes o f their choice. About 28500 schemes have been
completed and close to 20,000 schemes have been internalized (Atmarpam) by the community for
operation and maintenance. For scaling up the approach, and based on the experience gained during the
last three years in testing the reform principles under Sector Reform Pilots (SRP), GO1 has recently
launched an improved version o f the sector reform program called "Swajaldhara" with operational
flexibilities and provision of Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) for state governments. Within a
span o f 6 months GO1has sanctioned to States US$ 100million under Swarajaldhara.

On the sanitation front, the Total Sanitation Campaign, promoting low subsidy to no subsidy regime and
demand generation, is under implementation in 288 districts with total outlay o f US$ 692 million. GO1
and states have contributed approximately US$l09 million and the projects have utilized U S $ 52.5
million. These projects aim to trigger demand for about 24 million household toilets, 0.3 million o f
school toilets, besides large number o f women community complexes, rural sanitary marts, rural
production centers etc. Recently, GO1 has decided to reward open defecation-free village panchayats,
blocks, and districts with national awards (Nirmal GramPuraskan).

Government o f Maharashtra (GOMI Strategy and Actions

InJuly 2000, GOMtook a major policy decision to adopt demand driven and participatory approaches to
RWSS service delivery and the principle o f cost sharing, both in rural and urban sectors. Maharashtra is
the first state in the country to apply the sector reform program state-wide. Since then, GOM has taken
the following measures to implement the reform program: (i)     issuedoperational guidelines on community
involvement and participation at all stages: identification, planning, designing, implementation o f RWSS
facilities includingprocurement o f goods and services, O&M, repairs and replacements, and rejuvenation
and rehabilitation o f facilities; (ii)
                                     transferred decision making authority to the beneficiary communities;
(iii)enhancedpowersofZillaParishads(district rurallocalgovernments) to undertake single village
water supply schemes up to a capital cost of Rs.7.5 million (from the existing Rs.1.5 million); (iv)
appointed a Committee to advise on institutional restructuring o f the state-owned Maharashtra Jeevan
Pradhikaran (MJP - Water Board) and taken a formal decision to restructure it; (v) piloted GOI's Sector
Reforms in four districts for water supply and sanitation and five districts for total sanitation campaign;
and (vi) launched a KfW-assisted project in three districts to operationalize the reforms. In addition,


                                                    - 5 -

GOM took a policy decision in January 2003 to discontinue direct and indirect subsidies for O&M o f
RWSS facilities in a phased manner. The implementation o f the above reform program (including
phasing out o f subsidies and institutional reforms) as announced invarious Government Orders would be
an integral part o f the project. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOM about its
commitment to implementation o f the Sector Reform Program.

Maharashtra has also been in the forefront in implementing state-wide and community-based water
conservation and sanitation programs, such as: (a) water harvesting (Shivakalin Paani Sathavan Yojana);
(b) watershed development; (c) Mahatma Phule Jal Bhumi Sandharan; (d) sanitation campaign based on
Sant Gadgebaba s clean village approach; and (e) Yashwant Gram Samruddhi Yojana. The watershed
development program has received a state-wide recognition and acceptance by the people at large due to
pioneering efforts o f local community leaders and financial support provided by rural finance
institutions. Similarly, the rain water harvestingprogram, the Sant Gadge Baba sanitation campaign, and
the village-level participatory planning and development have also made remarkable strides as a result o f
community mobilization and state contributions and incentives to VPs that are granted in a transparent
and competitive manner. In particular, the Sant Gadge Baba sanitation campaign managed to mobilize
about US$170 million from local communities inthree years as against GOM's total investment o f about
US$3.5 million by way o f incentives. Each o f these programs has promoted local leaders and
communities to take charge o f their water and sanitation issues, and to achieve, through self-help and
voluntarism, both individual and common good, taking advantage o f the incentives provided by the state
government. The proposed project would buildits strategies and programs on community involvement as

project, as much as 30% o f total points (loo), are given to the districts' performance with regard to
successfully demonstrated by the above programs. Inprioritizing individual districts for inclusion in the

implementation of the above mentionedprograms.

On the sanitation front, GOM's new strategy i s to promote "total sanitation" with a shift o f focus from
construction o f latrines to changing people's habits and behaviors. Maintaining and using hygienic
latrines, washing hands, keeping food and water covered, using safe water and maintaining a clean
environment by adopting measures like draindsoak pits and safe garbage disposal form integral part o f
the strategy. As a part o f this strategic move, GOM proposes to discontinue financing or subsidizing
construction o f latrines for individual households. Instead, the new strategy focuses o n eliminating "open
defecation" through well designed Information Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns and
community based incentives, supplemented by construction o f sanitary complexes for women and in
rural schools.

To take the RWSS reform agenda further, GOM would need to: (i)               take up a massive IEC program
state-wide, as a prerequisite for financing o f new investments in the sector; (ii)    provide funds for the
emerging investment programs in all districts, but in small batches o f villages to allow deepening and
replicating o f the processes of bottom up planning and community empowerment; (iii)       build capacity o f
VPs and communities intechnical, financial and management aspects to be able to effectively handle the
new responsibility o f defining their own development agenda including planning and implementation o f
schemes, managing investment funds and later operating schemes without external financial support; and
(iv) build capacity o f district and state level institutions to do the business in a new way by which their
role changes from one o f designing, construction and/or service delivery to that o f providing support
services to VPs and communities. GOM faces the challenge o f operationalizing the reform agenda, and
has requested IDA assistance to fill the financing gaps and also to become a partner in bringing its
international experience to bear upon operationalizing reforms state-wide ina step-by-step manner.

3. Sector issuesto be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposedproject will address the above sectoral issues inMaharashtra and assist GOM in scaling up
the sector reforms statewide, using the experience gained with implementation o f the community-based
rain harvesting,     watershed development, sanitation campaign, and participatory planning and
development programs at the village level. Towards this end, Maharashtra and India, with support from
IDA, intend to make a number o f strategic choices inimplementing the project. These are as follows:

(a)      Focusing on the Poor, Tribals and Women and Building their Ownership and Capacity The
project includes specific interventions to target the poor, tribal population and women. The extent o f
"Below Poverty Line" population in a V P will be a key criteria for its prioritization for project support.
The Women Empowerment Fund and Tribal Development Program would aim at targeting and building
capacity o f vulnerable groups, including tribal groups and women, for ensuring their effective
participation inthe project. Specifically, about 10% o f the total project cost would target tribals.

(b)      Mainstreaming Decentralization:      In order to ensure satisfactory service delivery and
sustainability, the project will support the decentralization agenda by ensuring that funds and functions
are transferred to the lowest appropriate level. This should make allocations more responsive to the poor,
lead to more sustainable outcomes, and increase the power o f poor communities to negotiate RWSS
development on their terms. Specifically, the project will devolve decision making and fund approval to
Zilla Parishad (ZP-district level government), Panchayat Samitis (PS-block level government), provide a
central role to VPs inproject implementation (planning, design and construction) with responsibility for
operation and management o f RWSS services, build capacity and awareness and provide civic education
to rural local governments. Panchayat Samitis will serve as vital extended arms o f Zilla Parishads in
capacity building and monitoring activities. The project will establish organic links between VPs,
informal institutions and Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSCs), with the latter acting as
legal entities o f VPs, thereby eliminating conflicts or avoiding creating parallel power centers at the local
level. The V P strengthening would be achieved not only by transferring the above functions to VPs but
also by developing a range o f skills within the village community (see item (d) below).

(c)      Promoting Responsive and Accountable Public and Private Service Providers: One o f the
important challenges o f the project i s to respond to the community demand in an effective and efficient
way. To this end, the project would promote development o f responsive and accountable public and
private service providers and local governments (VPs, PSs and ZPs) and smooth fund flows within this
system. This would be achieved by widening the choice o f service providers, making service providers
directly accountable to the community organizations, building capacity o f the community to negotiate
with them and monitor their performance through report card systems. An incentive fund has been
provided, on a pilot basis, to improve management and governance o f VPs and ZPs.

(d)      Intemated Approach: The project will integrate implementation o f water supply with sanitation
and hygiene promotion. Further, the project will promote cross-sectoral linkages, with watershed
development, health, rural development, and women's development programs inorder to maximize health
and economic benefits o f improvedwater supply services.

(e)      Ensuring Sustainabilitv: The sustainability o f the source is critical for ensuring long-term
sustainability o f rural water supply schemes. The project will provide communities with a menu o f
technical options   - some o f which have been identified by GOM's study on Water Resource Management
and Technical Analysis and Options - that will be simple to implement, operate and maintain and
facilitate service provision to socially disadvantaged sections and isolated hamlets. The project will also
integrate indigenous knowledge and practices with modem methods to give sustainable solutions for



                                                      - 7 -

water supply and sanitation needs. Sustainable solutions will also be achieved through participatory
planning and implementation, and communities' contribution towards O&M costs.

2. Key policy and institutionalreformssupportedby the project:
As discussed in section B.2, the emerging policy and institutional framework in Maharashtra is
supportive of the project's development objectives, and makes community management in RWSS a
viable option for scaling up in the state. Moreover, this approach i s already being tested in the state
through a GO1 pilot, a KfW project and the hands-on-learning pilot undertaken as part o f this project
preparation. The project would further support implementation o f the following policies and reforms, as
agreed with GOM:

    Strengthening of the decentralizationprocess: The project would strengthen local governments and
    rural communities' managerial, technical and financial capacity by (i)giving budget directly to
    village-level governments; and (ii)  bridging the gap between communities and the district-level
    government by transferring planning and implementation to VPs;

    Empowering communities by (i)    buildingtheir skills to become critical users and consumers rather
    than passive recipients; and (ii)
                                    introducing mechanisms for communities to express their demands.
    Communities would demand, plan, implement and manage their rural water and sanitation systems
    while covering operating and maintenance costs;

   Ensuring efficient use of water by transferring water use planning and allocation functions to the
    communities and testing aquifer source sustainability;

   Institutional Reforms: The project would support GOM in implementing a time-bound road-map for
   restructuring o f the existing sectoral agencies such as the Ground Water Development Agency
    (GSDA) and the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) to align them better in the context o f
    decentralization. GSDA and MJP play an important role in assessing ground water resources and
    implementing rural and urban water supply facilities, respectively. Recognizing urgency o f scaling
   up sector reforms and investment programs across the state, GOM has carried out a study during
   project preparation with the objective to restructure their institutional mandates and roles to make



                                                 - 8 -

        them more competitive at the market place and effectively responsive to community-driven
        programs. T o take the institutional reforms further, GOM will: (1) adopt a time-bound transitional
        action plan designed to achieve complete separations o f the O&M functions o f MJP from its other
        functions, and complete, by December 31, 2004, full implementation o f the transitional plan; and (ii)
        take necessary steps including preparatory studies and legislative measures, to adopt, by December
        31,2004, a comprehensive and time-bound action plan for restructuring o f MJP;

 0     Discontinuing, in a phased manner, direct and indirect government subsidies: GOM has already
        taken a policy decision to discontinue, in a phased manner, direct and indirect subsidies to local
        governments for O&M o f water supply facilities and streamlining management of O&M functions.
        This reduction in subsidies will be further supported duringthe project.

 0      Cost Sharing Reforms: As an expression o f their commitment to participation and ownership,
        beneficiaries will contribute to the capital cost o f the facilities, with a portion to be paid upfront in
        cash. The following rules for the cost sharing by beneficiaries and VPs have been agreed:

                                                                                                                                      State

  3. Benefitsandtarget population:
  Benefits (Annex 4) to the rural poor include:
  (i) increased access to safe drinking water and clean and improved school, environmental and sanitation
  facilities; (ii)improved public health derived from enhanced hygiene and sanitation practices; (iii)
  financial savings and economic benefits derived from reduced health-related expenses; (iv) enhanced
  capacity o f local governments and communities to participate in development activities; (v) increased
  capacity o f disadvantaged groups (BPL, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe members) for social and


                                                                     - 9 -

collective endeavors; (vi) for women, reduced workload on water collection, improved privacy and
comfort o f sanitation, and improved empowerment and leadership abilities; and (vii) more accountable,
transparent and inclusive VPs and Gram Sabhas.

Target Population: Maharashtra i s the first state inthe country that has launched a major effort to extend
the sector reform program in all thirty-three districts o f the state. The project will directly benefit about
2800 VPs covering approximately 7 million population. The beneficiary population will be
predominantly the rural poor including women. The project i s expected to directly benefit 0.5 million
tribals in 1700tribal settlements, through the Tribal Development Plan.

4. Institutionaland implementationarrangements:
ExecutingEntities:The project's institutional model is briefly described below and outlined indetail in
Annex 2. Attachment 1.

At the village level, the Gram Sabha (village general body) will be the decision making body and will
approve Village Action Plans. V P constitutes the primary executing agency.                VPs will provide
promotional and oversight role and Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSCs), or Pada Village
Level Water and Sanitation Committees (PWSC) in case o f tribal settlements, will implement and
manage the schemes. Together, VPs and VWSCsIPWSCs would be responsible for: (a) planning,
procurement, construction and O&M o f rural water and sanitation schemes; and (b) conducting
monitoring and evaluation studies, with technical support provided by district-level governments and
Support Organizations (SOs). To ensure a wider base o f leadership and ease o f management,
VWSCsIPWSCs would delegate work to sub-committees for procurement, finance, supervision and
social audit. In case o f RWSS schemes involving more than one village, multi-village water and
sanitation committees would be the executing agency.

At the district level, the ZP through its restructured District Water Management and Sanitation
Committee (DWMSC) will facilitate, appraise, monitor and supervise project implementation. Additional
expertise will be brought infrom SOs.

At the state level, the Water Supply and Sanitation Department (WSSD) will be the counterpart agency,
responsible for overall coordination, promotion, monitoring and oversight primarily as "guardian" to
ensure that community participation, implementation and management o f water and sanitation services
proceed smoothly and without undue interference from other government agencies andor unscrupulous
contractors and non-governmental agencies.

ImplementationArrangements

Project Implementation and Processes: The project would be implemented according to rules and
procedures agreed inthe Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and Community Operational Manual (COM).
These documents outline the roles and responsibilities o f individual agencies and provide details o f
project processes and project cycle. The PIP and COM are based on the experiences gained during the
intensive hands-on learning pilot in 30 VPs in three representative districts (Thane, Satara and
Osmanabad) and various preparation workshops, studies and analyses that were carried out during the
course o f project preparation.The pilot, in particular, focused on validating various assumptions about
community participation, community willingness, partnering capabilities o f local institutions and
capacity building effort required. Duringnegotiations, an understanding was reached with GOM that it
will implement the proposed project in accordance with the institutional and operational frameworks as
outlined in the PIP and COM. The C O M will be subject to periodic reviews jointly by GOM and IDA,



                                                    - 10-

with stakeholder participation, to ensure flexibility and address any constraints to successful
implementation o f the program. Any changes in the PIP and in the COM would require IDA'Sprior
concurrence.

Sustainability and Scaling-up Strategies

The main focus o f the project i s on the sustainability o f investments. An effort i s made to create
mechanisms to involve all sections o f the communities in the selection o f technical options which are
affordable, and environmentally and operationally sustainable. For this purpose, the source sustainability
analysis would be made part o f the participatory appraisal at the community level. The focus would be on
developing low cost technical choices, with particular emphasis on recharge and conservation o f ground
and surface water rather than on construction of schemes.

GOM would make a sustained effort to develop a large pool of service providers that would be
accountable to, and contracted by, VPs and communities. To encourage the partnership between service
providers and communities, the project would promote: (i)         developing a cadre o f community level
service providers  - para professionals; (ii)  building capacity of public service providers to deliver
services in a demand driven manner; (iii)  facilitating interaction between private sector service providers
and communities to expose the former to various opportunities and develop partnerships; (iv) developing
capacity o f SOs that would move from village to village and provide catalytic inputs; (v) building
partnerships with service providers like engineering colleges and polytechnics which could become a
source o f technical support for the communities; and (vi) hiring capacity building organizations that
would build capacity and mentor and coach district teams and SOs.


Project cycle

PIP outlines the project cycle and subproject cycle specifying key steps and sequencing o f activities to be
performed in implementing the project. This will enable all partner institutions and other stakeholders to
understand and agree upon critical activities and their timing, duration and interdependence for ensuring
successful project implementation. At village level, the sub-project cycle involves five key steps, which
are planned and implemented by communities on their own initiative: (a) start up/dissemination o f
information; (b) pre-planning; (c) planning; (d) community implementation; and (e) post implementation.

Financial Management (Annex 6B)

The financial management system proposed for the project i s adequate to meet GOM's, local
governments' and communities' project management needs as well as IDA'Sfiduciary requirements as
per OP/BP 10.02. The financial management framework envisages that the project will maintain accounts
using existing Government accounting systems, with additional accounting and reporting processes that
would be necessary to classify project expenditures by components/activities and disbursement


                                                          - 12-

categories. The project implementation agencies will prepare monthly/quarterly/annual reports required
for project management at the village, district and state levels. The accounting and reporting system will
be manual inthe beginning and will move into a computerized environment during the life o f the project.
Assurances were obtained from GOM that the computerized Financial Management System (FMS)
would be established and operationalized by September 2005 and maintained thereafter.

Fund Flow: All project funds will be accounted for in dedicated accounts at the state, district and
village-level governments. Community contributions will also be remitted into separate Project accounts
opened and operated by participating VPs. The upfront mobilization o f partial capital contribution by the
communities will constitute a condition for releasing Project fund installments. Non-tribal habitations
will contribute 5% in cash upfront, before commencement o f implementation, and the balance 5% inthe
form o f cash and/or labour before completion o f implementation. Tribal settlements will contribute 1%
incash upfront, before commencement ofimplementation, and the balance 4% inthe form of cash and/or
labour before completion o f implementation. Release o f funds to VPs for implementation o f schemes will
be based on achievement o f predetermined and mutually agreed physical and process milestones. Funds
will be released ininstallments. About 2% o f the total sub project costs will be released upon completion
o f the village action plan, and submission by the VP o f an audited financial statement o f the project
activity. Any savings in funds released to VPs o n the basis o f approved cost o f village action plans, on
account o f economy and efficiency will be retained by VWSCs/PWSCs for financing O&M and other
activities related to subprojects. VPs' funding requests for cost overruns, on account o f faulty design or
extraneous reasons, will be reviewed by the District Appraisal Team and approved by the D W M C in
accordance with the norms and procedures agreed between GOM and IDA, and released to VPs through
supplementary financing agreements. All payments against agreed Financing Agreements as released by
the ZPs to the VPs will be treated as eligible expenditure for claiming reimbursement from IDA.The date
o f release o f such installments to VPs will be the point o f eligibility for claiming reimbursement by GOM
from IDA.

Monitoring, Learning and Evaluation (ML&E)

A Monitoring, Learning and Evaluation (ML&E) system will be established to monitor project progress,
process and outcomes, with the objective o f generating analytical information on the project's progress
and performance, and disseminate this information among stakeholders to enable them to effectively
address project implementation issues. Developing the ML&E system will be the responsibility o f the
Operations & Monitoring Team at the State level. Monitoring would cover: (i)                inputs, outputs and
outcomes; (ii)    performance o f project organizations; (iii)project processes; and (iv) project impacts.
Monitoring for supervision would focus on: (i)        quality and quantity o f participation o f VPs, tribal
settlements, VWSCs/PWSCs and women's groups; and (ii)cash contribution o f communities.
Participatory Monitoring and Learning will be especially designed for communities to enable them to
monitor progress and process at the village level. As part of monitoring and learning, six monthly audit
(independent review) would be carried out to ensure that processes and procedures as agreed inthe COM
are followed, technical standards are met, and social and environmental guidelines are followed. The
lessons emerging from the independent audits would be disseminated and discussed with the VPs,
communities, district and state teams and SOs, and corrective measures would be taken. Another
dimension o f project learning would be cross-learning among the GOI, KfW and other programs within
the state, as well as among other states in India. Among other instruments, Report cards will be used to
ensure accountability o f VPs, service providers and SO to the community. L o w cost communications
network o f information kiosks to link VPs to their district offices will also be developed. It i s proposed to
initially connect 25 blocks (1 block in each district) and 263 villages (1 village in each block)
electronically to test electronic data transmission at these levels. The districts and the Operations &
Monitoring Team will also be connected electronically for faster data transmission and feedback.


                                                     -13-

A Monitoring and Information System (MIS) will play a central role in the overall M&E system. The
system will ensure transparency by allowing access to information and records on project physical and
financial  progress and reviews and reports on scarcity monitoring, water supply village action plan
operations and maintenance, water quality management and sanitation village action plan monitoring.
The computer-based system will hold and report on the various indicators for the four phases o f the
project: pre-planning, planning, implementation and O&M. Once the system i s implemented both at
district and state levels, it will regularly and automatically collect the relevant information o n the
indicators from the data being captured. The proposed MIS will be integrated with FMS for collecting
financial information & GIS for water quality mapping, and aquifer management.

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:

(a)      Continuing with Supply Driven Model as followed in the first Maharashtra RWSS proiect: One
option would have been to continue with the implementation model o f the first Maharashtra RWSS
project, This model was essentially supply driven and did not deliver services to rural poor efficiently
and on a sustainable basis. Therefore, this option was rejected at the outset.

(b)      Decentralized service delivenl through district governments:    A second option would have been
to assign complete responsibility for project activities to district governments (ZPs), which have been
given the lead role in decentralized planning and implementation o f development programs. However,
because o f the large size o f the districts, ZPs tend to operate in a target driven, top down manner like
centralized line departments. This approach would have been against the project's objective o f
decentralizing service delivery function to VPs and user groups and at variance with the principle o f
taking project implementation to the lowest appropriate level. This option was also therefore rejected.

(c)      Single sector vis-a-vis multi-sectoral approach:  RWSS itself i s not a single sector, since it will
involve integrated delivery o f water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion, and integrated water
resource management at local level. Adding additional sectors would put unsustainable stress on the
implementing agencies and may dilute the quality o f implementation. Therefore, a larger multi-sectoral
approach was rejected.

(d)      The Proposed Option: The proposed project i s based on the successful results o f the two recent
IDA-Supported RWSS projects -Kerala and Kamataka 11- that have operationalized the demand driven
approach and supported broader sector reform programs in the two states appropriately adapted to the
Maharashtra situation. GOM has designed the project's institutional structure based on a careful analysis
o f the Kerala and Karnataka models and lessons leamed from the failures o f institutional arrangements o f
the previous Maharashtra RWSS project. As a part o f its strategy to deepen the broad decentralization
process down to VPs, GOM's focus i s on using already existing district and local governments, with
necessary checks and balances, and their empowerment with accountability. The proposed project will
introduce devolution o f substantial management and financial powers to VPs, indeed, a major
breakthrough for Maharashtra's decentralization effort, as presently such devolution stops at the district
level.

3. Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe project design:
National and International experience: The experience from the IDA-assisted projects in Paraguay,
Bolivia, Ghana, China, Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka have demonstrated effectiveness o f the
community driven development approaches inimproving sustainability o f investments. InIndia, GO1and
IDA partnership over the past decade has made impressive progress in successfully developing and
implementing innovative strategies to improve the sector's performance (Section B.2). The OED's Impact
Evaluation Report o f five IDA-assisted RWSS projects (May 1998) as well as the lessons learned from
projects supported by other donors agencies (Dutch, DANIDA, DFID) in India have also provided
valuable suggestions for designing participatory approaches, which are the cornerstones o f this project.
Some experiences and key lessons learned so far are as follows:

(i) Listentothe'voicesofthepoor':Listeningtoruralpoorhelpstodesignabetterprojectwith
focus on the needs and priorities o f the poor. The project preparation and design benefited from the
participation o f the poor communities and VPs in 30 villages inthe intensive hands-on learning pilot that
i s beingtested as part of project preparation.
(ii) Empower communities to participate in decision-making and control of resources:
Community participation in planning and implementation i s one way to ensure that the most appropriate
investments and service options are prioritized and sustainable. Community participation also facilitates
cost sharing and increases the accountability o f local governments.



                                                    - 15-

(iii) Decentralizewhileprovidingadequatetrainingandcapacitybuilding:Decentralizationof
services and investment decisions at the lowest possible level increases accountability and typically
improves service quality.

(iv)      Createsynergies betweenlocal governmentsandinformalinstitutions:Past experiences have
shown that villages with strong informal institutions for managing natural resources find it easier to
internalize new approaches and technologies without necessarily competing with those set up by the
government.     In support of project implementation, it is important to establish required links and
synergies between informal and formal institutions.

(v)       Build local ownership: Ownership o f the project design, at political, bureaucratic and
operational levels, i s a prerequisite for project success. Conducive policy environment and willingness to
learn by doing are equally vital for success.

(vi)     Ensure sustainability through user fees and contributions: Community contributions toward
capital costs would assure sustainability o f investments. When user fees are levied for O&M operations,
and contributions are collected toward the construction o f facilities, users can be expected to care more
for the efficiency o f and for continued maintenance o f the facilities.

(vii)    Develop adequate project monitoring system: Experience shows that an appropriate
information, monitoring and learning system must be inplace at the time a project i s launched inorder to
prepare the participating local government institutions and communities to avoid unnecessary delay in
project implementation.

(viii)   Long-term and phased horizon:Planning o f water supply and sanitation facilities should have
a long-term horizon (say 30 years) and investments should be planned to allow for infrastructure to be
built in a phased manner, as needs develop andresources permit. Hence, the programmatic approach is
critical for rural water and sanitation projects.

4. Indicationsof borrower commitment and ownership:
India has developed a national sector strategy (2003) which i s in line with the Bank strategy for rural
water supply and sanitation. The GO1 line ministry, the Ministry o f Rural Development (MRD), i s
committed to nationwide implementation o f the sector reform agenda contained in the national sector
strategy.   GOI's Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission (RGNDWM) has initiated follow-up
actions for nationwide dissemination o f the new reform strategy and for creating an enabling
environment for its implementation. GOM has demonstrated its ownership o f reforms by: (i)         taking a
policy decision     to implement and operationalize the reforms state-wide; (ii)restructuring existing
agencies to align their role with the new approach; (iii)     amending the Panchayat Raj Act to empower
village communities and strengthen devolution; and (v) phasing out direct and indirect subsidies.

5. Value added of Banksupport in this project:
GO1has requested IDA to assist a few select states in implementing sector reforms. It believes that IDA
support will provide a strong demonstration effect nationwide. As for GOM, given its commitment to
implement reforms statewide and sizeable investments that may be demanded by rural communities,
IDA i s uniquely positioned to support both the reform process and the associated investmentprogram in
RWSS. In addition, IDA can make available to Maharashtra its considerable knowledge o f national and
international experience and best practices indevelopment o f the sector.

E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are inthe project file, see Annex 8)

0 Costbenefit
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
                        NPV=US$89 million; ERR= 20 YO(see Annex 4)
0   Cost effectiveness
0   Other (specify)
The economic analysis o f the project was carried out for six typical schemes, distinguished by
technology/water source and terrain, and for the entire project. The main benefits quantified are: value o f
time saved incollecting water, value o f incremental water consumed, health benefits and costs that would
be incurred without the project situation to maintain the existing water supply arrangements. Apart from
these, environmental and institutional strengthening benefits are expected to accrue, but these have not
been quantified. The project i s expected to save, on an average 2 hours per household per day, across
different types o f schemes and technologies proposed under the project. The estimated rate o f return i s
about 20% for the project as a whole. Sensitivity tests based on assessed risks indicate that the project i s
able to absorb substantial negative impacts and still generate a positive ERR.

2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=USS million; FRR = YO(see Annex 4)
There are n o fixed financial revenues inthe project. The O&M i s the responsibility o f households and
local village institutions. For this reason, a financial cost-benefit analysis was not carried out.

Fiscal Impact:
The financing plan for the project provides that GOM would contribute about 27% o f the total project
cost ($73.6 million) over a period o f five years, comprising o f both investment and recurring costs for the
project period, including price and physical contingencies. The recurrent cost from Year 6 o f the project
i s expected to be minimal since the bulk o f operating and maintenance expenditures on rural water and
supply facilities funded by the project will be borne by the communities. Inabsolute terms, the estimated
annual government contribution will range between $12-13 million, or about 30% o f the annual outlay o f
US$40.0 million on the water supply and sanitation. Inview o f the priority provided by GOM to ensure
adequate and safe rural water supply along with total sanitation, GOM expects n o difficulty in allocating
the required counterpart funds for the proposed project. However inview o f the overall fiscal stress that
the state has been undergoing in recent years, GOM expects to raise counterpart resources from the
project primarily from potential savings that will be realized on account o f the recent introduction o f
reforms within the RWSS sector. For FY2003-04, GOM has made adequate budget allocation o f about
US$ 2.6 million (Rs. 130 million) toward the cost o f launching the project. GOM will make required
supplementary budgetary allocations for the current year (up to March 2004) and ensure that adequate
and timely counterpart funds are made available during the following years.

3. Technical:
The project will support infrastructure building such as rural water supply schemes, ground water
recharge measures including source strengthening, rain water harvesting measures, rehabilitation o f
existing schemes, community and environment sanitation facilities such as group latrines, road side
drains for disposal o f sullage and storm water, compost/garbage pits for disposal o f solid waste and
conversion o f unsafe sanitation technologies to safe sanitary latrines. Before construction o f any new
assets, the focus will be o n rehabilitating the existing assets to the extent possible with conservation,
reallocation and participatory demand management o f water as the main strategies to reduce additional
water demand and consequent need for additional infrastructure. Adequate focus will be given on
sustainability o f water resources by adopting various water recharge or conservation measures while
planning the water supply schemes. The community will choose the desired technology and service


                                                     -17-

levels, based on their affordability, with the help o f SOs and district teams. A Technical Manual has been
developed with various technical options, guidelines and codes o f practice to guide community and SOs
ineffective decision-making duringplanning andimplementation of schemes.

The Piloting o f Ground Water Aquifer Management i s expected to generate additional information and
lessons for potential interventions under the Project for source sustainability. Most o f the water supply
schemes are expected to be single village schemes, with simple technologies, which the communities can
handle themselves. Only a few larger multi-village schemes will be funded by the project, where the
source sustainability or water quality i s an issue. The project cycle would be fine tuned during the first
year o f the project to suit the requirements o f multi-village schemes.

Community, support agencies and district teams would supervise quality o f works under implementation.
Training would be provided on technical matters at various levels (village, district and state) and at
various stages during planning, implementation and O&M stage. During implementation o f schemes,
training would be provided to the community on O&M before completion o f facilities. Skills o f Local
resource persons would also be developed to support the community inO&M as needed.

4. Institutional:
GOM has taken a critical policy decision to shift the delivery mechanism for rural drinking water and
sanitation from the traditional supply driven approach to the more sustainable demand-responsive
approach. Although key sector institutions continue to operate intheir traditional framework, the process
o f institutional restructuring has been initiated through a series o f Government Orders in order to scale
up reforms across the state, manage the transition, and successfully implement the reform program.
GOM, after a careful study o f the existing systems and assessment o f the different options, has finalized
details o f implementation models, including design o f fund flows, transfer o f decision-making authority
and accountability to rural communities and VPs; staffing and s k i l l mix required at different levels;
management practices, and linkages with existing sector institutions.

Considering that GOM i s implementing the reforms statewide, it was decided early o n that the role o f
existing sector agencies (MJP and GSDA) should be reviewed and restructuring plans implemented
during the project implementation. Following internal consultation and discussion at key policy making
levels, GOM will take necessary steps (including studies, legislative measures) to finalize a detailed and
comprehensive time-bound action plan for the restructuring o f MJP and GSDA and will implement in the
meantime an interim option, separating the O&M function from all other functions, by December 31,
2004.
4.1 Executing agencies:
The main partners inproject implementation and their key functions would be: (i)      GOM: funding, policy
support and creating enabling environment; (ii)state level water supply and sanitation department
(WSSD): facilitation and monitoring, strategic planning, scaling up, and achieving program development
objectives; (iii) local governments at district and block levels (ZP and PS): promotional, capacity support
to VPs and communities, providing checks and balances and in RWSS facility appraisal, approval and
funding, and ensuring proper implementation o f the project rules; (iv) VPs planning and implementation
with full community participation and endorsements,              management o f project funds; (v) user
groups/communities: decision making, participation in planning, implementation and O&M; and (vi)
private sector/SOs: social, technical, and management support to the implementing agencies and user
groups.
4.2 Project management:
The project's institutional arrangements are based on the experience o f the IDA-supported RWSS


                                                     -18-

projects in India where decision-malung power and control have been transferred to the local
governments and village communities. The proposed institutional model also addresses the issue o f
sustainability o f institutions, and proposes to improve and redefine the existing sector institutions. The
proposedproject would be managed as follows:

At the state level, the Water Supply and SanitationDepartment (WSSD)       - Jalswarajya Office will be in
                                                                                                -
charge o f the project, with a Project Director managing its day-to-day implementation o f the project. The
Project Director will lead two supporting teams, the Reform Support Team (RST) and the Operations and
Monitoring Team (OMT). The first team will be responsible for the learning and knowledge management
for reshaping sector policies while the second team will perform project implementation and monitoring
progress and impacts o f the project. Considering the statewide spread o f activities under the proposed
project, a small unit will be set up in each o f the six Divisions o f the state to monitor, provide quick
feedback to the districts and conduct key progress and process checks at the district level.

At the district level, ZPs will be the focal point for implementation o f the project. The existing Water
Supply Departments o f ZPs will be restructured into three teams to assist VPs and communities. The
joint teams will: (a) facilitate, coordinate and guide community development and technical activities
(District Facilitation Team); (b) ensure that the project addresses community priorities and follow the
principles and guidelines for project implementation (District Appraisal and Monitoring Team); and (c)
take care o f financial support activities while arranging and coordinating the financial audit o f project
account for VPs (District Financial Management Team).

VPs will develop and implement Village Action Plans after these are approved by the Gram Sabhas. VPs
will also receive and manage project funds, arrange to collect community contributions, water charges,
etc., as approved by the Gram Sabha, and liaise with the district-level government. VWSCs will be the
key community organization in a VP that will be inclusive and responsible for planning, implementing
and managing the local water and sanitation facility funded by the project. Thus, VWSCs will be the
executing arm o f the V P and will remain accountable to the Gram Sabha and VPs by being entrusted with
the responsibility o fcarrying out the implementation o f the project.

VPs will engage SOs like field NGOs, self help groups, federations o f women organizations, public
sector agencies, private contractors (generally for larger multi-village schemes) with endorsement o f the
Gram Sabha. SOs will catalyze formation o f VWSCs and develop their capacity to plan and implement
sustainable solutions. They will also carry out sensitization and awareness building campaigns while
acting as facilitators and liaising with VPs, District Teams, ZPs and Gram Sabhas.
4.3 Procurement issues:
The Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was last carried out in 2000. A procurement
review for the state o f Maharashtra has been completed inMarch 2003. Maharashtrahas had a number of
IDA funded projects over the years both under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits including the Maharashtra
Rural Water Supply Project Iwhich closed inJune 1998. The state thus has extensive experience o f IDA
procurement and consultant guidelines.

Community Procurement. Under the project, eligible communities will undertake repaidrehabilitation
or construction o f new drinking water schemes serving their VP/community through their own efforts
based on a demand driven approach. Therefore, most o f the procurements (works, goods and services)
will be done at the VP level. The C O M gives detailed procedures, rules and methods of community
procurement.




                                                    - 19-

Other Project procurement. Procurement o f services and goods required for the project shall comply
with the IDA'Sprocedures as described inthe relevant Guidelines.
4.4 Financial management issues:
The Financial Management Manual (FMM) along with the Financing Agreements entered into between
ZP and V P on approval o f the village action plans would include detailed guidelines on the agreed
financial management arrangements. The main challenges to satisfactory financial management o f the
project relate to GOM's fiscal ability to make timely releases o f counterpart funds and substantial risks
involved in VPs handling significantly larger sums o f money than they have in the past. The financial
management        arrangements set in place have consequently focused on: (a) seeking adequate
commitments from GOM to ensure timely releases o f funds; and (b) ensuring that the project invests
substantially in buildingthe capacity o f communities in book keeping and accounting through trainings
to office bearers o f VPs and VWSCs and developing a cadre o f para professional book keepers.
Important lessons learned from the implementation experiences in other RWS Projects and other
Community Driven Development (CDD) projects in India have been incorporated into the design o f the
financial management system. The financial management arrangements would emphasize on providing
local level transparency, social audit and self-accountability. The institutional framework for the project
envisages adequate levels o f staffing for financial management and accounting functions at the state,
district and village levels (Annex 6).

Disbursements: Disbursements from IDA credit would initially be made in the traditional system
(reimbursement with full documentation and against statement o f expenditure (SOE)) and could be
converted to the Report based disbursements at the option o f the GOM and GO1 after successful
demonstration o f regular, timely and adequate Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs).

Retroactive Jinancing: GOM has requested for retroactive financing o f US$2.5 million to meet the
expenditures incurred since March 1, 2003 including those that are anticipated up to Credit signing. The
activities to be covered by retroactive financing are consistent with the project's financing categories
agreed with IDA.

Audit: The Comptroller and Auditor General o f India (CAG) through its offices in Maharashtra will be
the statutory auditor for the project. The AG's office will conduct annual audit o f the operations o f the
OMT at the state level, DrinlungWater Management and Sanitation Department at the ZP level and a
selected sample o f VPs at the village level. The audit report would consist of: (a) financial statements;
and (b) audit opinion confirming whether the project financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with consistently applied Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view o f the
operations o f the project during the year and that the withdrawals from the IDA Credit made on the basis
o f SOEs/FMRs together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be
relied on to support the related withdrawals. Additionally, the auditor will be required to provide a
management letter to project management highlightingfindings during the audit. The TORSo f the audit
has been prepared in agreement with IDA, and will be agreed with the CAG. The form o f annual
financial statements to be certified will also be agreed with the CAG.

5. Environmental:                          Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emergingfrom this analysis.
GOM carried out the following studies: (a) Environmental Analysis; and (b) Report on water quality
issues, based on representative testing o f drinking water sources in pilot project districts. An
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) as part o f EA has been prepared giving details o f the
environmental issues, specific measures to address these issues, funding o f activities for environmental
protection and enhancement, and explicit environmental indicators to be monitored along with related
institutional responsibilities. Public consultations were carried out in six representative project districts
to identify environmental issues related to the project. These consultations were organized with the help
o f local NGOs, consultants and the Jalswarajya office. The summary EMP has been disclosed in local
language to villagers and other stakeholders. The environmental aspects have been dovetailed into the
operationalmanual and the PIP for the project.

The key environmental issues are as follows: (i) Quantity issues: declining groundwater tables,
                                                      Water
drying up of drinking water sources and competing demands for scarce groundwater. The project has
developed specific measures to address and monitor water quantity issues; (ii)       Water Quality issues:
chemical contamination o f drinking water sources mainly due to fluorides, nitrates and salinity. The
project supports the on-going GOM water quality monitoring program and will build institutional
capacity for water quality testing / analysis, and taking corrective actions. Fluorides, nitrates and TDS
will be specifically monitored in the hotspot areas; bacteriological contamination will be monitored by
each VP using simple residual chlorine tests; (iii)  Household and Environmental Sanitation issues: usage
o f improved sanitary facilities i s low (as per survey in year 2000, only 10-13% o f rural households were
usingprivate latrines; improvements are expected to emerge during the current survey in 2003); needfor
soak pits, drains for sanitary disposal o f sullage. The project will promote safe and appropriate soak pits,
compost pits, sullage drains and lane improvements as necessary.
5.2 What are the main features o f the EMP and are they adequate?
Main features o f the EMP:
(i) Measures to address water quantity issues: Rejuvenation and rehabilitation o f existing water supply
sources; provision o f new drinking water supply systems; source protectiodstrengthening measures to
enhance the availability o f drinkingwater; periodic review/assessment o f groundwater source; piloting o f
integratedwater resource management in six watersheds /aquifers.

(ii) Measures to address water quality issues: Use o f alternate safe sources (ground/surface water) for
drinkingpurposes; dilution of contaminated water by safe water; limiteduse of fresh water for drinking
and use o f contaminated water for other uses like washing, bathing; promotion o f rooftop rainwater
harvesting in schools and houses; community based de-flouridation to be used as a last option; research
and development for identifying cost effective and acceptable de-flouridation technologies. Project
supports the on-going GOM water quality monitoring program and will build institutional capacity for
testing, analysis & dissemination and taking corrective actions: (a) VP to monitor bacteriological
contamination using simple residual chlorine tests; (b) districts to conduct water surveillance o f a
minimum 10% sources, and coordinate with VPs as required; (c) state level WSSD to conduct water
quality tests for 100 % sources inhotspot areas on a priority basis.

(iii) Measures to address household and environmental sanitation issues: The project supports GOM's
total sanitation strategy (zero open defecation) and has a major hygiene component to improve sanitation



                                                     -21 -

and hygiene behavior.

(iv) Guidelines on Environmental Safe Technologies: The project will develop simple and community
friendly Guidelines (in local language) providing a menu o f environmentally safe technologies for water
supply schemes, recharge structures, householdcommunity toilets, drains, soak pits and compost pits by
December 31, 2003. These guidelines will be incorporated in the COM and Technical Manual, and
revised during the project implementation to reflect lessons and on-the-ground experiences.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status o f EA:
                     Date o f receipt o f final draft: April 20,2003

5.4 H o w have stakeholders been consulted at the stage o f (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe
mechanisms o f consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
Public consultations were carried out, as part of environmental screening in six representative project
districts. Preparatory meetings were held with CEOs and officials o f other departments, including RDED,
Health and Family Welfare, Groundwater, Watershed, Irrigation etc. as well as target groups at the
VP/community level.       Advance notices in local language, including details o f the proposed project
components were distributed to the rural public, elected representatives and other functionaries at V P and
district levels. The notices were displayed in local V P offices and public places like village temples,
schools and bus stops. The summary (in local language) o f the draft EA report, including environmental
issues, proposedmitigatory measures and performance indicators have also beenplaced at V P offices and
other public places o f the representative districts for comment and feed back.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact o f the project on the
environment? D o the indicators reflect the objectives and results o f the EMP?
Environmental indicators specifically related to the E M P have been prepared to monitor and evaluate the
impact o f the project on the environment. These indicators have been dovetailed in the various project
components, along with agencies responsible for monitoring the indicators. The state level agency will be
responsible for collecting and analyzing data. These indicators have been incorporated inthe PIP.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
Key social issues relevant to the project relate to the following: (i)           establishment o f inclusive and
accountable local institutions which are responsive to the needs o f rural population in general and rural
poor in particular; (ii) empowerment o f rural women by giving them greater access, choice and voice in
water and sanitation in particular and improving their access to development opportunities in general
through    institutional and capacity building support; (iii)      improvement in health status by bringing
changes inpersonal, domestic and environmental hygiene behavior/practices; (iv) build capacity o f local
governments (specifically VPs) to improve their effectiveness, transparency and accountability; and (v)
empowerment o f tribal groups in identified areas to access water and sanitation services and other
development opportunities.

Gender issues: Lessons learned from the sector have repeatedly pointed towards the essential role o f
women and the difference made by their meaningful involvement in the achievement o f outcomes and the
sustainability. Issues related to gender have received emphasis during project design and preparation.
Specific measures to be considered include: (i)        representation in local level institutions; (ii)
                                                                                                     opportunity
for women to participate in all stagedphases o f the project cycle; (iii)       capacity building effort that will
focus not only on water and sanitation issues, but also on issues related to development, skill building

and income generation activities; and (iv) linkages with other government schemes and development
opportunities. To address gender issues, GOM carried out an Operational Gender Strategy and Action
Plan, and the recommendations o f the strategy have been incorporated in the project design and
implementation model. A self-standing Women Empowerment Fund subcomponent included in the
project would help build capacity of women to play an effective role inRWS and develop skills to help
them generate income and employment. GOM has recently passed an order for the conduct o f separate
"Mahila Gram Sabhas" (women's village meeting) to precede the village Gram Sabha meeting. This will
greatly strengthen the participation o f women inthe project.
6.2 Participatory Approach: H o w are key stakeholders participating inthe project?
Participation and consultation: The project preparationinvolved extensive consultation with cross section
o f stakeholders at different levels (Village, District, State). Several rounds of discussions were held with
elected representatives,     NGOs, local       communities       and  officials. GOM organized       several
multi-stakeholder workshops to discuss the approach and implementation modalities. The project also
tried to build o n the Sant Gadge Baba campaign (sanitation campaign) providing incentives to the
community participation insanitation activities. The implementation of a pilot duringproject preparation
also helped inkeeping the consultationprocess inthe context o f ground realities.

The Social Assessment (SA) was carried out as part of project preparation usingparticipatory methods.
The participation and consultation framework has been designed based on a detailed stakeholder and
institutional analysis. The project will invite partnership with a range o f stakeholders in planning,
implementation and post-implementation phases of the project. Considerable experience i s already
available based o n experience from projects implemented earlier in the country and elsewhere.             In
addition, a Tribal Development Plan has been prepared and disseminated, based on extensive
consultations with stakeholders.

Rqles o f all key stakeholders involved in the design of the project (ZP, VPs, local institutions, NGOs,
CBOs, vulnerable groups, communities, public sector and professional agencies) have been identified
and incorporated in the detailed sub project cycle developed for the project.           Strengthening o f the
processes o f Gram Sabha will greatly facilitate meaningful participation o f local communities, not only
inthis project, but also in general development of the village. Inaddition, the "Mahila (women) Gram
Sabhas" innovated by GOM in this project, would facilitate greater voice and choice for rural women in
the planning, implementation and subsequent operation and maintenance o f the water supply and
sanitation facilities. This process of consultation and documentation would continue in implementation
and post implementation phases to ensure continuous learning and sharing.
6.3 H o w does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
The project will be implemented in collaboration and consultation with the Community based local
institutions, NGOs and private sector organizations during all stages o f the project. NGOs and other
support organizations will primarily play the role o f facilitators and trainers.      Inaddition, they will
facilitate development o f inclusive decision making processes inVPs and VWSCs, and would intensively
promote the participation of women and other vulnerable groups inthe implementation and management.


Preparation: As mentioned under section 6.2, the project preparation activities involved extensive
discussion with NGOs and civil society organizations. In addition, as part o f the NGO capacity
assessment exercise, four regional consultation workshops were conducted with extensive participation
by 121NGOs.



                                                     - 23 -

Institutional arrangements: The institutional arrangement at the State and district levels will involve
advisory groups with membership from NGOs and civil society organizations.

Implementation: The implementation arrangement will involve support agencies (NGOs, private sector
consultants, technical agencies), who will assist rural communities (i)    to articulate their demand, (ii)
                                                                                                          to
plan and implement the schemes and subsequently and (iii)      to manage them. These support agencies will
also help buildcapacity o f stakeholder groups and institutions.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been providedto ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
Special provisions have been built for scheme level beneficiary committees (SLBC) for inclusion o f
vulnerable groups (tribals). The project will utilize existing local government institutions in combination
with the mechanism o f communities, supported by NGOs, CBOs and private sector. Thus it will address
not only sustainability o f water and sanitation services, but also indirectly influence governance issues at
broader level. The project combines the lessons learned from past experience with user groups and the
decentralization and governance agenda. User groups help in greater inclusion o f poor and vulnerable
groups, but may undermine decentralized institutions under the constitution. Involving decentralized
institutions helps address long term governance and sustainability issues, but may lead to elite capture
and poor performance due to limited capacity o f these (decentralized) institutions. The project addresses
both inclusion and governance issues by providing space for inclusion (through Gram Sabha, Mahila
Gram Sabha, participatory processes, broad basing the village water and sanitation committee structure
under the Village Panchayat, introduction o f scheme level committees where appropriate, participatory
processes inplanning, implementation and post implementation phases etc.) and at the same time putting
the decentralized institutions (VP, PS and ZP) in charge o f delivering the expected outcomes and
supporting them with capacity buildingand greater delegation o f financial and decision making powers.
6.5 H o w will the project monitor performance interms o f social development outcomes?
The project will have a monitoring system which will track progress (physical and financial), process and
outcomes. Indicators and milestones have been developed for each stage o f the sub project cycle. The
monitoring systems include process monitoring, self-evaluation by communities, participation monitoring
by multiple stakeholders and community report cards on project performance, participatory sustainability
monitoring and a clearly defined Social Audit process for which a government order has been already
issued by GOM. The process steps in the sub project cycle include collection o f baseline data, which
would be used for comparison with project achievements.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Annex 2 provides details o f various mechanisms to enhance sustainability o f investments. These are
summarized below:

Ownership and financial sustainabilitv: VPs and communities will have to apply to receive project
support adopting transparent eligibility and selection criteria. This should eliminate the risk o f lack o f
ownership. Capital cost sharing and responsibility o f O&M by beneficiaries are the first indicators o f the
demand for improved RWSS services. Since VPs and communities/VWSCs will have control over their
resources and will be the main decision-makers, there i s a greater chance that they will also raise
resources to operate and maintain the schemes on a sustainable basis. Inclusion o f all sections o f society
(particularly poor, women, and the more vulnerable groups) in decision-making, implementation and
receivingproject benefits, i s essential for sustainability. The project's specific interventions for targeting
these groups (Women Empowerment Fund, Tribal development Program, and poverty focus in VP
selection criteria, etc.) should have a positive influence on sustainability.The project also intends to
facilitate selection o f the technical options based on the affordability o f water charges so that


                                                       - 25 -

communities choose only viable and sustainable options and schemes.

Technical:    Adopting scientific methods for locating selected groundwater sources and implementing
associated water conservation and groundwater recharge measures will enhance sustainability o f yield. In
the case o f surface water schemes (only a few expected), necessary allocation for drinking water will be
obtained from the irrigation authorities. The sustainability o f physical works will be improved by
adopting sound design and engineering practices and monitoring the quality o f construction and
construction materials. The operational sustainability will be strengthened by training o f operators,
preventive maintenance and maintaining water quality by regular treatmentldisinfection.

Institutional: The project's institutional arrangements are in line with GOM's policy o f moving away
from direct service delivery to a facilitating function. All the three tiers o f the rural local government
(ZP, PS and VP) have the main responsibility o f project implementation. These institutions are
sustainable since these are integral parts o f Maharashtra's decentralization governance implemented since
1962.

However, VPs will be responsible for planning and implementation for the first time and the ZPs and PS
will, for the first time, play a supporting role for the VPs incarrying out these functions rather than doing
these themselves. The risks involved are: (i)     VPs might lack capacity and VPs may neglect interests o f
some villages and may not be inclusive o f certain social groups; and (ii)ZPs might lack appreciation o f
and the capacity to manage demand responsive approach, lack community development slulls and may be
too busy to focus on the project because o f their other responsibilities.

The project design would provide an array o f mitigatory measures to minimize these risks, which
include: local communities through Gram Sabhas and VWSSCs will be responsible for planning,
designing and implementing rural water and sanitation schemes; VPs will have control over resources
and their allocation; the project's strong VP capacity buildingprograms; support from experienced SOs
and engineering consultants to both VPs and ZPs; leadership and accountability o f the Chief Executive
officers o f the ZPs; and expanding s h l l base, systematic orientation and team building o f ZPs. In
addition, the project will enhance institutional sustainability by building capacity o f community
organizations inmanagement, implementation and O&M and developing a cadre o f para-professionals in
each village who could provide these services across a range o f assets.

        INDIA: Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation "Jalswarajya" Project

 ProjectDevelopment Objectives

 The development objectives o f the proposed project are to: (i)      increase rural households' access to
 improved and sustainable drinkingwater and sanitation services; and (ii)     institutionalize decentralization
 o f Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) service delivery to rural local governments and
 communities.

ProjectArea

 The RWSS sector reforms will be implemented in the entire state (33 districts). While the proposed
 RWSS project would cover 26 districts, the remaining 7 districts are covered by GOI's Sector Reform
 Pilots (SRP) and KfW programs. The project will be implemented in four successive batches o f VPs and
 tribal settlements during a five year period. The first phase o f nine districts will be launched in October
 2003 and the remaining 17 districts by June 2004. Initial community development work including
 Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities have already commenced in 9 districts and
 all 26 districts would be covered by about the end o f Year 1o f the project. Among districts applying for
 inclusion in the project, those showing the threshold level o f preparedness, by participating in
 orientation and capacity buildingprograms etc., will be included inproject implementation.

Self-selectionCriteria of Village Panchayats

Consistent with the demand-driven nature o f project investments in RWSS, VPs will be included in the
project by adopting a self-selection process. All the VPs in the project area will be eligible to apply,
provided they agree to the project rules. If in any batch, the number o f VPs applying i s more than what
the project can support in that batch, then the VPs will be selected based on a predetermined
prioritization criteria and weightage. These are: (i)  quantity and quality o f available water and state o f
existing WSS facilities; (ii)proportion o f BPL and tribal families; (iii) o f dues collection efficiency;
                                                                          level
and (iv) agreement to adhere to the project rules. Within a selected VP, the villages already having safe
water supply o f more than 40 lpcd or VPshillages applying only for sanitation facilities will not be
eligible to receive project support. The qualifying criteria for VPs are included in the Community
Operational Manual and will be readily accessible to all stakeholders.

ProjectComponents: The project will include the following four components:
By Component:

Project Component A US$187.00 million
                       -
Component A: CommunityDevelopment & InfrastructureBuilding. This component consists of the
following three sub-components : (i)   Community Development; (ii)     Community Infrastructure; and (iii)
Tribal Development Program.

A1:Community Development ($26.0 million). This sub-component will finance three main activities:
(i)Community Capacity Building; (ii)Women Empowerment Fund; and (iii)Village Panchayat
Strengthening.

(i)Community CapacityBuilding.The objectiveofthis sub-component isto facilitate theformation of
inclusive, responsible and skilled VWSCs and to build their capacity and empower them to plan,



                                                   - 37 -

implement, operate and maintain water supply and sanitation facilities through a participatory process o f
informed decision-making and collective action within the ambit o f Gram Sabhas and VPs.

Activities to be financed under the sub-component will include: (a) establishment o f an inclusive and
accountable VWSC; (b) preparation and implementation o f a community-based Village Action Plan; (c)
development o f Gram Sabha as a participatory, transparent decision-making forum; (d) assist VWSC, VP
and other local community organizations such as women's groups in capacity building; and (e) develop a
cadre o f para-professionals for efficient implementation and management o f the local water and
sanitation facility.

The community organization and development aspects initially require a high level o f facilitation and
capacity building on an intensive basis.       The project would use SOs in the Districts and State for
catalyzing formation o f VWSCs and developing their capacity to plan, implement and self manage. On
technical, managerial and other social aspects, VWSCs would be supported by DFTs which will include
members who will have various types o f expertise. Inaddition, VWSCs would approach various service
providers such as GSDA, MJP and private sector agencies to assist in planning and implementation
phases. VWSCs would also be encouraged to use services o f CBOs like Federation o f Self Help Groups
to take some responsibilities inimplementation. It i s expected that SOs' role would taper o f f as VWSCs
develop independent capacity for self management and their skill base improves.

(ii) Women Empowerment Fund. The objective o f this sub-component i s to mainstream women's
participation in water management, sanitation and village development activities. It i s designed to
empower women in building and strengthening partnership with VPs by forming a Women's
Development Committee (WDC); facilitating women's full and inclusive participation through Mahila
Gram Sabhas and the main Gram Sabhas; facilitating women's participation in VWSCs, Social Audit
Committees and other sub-committees in leadership roles and build women's capacities for undertaking
economic and village development activities through skills training and access to Women Empowerment
Fund.

The sub-component will finance activities in support o f women's empowerment including exposure
visits, workshops on mobilizing women, entrepreneurship training, personality development workshops,
skills development training; and fund mobilization training. WDCs, one in each o f the participating VPs,
will comprise mainly o f women members (at least 75% o f the total) from various self-help groups.
WDCs, with support from gender facilitators, will develop Women Empowerment Plans that will include
capacity building, development o f skills and fund requirements for undertaking economic and village
development activities, with a focus on water and sanitation. While the seed money will be targeted at
women from BPL families, all members o f women's groups will be encouraged to federate at the village
level and link to financial institutions for increased access to credit. Each VP will be eligible for funds to
the tune o f US$2,000 (approx.) towards these activities 60% o f which i s earmarked for capacity building
and the balance towards seed money (40%).

(iii)VillagePanchayatStrengthening. Theobjectiveofthis sub-component istobuildtheinstitutional
capacity o f VP so as to enable it to perform the guiding, coordinating and monitoring roles o f Project
implementation at the village level. V P strengthening will consist o f building in: financial management,
implementing social audit processes, promoting Gram Sabha-based inclusive decision-making, revenue
generation (including water taxes), water conservation and distribution,           sanitation and hygiene
promotion, and O&M. Technical assistance would be provided to VPs for improving effectiveness and
viability o f both old and new water supply schemes. Specific capacity buildingmodules and institutional
arrangements would be developed at ZP level for providing this support. SOs having experience in



                                                     - 38 -

working with PRIs would be involved in this process. This sub-component will finance VPs' essential
office and communication equipment, furniture and contractual staff hired for purposes o f financial
management, accounting services and capacity building activities. This sub-component would also
finance VP's cost o f orientation and training o f its staff in community driven development including
cross-learning and exposure visits.

A2. Community Infrastructure.($132.0 million)This sub-component will finance: (i) Recharge   Water
and Source Strengthening; (ii)      Water Supply Schemes with a combination o f new investments and
rehabilitation o f existing investments; and (iii)Community School and Environmental Sanitation
Infrastructure.    Communities will plan, implement and manage water supply facilities through VWSCs
incollaborationwith VPs.

(i) Ground Water Recharge and Source Strengthening. The recharge and source strengthening
activity i s a step toward long-term sustainability o f rural water supply. To ensure that rural water supply
schemes are constructed on a groundwater resource that i s dependable, the project will support measures
to increase recharge to groundwater systems including simple check bunds in gullies to complex
diversion and infiltration structures and injection wells to artificially recharge groundwater. For longer
term sustainability, however,      communities must practice water management (balancing demand and
supply) measures at aquifer level. This has beenprovided for separately inthe form o f a pilot component.

(ii)Water Supply Schemes. Objective of this sub-component is to develop cost-effective and
sustainable water supply facilities either by way o f improvement o f existing facilities or by setting up
new facilities through a process o f community consultation, collective action and technical facilitation.
The implementation o f the Swujuldhuru program o f GO1 will be suitably dovetailed so that project
processes are consistently followed. This sub-component will finance construction, rehabilitation and
improvement o f drinking water facilities. The majority o f the schemes (about 90%) will be dependent on
groundwater and the remaining will use surface water. Communities will choose affordable and cost
effective technologies from a menu of possible options consisting o f dug wellsihand pumps, mini water
supply schemes, piped water supply schemes, rain water harvesting, and rehabilitation and strengthening
o f existing water supply schemes. User-friendly technical guidelines have been developed to assist
communities in choosing appropriate water supply and sanitation options during the course o f the
preparation of the village action plans. Although priority will be given to rehabilitating existing facilities,
the project will not routinely finance RWSS facilities that were commenced by GOM and its agencies or
communities prior to the introduction o f the sector reform framework, especially those started under the
on-going master plan. Such ongoing schemes can be considered by IDA only on a case to case basis and
only if the project rules are applicable. Technical aspects o f RWSS are provided in the PIP and the
Technical Manual.

(iii)Community, School and Environmental Sanitation Infrastructure.This sub-component will
complement GOM's new strategy for promoting total sanitation which recognizes that the sanitation goes
beyond the installation and use o f latrines. Maintaining a clean environment by adopting suitable
measures like drainsisoak pits for sullage disposal and safe disposal o f solid waste would be supported.
Inaddition, project will finance sanitary complexes for women, and school water supply and sanitation.
These would be implemented inconjunction with activities o f GO1supported TSC.

A3. Tribal Development Program. ($29.0 million). The objective o f this sub-component is to build
institutional capacity o f tribals and improve their access to sustainable water and sanitation services. with
specific focus on tribal settlements and groups. The Tribal Development Plan will include financing o f
the following activities: (i)  community development including technical assistance to build community



                                                     - 39 -

level capacity o f tribal population to self-manage their activities; (ii)   support to infrastructure for
drinking water supply including source strengthening, water conservation and recharge measures,
community sanitation, environmental and hygiene promotion; (iii)development o f para-professionals
especially for supporting health initiatives; and (iv) empowerment o f tribal women and youth by
implementing the Women Empowerment Fund.

Project ComponentB US$54.60 million
                      -
Component B: Institutional Strengthening This component consists o f the following                   four
sub-components: (i)   Capacity building; (ii) including Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion (SHP); (iii)
                                             IEC
Monitoring and Learning; and (iv) Project Management.

B1: Capacity Building($12.85 million).The objective o f this component is to develop a shared vision
and build required competences among key stakeholders at state and district levels to enable them
perform their respective roles. This sub-component will fund capacity building activities to strengthen
ZPs, PS, SOs and State-level agencies. Project expenditures for capacity building will include
training/exposure visits, technical equipment, purchase o f computers and other office equipment, and
furniture.

At the district level, this sub-component will strengthen project ZPs (26) to carry out their new role
efficiently, and will build capacity o f SOs. Specifically, the sub-component will finance: (a) capacity
building consortium in each district that would be responsible for training o f ZPs, PSs and SOs (in
planning and implementation) at district/ block level so that they can help implement the reform program
and respond to the capacity building needs at the village level; (b) community development and
infrastructure training for district level staff including (i)
                                                             training in IEC, change management, skills
development, participatory approaches, community mobilization, finance and accounts and procurement;
(ii) incommunityinfrastructuresuchassourcestrengtheningandwatersupplyfacilities; water
    training
conservation; household, community and environmental sanitation; and (iii)training and skill
development in areas such as program design and management, participatory needs assessment,
budgetary and financial management, informationtechnology, and M& E; and (c) exposure visits, study
tours, workshops for district teams and state teams.

At the state level, this sub-component will assist GOM to develop its staff skills in the areas of
community development and infrastructure, water supply and source strengthening, water conservation,
environmental sanitation, IEC, water quality monitoring, and project monitoring and learning.

B2: IEC including Sanitation, and Hygiene Promotion ($10.00 million). The objective o f this
sub-component i s to develop and implement a development communication strategy in the State which
will focus on promoting behavioral changes among all stakeholders towards improved sanitation and
hygiene practices and empowering the rural poor in their interactions with partnering institutions. This
sub-component will finance (a) activities for promoting safe water supply and use, sanitation and
hygiene; (b) the Women Empowerment Fund and (c) the Local Government Incentive Fund. The
sanitation and hygiene promotion would include supporting GOM's new sanitation strategy o f stopping
open defecation and hygiene behavior change. The Operations and Monitoring Team at the state level
will be provided with services o f an IEC specialist and a Health Communication Specialist, and the
District Facilitation Teams (DFT) at the District level with funds for communication and dissemination
equipment, access to media, and production and distribution o f display posters, folders and pamphlets to
households, wall writings and paintings, street plays, and other media events.

IEC will primarily focus on a core set o f the most crucial health protection messages relating to the
importance o f (a) water disinfections and safe home storage; (b) hand washing after defecation and


                                                    -40-

before preparing food; and (c) using latrines and toilets versus open-field defecation. Innovative
demonstration methods will be usedto enhance learning effectiveness.

B3: Monitoring and Learning ($3.80 million). The objective o f this sub-component i s to monitor
performance and progress of the project and disseminate it among all stakeholders, for learning from the
lessons and empowering them to work in partnership for the attainment o f Project objectives.This
sub-component will finance establishment and strengthening o f an ML&E system that will serve the
needs o f project agencies at all levels including the state, ZPs, VPs and communities -with the objective
o f generating analytical information on the project's progress and performance, and disseminate this
information among stakeholders to enable them effectively address project implementation issues.
Through this component, the state level agency will take on an expanded role to promote knowledge
sharing. The ML&E system will facilitate learning and empowering o f stakeholders to work in
partnership to realize project objectives in a timely and effective manner. Expenditures in this
sub-component will mainly be for imparting training o f team members in ML&E concepts and methods
inthe areas ofrural water and sanitation and providing them with tools and office equipment to perform
their tasks more efficiently.   Using the principle o f "carrying tasks at the lowest appropriate level",
communities will be responsible for carrying out tasks for monitoring quantity (inputs and outputs) and
quality at their level. The sub-component will also finance expenditures on ML&E studies and
consultancy, design workshops, workstations, internet connections and networking, study tours,
information review and dissemination, learning melas, and analytical work on project design,
implementation and impact.

Health Impact Monitoring will be undertaken to judge the project effectiveness in improving public
health. The results o f the monitoring will again be a powerful teaching tool to villagers in showing the
impact o f healthy practices; and will help provide alerts and corrections that must be made ifthe schemes
are failing to deliver expected benefits.

This sub-component will also fund a report card system to facilitate performance monitoring o f various
institutional groups that work on achieving the project's      development objectives, as an instrument o f
accountability across them. The report card system will enable the partnering institutions like Mahila
Mandals, VWSCs, VPs, and District Level Teams to monitor each other in a transparent,
non-confrontational way.

B4: Project Management ($27.95 million). The objective o f this sub-component is to (i)      strengthen the
capacity o f the ZP to perform successfully its new facilitating roles and (ii) set-up and strengthen state
level institutional arrangement for policy development and coordination and monitoring so that the
reform program in water supply and sanitation sector i s scaled up throughout the State. This
sub-component will finance project management costs at the district and state levels. At the district
levels, the expenditures would include setting up o f DWMSCs including costs o f contracted professional
services, office furniture and equipment, transportation and incremental operating costs such as
government staff incentives, travel and subsistence. At the state level, the sub-component will finance
setting up the o f OMT, R S U and six small units at the Division level (including professional costs,
transportation and associated incremental operating costs).

stakeholders, aimed at exchanging and using information and knowledge relating to various aspects o f
the sector and supporting policy development. This sub-component will finance establishment o f a
knowledge management and policy support system to support GOM's statewide implementation o f the
reform program. Expendituresunder this sub-component include: (a) consultancy contract fees for design
and implementation o f project and sector information system; (b) purchase o f computers, servers,
printers, (c) costs o f networking, website development and hosting; (d) studies, workshops, exposure
visits, dissemination o f lessons learnt among stakeholders and provision o f technical advisory services;
and (e) studies to further develop restructuring o f MJP/GSDA.

C2: Water QualityMonitoring($3.50 million). The objective o f this sub-component i s to institute an
effective water quality monitoring system so as to ensure safe water to the communities.                 This
sub-component will finance: (i)    statewide one time testing o f all drinkingwater sources and subsequent
follow-up measures; (ii)   water quality monitoring and surveillance activities o f state agencies; and (iii)
introduce a system to empower village communities to monitor performance o f state agencies.
Expenditure financed will include testing, analysis and mapping o f water quality o n a statewide basis,
incentives to water quality testing staff at district level and costs o f village level sample testing for
bacteriological contamination. At the village level, a simple water quality monitoring system will be
developed talung into considerationthe lessons learned from the Kerala and Karnataka I1RWSSprojects.
Mahilla Mandals will be trained to monitor the water quality usingsimple kits and the community will be
empowered to demand independent testing o f water, if a doubt arises on the quality o f water.

Project Component D US$12.50 million
                       -
ComponentD:PilotComponent.

Piloting N e w Initiatives: The project will support implementation o f three pilots, which seem
fundamental to improve decentralization and governance o f district and village-level institutions; to
introduce aquifer-based supply and demand management o f water to enhance sustainability o f water
sources with reference to communities' broad-based priorities for diverse usages o f water; and to develop
and scale up a model for O&M o f water supply facilities that would expandbeyond the proposedproject.
The lessons learned by these pilots could be potentially replicated sector wide through future GOM or
donor-assisted projects.The three sub-components are:

 D1: Local Government IncentiveFund ($4.0 million). The Local Government Incentive pilot will
 support selected VPs and ZPs to develop, beyond the needs o f the rural water and sanitation sector, an
 approach to institutional buildingto become more effective, accountable and responsive and contribute
 to improving quality o f decentralization, devolution and local governance in Maharashtra. The Ministry
 o f Rural Development (MRD) has developed decentralization policy and service delivery systems for
 community infrastructure in a demand driven manner, and i s looking to develop institutional capacity
 within VP and ZP to manage decentralized services andbecome effective and inclusive institutions. The
 capacity o f the ZP needs to be developed not only in the context o f facilitating and supervising this
 project, but also as institution o f good and effective governance at the district level. The Incentive Fund
 for ZPs will provide grants to nine selected ZPs at about $150,000 each to make them more accountable
 to people and assume a greater development role. ZPs will use the project grants to finance expenditures
 on consultant fees for institutional restructuring and capacity development, including for budget making,
 implementation, monitoring and evaluation; introduction o f new information technology systems and
 equipment.

 The incentive fund will support about 225 VPs in nine districts with one-time grants ranging between
 $8,000 to $10,000 equivalent. The pilot would fund investments in using and adapting innovative
 approaches used in Gadge Baba Abhiyan (sanitation campaign) for stimulating VPs who have worked


                                                     - 42 -

 on management, inclusion and good governance to participate in a development market place and show
 case their efforts. Based on this competitive process, selected VPs would be provided intensive capacity
 building support in various areas including participatory planning and budgeting, community
 organization, promotion o f self help groups, inclusive decision making, community based procurement,
 financial management, negotiation skills and development o f community report card system to support
 user evaluation o f services provided by VP and self evaluation by VPs. This support would be provided
 through SOs, ZP and well functioning VPs. This will enable VPs to formulate and implement village
 development plans.

 The key outcome o f the proposed pilot would be a tested institution building approach for ZPs which
 could be scaled up to include the other districts o f Maharashtra. The project would also invest in cross
 ZP learning and knowledge management activities to draw key lessons for other decentralization
 programs o f GOM. The lessons learned would be shared and used to initiate dialogue with both MRD
 and ZPs to develop a programmatic approach to developing demand driven approaches in
 decentralization.

 D2: Groundwater Aquifer Management Pilot ($5.0 million).The objective o f this sub-component is
 to develop and test approaches for holistic and sustainable management o f water resources with the
 involvement o f key stakeholders. This sub-component will finance implementation o f a pilot activity in
 participatory management o f water sources in six representative districts in terms o f geo-hydrological,
 agro-climatic, and socio-economic conditions. The pilot will generate information for potential
 interventions required for achieving water source sustainability.

The main elements o f the Ground Water Aquifer Pilot are to: (a) build capacity o f stakeholders in the
pilot area for sustainable management o f groundwater resources; (b) analyze current state o f ground
water availability and use-patterns andtheir implications to source sustainability within the pilot area; (c)
provide information to stakeholders on ground water availability and sensitize them on the need for
community-centered demand management o f drinking water with a focus on sustainability; (d) develop
sustainable ground water aquifer management model that i s community-centered and managed to ensure
drinlungwater source sustainability; and (e) develop legal and regulatory framework that GOM could put
inplace for scaling upgroundwater resources management on a sustainable basis.

The activities under the pilot will include: (a) technical analysis o f the pilot areas (baseline survey and
social assessment o f pilot areas covering prevailing geo-hydrological, agricultural, social and economical
conditions; establishment o f piezometers for continuous water level and water quality monitoring;
monitoring o f cropped areas and other water uses; and development o f GIS database); and (b) IEC to
develop awareness and understanding among all types o f water users that (i)water resources (both
surface and ground water) available to the communities are not unlimited and therefore, need to be used
efficiently and judiciously; (ii)limited water resources must be used to provide livelihood to the
community as a whole adopting participatory, equitable, and demand management approaches; (iii)
reduced water use can potentially maintain individual households' current income levels if they adopt
new methods o f cropping and irrigation; and (iv) feed-back and community-management i s important for
effective design and implementation o f ground water legislation. Gender-specific messages for rural
women, who exercise a significant influence over water use within households and in agricultural
operations will form part o f the IEC.

Expenditures in this component will be on: (a) collection and analysis o f geo-hydrological, agricultural
and socio-economic data; (b) IEC campaigns for building awareness about ground water problems; (c)
forming Ground Water Management Associations (GWMA) at VP level which will be federated into



                                                   -43-

associations for geo-hydrologically compact areas; and (d) design and implementation o f physical works
for recharging depleting aquifers and increasing water availability.

D3: O&M Pilot Fund ($3.50 million). The main objectives o f the pilot are to develop: (i)an O&M
capacity buildingmodel for ongoing drinkingwater supply schemes, which are outside the purview o f the
proposed project's community infrastructure component; and (ii)        an action plan for scaling up the model
to eventually cover the entire state. With GOM's adoption o f the RWSS sector reforms, new investments
in the sector would be carried out using participatory demand led approaches that emphasize capacity
buildingo f local government and 100% O&M financing by users. However, there are a large number o f
villages inthe state with water supply systems that were implemented earlier in the supply driven mode.
In such villages, while water supply systems may be functioning (often below design performance
standards), the O&M arrangements have not yet been streamlined (tariff setting, tariff collection,
preventive maintenance etc.). As a result, these systems are operationally and financially unsustainable.
Consequently, the risks o f break downs are high while the repair costs will increase progressively. If
remedial measures are not taken on time, the probability o f premature system failure i s high and
correspondingly, higher cost investments are needed to bringthese systems back to working condition.

At present O&M costs are covered through indirect subsidies (maintenance support by block levelmobile
repair teams without adequate cost recovery) or direct subsidies (such as scarcity funds). Inaddition there
are several cases, where the systems have been implemented, but have not been taken over by local
governments (ZP, VP) causing a financial burden on the state. Besides, the real cost to community i s
much higher due to inadequate delivery o f water supply and inconveniences due to break downs etc.
Communities on the other hand are indifferent to the need for their involvement in and support to O&M
arrangements, as there was no community or local government involvement in the design and
implementation o f these schemes.

The pilot's activities will be carried out initially innine districts, selecting 3-5 villagedschemes in each
district. The villages would be selected from among those with functioning schemes in the district,
representing different typologies (hand pump, mini water supply, piped water supply and multi village).
A taskforce would be constituted comprising 5 professionals with expertise in community development,
gender, costing/financial management,         engineering and ground water recharge. The software
professionals (3 o f them) would be contracted professionals and the remaining 2 technical professionals
would be drawn from existing block level agencies. The team would visit selected villages/schemes,
carry out diagnostic assessment o f current situation, carry out IEC activities for mobilizing local people
(with special focus on women) conduct topical PRAs relatedto 0 & Mwith local communities and VPs.

                         InstitutionalModelandImplementationArrangements

GOM will implement the proposed RWSS program using an institutional model in which: (a)
VPsNWSCs will be the focal point for project implementation. They will be responsible for planning,
procurement, construction and O&M o f schemes, with technical support provided by ZPs, and other
support agencies (e.g. SOs, CBOs, GSDA, private consultants); (b) at district level, the ZP will be the
final authority for all project-related ahnistrative, financial and technical approvals; (c) project
implementation funds will be passed o n by GOM in installments to ZPs and from ZPs to VPsNWSCs;
(d) VPsNWSCs will be responsible for management o f construction funds including expenditure
approvals and accounting; in exceptional cases where schemes cut across VPs, PSIZP level committee
will be the appropriate implementing agency; (e) VP/Village/Habitation selection will be based on
transparent eligibility and prioritization criteria; and (f)institutional arrangements for multi-village water
supply schemes will be developed, with cost sharing rules remaining the same as for single village
facilities.

InstitutionalArrangements at Village Level

The following chart shows institutional arrangements at the village level (details are provided in the PIP
and COM). The focus i s on creating a sustainable and participatory institutional structure that ensures
responsive, inclusive,    accountable and efficient governance, for project implementation. The
implementation approach will empower users by giving them decision-making responsibilities and access
to ready-to-use information, by providing appropriate slulls, by creating an enabling environment and by
devolving financial management responsibilities to the appropriate level o f government.

Gram Sabha i s the general body consisting o f all persons registered in the electoral roles within the area
o f a VP, and i s a statutorily recognized institution for participatory decision-malung at the V P level.
Through the provisions o f the Bombay Village Panchayats (amendment) Act 2002, the GOM has vested
Gram Sabhas with substantial powers in matters dealing with social and economic development within
the VP. These include the following: regular Gram Sabha meetings; separate meetings o f women
members prior to regular meetings o f Gram Sabhas; selection o f individual beneficiaries for state
government schemes; power to approve local development plans, and grant permission to the Panchayat
for incurring expenditure under development scheme. With regard to the RWSS project, participating
Gram Sabhas will form VWSCs (sector-specific "Village Development Committees") in consultation
with VPs to perform various critical functions related to the project implementation and subsequent
management o f RWSS assets.

Village (Gram) Panchayat i s a body incorporated as Local Self Government under the Constitution o f
India and Bombay Village Panchayat Act o f 1958. VP i s the key village level institution for
implementation o f the RWSS Project. It: (a) initiates IEC activities, ensures capacity building o f itself
and its constituent community; (b) facilitates selection o f VWSC members by the Gram Sabha and
monitors VWSC activities; (c) applies for participation in the project and receives project funds; (d)
convenes Gram Sabha meetings;            (e) approves VWSC's proposals on formation o f various
sub-committees (Procurement, Finance, Audit, etc.); and (e) coordinates with ZP level agencies on all
matters concerning implementation o f the project.

ZPs will bring in additional expertise inWSS as needed from the private sector.

This separation o f functions is proposed as an interimmeasure. As the Water Supply Department begins
to better understandits new role, the facilitation and appraisal roles can be combined and performed by a
leaner unit. The proposed Organizational Chart and staffing plan for one district are given inthe Project
Implementation Plan.

Institutional Arrangements at State Level

The state level institutional arrangements have been designed to scale up GOM's reform policy with the
following role:


0        Provide policy and strategic support to districts and VPs.
0        Steer RWSS reform implementation for effectively achieving sector objectives
0        Provide expert advice on project implementation;
0        Provide operational support for project management, and
0        Undertake monitoring and evaluation

State Level Advisory Committee on Water Resources.            A state level Advisory Committee on Water
Resources will be established to advise GOM on policy issues in RWSS. The committee will have the
Minister o f Water Supply and Sanitation Department (WSSD) as the Chairman; Minister o f State for
Water Supply and Sanitation Department as Deputy Chairman, and Principal Secretary, Water Supply
and Sanitation Department as member secretary. The committee members will include outstanding
national and international experts in the sector and stakeholder representatives mainly from community
based organizations and NGOs. WSSD headed by the Secretary and assisted by the Deputy Secretary
will be for initiating, synthesizing and steering reformpolicies and their implementation inWater Supply
and Sanitation Sector in the state. The Principal Secretary to the Government, WSSD, will be in overall
charge o f the Project. The Deputy Secretary designated as Project Director will be responsible for the
day-to-day implementation o f the Project.

The Reform Support Team (RST) will include senior experts who will manage learning and knowledge
management roles for shaping the Sector Policy. The constitution o f the team i s provided in PIP.

The Operations and Monitoring Team (OMT) will perform project implementation and support functions
including monitoring o f progress and impact. OMT will be staffed with experts having strong operational
skills and field experience in engineering, ground water, community development, gender issues, health
and sanitation, M&E, and capacity building.

Empowered Committee. An empowered committee with appropriate powers o f the Cabinet devolved to it
has been established to speed up the decision-making. The Principal Secretary, Finance Department, i s
the Chair and the Project Director i s the Member Secretary. Decisions taken by the Empowered
Committee for Project implementation do           need further approvals from the Planning and Finance
Departments.

Regional Facilitating Team Inview o f statewide coverage o f project activities and to enhance the reach
   -
and coordinating capability o f the OMT, small project facilitation teams will be set up in each o f six
divisions in the office o f the Divisional Commissioner. These teams will perform extensive monitoring
activities, provide quick response and feed back to the districts, and conduct key process and progress
checks at the district level. The staffing plan i s provided in PIP.

CapacityBuilding and ScalingUp Mechanisms

The Project will use NGOs, CBOs (self help groups, federation o f women organizations), Panchayats
Samiti staff, and consortia comprising o f private, public and NGO sector professionals for mobilizing
communities, catalyzing formation o f VWSC, and implementing various capacity building activities
required by the project.

The project would use following mechanisms for scaling up:

   Investment in increasing the capacity o f NGOs for community mobilization and facilitation.
   However there i s a limit to number o f goodNGOs who can undertake these activities on a scale. The
   focus would be to develop a good mechanism to enlist and monitor their quality o f support at both
   state and District level. A capacity buildingprogram for NGOs would be developed to enable new
   NGOs to participate in the project.        Capacity o f existing CBOs (including SHGs and their
   federations) should also be developed for this purpose.

   Training a group o f para professionals to take some responsibilities for facilitation, mobilization and
   training. The project would invest in developing a cadre o f para professionals to undertake support
   to VWSCs and VPs. The project should try to invest in leadership, technical, financial, audit and
   management skills for village para professionals. Major scaling up o f the program can happen
   through para professionals. These should be accountable to VWSCs and VPs and given performance
   based incentives.

   VPs would be encouraged to develop networks and federations which could take up the
   responsibility o f scaling up the program. Mature VPs which have shown good performance could be
   rewarded and motivated by giving them a responsibility to mobilize, mentor and coach new and
   neighboring VPs to enable lateral spread and peer learning. Some support could be provided to
   VWSCs for scaling up the activities o f the project.

   On the supply side, significant investments will be made in development o f District Facilitation
   Teams at ZP level. Over a period o f time, similar teams could be developed at the Block level
   consisting o f Block Level functionaries.

   Interms o ftechnical service providers, when project achieves scale, it would be difficult to continue
   to find technical service providers only at the ZP level. Efforts would be made to locate competent
   NGOs with technical skills, engineering colleges with relevant disciplines and other private service
   providers and increase their ability t provide support to VWSCs in a demand driven manner. The
   project would also invest intraining of MJP and GSDA staff to become better providers o f technical
   options and demand driven services.

   The project would invest in developing capacity o f VPs and ZPs to be better facilitators o f
   participatory processes and being more responsive and accountable. This i s likely to enable VPs to
   become clear channels o f scaling up o f this program.

   Development o f IEC material highlighting the impact o f using these approaches and the process
   followed would enable information exchange and creating demand for these approaches.

Expandingthe choice of service providersto communitiesand VPs
The project envisages a process through which communities would be able to procure a range o f services
using community contracting and procurement for implementation o f the activities identified in the
Village Water Management and Sanitation Plans. Developing a large pool of service providers who
work in rural areas, are accountable to the community, are paid by the community and deliver quality
services i s a big challenge for the project.

The project proposes a choice o f service providers to the community and would actively promote
partnerships between community organizations and service providers. These are as follows:

0   Community level service providers: These include para professionals selected based on their
    aptitude and prior experience in this area by the community. These include village men and women
    with experience inrepairs, pumps,boring, masons, plumbers and village youth and women interested
    inpromotingsanitation andother appropriate technologies andwater quality monitoring. The project
    would aim to create a cadre and develop significant investments in capacity building o f these para
    professionals so that their services are indemand beyondthe project.

0   The other service providers would be CBOs like Mahila mandals and Yuvak Mandals and
    Federations o f Self Help Groups. Many activities involved in the implementation plans would be
    outsourced like collection o f water charges, construction activities, prefabrication o f blocks etc to
    these groups. There are examples o f these in Maharashtra. In addition engineers (retired and young)
    both would be also roped in as service providers for technical services and preparation o f plans and
    estimates.

0   Initially these para professionals would develop a market for their services in their village. Over a
    period o f time they would be encouraged to work in clusters and form o f an association to become
    local entrepreneurs over a period o f time, particularly related to O&M by taking service contacts with
    vwscs.

0   Public Service Providers: Although there are many agencies that are providing services to
    communities, most o f them are used to delivering services in a supply driven manner. The project
    would invest in capacity building o f public service providers to deliver services in a demand driven
    manner. The project i s already negotiating a partnership agreement with GSDA, the major geology
    and water source development and assessment agency to provide services to communities in a
    demand driven manner. The agency i s training its entire staff inparticipatory approaches and would
    develop specific service delivery packages in areas o f ground water assessment, source sustainability,
    O&M and repair services in a participatory manner and deliver them.           Similar agreements and
    investments in capacity buildingo f technical service providers in ZP, MJP and other public service
    providers will be also undertaken. It i s expected that as communities would be paying for these
    services directly, it will hold these service providers accountable

0   Private Service Providers: Currently the role o f private sector is limited in rural water supply
    schemes to suppliers o f materials like pipes and pumps, construction material etc. A large section o f
    the private sector involved inurban water supply schemes perceives rural areas as remote and risky.
    The project would facilitate interaction between private sector providers and communities to expose
    the providers to various opportunities and also appeal to the social corporate responsibility o f the
    private sector to be able to provide reasonable services at a reasonable cost. It i s also critical to
    involve the private sector to identify and pilot technology applications in area o f metering, IT
    applications and distribution networks.


                                                     - 54 -

0 Support Organizations includingNGOs: The project envisages anumber o f support organizations
  to provide initial limitedsupport insocial mobilization andcommunity organization and the leave the
  management and implementation to the communities.          The project needs to develop support
  organizations, which can move from village to village and are catalytic in their inputs. The project
  would need to orient the support organizations in this approach and also build capacity o f these
  agencies on technical issues including O&M and distribution, topical appraisals involving choice o f
  options. Investingina technical course for SOs would be critical.

0 Other providers like Engineering Colleges and Polytechnics: The project would actively build
  partnerships with these institutions so that students and teachers could actively work with
  communities in planning and preparation of technical plans and estimates. Maharashtra has a large
  network o f engineering colleges, which could become a steady source o f technical support for the
  communities.

0 Consortium of Capacity BuildingOrganizations: Buildingof capacity of VPs, District Teams and
  VWSCs is an ongoing task and would need to be done on a scale. VWSCs would also require a
  coaching and mentoring on an ongoing basis. The project i s trying to procure services o f many
  consortia o fNGOs and private consultants at State level and District Level for providing this support.

                                   Local Government Incentive Fund

The project will support a local Government incentive Fund comprising o f (a) an Incentive Fund for
Village Panchayats (VPs); and (b) an Incentive Fundfor Zilla Parishads (ZPs).

Incentive Fundfor Village Panchayats

The pilot project would make investments in using and adapting innovative approaches used in Sant
Gadgebaba Abhiyan (campaign for sanitation) for stimulating VPs who have worked on management,
inclusion and good governance to participate in a development market place and show case their efforts.
Basedon this competitive process, selected VPs would be providedintensive capacity buildingsupport in
various areas o f their operations including participatory planning and budgeting, community
organization, promotion o f self help groups, inclusive decision making, community based procurement,
financial management, negotiation skills, and development o f community report card system to support
user evaluation o f services providedby VPs and self evaluation by VPs. Fundswould be allocated to VPs
which have shown interest in developing their capacity.          Specific capacity building modules and
institutional arrangements need to be developed at ZP level for providing this support. Those institutions
having experience o f working with PRI institutions should be involved in the process.

V P i s also envisaged as the implementing agency for the new decentralization program o f G O M and
envisages direct resource transfer to Panchayat for sixteen different types o f community infrastructure
and services. The guiding principles for this program are very close to the proposed water supply and
sanitation program. These include community level prioritization, community contribution, community
management and social audit. Over a period o f time, the processes, institutional arrangements and rules
o f the game being developed under RWSSP, are expected to influence other sectors and decentralized
rural development programs proposedunder the new GOM initiative.

The selection o f VPs will be a done through a process similar to the Sant Gadgebaba Campaign but with
a focus on performance o f V P as a accountable, responsive and inclusive institution. The selection
would be based on the interest o f VPs, past performance o f district under other decentralized programs.
Within ZP, the selection o f VPs would also be based on some ranking process and IEC activities to
stimulate competition among villagers. Those VPs which are interested in being benchmarked for
performance would be supported for developing a user report card to develop a base line on quality o f
services provided by the VP.       VPs would be supported through a V P Incentive Fund. A regular
monitoring o f V P performance would enable ascertaining the improvement in VP performance over a
period o f time. The project would invest inpiloting o f a performance rating system for VPs.

Key Activities and Sequencing for VP Incentive Fund

Inthe first phase, the initial IEC campaign on the lines o f Sant Gadgebaba program will be launched to
promote good governance and effective management in VPs in all nine districts being covered initially.
This will set up a competitive and demand led process built on the existing efforts o f VPs. These VPs
can be from both participating in the proposed project or those from villages not covered by the project.
The GOM's Rural Development Department (RDD) could potentially use this methodology for a
statewide campaign to promote creation o f social capital around local governance issues and build
positive performance oriented incentives for VPs.

The second phase would involve selection o f 25 VPs in each District over a period o f two years. These


                                                  - 56 -

VPs would be provided facilitation inputs for buildingcapacity to develop a user report card, a Panchayat
Development Plan and a Village Development Plan. These services would be provided by a SO
designated for this purpose. Some o f the best performing and willing VPs would also be encouraged to
form SOs (on lines o f Hirwe Bazar) for being Margdarshak to other VPs (coaches and mentors). A
dedicated staff member in the DFT and ZP would provide the facilitation inputs. This stage would also
lead to development o f an operational manual for user report card for VPs and Panchayat Development
Planning And Village Development Plans. These manuals would be made available to ZPs, VPs and
MDDfor use for other development programs.

Inthe thirdphase, 225 VPs wouldbe supported over a four year periodfor implementingthe components
and initial set o f activities proposed under the Panchayat Development Plan. Menu o f activities which
would qualify for support would include capacity building activities for VP functionaries and other
CBOs in the village, development o f financial management systems, settingup computerized and internet
kiosks     for   service  delivery,   development   o f improved     service  delivery  systems   through
para-professionals, supporting ideas for revenue generation for VPs. VPs would contribute 15% o f the
total cost o f plans as their contribution.

In the final phase, documentation and learning forums would be undertaken as a part o f knowledge
management activities. A number of new VPs would be oriented to the approach followed by the 225
VPs and also provide a forum and mechanism for peer learning among VPs. At this stage, efforts would
be made to mainstream the approach within existing decentralization efforts in Maharashtra with MDD.

IncentiveFundfor Zilla Parishad(ZP)

Currently, both political and administrative functionaries at ZPs have become primarily implementing
agencies o f programs designed and funded by the state and the central Government. These programs are
then implemented at VP level and through line agencies by ZPs, in a supply driven manner with little
involvement o f VPs and village residents. Since the proposed project would primarily work through ZPs,
it is critical to make investments inZPs as an institution to enable them to become effective, accountable
and responsive local government and contribute to effective local governance.

The pilot incentive fund would be initiated in 9 ZPs over a three year period inthe project districts. The
lessons learnt would be shared and used to initiate dialogues with both RDD and ZPs to develop a
programmatic demand driven approaches indecentralization efforts initiatedby GOM.

The pilot project would make investments in developing a development marketplace for motivating ZPs
to showcase their efforts and propose ideas for improvement o f governance using criteria related with
inclusiveness,    participatory    decision making,    effectiveness,  responsiveness, transparency    and
accountability. Based on this competitive process, selected ZPs will be provided with intensive capacity
building support in various areas including participatory planning and budgeting, promotion o f
community organizations, community based procurement financial management and accountable service
delivery and e-governance initiatives. ZPs would also be enabled to develop a community and user report
card to get systematic feedback from VPs and users o f ZP services for key development programs. This
will enable ZPs to develop effective plans for institutional development o fZPs.

The project would financially support the institution development plans developed by ZPs over a period
o f two years. The project would also invest in cross ZP learning and knowledge management activities
to draw key lessons for other decentralization programs o f GOM. The key outcome o f the proposed pilot
would be a tested approach for institution building o f ZPs, which could be scaled up and adapted in all
districts o f Maharashtra. The project would also enable ZPs to innovate and develop their own


                                                   - 57 -

institutions in a more effective manner. It would also enable innovators within ZPs to experiment and
gain more recognition for public system improvements. This would also serve as an incentive for ZPs to
support VPs and VWSCs inan inclusive and accountable manner.

The ZP strengthening program will include: (i)Consultancies and assistance for institutional
restructuring and re-design; (ii)training/human resource development for planning, financial
management and budgeting, monitoring, IT and providing supporting services to VPs; (iii)      provision o f
infrastructure, particularly for IT and consultancy support for website development; and (iv) development
o f M I S Systems.

Key Activities and Sequencingfor ZP Incentive Fund

Inthe first phase, a development marketplace will be organized to enable various district ZPs to present
and show case various innovations and ideas related to improving local governance and performance as a
responsive and accountable service provider. Various innovations made by ZPs inresource mobilization,
participation, community procurement, financial management and e-governance would be presented in a
competitive market place. 9 ZPs will be selected through this process. The campaign would be taken up
over a three year period to enable building o f performance based incentives for ZPs. This methodology
will be shared with RRDfor a possible design o f state wide campaign

The second phase would involve supporting 3 ZPs every year for 3 years for capacity building support.
All ZPs would be provided support to develop ZP Report Card involving systematic feedback on
performance o f ZP by users and VPs for key development programs and services. ZPs who have shown
interest in collecting feedback through user report card would be also provided a fund o f about Rupees 1
million to contract various capacity building service providers for buildinginstitutional capacity o f ZPs.
ZPs would be enabled to develop a ZP Improvement Plan to improve ZP performance. These would be
presented in an open event for peer appraisal and support.

Inthe thirdphase, ZPs wouldbe supported through an innovation fundo fupto Rupees 5 million. Menu
o f activities needs to be developed through a participatory process. These would include a combination
o f process, institutional and system improvements including application o f participatory planning and
budgeting in development programs implemented by ZP, e-governance                 initiatives, introducing
community based procurement, development o f a transparent service delivery system, using
para-professionals for service delivery, improvement of financial management systems, reducing
response time in service delivery to VPs, developing innovative O&M arrangements for community
assets.

Inthe final phase, the documentation and learning forums would be organized as part of knowledge
management activities.      A learning workshop to disseminate results and efforts of ZPs would be
organized to enable key decision makers in GOM to interact with innovators among ZPs. It i s estimated
that the cost o f this package will be Rs. 35-40 lakhs per ZP, making for a total project cost o f
approximately Rs. 105 - 120 lakhs for the first 3 selected ZPs.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:

Types of Schemes
The economic analysis o f the project i s based on a representative sample o f 20 proposed schemes and a
survey o f 670 households in 5 districts. The sample schemes were selected across the five districts on
the basis o f sources o f water supply and the types o f technology, as follows : Cluster 1 (Groundwater) :
Hand-pumps; Cluster 2 (Groundwater) : Mini Water Supply; Cluster 3 (Groundwater) : Piped Water
Supply I(less than 2000 population); Cluster 4 (Groundwater) : Piped Water Supply I1(more than 2000
population); Cluster 5 (Surface water) : Piped Water Supply 111; Cluster 6 Tribal Cluster (Groundwater /
Surface Water).     A total o f about 3626 schemes are envisaged in the project. The project economic
analysis was carried out (a) separately for each o f the six clusters, and (b) for the project as a whole,
usingthe likely scheme mix andphasingproposedinthe project.

Project Benefits
The proposed project would be justified on the basis o f direct benefits to about 7.5 million rural
inhabitants, rising to about 10 million at the end of the project period (population i s assumed to grow at
1.8 % per annum). The typical project benefits envisaged are: time savings in collecting water, increased
availability o f safe water, health benefits from access to cleaner water, time savings from using
household latrines, improved sanitation knowledge and better sanitation practices, environmental benefits

and strengthened community, panchayat and state institutions. In addition, the demand driven project
would enable a more sustainable approach than has been possible through top-down public programs.
The benefits that have been quantified are:
  Value o f time saved inwater collection;
* Value o f incremental increase inwater supply;
  Value o f time saved indefecation by usinghousehold toilets;
*  Value o f health benefits from reduction in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea (quantified as water supply
benefits) and malaria (quantified as environmental sanitation benefits);
.Value of recurring and capital cost saved (costs incurred to maintain the existing supply of water in a
without project scenario);
.Incomemultipliers ofmicro credit disbursement.

li)ValueofTime Saved :Timehasbeenvaluedatthe opportunity cost oflabour usingtheminimum
wage rate for agricultural labour at Rs.47lday (Government Regulation 2002), and a real increase o f 2.94
percent per annum (India Development Report, 2000). Based on the household survey and discussions
with GOM officials, it is assumed that a person is gainfully employed for 250 days in a year, hence a
conversion factor o f 0.68 i.e. (2501365) has been applied in the calculations. It i s also assumed that a
person works for 8 hrs in a day. Further, the time saved i s valued at 52% o f the wages earned (ADB
Handbook for the Economic Analysis o f Water Supply Projects, 1999). A standard conversion factor o f
0.9 i s applied to arrive at the economic value o f time saved in border prices. A sensitivity analysis o f
value o f time saved has also been carried out, using the average market wage rate o f women at Rs 35
(household survey).

lii)Value ofIncrementalWater Consumed:The incrementalwater isthe increased water consumed
due to the increased availability and ease o f access as compared to the current water supply. The
incremental water consumption i s estimated as the difference between the designed supply (40 lpcd for
all schemes) and present water consumption, after the schemes are operational. The system i s designed
to serve 40 lpcd at the end o f 20 years, hence the incremental water availability will be more initially, and
declines gradually. In the absence o f a proper demand curve (willingness to pay approach), the
incremental water i s valued at the average o f current costs (equal to time and other costs incurred to
maintain present water supply) and future costs (capital costs amortized at 10 % plus O&M costs) o f
water supply (Asian Development Bank Handbook on the Economic Analysis o f Water Supply Projects,
1999).

(iii)Value of time savedinusinghouseholdlatrines/ sanitary complexesfor women:The project
envisages covering 10% households in the project area with individual household latrines costing Rs
2000 each. Basedon survey information, the average time currently spent by all members o f a household
inusingan open defecation place is 2.28 hrs per day. This time will be saved if individual household
latrines are provided. The time saved on defecation i s considered only for the adult population between
age 15-55 years (about 2.5 persons per households), for 10 % households under the project. Inaddition, it
i s assumed that 80% o f the women (excluding the 10% opting for household toilets and those who
already have householdtoilets) would avail o f the sanitary complex for women. It i s assumed that 50% o f
their current time spent on open defecation, will be saved. Time has been valued inthe same way as time
saved for water supply (at 52% o f wage rate o f Rs. 47, 8 hrs per day, 250 days o f gainful employment).

[iv) Value of healthbenefitsfrom reductionin diarrhoea and gastroenteritisdiseases
It is widely recognized that provision o f safe water supply coupled with sanitation facilities will give
considerable health benefits, especially in the reduction o f water borne diseases. These health benefits
are captured for reduction in diarrhoea and gastro-enteritis (reduction in malaria i s considered as a
benefit from environmental sanitation activities and i s estimated separately). The reduction in diarrhoeal
diseases i s taken as 20.8% and reduction in gastroenteritis as 39.0 % [Jha, Esrey, etc. and survey
information]. The three health benefits quantified are (a) reduction in expenditure on medication, (b)
reduction in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs); and (c) reduction in indirect man-days lost to the
carer, due to reduction in incidence o f disease. The reduction in incidence o f diarrhoea i s taken as 20.8%
due to water supply alone and 37.5% due to water supply and sanitation. The reduction in incidence o f
gastroenteritis i s taken as 39.0% due to improved water supply and sanitation.

The expenditure incurred on medication (includes medicines and consultation) is taken from actuals from
the survey (average o f `per incidence expenditure'). The benefit i s calculated as the reduced expenditure
on medication due to the reduced incidence in disease. Reduction inDALYs i s estimated for reduction in
diarrhoeal diseases (9.6% o f total DALYs is due to diarrhoeal diseases, World Development Report,
1993, World Development Report, 2001), and valued at the opportunity cost o f labour. The reduction in
indirect man-days lost for a carer, i s taken as 3 days per incidence for gastroenteritis and 1 day per
incidence for diarrhoea, valued at the opportunity cost o f labour.

[v) Value of HealthBenefitsdue to ReductioninMalaria
Health benefits due to improved Environmental Sanitation will reduce incidence o f malaria and have
been quantified as (a) reduction in expenditure on medication; (b) reduction in DALYs; and (c)
reduction in indirect man-days lost due to the reduction in incidence o f Malaria. The reduction in
incidence o f Malaria i s taken as 37.5% due to improved sanitation.

[vi) Value of capital and O&M Cost Saved : Capital and O&M costs being incurred on the present
schemes would be saved, as these costs would have been incurred if the present schemes were to
continue. The O&M cost saved i s taken as the actual O&M cost incurred on technical operation o f the
project ineach village (including administration costs). Similarly, ifthe existing system was to continue,
replacement o f existing schemes will have to be undertaken to cater to the requirements o f increased
population and failure o f schemes. The saving on this cost i s taken as the savings in capital costs. This
has been valued, usingthe least cost option o f hand pumps lasting for 8-10 years, hence the benefits are
considered in the 4th and 14th year. Takmg the cost o f one hand pump as Rs 35000 (PPMU cost), the
investment saved i s Rs 728 per household plus 34% hardware costs, towards design and implementation
charges by MJP. This i s a very conservative estimate of the capital costs saved.

[vii) Income multiplier of micro credit disbursement :About Rs. 40,000 per GP has been earmarked
as micro credit for women, for promoting entrepreneurial activities to increase income and empower
women. The first year o f the project will focus on capacity building and training. The micro credit
disbursement will start from the 2nd year, till the 6th year. It i s assumed that the benefit will start flowing
in after one year from the year o f disbursement, thus the inflow o f benefit is taken from the 3rd year to
the 7thyear. The income multiplier o fthe micro credit i s assumedto be 1.5.

Project Costs

All costs, estimated for the project are expressed in constant 2003 prices, net o f taxes. The average water
supply costs are Rs 3678lhh (range Rs 505-6562), average source sustainability costs are Rs 4401hh. The
average environmental sanitation (including drains, compost pits, school toilets, women's sanitary

complexes) costs are Rs 1320/hh; average latrine costs are Rs 200/hh (Rs 2000 per household latrine,
10% coverage); and software costs are Rs 3330/hh. The total investment cost works out to be 8968/hh.
Out o f this, the costs for individual house connection and household sanitation are over and above the
project costs. A wide variation in the cost i s expected across villages, depending on the hydrogeological
conditions, severity of the water quality problem, number of households in the village, extent o f
augmentation o f existing water supply schemes, etc. O&M costs depend on the type o f schemes and vary
from Rs.482-1727/hh/yr for water supply and source sustainability (Rs.l76/hh/yr for Cluster 1, i.e Hand
Pump Scheme). The above costs are extrapolated for the entire project, based on the following phasing o f
schemes: 3% of schemes expected inthe first year, 12% inthe second year, 32% inthe thirdyear, 36% in
the fourth year, and 17% in the fifth year. The software costs (including IEC, village development,
institutional development and sector strengthening) are extrapolated, based on projections for four years:
8% GPs covered in the first year, 31% in the second year, 41% in the third year and 20% in the fourth
year. The overall cost benefit analysis i s based on the phasing and mix o f schemes as given above.

Cost Benefit Analysis and ERR

Costs and benefits are expressed in border prices (using standard conversion factor, SCF of 0.9 to all
domestic expenditures and benefits) and have been projected over a 20 year period, from the first year o f
the project. Switching values have been calculated at 12% opportunity cost o f capital in India. The
economic rate o f return i s estimated to be 19.85% for the whole project (all costs and benefits). It i s
20.8 1% if only water supply and source sustainability costs and benefits are considered. ERR, B/C ratios
and switching values have been calculated for each type o f cluster and scheme (details in Economic
Analysis Report). The rates o f return in all cases understate the true ERR since there i s no quantification
o f benefits o f drains, compost pits, source sustainability measures, habitation improvements, community
development etc.

Main Assumptions:
Time has been valued at the opportunity cost o f labour using the minimum wage rate for agricultural
labour at Rs.47/day (Government Regulation 2002), and a real increase o f 2.94 percent per annum (India
Development Report, 2000). It i s assumed that a person i s gainfully employed for 250 days in a year,
hence a conversion factor o f 0.68 i.e. (2501365) has been applied inthe calculations. It is also assumed
that a person works for 8 hrs in a day. Further, the time saved i s valued at 52% o f the wages earned
(ADB Handbook for the Economic Analysis o f Water Supply Projects, 1999). A standard conversion
factor o f 0.9 i s applied to arrive at the economic value o f time saved in border prices. A sensitivity
analysis o f value o f time saved has also been carried out, usingthe average market wage rate o f women at
Rs 35 (household survey).

Sensitivity analysis / Switching values of critical items:
Sensitivity analysis, based on assessed risks, indicate the project i s able to absorb substantial negative
impacts, yet generate positive ERRS.For example, the project can sustain:
0 Significant increase in costs or decrease in benefits: an increase in costs by 20% or a decrease in
benefits by 20%, or a combined 17% increase incosts and 17 % reduction inbenefits.
0 Implementation delays would delay project benefits. If benefits are delayed by three years, the ERR
falls to 17.30 YO.
0 Reduction in time savings from water collection and household latrines. If time savings from water
collection and private toilets were reduced by 30%, the project ERRwill fall to 14.89%.
0 Increase in the number of house connections. The project ERR i s only moderately sensitive to this
variable. 60% households opting for house connections gives a positive ERR o f about 20.96%.
0 No health benefits. Even ifhealth benefits are not quantified, the project is still feasible with an ERR o f
18.77%.
0 Complete failure o f all schemes inyear 10 makes the project non feasible.
0 An alternate supply driven scenario is not feasible.

Additional Scenarios

Inaddition to the base case scenario and sensitivityanalysis, the following two additional scenarios have
been especially considered.

(i) towomenfolks(GenderBenefits)
    Benefits
The responsibility for water collection, which takes considerable effort, labour and time falls on women
folks. The project focuses on empowering women and assuring involvement o f women in all aspects o f
the project. The benefits accruing especially to women are captured in a separate scenario (it i s not
included inthe base case, to avoid double counting) :
0 time savings inwater collection;
0 time savings due to use o f household toilets /women complexes;
0 availability o f incremental water to females above 10 years o f age;
0 health benefits due to reduced diarrhoea, gastro-enteritis and malaria. [benefits due to reduced
expenditure on medicine i s captured for women above 10 years; reduction in DALYs for women i s
51.34% o f the total DALYs, for diarrhoeal disease and 49.95% o f the total DALYsfor malaria;
0 micro credit schemes (small loans and savings facilities) : Rs 40,000 per GP has been earmarked for
reduction o f poverty, and empowerment o f women. [the micro credit disbursement will be 20% each year
(3rd year to 7th year o f the project). Based on market information, the income multiplier o f this micro
credit i s assumed to be 1.51.



                                                     - 65 -

The ERR o f the gender scenario works out to be 13.24% as against the total ERR o f 19.85% (when all
benefits are considered), showing that a substantial amount o f benefits are actually accruing to women. In
addition to the above quantified benefits, many other benefits to women have not been quantified, such
as reducing workload and physical strain; empowering, sensitization and capacity building o f women,
etc.

(ii)AlternateSupplyDrivenScenario
The prime reason for the failure o f the traditional supply driven water supply schemes has been the lack
o f people's participation and proper institutional arrangements for managing the schemes. Also, there
has been a failure to manage cost recovery and provide timely O&M, in terms o f finances and materials
to sustain the project. The proposed project entails institutional strengthening and capacity building
which i s expected to result in significant impacts, especially inensuring the sustainability o f the schemes.
However, to compare the proposed project with the traditional supply driven projects, the following
alternate scenario i s considered :
0 The life expectancy o f the proposed project reduces to 10 years (as i s commonly observed intraditional
supply driven projects).
0 Additional costs o f construction incurred in traditional supply driven projects due to MJP charges,
increasing the project costs by approximately 24%.
0 Reduced software costs, normally not incurred in supply driven projects.
Inthe above supply driven scenario, the project is foundto be non-viable.

Thus, the proposedproject i s economically feasible and will provide richbenefits to the ruralpopulation.

                               Annex 6(A): Procurement Arrangements
       INDIA: Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation "Jalswarajya" Project

Procurement
A.       Procurement Implementation Capacity

Maharashtra has had a number o f IDA funded projects over the years both under IBRD loans and IDA
credits including the Maharashtra Rural Water Supply Project which was closed in June 1998. The state
thus has extensive experience o f IDA procurement and consultant guidelines. A Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR) was carried out in 2000. A procurement review for the state o f Maharashtra
has been carried out, and the report was completed in March 2003. The project would be implemented
through District Local Governments (ZPs), and the state level agency       -Jalswarajya office -would be
responsible for overall coordination and monitoring. In order to plan and implement several procurement
activities during the first two years o f the project, the Project Director would supplement the existing
capacity at the state level with a consultant to help the project team in preparation o f the procurement
plans, documents and guideitrain the District Teams who do not have prior experience with IDA
procurement, and monitoring of procurement arrangements at various levels.

Community Procurement.Most o f the procurement (works, goods and services) inthe project will be
done at the V P level. Under the project, eligible communities will undertake repairirehabilitation or
construction o f new drinking water schemes serving their villagelcommunity through their own efforts
based on a demand driven approach, hire support organizations and mobilize training for women's
groups, various functional and management committees and VPs. The Community Operational Manual
(inlocal language) gives detailedguidelines, procedures, rules andmethods o f community procurement.

B.       ProcurementRisks and SuggestedRemedies

Demand based approach and community contracting - assisted but not driven by central or local
government - i s a relatively new approach to project implementation. There i s a potential risk from a
large volume o f contracting at the community level. Therefore, capacity building activities need to be
initiated, through an Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaign in each district well
before communities organize themselves into VWSCs and plan/ prepare implementation o f their
schemes. There i s also need for simplifying procedures and processes o f various procurement and a
strong monitoring mechanism including social audits which considerably reduce the inherent risk. These
project would address these risksthrough the following mitigation measures:

     The draft procurement plan was finalized before negotiations and an updated procurement plan will
     be required for each new fiscal year before disbursement can be initiated.
     Procurement supervision will be conducted every six months and the procurement plan will be
     monitored o n an on-going basis.
     To enhance procurement capacity o f the village community, procurement training will be conducted
     as part o f the capacity buildingfor project management inall participating VPs.
     A Community Operational Manual (COM) has been developed duringpreparation. C O M contains a
     section on procurement which covers procurement procedures, procurement methods, and reporting
     requirements.These procurement rules and procedures would be disseminated early o n through a
     well devised IEC. The manual will be reviewed every six months and revisedrefinedinconsultation
     with IDA.
0     The project would develop a district-wise roster o f support organizations and service providers
     (consisting essentially o f NGOs, SOs or individuals with some social mobilization experience and



                                                    - 68 -

     technical know-how) who are interested in providing the advisory and technical support to the
     communities to help them make an informed choice.
0    The project will develop a strong and continuous monitoringmechanism, including social audit. The
     monitoring will be done at various levels -state level Operations Monitoring Team (OMT) and Hub
     Team, District Facilitation Team (DFT) and the village level monitoring. Inaddition, extemal
     consultants will be hired to carry out process and technical monitoring (including procurement and
     financial management) periodically.

C.        Schedule of Activities andProcurementPlans:

The project would cover 2800 VPs (including tribal padas) spread over 26 districts, roughly about 110
VPs in each district. GOM has already initiated implementation in 30 VPs inthree pilot districts during
project preparation to test the approach and various processes and procedures at the community level.
The first year plan will include nine districts, and remaining 17 will be included inYear 2.

D.        ProcurementArrangements

All project activities to be financed under the Credit would be procured in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement o f Goods, Works (January 1995, revised January and August 1996,
September 1997, January 1999) and Consultancy Guidelines (January 1997, revised in September 1997,
January 1999, and M a y 2002) for hiring consultant services (including NGO services). All civil works,
goods and services would be procured using India specific Bank's model documents as well as the
formats o f the community contracts specifically approved for the project.

Procurement at the village/community level will be guided by the Community Participation in
Procurement (CPP- Para. 3.15 of the Procurement Guidelines). VPs will directly enter into contracts
with private contractors, NGOs, consultants, government agencies, and will be guided by the principles
o f efficiency, equal opportunity and transparency o f the process. The VPs/communities will manage and
implement the water supply and sanitation activities, hire skilled contractors and purchase materials
locally to ensure minimal delays and reduce inefficiencies due to loss during transport and storage.
Standard price lists (Jal Swaraj Schedule o f Rates) will be developed, maintained and updated regularly
under the guidance o f the district team, and will used by the VP/communities as standards rates to guide
their procurement.

Specific procurement arrangements summarized inTable A are as follows:

 Village/Community Subproject Grants (US$ 185.8 million): The project components will finance
subprojects which are demand driven in nature, making it difficult to determine ex-ante what i s to be
procured.    Grant funds from the project can be used for services, goods, training, and works. The
VP/communities may obtain technical, management support and advice from the Water Supply
Department at the district or decide to hire local consultant/NGOs for these services. The
village/community subprojects would include: water rejuvenatiodsource strengthening measures,
rehabilitation and construction o f water supply schemes, community and environmental sanitation
infrastructure, aquifer pilot, hiring of services for training and capacity building o f VPs and various
village committees, women empowerment activities, and local govemments. The village subprojects
would also include hiring of support organizations to help the VPs and communities prepare and
implement the Village Action Plans. The average value o f each subproject would be about US$lO,OOO
and maximum would not exceed US$50,000.




                                                     - 69 -

It is expected that o f approximately 2800 works [drinking water as well as sanitatioddrainagelsource
strengthening] there will be some multi-village or large single village schemes where the works
component (excluding pumps and motors) i s estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$ 50,000 or more.
These works shall be implemented through local contractors usingNCB procedures and the Bank's India
specific model documents for the procurement o f small works.

A bulk (estimated at 2500) o fproject works procurement would comprise contracts estimated to cost less
than the equivalent o f US$ 50,000. If the community elects not to carry out the work itself, then these
works may be procured through local shopping procedures i.e. on the basis o f comparison o f price
quotations obtained from at least three prequalified contractors that are eligible as per the Guidelines, or
from registered and experienced NGOs and self-help groups.

The first two contracts for goods and works under sub-projects, regardless o f district and value, and all
contracts with estimated value o f US$ 250,000 or above shall be subject to IDA'Sprior review. The
RSPMU will review the first two contracts for goods and works under subprojects in each district
regardless o f value. The agreed procedures for community procurement are as follows:

             Works: Most works undertaken in this project will use community participation to mobilize
            and pay labor. A small number o f works may need to be procured through small works. The
            following methods will be used: (a) direct contracting with registered NGOs or local
            community organizations such as "Mahilla Mandals" or "Yuvak Mandals"; (b) lump-sum
            fixed price contracts with qualified contractors awarded on the basis o f quotations obtained
            from at least 3 qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation; and (c)
            community carrying out the works themselves and taking up technicallmanagerial assistance
            from district teams or support organizations or hiring services o f individual experts.

            Goods: The goods estimated to cost less than US$500per contract upto an aggregate amount
            not to exceed US$lO,OOO may be procured through Direct Contracting procedures. Goods
            estimated to cost less than US$30,000 per contract would be procured through shopping
            procedures on the basis o f at least 3 quotations.

        0   Services: The services estimated to cost less than equivalent o f US$lO,OOO may be hired by
            inviting proposals from three or more service providers or technical consultants or based on
            consultant's qualification. Any service contracts costing more than US$lO,OOO but less than
            US$50,000 shouldbe invitedthrough newspaper advertizement.

Small Works (Estimatedtotal cost $2.5 million): Small works estimated to cost less than $50,000 per
contract up to an aggregate value o f U S $ 2.5 million will be procured under lump sum , fixed price
contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations obtained from three (3) qualified domestic contractors in
response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description o f the works, and the
award should be made to the lowest bidder.

Goods (Estimated total cost $9.0 million): Goods would be procured following Bank Procurement
Guidelines (January 1995, revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999). The
following procurement methods would be followed

NationalCompetitive Bidding(NCB): Contracts estimated to cost more than US$50,000, but less than
the equivalent o f US$ 200,000 per contract upto an aggregate value o f S$3.5 million would be procured

              Annex 6(B): Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
          INDIA: Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation "Jalswarajya" Project

FinancialManagement
1. Summaryofthe FinancialManagementAssessment

Countrv Issues: The following country issues will apply:

(a)       The issue of availability o f funds on a timely basis to applies to the project to the extent that this
i s a state sector project and that state sector projects are generally more vulnerable to this problem. GOM
has demonstrated a high level o f commitment to the project and has assured IDA that counterpart funding
for the project will be accorded the highest priority.

(b)       Quality and timeliness o f audit reports and responselfollow-up o f audit findings has been noted
in many states/administrations. To mitigate this risk, GOM has sought to include the CAG in the
preparation process and separate TORSfor the project audit are being agreed. The TORSwill cover the
requirement o f CAG's certification and report on the financial statements o f the project and will not be
limitedto SOEs.

(c)       Formats o f Project Financial Statements have been agreed with GOM and it i s expected that the
accounting system will be capable o f producing these statements.

(d)       At the country level, delays in submittingwithdrawal applications has been an area o f concem.
However, the Financial management system that has been designed for the project would allow GOM to
submit monthly reimbursement claims on a timely basis. The first Maharashtra RWSS project financed
by IDA closed in 1997, and there are no specific references to delayedclaims inthe ICR.

Strenvths andWeaknesses
Strengths:The project has the following strengthsinthe area o f financial management:

(i)       A project financial management manual for the project has been prepared. The project will
          prepare financial management reports from the start.

(ii)      A highly committed Team is inplace at the state level and key finance staff have been associated
          with the development o fthe financial management system for the project.

(iii)     Adequate institutional arrangements have been put in place at the village level to ensure that
funds are used for intendedpurposes;

(iv)      GOM has demonstrated a highlevel o f commitment to the project and duringdiscussions on the
fund flow processes assured the Bank that the releases of funds during the life o f the project will be
accorded the highest priority.

The accounting system inplace primarily focuses          Financial management manual has been
on book keeping and not on financial management          developed for the project which focuses

The capacity o f GPs for book-keeping and                One o f the critical functions o f the project
accounting and financial management i s very             will be to enhance capacity o fthe
limited. They will need support inmaintaining the        community inbookkeeping and
books o f account.                                       accounting. Training on accounting and
                                                         book keeping will be providedto the

FundsFlow

The envisaged fund flow for the Project i s as follows:.

State Level: GOM will transfer the funds based on the annual work plans to the P L account maintained
by the OMT in installments. Specific commitment is being sought from GOM to release the funding
requirements for the two quarters at the start o f each year. From the P L account funds required for state
level Project expenditure will be met. The funds for the district level operations will be transferred to the
ZP from the PL account.

Zilla Parishad Level: A separate bank account in a scheduled bank will be maintained at the ZP level,
which will be operated by the District Team in ZP under single or joint signatures, depending upon the
amount o f transaction. The officers may be Chief Executive Officer, Additional Chief Executive Officer,
Senior Accounts Officers o f the District Financial Management Team or other officers in WSSD in ZP as
approved by OMT. The expenses for the district level operations and expenses o f the DFT, DAMT,
DFMT and the Administration Unit will be met from this account. As per the approved village level
action plan and agreed milestones therein, funds will be transferred from this account to the Gram
Panchayat. T o ensure that the releases to the VPs are timely, benchmarks have been established and these
will be monitored to identify exceptions through the financial and other M I S reports. Compliance with
the benchmarks will be considered as an important indicator for ZPs eligibility to the `Incentive Fund'.

Village Panchayat Level: A dedicated account will be opened at the V P level, to receive funds from the
ZP and also to credit capital contribution by the community. This account will be operated on behalf o f
VP by VWSC members under the joint signature o f at least two officer bearers of Village WSSC,
nominated for the purpose by the Gram Sabha. At least one signatory shall be a woman.

Financial Management Framework

At the state and district levels, the project will maintain accounts using the present Government
accounting system, with additional accounting and reporting processes to classify project expenditures as
required by project components/activities and disbursement categories and prepare monthly/quarterly
/annual reports required for project management. The accounting and reporting system will be manual in
the beginning and will move into a computerized environment during the life o f the project.

State Level: The Operations and Monitoring Team (OMT) will continue to operate the present book
keeping arrangements as per the Government accounting mechanism. However, the accounts will be
classified and summarized by additional accounting heads to track Project component wise expenses,
disbursement categories and procurement categories. The OMT will be responsible for compiling the
financial reports and claims for fund release to the state, Government o f Maharashtra as well as to the
Bank. The Reform Support Team (RST) will provide overall policy level support in developing financial
management policies and bringin lessons learnt.

Zilla Parishad Level: A dedicated District Financial Management Team (DFMT) set up at district level,
under the Chief Executive Officer/Additional Chief Executive Officer, ZP as the District Project Director
and District Project Coordinator will manage the project funds and will be responsible for all
expenditures at the District level. This will include meeting the expenditures o f the District Facilitation
Teams (DFT) and District Monitoring & Appraisal Teams (DMAT). The DFMT will also ensure timely
releases o f the installments to the VPs against agreed milestones in sub project contracts on advice by the
DMAT. The DFMT will submit monthly reports o f funds to the State level OMT, providing details of
fund flow, bank reconciliation, expenditures by Project activities, expenditure by disbursement categories
and procurement methods, details of approved village level actions plans, releases made and beneficiary
contributions accounted for.

The dedicated team for facilitating, coordinating and guiding community development and technical
activities i s called the District Facilitation Team (DFT). An accountant with adequate skills and
experience in community accounting and capacity buildingwill be an integral part o f the DFT and will
be responsible for VP level facilitation and training functions.

The District Appraisal & Monitoring Team (DAMT) sufficiently fire walled from the facilitating team
will function as the "guardian of rules" to ensure that the Project addresses clearly the community
priorities, follow the principles and guidelines for Project implementation and the technical and financial
viability o f the proposed schemes. The Executive Engineer, Water Management and Sanitation
Department will be the Team Leader o f the District Appraisal & Monitoring Team (DAMT) and will be
responsible for appraising and approving or recommending administrative, financial, technical and
process sanction o f the Village Action Plan to the Project Coordinator, Project Director or D W M S C
depending upon the estimated cost and delegated powers o f sanction, checking the quality o f works
undertaken to ensure that the materials procured and works executed conforms to quality standards and in
accordance with what has been planned by the community, monitoring the progress o f Village Action
Plan implementation and recommend to DFMT, release of installments to the VPs based on achievement
o f milestones o f activities as planned by the V P in the Village Action Plan and conduct performance
audit of Village Action Plan implementation covering technical, social, environmental aspects by
engaging an external agency.

Village Level: Gram Sabha is the general body consisting o f all persons registered in the electoral roles
within the area o f a VP, and i s the constitutional body for participatory decision-making at the lower
most level o f PRIs. The Gram Sabha will be responsible for: (a) approving participation in the Project
and approving any contracts/MoU to be signed between VP and ZP; (b) appointment o f the Village
Water & Sanitation Committee (VWSC)/Beneficiary Level Sub Committees (BLSC); (c) approving the

statements o f accounts and other reports, budget and annual accounts etc. on Project implementation
presented by the VP; and (h) recommend agencies for performance audit, financial audit and technical
audit on the working o f VWSC and Project implementation.

Village Panchayat - a body corporate incorporated as the Local Self Government under the Constitution
o f India and the Bombay Village Panchayat Act 1958, i s the focal point in the implementation o f the
project. All water supply and sanitation assets and facilities other than those created on private lands are
owned by the VP. The VP will be responsible for overall coordination o f project activities and
specifically: (a) facilitate and monitor the VWSC activities; (b) request and receive all funds under the
project and maintain separate books o f accounts with the assistance from VWSC; (c) approve the
appointment o f Procurement Sub-committee, Finance Sub-committee and such other sub-committees
suggested by VWSC; (d) recommend to the Gram Sabha for its approval, the Village Action Plan for
water supply and sanitation prepared by VWSC; (e) coordinate with the DAMT for obtaining the
required sanctions for the Village Action Plan; (f) finalize and incorporate the accounts o f VWSC with

agreements/MoU with ZP for implementing the Project and contract SOs, consultants and other service
providers required for availing various technical assistance services from among the panel prepared by
the ZP and with the approval of Gram Sabhaand monitor their activities.

VWSC i s the executive arm o f the VP entrusted with the responsibility o f carrying out the decisions o f
the Gram Sabha on matters relating to project implementation as well as the general aspects related to
Water Supply and Sanitation Sector in the village under the overall supervision o f the VP. VWSC will
maintain and operate the bank account on behalf o f the VP through persons authorized by Grama Sabha
from amongst the VWSC members and prepare financial statements, maintain books o f accounts and
other records on behalf o f the VP and submit them to Grama Sabha for approval. The VWSC will operate
through various Sub-committees on Finance, Procurement etc. and execute contracts and procure
materials and services on behalf o f the VP as approved by the Gram Sabha.
The Social Audit Committee (SAC) i s a self-check and internal monitoring mechanism for the Gram
Sabha and the VP on the activities o f the VWSC and other sub-committees. It will carry out its
monitoring and audit activities continuously along Project implementation and the objective i s not fault
finding but correcting mistakes before it i s too late. The social audit i s not restricted to financial aspects
but covers all aspects of project implementation including social, economic, financial, technical,
process-related etc. The specific roles are to (a) continuously review the functioning o f the VWSC and
i t s various sub-committees in order to ensure that they carry out their roles and responsibilities in a just
and fair manner and not violating the principles o f the project like, inclusion, equity, cost-effectiveness,
transparency, environmental soundness etc.; (b) conduct detailed scrutiny o f such actions or decisions

and report the findings along with recommended remedial measures to the Gram Sabha; (c) request for
convening special Gram Sabhas to discuss findings o f social audit, which are o f very serious nature. The
report o f the SAC, as approved by Gram Sabha will be forwarded by the V P to the DWMSC. Such
reports will be made available to any member o f the Gram Sabha upon request and payment o f a fee. The
important findings inthe report will be prominently displayed inthe notice board o f the VP at least seven
days in advance o f the Gram Sabha; and (d) chair the Gram Sabhas discussing social audit report, if the
Sarpanch i s a member inVWSC or any o f its sub-committees.

Staffinp & Training:
State Level: The Reform Support Team will have senior level Financial Adviser, on deputation from the
Accounts cadre o f GOM, assisting the Team to develop overall state level policies on financial
management, accounting, auditing and beneficiary contributions etc.

The Operations and Monitoring Team will include Finance and Accounting staff - Senior Accounts
officer (l), Accounts Officers (2), Assistant Accounts Officers (6), all staff on deputation from the
Accounts cadre o f GOM. Each o f the Assistant Accounts Officers will be placed with the Regional
Facilitation Hubs (RFH) to perform extensive monitoring activities, provide quick response and feed
back to the districts and also conduct key process and progress checks at the district level. It would be the
responsibility o f the finance and accounts staff o f the OMT to ensure that the financial management
system i s implemented as per the design agreed with the Bank.

District Financial Management Team (DFMT):A small team consisting o f a finance officer assisted by
accounts clerks and two administrative clerks will take care o f the financial support activities to the
district level arrangement. The DFMT will also be responsible for arranging and coordinating the
financial audit o f Project account o f VPs.

An accountant with adequate skills and experience in community accounting and capacity building will
be an integral part o fthe DFT and will be responsible for V P levelfacilitation and training functions.

VillageLevel: At the village level, the finance, accounts and social audit functions will be with different
institutions/committees as described earlier in the section on institutional arrangements. At the V P level
the VWSC can hire the services o f an accountant or entrust the responsibility a member o f VWSC duly
trained under the project for book keeping and maintaining accounts. If necessary skills are not available
at the village level, a suitable person can be identified and trained as a para-professional. As an alternate
option, a cadre o f self-employed accountants will be developed and encouraged to set up accounting
practices at the village level, whose services can be availed by the VWSC.

Training:
Since the project financial and accounting staff at the state and district level would be newly recruited,
and have not been involved in the design of the project and the design o f the financial management
system, they need to be trained inthe requirements of accounting and reporting under the project. These
trainings will be arranged in-house by the HRD Department inconsultation with the Finance Adviser and
will draw on internal and external expertise for the purpose. The accounting staff will also need to be
trained to operate the computerized financial management system, once it i s ready.

SOs will play a key role in facilitating the village level institutions inbook keeping, accounting, reporting
functions and will need to understand the requirementdformats o f village level accounting. Training
programs, manuals etc. will be arranged to provide the SO staff with the requisite skills to impart the
knowledge.


                                                     -81 -

Capacity building o f the institutions/committees at the village to manage the funds, maintain books o f
accounts, report periodically on the financial progress to all the stakeholders will be one o f the most
critical aspects o f the project. SOs will be responsible for providing training to the different village level
institutions to prepare them to meet their fiduciary responsibilities.

The project will promote, as a conscious strategy o f internalizing capacities at the village level,
identification and development o f potential Para-professionals in book keeping and accounting.
Para-professionals will be identified during the initial batches and developed by involving them in
Project processes and capacity building activities. They will join themselves as SO, will be available as
resources persons for SOs or will be available as individual resource persons to VPs. Thus they may take
various roles as facilitators, motivators, trainers, resources persons or service providers to villages during
the scaled up phase.

Accounting Policiesand Procedures
The Financial Management Manual has been prepared and documents in detail the accounting and
financial management processes and procedures. Books o f accounts for the project would be maintained
usingdouble-entry bookkeeping principles. Standard books o f accounts (cash and bank books, joumals,
ledgers, etc.) would be maintained at the state & district levels. The books o f accounts will be maintained
on a manual basis untilthe integrated computerized accounting system i s developed.

A Chart o f Accounts has been developed to enable data to be captured and classified by expenditure
center, budget heads, procurement methods, project components/activities, and disbursement categories.
This matches closely with the classification o f expenditures and sources o f funds indicated inthe project
documents (Project Implementation Plan and Project Cost Tables). The key issues that have been
addressed inthe design o f the accounting policies & procedures are:

9    Accounting entries for recording the beneficiary contributions inkindwill be made on the basis o f
     certification o f achievement o f the specific milestones as laid down inthe Sub-project agreements
     (specifying the contributions inkindlinked to each milestone).
     Releases of installments against the sub-project agreements will be recorded as expenditures inthe
     books o f accounts o f WSSD.
     All other releases o f funds to accounting centers (District Teams etc.) will be accounted for as
     advances inthe books o f accounts o f and adjusted to expenditures only on submission o f

.    expenditures.
     At all accountingcenters, separate books o f accounts will be maintained for the project funds as per
     the requirements specified inthe Financial Management Manual.

VWSC/VP will maintain accounts recorddregisters as follows: (i)Cashhank Book; (ii)               contributions
received in casWlabor/materials; (iii)   materials purchased and utilized. In addition, the VWSC/VPs will
retain all vouchers, bills, supporting documents and ensure that the Bank pass books are regularly
updated. Similar accounts will be maintained for the Operation & Maintenance Bank account and reports
submitted to its members and Gram Sabha.

2. Audit Arrangements
The Comptroller and Auditor General o f India (CAG) through its offices in Maharashtra will be the
statutory auditor for the project. The AG's office will conduct annual audit o f the operations o f the OMT
at the state level, Water Management and Sanitation Department at the ZP level and will also cover the
Village Panchayats on sample basis (10% for all VPs receiving total project funds below Rs. 10 lakhs,


                                                      - 82 -

  25% for all VPs receiving total project funds above Rs. 10 lakhs and below Rs. 25 lakhs, 50% for all VPs
 receiving total project funds above Rs 25 lakhs and below Rs. 50 lakhs and all VPs receiving total project
  funds above Rs. 50 lakhs). The audit report would consist o f (a) financial statements and (b) and audit
  opinion confirming whether the project financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
  consistently applied Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view o f the operations o f the project
  during the year and that the withdrawals from the IDA Credit made on the basis o f Statements o f
 Expenditure (SOEs) / Financial Management Reports (FMRs) together with the procedures and internal
  controls involved in their preparation, can be relied on to support the related withdrawals. Additionally,
 the auditor will be required to provide a management letter to project management highlightingfindings
  duringthe audit.

  The audit report with the management letter will be submitted to IDA within six months o f the close o f
 each financial year. The TORSo f the audit has been prepared in agreement with IDA and will be agreed
 with the CAG. The form o f annual financial statements to be certified will also be agreed with the CAG.

 Thus the following audit reports will be monitored inthe Audit Reports Compliance System(ARCS):

 VPs as constituents o f local rural governments, are audited by the State Government under the Bombay
 Local Fund Audit Act, 1930. As a demonstration o f good practice, each o f the VPs implementing the
 project will be required to submit audited statements o f expenditures and audit reports for the project
  within 6 months o f the close o fthe financial year. The VPs will also have the option o f engaging firms o f
  chartered accountants from the panel prepared by the ZP. The ZP will maintain a panel o f chartered
  accountancy firms at the district level based on the general list approved by the Accountant General and
  agree on the rates o f fees to be charged. Terms o f reference have been developed for the audit at the GP
  level and i s documented inthe Financial Management Manual. The project will retain 2% o f the total sub
 project costs untilthe completion o f the sub project and submission o f the audit reports. Follow-up o f the
  audit observations will be monitored by the District Financial Management Teams and such reports will
 be made available to the Bank supervision Teams, as required.

  ReportingandMonitoring

  The monthly reporting formats from each o f the accounting centers have been designed to provide
  summarized monthly financial information on the fund flows, balances in cashhank, status o f advances
  and expenditures classified by project components/activities, disbursement categories, procurement
 methods etc. These reports will be compiled by the OMT at the state level on monthly and quarterly basis
 to provide meaningful FMRs. An important aspect o f the reports would be that the expenditures reported
 under the project would need to be regularly reconciled with the reports submitted to the Accountant
  General's Office and would need to explain differences, if any. These reports will be prepared from the
  start o f the project, submitted to IDA within 45 days o f the close o f the quarter and used by the project at
 the state and district level and IDA for monitoring and management decision making.

 The annual audited project financial statements, to be provided by GOM to IDA would comprise: (a) a
 consolidated Project Sources and Application o f Funds for the whole project; (b) classification o f
  expenditures by project activities/components and disbursement categories; (c) consolidated statement o f


                                                      - 83 -

withdrawals (for the whole project) from the IDA Credit made on the basis o f Statements o f
Expenditures (SOEs) and documented claims; and (d) reconciliation o f reported expenditures with the
total withdrawal claims submitted duringthe year.

The financial arrangements between the ZP and V P (as are envisaged) will not require financial
accounting for the sub project expenditures inthe project books. All payments against the contracts will
be recorded as expenditures inproject books. However, the VPs will be required to submit regular SOEs
summarizing sources and uses o f funds against the plans inorder to build accountability and demonstrate
the presence o f adequate accounting and bookkeeping arrangements.

VPs will prepare a simple report summarizing (i)   the sources and uses o f funds, indicating the balances in
cashhank; (ii)activities completed, cost and activities to be completed in the next month); (iii)
contributions in labor and materials. The report will be presented to its members and in the Gram Sabha
and provide all records for scrutiny by members. The submission o f the financial report will be required
as a precondition for release o f subsequent installments against the individual sub-project agreements.
The financial management arrangements set up would emphasize on providing local level transparency,
social audit and self-accountability. These measures would include a simple summary o f the accounts
(amounts received from the members and the project, amount spent and balances inhand) to be publicly
posted in the notice board in the Gram Sabha. In addition, the books/registers, vouchers and bank pass
books would be open for perusal by members.

Computerized FinancialManagement System

The computerization o f the financial management system has not been envisaged from the start o f the
project but will be initiated before the end o f Year 2 o f the project. The key issues considered while
developing the design o f the software would be:

0    Integration with the M I S system-qualitative information on the sub project proposals/contracts
     tracked inthe M I S system are linked by common code numbers inthe FMS system. Financial
     information relating to the sub-project contracts are tracked by the same code numbers.
0    The systemwould allow accounting o fmultiple projects and overall consolidation at the entity level.
0    The systemwould be used for generating financial reports required to be submitted to the Accountant
     General as well as required for project management.

Impact of Procurement Arrangements

The nature and type o f the contractual arrangements with the VPs lay the basis o f accounting for the
project. As has been envisaged, the WSSD through the ZP will enter into contractual arrangements with
the VPs for implementation o f the water supply schemes. These agreements will be based on lump sum
contracts with payments based on performance milestones agreed and documented in the contracts. The
achievement o f the performance milestones will be certified. Thus, the project will only need to account
for the release o f performance-based installments.

Action Plan

The key actions required to ensure adequate financial management arrangements are inplace are as
follows:

  3. Disbursement Arrangements
  Disbursements from IDA Credit would initially be made the transaction-based system (traditional
  disbursement procedures, such as reimbursement, direct payment, etc) and may be converted to the report
 based system at the option o f the GOM and GO1after the successful demonstration o f regular, timely and
  adequate Financial Monitoring Reports.

  A Special Account would be maintained in the Reserve Bank o f India; and would be operated by the
  Department o f Economic Affairs (DEA) o f GOI. The authorized allocation o f the Special Account
  would be US$18.0 million which represents the average o f six months o f eligible expenditures to be paid
  from the special account.

  OMT, WSSD, GOM will compile the financial informationfrom all its management constituent agencies
  and prepare reimbursement claims on a monthly basis. The OMT will also be responsible for submission
  of the withdrawal applications to CAA&A in DEA for onward submission to IDA for replenishment o f
  the special account or reimbursement.

  Disbursements will be made on the basis o f statement o f expenditure for (a) civil works for contracts not
  exceeding US $250,000; (b) goods under contracts not exceeding US$200,000; (c) consultants for
  contracts not exceeding US$200,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals; (d) incremental operating
  and maintenance costs; (e) training, workshops and exposure visits; and (9 sub-project grants under Parts
  A and D.1.and D.2.

  Retroactive Financing: Eligible expenditures incurred by GOM prior to Credit signing, but after March
  1, 2003, will be financed under retroactive financing with a limit o f SDR 1.8 million (equivalent o f
  US$2.5 million) and subject to GOM following IDA'Sprocurement procedures.
