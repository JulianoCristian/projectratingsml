ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.0 Preamble
Maharashtra is located in the Western India and has a total population of about 96.7 mn as
per the 2001 census data. Out of this 55.7mn (58%) people,reside in rural areas and 41 mn
(42%) reside in urban areas. The State is sub-divided into 35 districts and 353 talukas.
Two of the districts are urban districts and the remaining 33 are rural districts. The rural
population resides in 40,785 villages and 45,528 habitations.
Despite implementing various programmes at a cost of Rs 166, 000 mn (USD 3,320 mn)
till date for providing potable water supply to the rural communities, more than 26% of the
habitations do not have assured supply of adequate potable water. Besides many more
habitations face scarcity during summer months and depend of tanker supplies. The main
reasons for this situation are:
* Non-involvement of communities in planning and management
* No focus on capacity building of communities to own and manage infrastructure
*  Use of standard engineering designs and lack of technology options for varying
needs
* No focus on source protection and augmentation
*  Focus on physical infrastructure building rather than delivering water in a
sustainable manner
Based on these lessons learnt, the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) has adopted a
'reform policy' across the state in the rural water and sanitation sector in the year 2000 and
is the only State in India to do so. The reform policy is based on the pnnciples advised by
the Government of India's (GOI) Sector Reform Programme. The key principles of the
GOM's reform policy are (i)community ownership and management of water supply
facilities (ii) strengthening of decentralized service delivery and management through the
Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) and (iii) long term sustainability of the services through
appropriate technical and management options that involve,local communities. This policy
earmarks a radical departure from the past policies and programmes that were centralized
and supply led and did not involve communities in any manner.
2.0 Project Setting:
2.1 Rationale for the project
Out of the 33 rural districts four are supported by Government of India's (GOI) Sector
Reforms Programme (SRP) and three are supported by KfW for water supply only. The
GOI is supporting the GOM for implementation of Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in all
the districts. However, these programmes are for a limited period (3-4 years) and do not
cover the water and sanitation issues in an integrated manner. Secondly, these programmes
do not incorporate provisions for state wide sector strengthening and experiment with
other related initiatives (like over all PRI capacity building etc). Thus, GOM lacks
adequate resources to implement water supply programmes in remaining 26 rural districts,
strengthen the intuitional capacity across the state and pilot innovative approaches like
integrated water resource management by communities. Therefore, GOM approached the
World Bank to support the statewide implementation of the reform policy in a holistic
manner.



2.2 Project Objectives and Scope
The objectives of the project are:
(i)   Increase rural community's access to improved and sustained drinking water
and sanitation services, and
(ii)  Decentralise RWSS service delivery to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).
The project is designed to cover about 3730 GPs (out of 20,753 GPs in these 26 districts),
selected on a composite set of criteria based on poverty level, water scarcity and
preparedness of the GPs in 26 districts over a 6-year period. Selection of water supply
source would be demand driven guided by water quantity, quality as well as capital and
O&M costs. However, considering the cost effectiveness and easy accessibility, the
project envisages more demand for groundwater source than distant surface water source
except where adequate and acceptable quality water is not available. A total investment of
approximately Rs.15,000 mn (USD 300 mn) is estimated of which 10% of the hardware
cost of approximately Rs. 1200 mn(USD 240 mn) would be contributed by the
beneficiaries. In addition, 100 % O&M cost would be contributed by the beneficiaries.
Activities taken up under the pilot project from May 2002 onward till signing of the
Project would be eligible for retroactive finance. As agreed with the World Bank mission,
the proposed project is proposed to be one in a series of dovetailed RWSS projects.
2.3 Project Components
The following are the key project components.
2.3.1. Community Development and Infrastructure: This component has the following
sub-components.
2. 3.1.1 Community Development: The capacity of the community would be built for
undertaking participatory planning, project execution and taking care of the O&M of the
services Support Oragnisations and District Facilitation team would provide necessary
capacity building to members of GP, VWSC and other para-professionals in the village.
2.3.1.2 Women Empowerment Fund: This aims at skill development of poor women as
identified in the gender strategy and providing access to credit, through an empowerment
fund, to improve their livelihoods.
2.3.1.3 Community Water Supply Infrastructure: The project aims to finance
improved drinking water supply facilities in about 3730 GPs. The community would
share 10% of the capital cost and 100% of the O&M cost, based on the option chosen by
them.
2.3.1.4 Personal Hygiene, Household and Environmental Sanitation: The project
would support the GOM's new strategy aimed at encouraging the communities to
eliminate the practice of open defecation and adopt safe sanitation and hygiene practices.
Besides, school sanitation, lane improvements, drains, soak pits, garbage and compost pits,
and IEC for hygiene behaviour would be promoted.
2.3.2 Institutional Strengthening: The following are the sub-components.
2.3..2.1 PRI and State Agencies Capacity Building: In order to experiment with the
concept of empowering the PRls to address development needs beyond WSS, pilots
would be undertaken to build the overall management capacity of about 150 GPs and
three ZPs which will demonstrate outstanding performance in the implementation of the
water supply and sanitation component of the project.
2.3.2.2 IEC: The Development Communication strategy would focus on institutional as
well as behaviour change relating to sanitation and hygiene, practices.
2



2.3.2.3 Monitoring and learning: The M&L system would enable the management team
to regularly monitor the progress of the project, capture the key lessons and disseminate
the learning to all the stake holders
2.3.3 RWS Sector Strengthening: This component would support GOM to strengthen its
capacity for implementing sector reforms across the state and improve the overall
management of the sector. The sub-components are: knowledge management system,
piloting of integrated ground water aquifer management in six identified watersheds and
water quality monitoring.
2.4 Project period and phasing: The project is designed to be implemented over a period
of 6 years during 2003-2009. All physical activities would be implemented during the first
five years and the last year would focus on sustainability issues. The project intends to
cover 450 GPs in three districts during the first year, 900 GPs in 6 districts in 2ndyear, 900
GPs in 6 districts in the third year, 900 GPs in 6 districts in fourth year and 580 GPs in 5
districts during the 5th year of the project thus totalling 3730 GPs .
3.0. Baseline Environmental Status
3.1. Water Quantity issues
3.1.lGroundwater Potential and Extraction: The Groundwater Survey and
Development Agency (GSDA), a nodal agency for groundwater planning and
development in the State, has classified the State into 1505 watersheds and 2415 sub units
based on irrigated and non-irrigated areas and estimated the groundwater potential.
Based on the stage of ground water development and pre and post monsoon water level
trends, out of 1766 watershed subunits in the project area 1428 (81%) subunits are safe.
Out of the remaining, 69 (4%) sub units are over exploited, 40 (2%) sub units are critical,
170 (10%) sub units are semi-critical and in 59 (3%)sub units (3%) quality of groundwater
is saline and unsuitable for drinking and irrigation .
The current availability of total water resources in the state is estimated as 154137
MCM/year (70% surface water and 30% ground water). The total utilisation by all the
sectors in the state is estimated as 39484 MCM/year, being 26% of the total water
resources available. Out of this rural drinking water consumes only 1062 MCMIyear. It is
estimated that by year 2030 the total water demand would go up to 103704 MCMIyear,
being 67% of the available resources. However out of this, the demand for rural drinking
water is estimated at 1943 MCM/year2.
Secondly, the total groundwater availability in the state is 46454 MCM/year out of which
availability in the project area is estimated at 28751 MCM/year. The total current annual
extraction of groundwater in the project area is estimated at 7768.91 MCM/year,being
27% of the utilizable recharge. Out of this 7095.87 (91%) MCMIyear is for irrigation and
only 673.04 MCM/year (9%) is for drinking purpose3. The demand for drinking water in
the project areas in the year 2030 is projected to be 1373 MCM/year (as against 673
MCM/year in 2002).
' Provisional revised groundwater assessment by GSDA and CGWB, 2002.
2 Analysis carried out by GSDA using the data from the Second Maharashtra Water and Irrigation Commission,
1999 and the Provisional revised groundwater assessment by GSDA and CGWB, 2002
3 Provisional revised groundwater assessment by GSDA and CGWB, 2002

However, the GSDA's trend analysis in the project area indicates that water tables are
declining in over 68 talukas located in 19 districts over the last ten years4. If the current
trend of over-extraction of groundwater, especially for irrigation purposes, continues
without any control there could be a possibility that out of the total demand of 1373
MCM/year in 2030 only about 1263 MCM water per year could be available for drinking
purposes in these districts5. The GOM would educate the community about better
irrigation practices, balanced use of groundwater resources for competing demands and
also conservation of groundwater through IEC. While the irrigation related IEC does not
form part of this project, the WSSD would liaison with the irrigation and agriculture
departments for necessary coordination. Secondly, the project plans to address this very
issue of holistic water resources management by the communities on a pilot basis in six
select watersheds. The lessons learnt during these pilots would be useful in scaling up the
approach to all the watersheds in the state.
Thus, it can be concluded that through scientific planning and judicious use of available
water resources by different sectors, availability of water for human consumption in rural
Maharashtra would not be a constraint.
3.1.2. Impact of Sugarcane Irrigation: About 18.8% (6,99,200 ha) of the total irrigated
area (37,19,149 ha) in the State is under sugarcane and is over irrigated. About 50% of this
(349, 600 ha) falls under project area, mainly concentrated in Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara,
Nashik, Latur, Beed, Osmanabad and Solapur districts. Excessive irrigation and use of
chemical fertilisers for sugarcane has led to progressive decline of groundwater tables and
contamination of groundwater at shallow depths with Nitrates, thus deteriorating the
groundwater quality. The GOM would educate the farming community about the use of
appropriate irrigation measures (such as drip irrigation, sprinklers etc) and also use of
organic fertilisers through IEC. However, this IEC is beyond the scope of the project and
WSSD would liaison with the Irrigation and Agriculture departments for the same.
3.1.3. Surface water: Total surface water availability in five major river basins covering
the project area is estimated at 107683 MCM/year of which present utilization is 30635.67
MCM/year (28.5%). Per capita availability of surface water is lowest in Tapi river basin
(477 cubic meters/year) and highest in Konkan sub basin (3497 cubic meters per year).
3.2. Water Quality issues: Ground water Quality in the State particularly in shallow
acquifer is generally good and potable. However, in certain areas concentration of
Fluoride, Nitrate, Iron, and salinity due to exposure to rocks is higher than permissible
limit.
3.2.1.Fluoride: Chemical analysis of water samples from wells and bore wells by GSDA,
CGWB, PHD and NEERI shows that in project area, ground water in parts of 52 talukas in
17 districts has higher concentration of fluoride than permissible limits and most of the
affected areas are in Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Satara, Beed, and Solapur districts.
Based on data of water table monitoring by GSDA and CGWB between 1992-2002 and the also the Hydrology
project data
5 Provisional revised groundwater assessment by GSDA and CGWB, 2002 This analysis indicates a 'worst
case' scenario for some parts of the 68 talukas in the 19 districts, if the current irrigation practices continue In
such a scenario, the GOM would allocate an additional I 10 MCM/year (the projected shortage) for drinking
water purposes, curtailing other uses, as drinking water has the first priority for water usc in both the national
and state policies
4



Concentration of fluoride is more in deeper aquifers tapped by bore wells than at shallow
depths. GOM is in the process of developing a strategy to address fluoride related issues,
with assistance from Water and sanitation Programme-South Asia (WSP-SA). The WSP-
SA consultants have reviewed the prevailing field situation in four districts: Yavatmal,
Chandrapur, Nagpur and Nanded (excepting Nanded all the three are project areas) and are
in the process of formulating their recommendations. A brainstorming session would be
organised to discuss the recommendations and agree upon on the broad strategy
components during May/ June 2003. These components would then be detailed to
formulate the state wide strategy by July 2003. After that the strategy would be
implemented through out the state, including the project area.
3.2.2.Nitrate: High concentration of Nitrate in groundwater is reported mainly in Sangli,
Solapur, Satara, Nagpur, Yavatmal, Bhandara, Beed, Osmanabad, Thane and Parbhani
districts due to excess application of chemical fertilizer in large areas irrigated under
paddy, sugarcane, banana, cotton, orange and grape. The excess use of chemical fertilisers
leads to concentration of nitrate in groundwater at shallow depths. Secondly, composting
of solid waste and cow dung close to the water sources also leads to concentration of
nitrates in shallow water tables. Despite high concentration of nitrates, no case of blue
baby syndrome is yet reported in any part of the state. As explained in 3.1.2 above, the
WSSD would liaise with the irrigation and agriculture departments to educate the farmers
about using organic fertilisers. Secondly the project EC' would educate the community
about safe methods (including site selection) of composting solid waste.
3.2.3. Salinity: Salinity in groundwater is observed in 3 different areas of the State (i) Tapi-
Puma river alluvium (ii) Water logged areas in the canal command , and (iii) Coastal areas
Groundwater in the areas covering southern parts of Puma alluvium in Amravati (Daryapur,
parts of Achalpur and Anjangaon talukas) Akola (parts of Akot, Akola, Murtizapur and
Telhara taluka), Buldhana (Nandura, Khamgaon and Mehkar talukas) have high salinity,
making it unfit for drinking purpose. The villages in this zone are supplied drinking water
from safe surface water sources. Intervention through rainwater harvesting would also be
undertaken.
3.2.4.Iron: High concentration of iron is present in groundwater in Ratnagiri, Chandrapur,
Sindhudurg, Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Solapur, Nagpur, and Kolhapur districts due to high
iron mineral in the geological formations. In areas where iron content is high in
groundwater, storing water before use and allowing it to settle has reduced its impact. The
iron contamination has no severe health impact except for some occasional stomach
disorders.
3.2.5. Bacteriological Contamination: Sampling of drinking water sources by PHD
across the State indicates contamination of about 32% sources over last three years i.e.
2000-2002. As per PHD reports an average 1.2 million (1.2%) people are affected every
year and about 350 people die due to bacteriological contamination of drinking water.
However, the trend analysis of attacks and deaths due to water borne diseases between
1997 and 2002 indicate a progressive decline, due to intensive IEC undertaken under the
Sant Gadge Baba Campaign. The IEC covered safe sanitation practices and protection of
drinking water sources from contamination and chlorination of water.
The prevailing unsafe sanitation practices of open defecation and not washing hands is a
major cause for the bacteriological contamination and diseases. The project would
undertake intense IEC to encourage communities to shift over from the practice of open
5



defecation to safe sanitation and adopt safe sanitation practices such as hand washing.
Other environmental sanitation intervention like drains, solid waste management would
also contribute to the reduction of diseases. Further, the community would be trained to
regularly check the water quality, either directly or through PHC (using field test kits) and
regularly chlorinate the water as per need.
3.3.Sanitation and Hygiene: Presently out of 1 lmn rural families about 2.46 mn have
been provided latrines by GOM under different programs. However, while about 22.5% of
rural families have access to latrines only about 11.5% use the latrines and others continue
the practice of open defecation. Therefore the project aims at achieving zero open
defecation instead of focusing on 'latrine building'. Out of 53171 primary schools 27%
have sanitary facilifies.
4.0.Policy and Legal Framework
The GOM adheres to the National Water Policy laid down by the government of India and
gives first priority to drinking water supply over other water uses. Besides, Government of
Maharashtra has passed following Acts dealing with protection of Environment and
natural resources.
* Maharashtra Act XVI of 1970 viz. Maharashtra Prevention of Water Pollution Act 1969
* Maharashtra Act XLVIII of 1976 viz. Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage Board
Act 1976 (as amended twice).
* Maharashtra Ground water (Regulation) Act 1993 for protecting drinking water wells.
* Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act
1993 prohibition to employ manual scavengers
* Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission Actl998 recommending lower
electricity tariff charges for RWS Schemes
* Bombay Police Act (punishment for spoiling environmental sanitation)
5.0.Public Consultations and issues identified: Public consultations were held in four
villages in each of the five districts selected for the study. The issues emerging from the
public consultations are as follows:
5.1.Water quantity and quality issues:
*    Adequate drinking water supply is not available in summer
*    Surface water supply also depletes during lean period.
*    In many places, drinking water sources are polluted and contaminated.
*    Lack of awareness about residual chlorine in water and use of chlorine tablets.
*    Quality of water is not regularly monitored.
*    During water scarcity period, beneficiaries are willing for dual water supply system
5.2.Household and environmental sanitation issues:
* There was lack of individual latrines and practice of open defecation causes
inconvenience, particularly to women.
* Disposal of organic waste close to water supply source causes contamination.
* Scarcity of water is cited as main reason for non-use of latrines.
* Lack of sullage and storm water drains and soak pits causes environmental problems.
6



5.3.Personal health and hygiene:
* Using polluted/contaminated water causes frequent attacks of diarrhoea, malaria,
jaundice and other gastrointestinal problems.
6.0.Hot Spots and Issues
The following is an analysis of hotspot areas.
6.1 Sanitation hotspots: Only 22 4% households have access to latrines. Only 27% of
primary schools have sanitary facilities. In most of the villages disposal of sullage,
wastewater, and cattle dung is improper. Thus, all the 26 districts in the project area fall
under hot spots category.
6.2 Water hotspots: For identifying water related hotspot areas the declining water tables
and presence of excess fluoride and TDS has been considered (TDS includes salinity also)
as primary indicators. As presence of nitrates and iron in the drinking water did not have
any recorded health impact in the state they have not been considered as indicators for
water hotspot areas.
The taluka wise information has been plotted for the above three parameters, in Table I
below. The districts that have presence of any two parameters and more than 5 affected
talukas have been prioritised a hot spot areas. Accordingly, the following 12 districts fall
under the category of hotspots: Akola, Beed, Buldhana, Clhandrapur, Jalgaon, Nagpur,
Nashik, Sangli, Satara, Sinzdhdurg, Solapur, and Yavatmal. There are a total of 102
affected talukas in these 12 clistricts.
A second level of analysis reveals that there are about 35 talukas in 15 districts (11 out of
the above 12 (excepting Buldhana) and additional districts of Hingoli, Osmanabad,
Ratnagiri and Thane) that have more than 2 indicators and thus qualify to be considered as
hotspot talukas. However, it may be noted that not all the villages in these talukas/ districts
are affected.
A tertiary level of analysis would be required to identify exact hot spot villages. Specific
criteria would be identified and detailed information collected to identify exact hotspot
villages during the initial project period. PPMU would contract experienced consultants
for this exercise.

7.0 Strategies and Technology Options for addressing Hotspot issues
7.1 Strategies: The following are the specific strategies to address environmental aspects
related to different project interventions.
7.1.1.Strategies for Water Quantity issues
* Rejuvenation and rehabilitation of existing sources
* Promote concepts related to ground water recharge, source protection/ strengthening
and balanced extraction for different uses.
* Rainwater harvesting and roof top rain water harnessing
* Create supplementary safe source
* Promote aquifer management groups and educate communities in total water resources
management, on a pilot basis.
* Regular monitoring of ground water
7.1.2. Water Quality Issues
* Provide potable drinking water from alternate sources
* Promote shallow open wells
* Continuous chlorination of water supply to maintain a minimum residual concentration
at each stand post and individual connection.
* Mixing contaminated water with fresh water to lower the concentration of fluoride,
nitrate, iron and salinity
* Promote household or community treatment systems
* Continuous IEC programs
7.1.3 Water Quality Monitoring: The water quality monitoring in rural areas is carried
out through a three-tier strategy involving following actors in the table below.

Organising water quality tests for 100% sources in high
problem districts/ hotspot areas.
Maintain state level MIS
7.1.4. Strategy for Household Sanitation:
* Community based incentive for zero open defecation through collective action.
* Effective TEC through Sant Gadge Baba campaign
* Propagate safe and low cost technology options for,poor stake holders
7.1.5.Strategy for Environmental Sanitation
* Provide sullage and storm drains with proper disposals
* Promote household/community compost pits for waste disposal



* Identify suitable sites away from drinking water source for disposal of excreta
village garbage and cattle dung
* Construct internal lanes and pavements
* Effective IEC campaign for peoples participation and attitudinal change
7.2 Technology Options: Considering the nature, type and severity of the problems in the
project area, a menu of environmentally safe technology options for various quantity,
quality, hygiene and environmental sanitation issues have been provided (refer Annexure-
VII, VIII, IX and X in the main report for details). Further, appropriate 'Technical
Guideline Manuals' are prepared to guide the process of selection, implementation and
O&M for all the suggested technical interventions. The communities would select an
appropriate option based on the technical need, capital cost, O&M cost, preference, and
availability of technology and skills in a demand driven approach.
7.2.1 Technologies for Water Quality: The generic preferred technology options where
drinking water in the existing sources is contaminated are: alternate safe source, use of
limited safe water for drinking and cooking and use of contaminated water for other
purposes, dilution by adding low/ nil contamination water, domestic filter treatment and
community level treatment through appropriate technology. Besides these, the following
specific technology treatment options are also available for specific contamination.
Fluoride:
* Nalgonda Model (Complexion Method) and fill and draw defluoridation plant
technology
* Dilution with low fluoride water
* Roof Rain water harvesting structures to provide for drinking and cooking water
Iron:
* Aeration of water and settling of the iron oxide sludge.
Bacteriological:
* Chlorination of water at source/ household as the case may be.
7.2.2 Groundwater Recharge: Various conventional and non-conventional measures
such as check-dams, deepening/ de-silting of tanks in the former category and jacket wells,
bore blast technique and fracture seal cementation in the later category. Selection of one or
a combination of more than one technology depends on the local hydro-geological
conditions.
7.2.3 Household Sanitation: A range of safe pit latrines varying from VIP to single pit
pour flush to twin pit pour flush latrines shall be propagated. The household would choose
a desired option based on local soil conditions, their preference, cost and ease of
availability of materials and construction skills.
7.2.4 Environmental Sanitation: The technology options for solid and liquid waste are:
Sullage drains, soak pits leach pits, open drains, household and community composting
pits, disposal of biodegradable wastes through Vermiculture for various regions.
8.0 Environmental Management Plan (EMP):
Critical analysis of the baseline environmental data, feed back from the public
consultations, information gathered through MIS for the, current schemes as well as the
issues emerged during discussions with various functionaries and organizations
participating in the rural water supply program has brought out key environmental issues
that need to be addressed along with mitigated measures while designing and

implementing the project. The important environmental issues are classified into four
different categories (I) Water Quantity issues (ii) Water sources management (iii) Water
quality issues, and (iv) Environmental sanitation and hygiene issues

The negative impacts anid their mzitigatory measures have beeni shown in the EMP table in
italics It may be noted that the project interventions have been designed to adldress all
possible negative impacts. Thus, the overall inmpact of the project is positive and would
imlprove health of the people anid environment in the project area
8.1 Environmental Monitoring and Performance Indicators: The following Key
Performance Indicators have been identified to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project
interventions on the environment. These indicators have also been incorporated in the Project
Implementation Plan (PIP).

The PPMU (WSSD) would be the overall responsible agency to coordinate with all the
departments and ZPs to collect data and monitor the project progress.
8.2 Institutional Arrangements for the Project (including EMP):
The project, including the EMP, would be implemented through an institutional
arrangement that would build up on the existing PRI structure as detailed below.
Village Level: The VWSC nominated by the Gram Sabha would be the project manager at
the village level and functions as a sub-committee of the GP. The project funds would be
transferred to a separate bank account managed by the VWSC. A separate 'Social Audit
Committee' would ensure transparency, equity and quality aspects. Para-professionals in the
village would be trained to monitor the water quality and also the ground water tables.
District Level: The revamped Water Conservation Committee of the Zilla Parishad would
be the policy making body. The professional support would be provided by two inter
connected but independent teams- Districts Facilitation Team (DFT) and District Appraisal
and Monitoring Team (DAMT)- managed by the CEO of the ZP. The DFT would facilitate
the processes and capacity building at village level and the DAT would monitor quality. The
engineers, hydro-geologists and health specialists in the DFT would help the communities
to choose an appropriate option for a given need (from a broad menu described in section
7). The Monitoring and Evaluation specialist in the DAMT will monitor the implementation
of EMP based on the specific indicators listed in table 4 above. Further, special consultants
with experience in environmental issues would be contracted to assist the DFT and DAMT
as per need.
State Level: The PPMU at the state would have two sections. A reform management think
tank that would monitor the progress of reform agenda in the sector and feed into the policy
making of GOM. The project management team would provide managerial assistance to the
District teams and monitor the progress of the project. The environment and health
17



specialists along with M&E specialist in the team would be responsible for monitoring the
implementation of the environment management plan.
Other Line Agencies: The GSDA would be responsible for tracking the ground water
trends through existing monitoring systems (state wide observation wells under the geo-
hydrology project). The Public Health Department would continue to monitor the 'water
quality' on a sample basis through its existing laboratoriesland PHC structures. Besides, the
PPMU would contract other agencies for special purpose works like testing of 100% water
samples in the districts, developing criterion for identifying hotspot villages, impact
evaluations etc. Support Organisations (SOs) would also be contracted to work closely with
the villages and build their capacity and also help them in the project processes.
The DFT/ DAMT at the district level and the PPMU at the state level would be responsible
for coordinating with these agencies, collect regular data/ information and utilise it in the
project implementation.
9.0 Budget for EMP:
All the project intervention components (community water supply infrastructure and
personal hygiene, household and environmental sanitation) and staff positions at the
district level and environmental training related budgets for state, district and villages have
been incorporated in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). In addition the following
aspects are budgeted as supplementary environment budget in the EA.
* A new position of an 'Environment Specialist' at Project Planning and
Monitoring Unit (PPMU) level.
*  Specialist consultant for developing hot spot village selection criteria
*  Specialist consultants to help DFT and DAMT on a need basis.
