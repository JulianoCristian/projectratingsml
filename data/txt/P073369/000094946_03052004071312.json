The\n            tribal development plan will have two major objectives: i)\n            one related to rural water supply and sanitation delivery\n            being attempted through fostering, and empowering\n            autonomous, inclusive, equitable and accountable grassroots\n            tribal institutions, and ii) institutional strengthening to\n            enable the state government in general. The concept of\n            self-help and community sharing or resources is ingrained in\n            the tribal culture; involving local communities in\n            decision-making is part of the tradition. Key issues are\n            discussed and conflicts, if any, are resolved in the\n            presence of hereditary village head and other elders. The\n            project's strategy of decentralization of Village\n            Panchayats, and user groups, fits in with the tribal\n            socio-economic characteristics and cultural value. At the\n            same time, a study on traditional systems of governance\n            among tribals will also be completed during the first year\n            of the project, with a view to identify\n            culturally-appropriate ways of local governance and hence to\n            improve tribals' participation and inclusion. The\n            tribal development strategy will also be premised on the\n            Community Demand Driven (CDD) principles of: autonomy,\n            subsidiary, self selection and demand driven participation,\n            inclusion and equity, transparency and accountability, and\n            cost sharing. Tribals mobilized into groups will be\n            capacitated to plan, implement and operate and maintain the\n            project activities/facilities."}, "docdt": "2003-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
