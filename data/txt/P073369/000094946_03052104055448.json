Develop a program to educate the community\n            about the need to maintain groundwater balance, and control\n            over collective exploitation, and to avoid over-extraction\n            of groundwater, and drying of drinking water wells.\n            Technical manuals will provide with guidelines for\n            environmentally safe disposal methods to reduce diseases,\n            health expenditures, and lack of safe disposal of chemicals.\n            Capacity building of the community/school to properly\n            maintain facilities.
