objectives of the\n            proposed project are to: (i) increase rural households'\n            access to improved and sustainable drinking water supply and\n            sanitation services; and (ii) institutionalize\n            decentralization of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS)\n            service delivery to rural local governments and communities.\n            The project has the following components. Component A:\n            Community Development & Infrastructure Building. This\n            component consists of the following three sub-components :\n            (i) Community Development; (ii) Community Infrastructure;\n            and (iii) Tribal Development Program. This component will\n            consist of the following sub-components. A1: Community\n            Development. A2: Community Infrastructure. A3: Tribal\n            Development Program. Component B: Institutional\n            strengthening. This component consists of the following four\n            sub-components: (i) Capacity building; (ii) IEC including\n            Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion (SHP); (iii) Monitoring and\n            Learning; and (iv) Project Management.  B1: Capacity\n            building. B2: IEC including sanitation, and hygiene\n            promotion. B3: Monitoring and Learning. B4: Project\n            Management. C: Sector Development and Strengthening. C1:\n            Knowledge Management for Policy Support. C2: Water Quality\n            Monitoring. Component D: Pilot Component. Piloting New\n            Initiatives: The project will support implementation of\n            three pilots, which seem fundamental to improve\n            decentralization and governance of district and\n            village-level institutions; to introduce aquifer-based\n            supply and demand management of water to enhance\n            sustainability of water sources with reference to\n            communities' broad-based priorities for diverse usages\n            of water; and to develop and scale up a model for O&M of\n            water supply facilities that would expand beyond the\n            proposed project.
