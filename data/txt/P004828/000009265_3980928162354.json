The project consists of three components. The\n            first component focuses on capacity building, institutional\n            development, and computerization. In this component,\n            system-level planning and coordination are targeted on the\n            central agencies responsible for higher education.\n            Institutional-level planning improvements are targeted to\n            universities and other higher education institutions. The\n            component will also support development of information\n            technology in participating universities and higher\n            education institutions. The second component will provide\n            grants, on a competitive basis, to support quality\n            improvements in selected qualifying higher education\n            institutions and universities. The selected improvement\n            programs will focus on teaching, learning, research, and\n            institutional administration. The third component provides\n            the essential coordination, implementation, procurement,\n            contract management and accounting functions needed for\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "1998-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
