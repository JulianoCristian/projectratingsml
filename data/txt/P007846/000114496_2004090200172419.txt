Re:
Loan No. 3841 Rural Health Project
Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Sir:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement between the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank) and the Republic of Panama (the Borrower) dated July 20, 1995 (the Loan 
Agreement) with regard to the above-captioned Project.
Pursuant to our recent discussions on the subject, the Bank agrees to amend the Loan Agreement 
as to: (i) change the percentage of disbursement in category (1) “works under Water Subprojects” of  
Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement; and (ii) to exclude Subprojects executed by UNICEF from such 
category (1).  
As a consequence, Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and replaced to read in 
its entirety as per the Attachment I to this Amendment Letter.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating this letter in 
the spaces provided below.  This Amendment Letter will be executed in two counterparts, each of which 
shall be an original.
Upon your confirmation, please return one fully executed original to us.  The provisions of this 
Amendment Letter will become effective as of the date of this letter upon receipt by the Bank of one 
fully executed original of this Amendment Letter.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
