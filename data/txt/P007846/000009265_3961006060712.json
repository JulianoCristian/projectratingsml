percent at present to about 30 percent among young children,\n            breast-feeding and pregnant women in the poorest 28\n            districts of Panama; (b) increase the coverage of water\n            supply and basic sanitation in all of Panama's rural\n            areas from about 62 to 80 percent and from about 72 to 88\n            percent respectively; (c) train new and existing Community\n            Water Boards to improve their capacity to operate and\n            maintain systems under their responsibility; and (d)\n            strengthen the institutional capacity of: the Subdirectorate\n            General of Environmental Health of the Ministry of Health,\n            Subdirectorate General of Health Services, Project\n            Administration Unit, and the Ministry of Planning and\n            Economic Policy. The Project supports the Government of\n            Panama's poverty alleviation strategy as it (a) targets\n            nutrition interventions in the poorest districts; (b)\n            contributes to human resource development by improving\n            access to basic and preventive health services; (c) involves\n            the community in the design and execution of subprojects and\n            makes them fully responsible for their operation and\n            maintenance; and (d) makes the fullest use of\n            nongovernmental organizations, private sector and community\n            resources. Thus, the project consists of three components:\n            nutrition, rural water supply and sanitation, and\n            institutional strengthening."}, "docdt": "1994-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
