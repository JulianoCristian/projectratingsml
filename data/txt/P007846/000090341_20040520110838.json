         was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that a thorough\n            assessment of the Borrower's implementation capacity is\n            crucial to establish a realistic implementation plan. It is\n            important to assess the country's geographical and\n            logistical reality, which may produce constraints in\n            implementation. In the provision of basic social services,\n            it is essential to include a social communications strategy\n            to reach out to beneficiaries, particularly the remote,\n            rural communities, and explain the benefits and implications\n            of project interventions. The involvement of third party\n            service providers, such as private entities and/or NGOs,\n            contracted by government to deliver social services can be\n            positive, effective, and affordable. In a project\n            implementing complementary activities in the same areas, it\n            is very important to coordinate among components.\n            Coordination can, in these cases, increase the impact and\n            effectiveness of the activities and facilitate\n            implementation, particularly at the level of the regional\n            and local offices where physical, human, and financial\n            resources are scarce. The involvement of communities is\n            particularly important during the transition to operations\n            and maintenance of the rural water systems. Although this\n            project suffered from weak quality at entry and poor\n            implementation and supervision early on, the remarkable\n            turnaround resulting from the mid-term review and\n            restructuring shows that it is possible to carry out a\n            radical restructuring and get good results. Given the\n            problems encountered in this and other projects, at this\n            time, the use of UNDP as a procurement agency it is a\n            condition sine qua non for successful implementation in Panama."}, "docdt": "2004-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
