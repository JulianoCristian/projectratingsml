seeks to achieve this by pursuing three specific objectives: (a) improving governance and
capacity at the local level; (b) strengthening the provision of, and access to, essential
infrastructure services; and (c) supporting private small-scale group enterprise
development.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1. Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Overview
At the time of project formulation (as at present) about 65% of the population of the Kyrgyz
Republic lived in rural areas, which means in the administrative rural self-government areas (aiyl
kenesh okrug-AKO) and their constituent natural villages (aiyl) at which this project was aimed.
These villages were extremely poor, with 62% of their inhabitants consuming below the absolute
poverty line in 2001, and 28% in extreme poverty. These rural poverty numbers reduced to 51%
and 14% respectively in 2005, still very high. These improvements came with only modest
economic growth, partly fueled by the land privatization reform and remittances from workers in
Kazakhstan and Russia. Unlike many other countries, the political leadership admitted the scale
of the poverty problem in the country, and welcomed poverty studies and monitoring assistance
from the Bank and other donors. The GOK had nearly reached agreement on a previous
proposed IDA operation (the Kyrgyz People's Initiative Project) aimed at alleviating rural
poverty on a community driven basis, a few years before. Many other operations, focusing on
productivity-enhancing aspects of poverty alleviation, in agriculture, irrigation, and rural credit,
had been started by the time (2003) the Village Investment Project (VIP) was developed, which
explains the lack of such features in VIP. In particular, a successful series of small-scale rural
credit operations had been started, which probably explains the inclusion in VIP of support for
only group-implemented income-earning micro-projects (MPs), and a fairly strict initial limit on
the    overall    proportion    of    income-earning    MPs      in   the   early   project   years.

Throughout the decade of post Soviet transition, the public sector had lacked financing for
rehabilitation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. This led to serious deterioration of this
infrastructure, especially in rural areas.     Local governments and communities consistently
identified lack or poor quality of drinking water, shortages of electricity and gas, and the
dilapidation of health care and educational facilities as their primary concerns.

The project also was formulated during a ferment of GOK decentralization initiatives being
implemented with the strong support of the donor community.                  Since the mid-1990s
administrative decentralization in the Kyrgyz Republic was increasingly linked with the need to
address problems related to the demise of collective and state farms - the previous organizing
principle for all rural areas in the USSR. This trend intensified with laws passed in 2001-2003,
providing for direct election of local AKO officials and some autonomy both functional and
financial for local governments, including below the raion (district) level. If anything, VIP was
more directly aimed at fleshing out this decentralization and devolution trend, with real
participatory practices for project decision-making at the village level, than at poverty alleviation
per se.

VIP focused on empowering community groups to make decisions on priority investments. This
process was to occur in close partnership with existing local government institutions, in
particular aiyl okmotus (village administrations) and aiyl keneshes (elected village councils). VIP
chose not to provide support directly through aiyl okmotus for two main reasons: documented

                                                 1

low levels of public confidence in AOs and their lack of budget autonomy and capacity which
increased the risk for improper use of funds. At the same time, the project sought to develop
good local practices and introduce new mechanisms in formal local government institutions
through their engagement in decision-making.

This approach insulated the project from problems when government policy rolled back some of
the country's decentralization reforms, in particular returning to the de facto appointment of
heads of aiyl okmotus instead of popular elections (as occurred in the new Constitutions of 2006
and 2007). The elimination of genuine elections significantly limited independence of the glavas
(heads of aiyl okmotu) and undercut their accountability to communities. However, with the
balanced power base of the VIP arrangements, at the central level through the Steering Council
with equal representatives of various stakeholders, as well as at the local level with the Local
Investment Union Executive Committees (LIC) including representatives of the aiyl okmotu and
aiyl keneshes this political shift has not affected the project's pace and results. Thus, in sum,
because it had created what was in a sense a parallel structure of decision-making for project
activities and works, the centralizing trend of government policy in recent years did not
materially slow the project, its works, and its benefits. It probably did, however, prevent a
spontaneous adoption of project processes across the governmental structures of rural
Kyrgyzstan.


Country Assistance Strategy and Government strategies supported by Project
The operative CAS at the time of project appraisal (Report No. 25708 - KG, discussed
05/15/2003) focused on three objectives: a) supporting private sector-led growth, b) providing
essential services, and c) strengthening the governance framework. Although the PAD claims
that the project supports all three, the links to the first objective appear somewhat tenuous. The
only direct link of project activities to profit-oriented investment would have to be through the
income-generating MPs, which as noted above were strictly limited in terms of numbers and
proportions, and which the project made every effort to confine to group or cooperative
investments. The normal pattern for private-sector development in peasant rural societies
(which was then commencing to develop in Kyrgyzstan in place of the large-scale collectives of
Communism) is through formation of family enterprises, thus avoiding the well-known internal
incentive and moral hazard issues of cooperatives.              There were good reasons for this
ambivalence towards support of commercial activities by VIP. First, there were the other
operations (e.g. rural credit) aimed at this goal underway. Second, the real constraint on rural
entrepreneurial development in the Kyrgyz Republic was not deficient village infrastructure,
poor as that was, but rather the very poor business environment maintained by local authorities
which essentially harassed rural enterprises to bankruptcy as soon as they started to generate
noticeable profits. To improve this situation, two other projects (Agribusiness and Marketing,
and Financial Sector and Business Development) were specifically being prepared. Thus VIP
was never intended to contribute significantly towards this goal.

On the other hand, VIP's links to the second and third CAS priorities were obvious and
powerful. No other IDA operation was significantly contributing to improving the infrastructure
of the villages where over half the Kyrgyz population lived, as VIP was to do. In the area of
governance and decentralization, VIP provided a working model, eventually (during the life of
this project) replicated in every village in the country, of what real citizen participation and
empowerment looks like.

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overarching aim of the project was to contribute to the alleviation of rural poverty. It seeks
to achieve this by pursuing three specific objectives: (a) improving governance and capacity at
the local level; (b) strengthening the provision of, and access to, essential infrastructure services;
and (c) supporting private small-scale group enterprise development.            It does this at the
grassroots level, by supporting income and employment generating investments in village
infrastructure and in group-managed small and medium enterprises, and by helping communities
and local authorities work together to achieve key development objectives at the local level.
This approach was in line with the country's policy of devolution of responsibilities, aiming to
strengthen local government administrations (aiyl okmotus) and councils (aiyl keneshes) and
grassroots institutions ­ making them more inclusive, accountable and effective at meeting
villagers' self-identified development needs.

Key performance indicators of the project development objectives (PDO) included:
    Employment and income generated by micro projects;
    Access to improved infrastructure;
    Broad participation in strategic planning micro-project prioritization and implementation,
      at both aiyl and aiyl okmotu level;
    Adoption of mechanisms for accountability of community managed funds, including
      publicized minutes of decision meetings, micro-project progress reports and careful control
      of community managed funds;
    Capacity of targeted communities to prioritize, plan, design, implement, operate and
      maintain micro-projects.

1.3. Revised PDO

The PDOs were not formally revised.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries as (approved by original approving authority) and Key
      Indicators.

Target group­ individuals. Although various categories of beneficiaries were discussed in the
PAD, essentially the intended and actual beneficiary group was composed of the cross-section of
inhabitants of the Kyrgyz Republic's villages, especially as the project was rather quickly
expanded to cover the whole country. The Project originally expected to cover about 1.5 million
people in 200 Aiyl Kenesh Okrugs (AKO), or about half of the country's rural population.
However, with the Project's rapid expansion, it was decided in 2004 to cover all 475 AKOs in
the country with the help of parallel financing provided by KfW and a WB repeater project (VIP-
2). Over half (51%) the rural population was poor in 2005, and this proportion was considerably
higher in the oblasts of Batken, Issykul, Jalalabad, Osh, and Naryn, i.e. all the regions outside
Bishkek, Chui, and Talas where the bulk of project activities were implemented.

Target group- communities. The primary beneficiaries of VIP were participating communities.
They benefited from the investments made under VIP in accessing new and better social and
economic infrastructure, in created new jobs and incomes within income generating micro
projects, in receiving information, knowledge and development of new skills from VIP's
participatory processes in social mobilization, needs and resources assessments and strategic

                                                 3

planning. Community members as general villagers benefited from the project mainly in terms
of improved public infrastructure. However, the major VIP beneficiaries in communities were
so called partners formed by VIP at the village level. The latter included: village mobilizers
(there were more than 5,615 elected VMs) and organizations which were formed to prepare and
implement micro projects (there were more than 4,617 micro-project groups-MPGs-
implementing MPs), make decisions on the investments (around 1,661 VICs and 475 LICs were
formed and functioning), and monitor outcomes and impacts of these investments (475
Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation Groups-PMEG were formed in participating AKO).
These community level partners also benefited most in obtaining knowledge and information, as
well as getting new skills.

Kyrgyz incomes are both very low and very equal (Gini coefficient of 0.28) by international
standards, which increases the likelihood that needy people reaped most project benefits. There
is some chance that more dynamic or entrepreneurial residents reaped a larger share of the
benefits of the relatively small share of income-earning MPs, as they were probably more likely
to be the originators of such subprojects, but then many of these were selected to a) provide
publicly needed and wanted goods and services, such as the only grain mill in a village, and b)
were forced to provide a certain amount of employment or abide by other conditions imposed by
the various levels of investment committees which under project rules selected the investments.

Target group ­ local governments. VIP targeted bodies of the local self government- aiyl
keneshes (AK, local councils) and aiyl okmotus (AO-local administrations) within its social
mobilization process, through general and special training organized for heads of AOs (glavas)
and AK deputies. They also benefited from learning- by- doing while participating in the work
of the LICs on resources and needs assessment and strategic planning. This specific approach
gave the opportunity to AO management to learn through VIP mechanisms, processes, and tools
for good governance and obtain skills in conducting public affairs in a participatory manner,
especially with regard to strategic planning for community development.

Target group- NGOs. This group was expected to be empowered through involvement into the
process of social mobilization, training and annual gathering of ARIS staff and partner
organizations. ARIS also stated that it delegated these tasks to reduce the cost of social
mobilization. However, very little was spent on engaging NGOs and their benefits from VIP
were not as significant as originally planned. Although VIP approaches are widely replicated
and used by other development agents throughout the country, this happened mostly without the
Project's direct intent.

1.5. Original Components
VIP was comprised of three major components.

Component 1- Capacity Building and Empowerment (US$ 3.06 million; of which IDA US$
2.03 million, GOK US$ 0.23 million, co-financiers US$ 0.80 million).

Component 1 supported local capacity building and promoted community empowerment.
Focusing on three key groups - members of participating communities and community-based
organizations (CBOs), local self-government officials, and partner NGOs ­ the component was
expected to promote capacity building in social mobilization, strategic planning, micro-project
implementation and good governance. A social mobilization process consisting of 21 steps (later
increased to 26) was a cornerstone of this component. The project was expected to collaborate

                                                 4

very closely with partner organizations engaged in community mobilization and capacity
building in the country. This included UNDP, DFID (UK), the Urban Institute (USAID), the
Swiss Development Corporation (SDC), the Swiss Red Cross, the Soros Foundation, and the
Counterpart Consortium (a national association of NGOs). Training was conducted on VIP
processes and principles, as well as on business development, infrastructure planning and
operation, and good practices for avoiding or mitigating environmental impacts of micro-
projects.

Component 2 -Village Investments (US$ 14.41 million; of which IDA US$ 11.53million,
beneficiaries - US$ 2.88 million)

Component 2 provided a facility and mechanisms for delivering financial and technical support
for community-based initiatives around which villagers and local authorities collaborated in an
ongoing process of strategic planning, investment selection, and micro-project implementation.
Eligible and participating communities received community grants to implement their agreed and
approved community investment plans. Communities were to be targeted for inclusion on the
basis of their need, using poverty criteria, and of their willingness to apply and adhere to
principles of transparency, participation and accountability. On average, about US$95,000 was
available for a community participating over a full four-year cycle (actual allocation was based
on the size of population). At least 20% of the investment cost of each micro-project was
provided by the communities themselves (in funds, materials and/or labor).

Through a participatory and fully transparent process local problems and priorities were
assessed, own priorities for the grant scheme established, micro-projects addressing these needs
prepared and implemented. To be eligible for project support, a micro-project proposal had to
meet several requirements: (i) sponsorship by a micro-project group (MPG) recognized by the
community; (ii) a sound investment plan; (iii) local contribution o f at least 20% o f the
investment cost; (iv) a sound plan for the future operation and maintenance (O&M) of the
investment.

Component 3 ­ Project Management (US$ l.73 million; of which IDA US$ 1.40 million,
GOK US$ 0.25 million, co-financiers US$ 0.09 million)

This component supported overall project management by the Community Development and
Investment Agency (Agentstvo Razvitiya i Investirovaniya Soobschestv - ARIS).              It was
originally assumed that the agency would not have a large cadre of technical staff. Instead,
funding was expected to be provided to contract local technical expertise as needed to screen
micro project proposals for their technical and financial soundness and to facilitate and monitor
their implementation. Community mobilization work was to be undertaken by VIP Partners --
local and international organizations with an ongoing involvement in social mobilization
activities in various communities. For the ARIS, Community Development Support Officers
(CDSOs), recruited on term contracts from the target area, were to be assigned to work with two
or three AKO (depending on community size and travel distances involved) and provide the
essential link between the communities, the ARIS and the Community Mobilization Partners.
The CDSO is the basic professional staff of ARIS dealing with the villages.

1.6. Revised Components
There has been no formal revision of the project components. However, significant changes
were made to the components in the course of project implementation (see 1.7). These changes
include additional activities, reallocation of funds, and changes to the Operational Manual.

                                                  5

1.7. Other significant changes
Acceleration of national coverage. The major change in project design has been the acceleration
of coverage of the village investments program, to cover the entire country already under the first
VIP. The initial plan was that the first project would include only 200 of the country's 475
AKO. However, the PAD did note (pg. 14) that "Political and popular demand to include more
rural communities each year is strong, and if sufficient implementation capacity can be created,
at both the central and grassroots levels, to accommodate accelerated implementation, the
timetable may need to be shortened". This is what in fact occurred. Indeed, this is a fairly
common development in other countries where community-driven development (CDD) or
village works projects start well, as VIP did.       Thus, the ICR (of 12/30/2002) for the first
Community Works project in Albania notes that "the decision to implement the project country-
wide was also consistent with the post-crisis need for national unity over geographical division".
It is likely that the same need was felt in the Kyrgyz Republic after the 2005 revolution, as the
decision to accelerate coverage of VIP was taken in that year.

An unusual feature of VIP was the breakdown of the project into 4-year cycles for each of four
cohorts of villages, depending on the year of startup for each AKO. Each AKO receives 600
Som (about US$15) per capita for its village investment program, distributed among four annual
tranches. Initially these amounted to 100, 125, 175, and 200 Som/capita over the 4-year cycle
for each village, later changed to 100, 150, 200, and 150 Som/capita. Given this structure, and
lack of its modification, the acceleration of 2005 seems to have produced a program ending
perhaps sooner than anticipated at project startup, and for which steps to prevent premature
shutdown have not yet been developed, publicized, or agreed. For example, at the initial pace of
program expansion, the last cohort of villages would not have commenced their programs until
2012, ending in 2015 at which time every village in the country would have completed one 4-
year cycle. Now, the first cohort is finishing its last year this year, and the last will finish in
2011.

Use of NGOs and collaborations with partner organizations.           Initially, much of the social
mobilization and training of villagers to actively participate in MP development and selection
was intended to be executed by NGOs, to be selected competitively as contractors. Due perhaps
to perceived difficulties in doing this in a fully honest and transparent manner, and perhaps also
to early successes in using ARIS in-house CDSOs to perform these functions, these tasks were
quickly delegated to the cadre of CDSOs, with excellent effect. Very little was thus spent on
engaging NGOs.

Another change, made as the result of shifting more functions and subsequently workload
towards ARIS, related to establishment of oblast offices not envisaged in the original Project's
design.

Assumption of non-CDD tasks by ARIS.             As its name implies, ARIS was created to be a
community development agency, and from its beginning was imbued with an ethos of village
democracy and self-reliance.      Thus it came as a shock to the IDA task team and sector
management when requests were made from another sector unit, backed by the country
management unit, that ARIS become the implementing unit for another project, the Small Towns
Infrastructure and Capacity Building Project (STICBP), with a much different approach and
objectives than VIP. The concern was that ARIS would be diverted from its emphasis on village
                                                  6

good governance and direct citizen participation. In the event, the projects were well segregated
inside ARIS, and no deleterious effects on VIP implementation were observed. Since then ARIS
has accepted to manage another municipal project Bishkek and Osh Urban Infrastructure Project
(BOUIP), but rejected a proposed rural water supply project. Some observers consider that the
addition of the urban projects to its portfolio either has, or could possibly, provide synergies, for
example in terms of increased engineering expertise to ARIS' VIP program, but it seems that in
reality the segregation thus far has been so complete as to prevent that from occurring.

Reliance on credit entity for validation of income-earning subprojects. The PAD saw community
grants for income-earning MPs primarily as serving the function of a minimal equity contribution
(of a maximum of US $1,000), often demanded by prudent commercial and microfinance lenders.
Thus the PAD stated (pg. 11) that "the start-up grant will not be provided unless and until an
established lending institution has approved the credit application for the associated business
credit; this will require legal registration as a group business (e.g. cooperative, joint venture,
partnership, etc.)" Perhaps because it added excessive complexity to very small investments, this
requirement was, upon agreement with the World Bank, cancelled.

Reallocation
The GoA requested a reallocation in March 2007 for the purpose of efficient completion of the
project and disbursement of the remaining funds. The funds were reallocated from the Category
for Consulting Services and Unallocated and used for the community grants, works and training
due to the increased number of participating aiyl kenesh okrugs.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

The project's thorough preparation, as well as the government's commitment and participation,
ensured a solid design and a good base for successful implementation. Moreover, excellent
governance and project management performance led to more than foreseen outcomes.

2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
One of the key factors in VIP success was the thorough preparation process, including learning
about approaches and successful experiences in the area of CDD in other operations in
Kyrgyzstan and worldwide. During the pilot stage, funded by the Japan Social Development
Fund (JSDF), there were extensive consultations held with various donor funded projects.
While learning successful approaches and mechanisms, the joint WB and Government
preparation team also considered lessons learnt and problems encountered by these partners in
Kyrgyzstan. A CDD practitioner's forum was organized by the preparation team and supported
by the WBI initiative on networking in CDD to share information, discuss lessons, and build a
synergy in activities at monthly meetings. In addition, the preparation team made an effort to
learn from other WB and ADB initiatives on community level interest groups, such as irrigation
and drinking water users' associations.      The preparation team with the support of WBI also
visited Albania to learn about CDD activities there and established links with other successful
WB funded CDD operations, such as KDP in Indonesia, and the Social Investment Fund in
Armenia. Major positive as well as negative lessons of these initiatives were documented and
studied, and reflected in the design of the VIP.        Finally, the pilot stage of VIP gave the
opportunity to fine tune the design of the project and its arrangements, establish mechanisms to
prevent and mitigate possible risks. The gradual phase-in of VIP also gave an opportunity for


                                                  7

broad awareness of its principles to ensure commitment from the Kyrgyz Government as well as
from many citizens.


Background analysis
The project preparation process involved intensive social studies. There was a Social and
Institutional Assessment (SIA) conducted in 2002 with the aim to understand the context and
verify various assumptions and project approaches and principles.           The SIA reviewed
demographic and poverty data, analyzed existing legislation in regards to community based
organizations and their status, reviewed roles of formal and informal community' leaders and
institutions, and analyzed the role of civil society in community development. Two additional
studies assessed social capital in a few study areas, as well as possibilities to upscale partner
organizations' initiatives (UNDP and DFID).          The SIA concluded that the potential for
successful implementation of village based investment was from moderate to good. A weakness
was the lack of a quantitative baseline study which could be used to directly prove impact on
incomes and other outcomes.

Stakeholder Participation and Government Commitment
VIP enjoyed support from most stakeholders from the start. The key stakeholders in the project
design were the community members, local CBOs, local government (aiyl okmotus and
keneshes), as well as the national government, national NGOs, and other donors. There was an
effective dialogue with these stakeholders, such as CDD practitioners, local and central
government officials and NGOs organized at the stage of preparation. The Project Preparation
Unit organized five stakeholders' workshops in various regions of the country on the project's
objectives and mechanisms, design and operational arrangements, on financial and procurement
management, and capacity building activities. There was an initial resistance from some state
ministries and agencies which attempted to divert VIP into specific sectoral directions.
However, personal interest and strong support from Askar Akaev, President of the country at that
time, helped retain investment decision-making at village level.


Risk Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment
The project identified critical risks and assumptions adequately.

The project's environmental impacts were deemed small, as was borne out in practice. The
preparation included a review of regulations and capacities for environmental assessment in
Kyrgyzstan. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was thus formulated, summarizing
possible impacts, mitigating measures and capacity building needs. The EMP satisfied the
OP4.01 requirements for a "financial intermediary operation".      Training for environmental
impact screening of project activities was completed. Environmental Guidelines constitute an
integral part of the ARIS Operational Manual.

Guidelines for Environmental Review of Micro-projects were developed to ensure environmental
sustainability.    Moreover, 1% of completed micro projects are subject to the annual
environmental monitoring and evaluation according to the Operational Manual.                  An
Environmental Assessment (checklist) is filled out for each micro project to evaluate and
mitigate the micro project's potential environmental impact.      Following the results of the
environmental assessment of micro projects 1 850 out of 4 344 completed micro projects belong
to the Category "B" (middle level risk), and 2 494 micro-projects fall under the Category "C"
(low risk).

2.2. Implementation
The project components were implemented in a highly satisfactory manner and the development
objectives were achieved. Below are listed the factors considered to have had a significant
impact on the implementation and the outcomes. The PAD claimed an "overarching aim" of
poverty alleviation, to be achieved through three specific objectives of improving governance
and capacity at the local level, improving infrastructure, and supporting small-scale group
enterprises. To measure progress towards these goals, the PAD proposed 20 indicators, perhaps
too many to provide meaningful assessment or guidance; they were replaced in VIP-2 by 7
indicators.    In the original group, about 9 attempted to capture outcomes, 7 concerned the
processes recommended to achieve good outcomes, 2 concerned what were actually inputs, and
two more measured intermediate inputs which also function as outputs or accessories to
outcomes. The broadest outcome indicator was "rising employment and incomes in participating
communities", but of course this was under the expectation that VIP would cover less than half
the villages of the country, which would permit easier comparisons of project impact. Now,
every village has had at least one year of project experience.       On a macro level, incomes
(including rural incomes) have increased, and rural poverty has declined, but attribution of this to
such a small project would be difficult.

The project agency itself (ARIS) claims only 4662 permanent jobs created, mainly by income-
generation MPs.      This number is small in the context of Kyrgyzstan, but given the small
aggregate sum invested in such MPs, it likely breaks down to an order of magnitude of
$1000/job created, which is negligible (i.e. astonishingly cheap) by international experience.
Impact will be discussed more extensively below, but it should be noted that the process and
intermediate objectives were all met or exceeded.

Component 1 ­ Capacity Building and Empowerment
This component was perhaps implemented with the most success. Project activities, both in a
pilot phase financed by the JSDF, and in each annual cohort of AKOs added under the project
itself, started with an extremely detailed social mobilization phase. The focus of community
discussion started out much broader than the actual small MP investments to be financed,
encompassing development strategies for the administrative village jurisdictions. Between these
initial broad discussions and final investment programs, a series of 21 mobilization steps were
included in the Operational Manual (OM, pg. 20), including organizing of groups (e.g. to
develop self-selected MP proposals), elections of committee members at various levels (to judge
and select among investment proposals), training in areas such as project preparation or
operations and maintenance, organizing procurement processes or labor donations for project
implementation, etc. These many steps did not include major milestone events like the First and
Second Village Meetings where major decisions were actually taken. The importance of social
mobilization activities was well understood by all actors, and it affected the quality of strategic
planning, selection of micro projects as well as their implementation. This component also
played an important role in empowerment of local self government bodies (aiyl keneshes and aiyl
okmotus), raising their role and profile in communities and building closer relationships with
population.    Through the VIP supported institutions (LICs, VICs, MPGs), procedures and
processes, local government bodies got new ideas, instruments and mechanisms helping them in
doing their daily work more efficiently and transparently. It is encouraging that some aiyl
okmotus have adopted VIP approaches in strategic planning and selection of priorities for their
own investment programs. In some AKO they have transferred parts of the budgetary funding to
                                                9

the Local Investment Committees (LIC) so they are allocated and used based on principles of the
VIP: broad participation of people, including poor and vulnerable in planning, selection and
implementation of small but publicly supported projects.

While almost all Kyrgyz natural villages have now gone through the social mobilization process,
for other such programs a point to reconsider might be the volume of community time and effort
devoted to strategic planning of the small districts around such villages. It may not require such
a broad effort when the community may have obvious needs for an improved road, drain or
clinic. In the VIP case, the issue was compounded by similar efforts conducted by local
governments (AOs) for the AKO areas. In the coming years, it is recommended that minimal
updating efforts be expended on Village Profiles, most of which now exist for every settlement
in the country.

Training was a major element of this component. For village residents willing to take up
voluntary roles in the program, training modules were developed and delivered in the "VIP
philosophy" (principles of community-driven development), community needs assessment, local
development and investment planning, business and marketing fundamentals, community-level
procurement, community-level accounting, micro-project environmental impact assessment,
participatory monitoring and evaluation, budgeting, conflict resolution, and many other topics
relevant to local self-government and investment management.            Again, for cost efficiency
purposes, ARIS conducted all training activities using own resources.

VIP has created countrywide community based organizations (CBOs) in all AKO.                  These
institutions empowered, trained and supported through VIP could be institutions which, in
partnership with local governments, could address development of their areas. However, many
of them feel unneeded or unutilized with the project's completion. Since funding at the local
level is limited and largely earmarked, their energy is mainly used for attraction of small grants
from various donor organizations.

Component 2 ­ Village Investments
The village investments themselves formed the largest project component. Project funding for
these investments was strictly egalitarian, with a single exception for very small AKs. AKs with
a total population below 1,500 were funded at the rate of 1,500 people, i.e. 900,000 Kyrgyz Som
(about $22,500) over their four-year cycles, apparently due to the decision that this amount was a
floor critical mass for a village investment program to generate impact. An average AK, being
about four times larger than this minimum, received about 3.6 million Kyrgyz Som
(approximately $90,000) to undertake works.

The project was expected to fund between 2,000 and 4,000 MPs, costing about $3,000 on
average, in base costs. At least 25 % of costs were to be contributed by the villagers themselves,
in labor (the primary source of contribution in these very poor communities), materials, and
money, the latter covering at least 3% (later raised to 3.75%) of total costs, deposited up front.
Projects were to be selected in an extremely participatory, democratic, and transparent process,
covered under the first component of the project, as noted above. The PAD predicted that in
early years for each AKO, economic and social infrastructure MPs would predominate, given
neglect of such infrastructure since the breakup of the Soviet Union, but that in later years group-
based small business ventures (sometimes called income-generating MPs) would rise in
importance.    This indeed largely occurred, but it is not clear whether this was entirely

                                                 10

attributable to villagers' predilections, or was somewhat due to pressures from agency staff, who
thought this approach both rational and proper. As the project matured, categorization of
infrastructure was elaborated into communal/economic, sanitary and environmental, and social
infrastructure. Income generating MPs at large were seen as poverty alleviation means, while
implemented differently by different communities. In some villages they were given as seed
grants to poor families to start up small enterprises, in other areas communities decided that they
would be given to local entrepreneurs on a condition that their services or products would be
advanced to poor households with some discount.

Preparation and implementation of micro projects was a difficult process for communities,
especially during their first year of involvement in VIP. These difficulties related to the lack of
special technical expertise in the villages and raion centers, need to go through a lengthy and
complicated process of approval for technical designs with various relevant state agencies, as
well as overall lack of experience in communities on formulation of their needs and ways of
addressing them. The limitations on annual disbursement per AKO, as well as the limited annual
timeframe, were slightly problematic for large infrastructure micro projects and caused some
delays in their completion. Some infrastructure micro projects were of inadequate quality or their
maintenance not sufficient due to their complex nature, lack of technical expertise, and
sometimes because of unclear ownership status of the asset but the numbers of such problem
cases are low. While the problem of "lumpiness" of larger investments might be solved by ARIS
management itself, introducing a "carryover" provision whereby a village may borrow from
earlier and later year budgets to contract a larger investment entirely within one year, the issue of
better handling of engineering complexities will require a broader and more sustained effort,
which is already under way in the VIP-2 project. This is discussed in the section below.


Component 3 ­ Project Management
The implementing agency for the VIP was the Community Development and Investment
Agency - Agentstvo Razvitiya i Investirovaniya Soobschestv or ARIS, in Russian. ARIS was
created to implement VIP, and in that respect is much like a normal project management unit, or
PMU. Also like a PMU, all of its staff are consultants, not civil servants. ARIS staff operate
out of a headquarters in Bishkek, two regional offices in the South and North of the country,
single oblast (province) offices in the smaller oblasts of Batken, Naryn, Talas, and Issyk-Kul,
and two offices each in the larger oblasts of Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Chui.

ARIS was both a creation of the project and its agency, and it may be seen as an output of the
project management component. In this regard, the project was extraordinarily successful. In
aspect after aspect - financial management, engineering, procurement, staff morale, reputation
for honesty and integrity, personnel management and staff training - ARIS seems to achieve
levels superior to the great bulk of agencies and PMUs implementing Bank Group projects
worldwide.      The hallmark of its staff and its processes seems to be a thoroughgoing
professionalism. Taking personnel management as an example, ARIS staff are first recruited on
the basis of strict application of professional criteria and candidate interviews by an entire cross-
section of management, with hiring apparently proceeding only when consensus is achieved.
All staff are subject to confidential annual 360 degree evaluations by colleagues, external
partners, and clients (e.g. AO officials and village beneficiaries). Such informants as well as the
staff himself are asked to consider needed changes in skills, and thus specific training related to
that. Suggestions for training that are in accordance with staff's duties, and affordable, they are
approved by the HR director.          This highly sophisticated process is largely executed by
                                                  11

computer, so staff can easily compare self-assessments on various points with those of
supervisors and colleagues.       The process is aimed clearly at personnel development, not
discipline, and it actually seems to determine the corporate training program. To reduce the
costs of this training, ARIS maximizes use of training-of-trainers methodology, where resource
persons are selected for various aspects of agency work in each oblast, trained in Bishkek, and
returned to their oblasts to train their colleagues. Such attention to detail and substance can be
described in most aspects of ARIS' business practices and procedures.

The outcome of this professionalism is the high respect expressed for ARIS throughout the
country, both in oblast capitals and from ordinary villagers, many of whom freely declare that
ARIS is free of corruption. Based on this sort of reputation, a high number of former ARIS
staff, and indeed villagers with leadership roles in VIP programs, have now been elected to
village councils and higher level bodies.      Thus aside from the achievements of ARIS as an
entity, a large number of Kyrgyz professionals and ordinary citizens have experienced on the
inside what a truly competent, honest and idealistic organization looks and acts like, and will
hopefully move on to try to reestablish such values and conditions in other milieus.

One emerging problem area in the past few years has been a small number of projects where
poor design or workmanship have resulted in possibly dangerous works. A recent mission for
VIP-2 visited 25 of the technically most challenging of the 2,200 micro-projects in that portfolio,
and found 3 with structural issues ­ so the engineering quality issue is truly limited in extent.
These instances occurred despite the work of 10 ARIS field engineers, one based at each oblast-
level office. The problem may have emerged in recent years as villages (and ARIS) have, with
increasing confidence, attempted larger and more complex works. Those most likely to present
dangers to human safety are bridges actually suspended over channels (e.g. not mere culverts),
and gymnasiums, which suspend ceilings two stories above players and spectators. A program
has already been proposed (which ARIS quickly accepted), including IDA funding for strong
consultant engineering input to a thorough review of all challenging engineering works in the
portfolio, funding for retrofitting all works presenting danger to users, and an increase in the
ARIS staff establishment of engineers of appropriate specialities who will strengthen review of
designs, specifications, construction, and works as built.

Another emerging problem for ARIS has been an increasing turnover of its staff. This could be
explained by stagnating salaries, dictated by the Ministry of Finance matrix. The ARIS salary
level at the local level, as well as regional and national, is not competitive anymore and needs
serious consideration if this high quality staff is to be retained in the agency. Lack of training
opportunities for ARIS staff in country and abroad is also seen as a reason for many leaving it for
other development organizations despite their high motivation and loyalty to the VIP and ARIS.

One fundamental key to creating an organization like this, based on the process of creating
ARIS, seems to be resistance to nepotism. The founder and first executive director of ARIS is
often referred to as charismatic, but many charismatic leaders do not produce first class complex
organizations. One use of charisma then, in the development process, is to resist the inevitable
attempts at nepotism which will undoubtedly be attempted in any developing country context,
and indeed, in many developed countries as well, from the highest levels of political authority.
Once this is established, merit can be established as the operative basis for recruitment and
promotion of staff, and a highly professional and respected organization can be created. With
that established, all processes inside the organization can be made transparent, with little to be
hidden. This seems to be a fundamental lesson of this project.
                                                 12

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization
The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system and the list of indicators covered the project
objectives adequately.    The M&E system has been fully utilized for project management.
Beneficiary assessment surveys instituted for the mid-term review were well done, and the
completion surveys were innovative, thorough and perceptive. In each case they focused on the
critical parameters for each component and provided the basis for this report.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Only one safeguard was considered applicable during appraisal: Environmental Assessment
(OP4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01). The mitigating measures and monitoring activities were performed
as prescribed and the safeguard policy has been satisfactorily complied with throughout the
project.

Financial and procurement management were found satisfactory throughout the project
life; indeed for the last two years of project life its financial management was rated highly
satisfactory.   It was regularly supervised by the financial management and procurement
specialists at the World Bank country office in Kyrgyzstan (see Annex 2 for more details).

2.5. Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

Sustainability

Sustainability here applies to both the overall program and ARIS itself, and to the individual
MPs. Although the VIP program has been carried forward in time by VIP-2 (now to be
augmented by Additional Financing) and by co-financiers, it is still true that the program is very
largely still donor-financed. The same is true of ARIS, which has broadened its non-VIP support
base by taking on other projects, but they also are largely donor-financed. Given the country's
macro-economic situation, it is difficult to propose a long-term solution other than continued
rapid economic development on an aggregate scale. The sustainability of MPs is discussed
below.

Monitoring to ensure sustainability

Participatory monitoring and evaluation groups and ARIS CDSOs hold annual monitoring of
15% of completed MPs and evaluated them by four indicators against a 100 point grading system
to monitor how obligations assumed by the MPGs and the communities are followed and to
check the current state of completed project facilities. Over the period from 2004 to 2007, 771
(17%) of completed MPs were covered by such monitoring. Some early detailed results of such
efforts are given in Table 1 below.

To ensure sustainability the MPG leaders transfer completed project facilities to the balance
sheet of relevant organizations and communities. The review of micro projects completed over
the period from 2004 to 2006 identified that the MPGs mainly transfer facilities to the balance of
ayil okmotus. These include schools, FAP (Primary health care or first aid points), kindergartens
and other social and economic infrastructure.           An Action Plan to ensure micro projects'
sustainability was developed (annual reporting meetings of villages); a training "Local Area of
Ayil okmotu Development Strategy" was prepared as well.                 It includes issues related to
ownership of completed facilities, maintenance of completed facilities and measures to ensure
their sustainability.

In the longer term, the main thrust toward sustainability, in the broader sense, will have to come
from a transfer of not just works, but also participatory processes including micro-project
selection, transparent procurement and payment of contractors, and close coordination with
villagers to elicit in-kind and cash contributions, from VIP and ARIS to the regular organs of
local government, starting with AOs. Only then will the ultimate goal of ARIS been reached. If
the GOK remains interested in decentralized rural development, this could be a prime focus of a
third VIP operation.


3. Assessment of Outcomes


3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDOs, as relevant at closing as at appraisal, have been achieved and the project has had
impacts above expectations, as summarized in 3.2 and detailed in Annex 2. The efficiency of the
micro projects is well above the required level and is likely to be significantly higher than can be
shown in the calculations, summarized in 3.3 and detailed in Annex 3.




                                                   14

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The project development objectives, as described in section 1.2, were achieved for all
components and the project's achieved impacts have contributed to creating an environment
conducive to rural income growth and poverty reduction. While attribution of macroeconomic
events to small investment projects such as the VIP, even only in part, is risky at best, it is worth
noting that during the project period the rural poverty rate declined by almost 14 percent (from
55.5% in 2004 to 41.7% in 2007).4 It seems incontestable that access to improved infrastructure
services and income-generating activities, contributed to these larger outcomes. The details on
project outputs and impacts are found in Annex 2.

The VIP achieved all its targets in social mobilization and capacity building. There were more
than 3,700 training courses conducted in all communities with participation of 75,000 people.
475 LICs, more than 1,600 VICs, and more than 4,500 MPGs were elected by villagers and
empowered by ARIS through training and through learning by doing.

The project successfully completed 4 344 micro projects out of 4 674 approved by communities
(93%). The remaining MPs are due to be completed under VIP-2. IDA disbursements for this
component amounted to US$ 12.4 million. Communities provided co-financing for about US$
5.75 million against the intended US$ 2.88 million. Micro projects could be broadly classified
by types as income-generating ­ 26.7% and social and economic infrastructure ­ 73.3%. Social
and economic infrastructure MPs were focused on improving access to and quality of drinking
water through repairs or construction of water systems; on increasing productivity of arable lands
through drainage improvements and renovation of irrigation systems; on improving schools and
kindergartens facilities through installation of heating systems, provision of new floors and roofs,
on improving access to electricity and telecommunications.              Grants provided to rural
entrepreneurs through income generating micro projects supported small scale business, such as
bakeries, flour mills, AI (artificial insemination) stations. According to the BIA about 70% of
the respondents stated that MPs implemented under the VIP were successful and that most
facilities constructed or renovated under the VIP are in good condition and used by the
population.

3.3. Efficiency (see Annex 3 for a detailed description)
Quantification of benefits of the overall project was considered impractical at appraisal, and this
conclusion was reinforced at completion. However, simple project analyses can, and have been
carried out at the MP level, to check the overall viability of the MP selection process - which
typically did not use such calculations on an operational level. The actual selections were done
mainly on the basis of community discussion and prioritization.          The result has been that
implemented micro projects have generated direct benefits to the participating communities, in
terms of increased incomes, employment opportunities, and a host of other benefits, e.g. earlier
and better schooling of children, quality of life as derived from use of public baths and
gymnasiums usually attached to schools; paid consumption of electricity, milled grain and
bakery products, repairs to vehicles of all sorts and other machinery, higher crop yields due to
improved seeds, etc. A special program commissioned by ARIS over 2005-2007 sampled 220
MPs randomly representing the various types of MPs actually implemented, and did mainly
financial post-evaluations on them.          The completion mission reviewed these in some detail,
eliminated 35 due to perceived unreliability of data, and corrected some of the 185 remaining on

the basis of fairly extensive field visits. A summary of typical MPs together with their financial
returns is presented in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 of Annex 3, while a full list of all analyzed MPs is in
the project file.


It will be noted that typical and average IRRs calculated for this sample, are extremely high.
These results are calculated in nominal terms, but as inflation (at least in terms of consumer
prices) has not reached 8% annually over the life of the project, the real results would not be
much lower.      The financial post-evaluations demonstrated that communities usually chose
investments that are suitable to local priorities and circumstances, and implemented them in the
most economical possible manner - with most of the labor provided free as their contributions to
the project, one of the reasons for the high rates of return. Taken as a whole, the weighted
average IRR on economic infrastructure is 186%, on sanitary and ecological infrastructure is
131%, on social infrastructure is 90%, and on income-generating MPs 70%. The overall high
rates of return derive from the extremely low costs of the MPs, only $6000 on average, in turn
largely generated by the low imported value of villager's labor. The reason for the perhaps
counterintuitive result, that the more commercial projects have the lowest rate of return, may be
that revenue-earning MPs are exposed to healthy competition in a free market economy, while
infrastructure in all cases is provided in something like a natural monopoly situation, where
without the project MP, none of the associated service (e.g., decent road access to the village) is
enjoyed in the village area at all.

This may explain why the highest returns are derived from roads, bridges, and irrigation and
drainage systems, as opposed to say bakeries and repair shops. But for all types of investment,
the range of individual returns is extremely wide, from projects with 6%, zero, or even negative
returns, to many over 100%, which implies that the detailed and quite complex selection process
itself is a very important element, and was not overdone, or a luxury.         Several public bath
houses failed economically, largely because unforeseen problems or complexities arose in
constructing the water supply, adding excessively to both the cost and the time of development
(speed in implementation is another factor behind the enormously high average rates of return).
On the other hand, some fairly inexpensive drainage works not only markedly improved
agriculture for a village (sometimes providing two crops per year instead of one), but also
completely changed living conditions, allowing very solid new homes to be built on land which
was formerly total waste. The project provided many schools with nothing more than a new tile
roof, where the credit paid for the tiles, while the men of the village actually made the new roof,
often in one day which was something of a festival in the village; it emerges that the main cause
of deterioration of plaster and brick schoolhouses, is failing roofs, which allow snow and rain to
pour into such buildings, and ruin everything inside, aside from making schooling impossible.
Thus the villages learned to pinpoint the precise expenditure which would make all the
difference to their community.        Indeed, the project became famous for the quality of the
windows provided in most building MPs - another example of focusing on critical items instead
of wasting money on non-essentials.         In general, it is clear that aside from important and
gratifying unmeasurable governance and social benefits, the project generated enormous
economic returns.

A final measure of project efficiency may be the proportion of overhead or administrative costs
in total project costs. This was taken in Intermediate Indicator 11 (on pg. vi of this report) to be
the ratio of ARIS operating expenses to expenditures on village investments and capacity
building. Here ARIS reports the ratio to be 6.7% in the early year of 2004, 6.2% in 2005,
                                                  16

spiking upwards to 13.7% in 2006 when the number of CDSOs had to be doubled to handle the
doubling of the geographic coverage of the project, and three additional oblast offices
established, before reverting to 6.2% in 2007. For the first quarter of 2008, ARIS reported a
slight rise to 6.3%. As a check using a somewhat different set of data, this ICR has reviewed
audited project accounts, and found that for all of 2006 "project management" expenditures
(including building renovations) amounted to 8.9% of those on the two substantive categories,
with a cumulative sum of 10.3% over the project life till end-2006. The same calculations for
the third quarter 2007 yielded a very frugal 4.8% for the quarter, and 8.6% cumulative. These
results may be compared with the very successful Albania Community Works project which
showed a 9-11% ratio over the preparation/appraisal period, ending with 6.5 % in its last full
year (2001 - see ICR, pg. 9). The Albanian Development Fund had advantages over ARIS of
several years of project activity before the startup of the referred project, and subprojects
averaging $70,000 in value, more than an order of magnitude larger than ARIS, which should
reduce overhead ratios. Again, ARIS' performance in this project appears exemplary.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Highly Satisfactory
While ratings of projects are always matters of judgment, this would seem to be an unusually
clear case of a highly satisfactory outcome.       On the most objective quantitative measures
possible, the project produced such extraordinary economic returns to the investment costs
incurred, that even massive discounting could not change the outcome. In process terms, the
project introduced more widespread concrete participation and voice, of ordinary poor rural
citizens, than any other effort in the history of Kyrgyzstan - indeed of Central Asia. It created
the most respected and admired agency in the country, one widely said to be free of corruption.
Specialized expert reviewers, in fields such as financial management and procurement, have
given ARIS and the project their highest ratings. It achieved or exceeded all its quantitatively
measurable goals - ahead of schedule, indeed covering the whole country when it was designed
for half. It raised technical standards for all manner of rural infrastructure - at much less cost
than inferior work by other agencies. However, with the discovery by the VIP-2 Mid-Term
Review mission of some instances of very poor construction (see page 13), the project team
proposed (and ARIS accepted) allocation of US$ 1 million of currently proposed additional
financing for VIP-2 specifically to technically audit the entire combined portfolio of VIP micro-
projects and to retrofit any which exhibit serious deficiencies. Raising such an issue and
working effectively to resolve it are considered very good practice.

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
There was a significant decline of almost 14 percent in rural poverty rates observed in
Kyrgyzstan in the period 2004-2007.          While it is difficult to apportion causality of a
macroeconomic trend like that, to a relatively small rural mobilization, works, and small
enterprise program like ARIS, it seems clear that the project played some role in this
development. Project design and implementation both aimed to include poor, women and
vulnerable people in rural areas. Through focus group discussions with these segments of village
population and with youth, it made efforts to include them in the process and in the sharing of
benefits.   Originally, ARIS had no gender focused experts, but later in implementation it
recruited gender specialists in all seven oblasts who sought to ensure higher engagement by
                                                 17

women in all aspects of the micro-project cycle and investment decision making. This especially
helped to reach and mobilize women otherwise excluded in some specific areas of the country,
where women traditionally have limited exposure to village public activities.

About 36% of all village mobilizers, 30% of VIC members, and 23% of LIC members were
women.     By way of comparison, the number of women elected in aiyl keneshes in 2004 was
under 15%. Roughly a third of participants in village meetings determining priorities were
women, with modest increases over the course of the project. ARIS reports that over 1,500
women were provided with income-generating activities through micro-projects.

Through participatory decision-making and execution of MPs at the community level,
communities themselves have started to think about inclusion of as many members as possible.
Income generating micro-projects were geared to support poor through seed grants to start small
scale business, get jobs in these ventures or to have access to products with discounts.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

     Community contributions (including labor) amounted to US$ 5.75 million, or
       double the expected US$ 2.88 million.              It was expected that the community
       contribution would cover no more than the 25% required by the project. However, some
       communities contributed over 80% to the micro projects. This allowed for more total
       investment in infrastructure improvement.
     Expanded Project coverage. Enthusiasm and real support to the Project by community
       members and local governments (aiyl okmotu, aiyl kenesh) allowed expanding the
       coverage of AKO from originally intended 200 to 475 (100% of the country).
     High interest of other donors to contribute to the Project: DFID financed
       US$ 1 million and committed to co finance VIP-2; KfW funded US$ 8 million for the
       KfW-VIP 1 and 2, the Asian Development Bank through the Japan Fund for Poverty
       Reduction contributed US$1 million for the Rural Livelihood Development Project
       implemented by ARIS in Chui and Osh regions.
     Management Information System.                  The project has developed an effective
       Management Information System used not only by VIP but all projects implemented by
       ARIS. It is also being adopted by various government structures at the local and central
       level, as well as by some donor funded projects in the country.
     Social Capital. The Project has contributed to a massive increase in supply of highly
       skilled community mobilization and micro project management specialists at aiyl kenesh
       level.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
This is a difficult aspect to rate. The project was totally successful in accomplishing what it
explicitly set out to do.    It provided high-priority (in the minds of the prime beneficiaries)
village infrastructure on a large scale to a countryside which had mainly witnessed loss of assets
over many years. These constructions are mainly well-designed and built, and will generally
provide expected benefits for at least as long as projected. VIP trained tens of thousands of
citizens in useful skills, and entrusted them with program decision-making. In these areas, the
excellent and economical outcomes achieved are secure.            But perhaps due to continuing
                                                 18

governance problems at a higher level, the processes and approaches of the project have only
sporadically been transferred to the normal programming, budgeting, and implementation of
rural governmental activities, with the result that ARIS activities are still the exception, not the
rule in rural Kyrgyzstan.     A third project in the VIP series might provide the possibility of
making this critical transfer, but this will be neither automatic nor easy.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance


5.1. Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
Project preparation was highly professional, idealistically motivated, yet practical, and thus
ensured a strong analytical base enabling common citizens to prioritize rural sector interventions,
and the team to design the project components. An important element in excellent quality at
entry was the refusal of the project team to be rushed; the decision to use JSDF funds to actually
design and implement a pilot phase before Bank Board approval, was key. At the time, the team
had to resist management pressure to short-circuit this process. The completion of the pilot
phase was crucial to the rapid and successful start-up of the project.

(b)Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The total number of supervision missions amounted to 6 plus numerous shorter follow-up visits.
The different components were supervised with appropriate frequency throughout the life of the
project. The project had two task team leaders in the six years between identification and
completion, one for about five of those years, an unusual instance of continuity nowadays. This,
plus the seriousness of purpose of the original Bank/ARIS counterpart team, enabled an unusual
degree of trust between the principals, which obviously helped the project (and ARIS) develop.
One point of weakness would be the lack of an engineer on supervision missions until the VIP-2
Mid-Term Review mission, which did find some engineering quality issues in some MPs, and
devised a program to rectify them. This should have been done sooner.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The IDA team provided an overall solid project design, a real tryout of project design in a pilot
phase, thorough supervision and ensured, to the extent possible, client commitment by being
responsive to client and stakeholder needs and feedback. More engineering input in supervision
would probably have been useful.

5.2. Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Through 2005, both the project and the government closely shared a decentralization agenda
which greatly helped the project to accelerate its coverage and impact. Even then Government
was not quick to provide meaningful financial contributions, or to try to transfer project
mechanisms to regular rural administration - but this might have been normal, in the early years

                                                   19

of a new type of program. Since 2005, however, Government policy has turned sharply toward
centralized administration, and delays in Government funding and replication have become more
glaring. True impact of a program like this would require an effort by government to replicate
its approaches in its own funded programs. Still, overall, Government has been supportive of the
VIP program, and it did allocate US$1 million equivalent to cofinance the VIP-2 project. Thus
its performance merits a moderately satisfactory rating.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Sections 2.2, 3.3, and 3.4 above make it rather clear that ARIS' performance in this project must
be rated highly satisfactory. A small number of poorly implemented village works, in a portfolio
of thousands is a feature of any community works program in any poor countryside worldwide ­
though the move by the IDA team and ARIS to shore up competence and review in this area is
excellent. Among other high marks for performance, ARIS' financial management has been
rated highly satisfactory by IDA specialists for the past two years.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Borrower performance in this operation was largely the performance of ARIS. However, oblast
governors and raion hakims were supportive of activities in their jurisdictions, and central
government agencies quite helpful. The overall performance was thus satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

Small can be (beautifully) efficient. Micro project investments allow for a more manageable,
adjustable and relatively transparent implementation process. In a context of overall limited
institutional capacity, these mechanisms can potentially magnify a project's development impact.
The VIP experience has shown that communities can implement micro projects much more
efficiently than local administrations in terms of speed and costs. The model may perhaps be
adapted to address anything from municipal infrastructure to environmental type projects like
solid waste collection and mudflow protection, although as group sizes get larger care must be
taken to ensure that the bounds of mutual trust and intimate knowledge of people and conditions
are not exceeded.

Communities can mobilize substantial internal resources.              Community contributions
amounted to almost double the expected amount, thus indicating that communities can make
substantial own contributions given that they are involved during the whole implementation
process from the identification of priorities, to implementation and monitoring.       In recent
periods, community contributions have declined somewhat, as inflation has eaten away at
villagers' purchasing power, and general economic conditions have deteriorated. Still, villagers
surpass the appraisal expectations.

Long term involvement of communities in the Project empowers people and ensures
inclusion.     Annually repetitive nature of the investments within four years empowers
communities, strengthens their capacity through learning by doing, and encourages the poor and
vulnerable to participate in the VIP processes. Indeed, the BIA found increased participation by
such people in the later years of village participation.
                                                  20

One key to creating high quality organizations in a developing country context is successful
resistance to nepotism and other forms of favoritism in personnel selection and
management.        This sets the tone for open and honest administration and a stress on good
governance across the board. The Bank may need to strongly support good project directors in
the effort to set and meet such standards.

Perhaps the two main areas for increased attention by ARIS management, learned from
experience thus far, are:
     even more emphasis on including poor and vulnerable people in decision-making through
       special training and outreach work; and
     more technical (e.g. engineering) input, starting with advising village committees during
       the selection process, through design, supervision of construction, and acceptance of
       works and goods.

Scaling Up. In the longer term, the main thrust toward sustainability, in the broader sense, will
have to come from a transfer of not just works, but also participatory processes including micro-
project selection, transparent procurement and payment of contractors, and close coordination
with villagers to elicit in-kind and cash contributions, from VIP and ARIS to the regular organs
of local government, starting with AOs. Indeed, the government may wish to consider sustaining
the LICs, VICs and other participatory institutional creations of VIP specifically to implement
the whole gamut of local government programs. Only then will the ultimate goal of ARIS have
been reached.

This annex discusses in detail the outcomes and outputs for each component, as well as the
"outputs" of the project management.

Capacity Building and Empowerment ­ detailed outcome discussion

Capacity Building and Empowerment Component had two major aims.                The first was to
strengthen communities with knowledge and skills required for the implementation of VIP.
Second aim was to strengthen newly established community based organizations to make them
capable of undertaking initiatives, making decisions and implement activities in own area
development. There were 475 Local Investment Committees established in all AKO around the
country. ARIS estimates more than 7,500 people being their members. These LICs are formed
on the basis of 1,661 Village Investment Committees which in turn have more than 10,600
members. There were more than 4,600 groups implementing various micro projects. In order to
empower these groups, ARIS conducted about 4,000 training and workshops with about 77,000
people participating in them.      Training topics for communities covered issues of social
mobilization, needs assessment and development of vision and strategic plan for the area,
preparation of micro projects, their implementation and maintenance, procurement and
disbursement procedures, participatory monitoring and evaluation. Specific training on business
planning and marketing was conducted for those who were interested to start small scale
business. The Project issued various methodological materials and handbooks for trainers and
for community members. Among those are excellent "Best Practice" manuals for both social
and infrastructure micro-projects, and for income-generating micro-projects. Another manual for
economic analysis of micro-projects is also first class.

One of the key outputs of the Project is increased confidence of community members in their
role in local area development, in possibility of attracting not only external, but also internal
resources (mobilization of people using their cash and labor contributions) for addressing local
priority needs. The other important output is generating and strengthening cadre of local leaders
among village mobilizers, representatives of LICs, VICs and MPGs who became change agents
in their areas and were supported by communities and elected to local ayil and raion keneshes,
recruited to ayil okmotu and raion administration staff.

Village Investments ­ Detailed Outcome Discussion

The project successfully completed 4 344 micro projects out of 4 674 approved by communities
(93%). The remaining micro projects are due for completion by the end of 2008 under the VIP
2.   IDA disbursements for this component amounted to US$ 12.4 million.                                Communities
provided co-financing of about US$ 5.75 million against intended US$ 2.88 million. Micro
projects could be broadly classified by types as income-generating ­ 26.7% and social and
economic infrastructure ­ 73.3% (See more details in Table 1 below). Schools (941 MPs) and
sewing workshops (224 MPs) were the types most commonly supported and implemented by the
communities.

Main outputs of micro-projects include the following: (i) villagers received access to 4 344
social, economic and marketing infrastructure services. This includes access to pure drinking
water, increased area of arable lands due to drainage improvements and renovation of irrigation
systems. Children enjoy improved conditions of schools and kindergartens (repair of heating,
reproofing and etc.). Installation of transformer substations, wiring and similar projects made
houses lighter and warmer. The estimated number of beneficiaries is 5.7 million5; (ii). 4 662


5Villagers may be beneficiaries of one or several micro projects.

                                                               24

work places were created in rural areas, thus villagers' income increased. According to the
Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA), over the period of last four years the number of
beneficiaries in the 1-4 grades reduced by 24.1% in the new cohort and by 34.9% in the old
cohort in the wellness grading system of 10 points (1- very poor and 10- very rich), while the
number of beneficiaries upgrading themselves to the 5-8 grades increased by 23.6% and 32.5%
accordingly; (iii) leaders of micro project groups learned to develop micro project proposals and
manage micro projects as well as to keep financial reporting and to carry out procurement in line
with the World Bank procedures; (iv) leaders of micro project groups learned how to carry out
participatory monitoring and evaluation of micro projects; (v) capacity of community members
was strengthened: more then 20 thousand people can now develop business plans on their own
now.


In addition, the BIA has identified the following findings:

    According to most of the respondents (44% of the total number of the respondents in all
       target groups and 51% of the respondents in the old cohort), the most significant benefit
       derived from ARIS micro projects is "the improved access to essential services", i.e.
       renovation of schools, FAPs, roads, water supply lines, etc. 12% of the respondents
       indicated increase in employment during the micro project implementation, while 9%
       stressed the improved quality of the service provision.

    About 70% of the respondents said that micro projects implemented under the VIP were
       successful. Most of the other respondents had normal complaints about time taken, cost
       or quality standards.

    Currently, according to 84.6% of the respondents in the old cohort, most facilities
       constructed or renovated under the VIP are in good condition and used by the population.

    On the whole, the Project managed to produce profound impact on the life of villages.
       The longer the Project works in the village, the greater impact it renders. For instance,
       people mentality in villages of old cohort is gradually changing; the respondents noted
       that "people have become friendlier, united and proactive". Another important fact is
       that, according to experts, the VIP managed to generate 1.7-4.4 new jobs per micro
       project.

    Although the Project produced direct impact on the economic status of the communities
       (rural infrastructure), the major impact of the Project is in training provision and support
       to communities' economic initiatives, which would eventually lead to real economic
       growth.

US$ 18.15 million were disbursed to finance micro          income generating micro-projects, making on

                                                         The Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA) provides
                                                           data on beneficiaries' perception in terms of their

                                                           the new cohort and by 34.9% in the old cohort,

                                                           financially unviable micro projects (mainly social
                                                           infrastructure for which it is difficult to estimate

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


A range of benefits have been generated by the project. Skills for strategic planning, micro-
project preparation and implementation, and group business development have provided a strong
foundation for further investment and productivity in participating communities. Upgraded
knowledge among aiyl okmotus in financial management, coupled with improved mechanisms
for accountability and transparency have contributed to changing expectations about the role of
local government.        A growing cadre of specialists, including members of beneficiary
communities, with appropriate skills in social mobilization has enabled the participating
communities to influence their own development. All these are valuable, though intangible,
assets that are crucial for long-tern economic productivity of individuals and enterprises. They
have helped empower communities to build social capital, to improve local governance, and to
work generally more effectively to address their priority needs.

However, quantification of these benefits is impractical, and therefore, as appropriate for a
project of this type, there was no attempt to compute an overall economic rate of return at Project
Appraisal. Instead, the analysis was carried out at the micro-project level. Implemented mini-
projects have generated direct benefits to the participating communities, in terms of increased
incomes, employment opportunities and reduced costs (time and O&M). In line with this
approach as well as with the purpose of a comparison of the foreseen at appraisal returns with the
actual ones, the analysis mainly focuses on the financial viability of the typical micro-projects
(MPs) implemented under the Village Investments component. The analysis is primarily based
on the post-financial appraisal of 220 MPs that was undertaken during 2005-2007 by ARIS as
well as the field visits to participating communities.

All 220 MPs were thoroughly reviewed, and corrections were made where necessary. Out of
220 MPs appraised by ARIS, 35 MPs were eliminated due to low data reliability, leaving 185
MPs assessed by this analysis. A summary of typical MPs together with their financial returns is
presented in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, while a full list of all analyzed MPs could be found in the project
file. The financial (nominal) opportunity cost of capital of 15% is used in this analysis to assess
the viability and robustness of investments6.




6 At Project Appraisal the financial (nominal) opportunity cost of capital was assumed to be 12%.
However, the financial post evaluation lifted it to 15% representing the prevailing deposit rate in Kyrgyz
Som.

Summary:

The financial post evaluation demonstrated that communities usually choose investments that are
suitable to local priorities and circumstances and therefore, overall, achieve high returns. Indeed,
the substantial majority of representative examples are viable and provide a positive financial

return. However, there are cases of mini-projects with negative Net Present Values (NPV) and
low Internal Rates of Return (IRR) including some income-generating MPs for which financial
viability is an obvious criterion of success.

Overall, a sample of 185 micro-projects indicates high financial viability and/or high social
impact of micro-projects.        Taken as a whole, the weighted average IRR on economic
infrastructure is 186%, on sanitary and ecological infrastructure is 131%, and on social
infrastructure is 90% and on income-generating micro-projects 70%. Roads, bridges, irrigation
and drainage systems seem to generate the highest returns. Revenue earning MPs are exposed to
healthy competition in a free market economy, while infrastructure in all cases is provided in
something like a local natural monopoly situation, where without the project MP, none of the
associated service is enjoyed in the village area at all. This may explain the higher average rates
of return of the infrastructure investments.

However, internal rates of return on investments are very project and location-specific and vary
significantly. Economic infrastructure mini-projects show financial rates of return ranging from
4% to over 100%. Some drinking water, power supply and telecommunication mini-projects
show negative NPV and low IRRs.              However, it should be noted that in these cases
quantification of the benefits was not sufficient. The sanitary and ecological infrastructure mini-
projects show IRRs ranging from 11% to over 100%. Some public bath houses and rubbish
removal mini-projects don't show positive financial returns. The social infrastructure mini-
projects have IRRs between 6% and 124%, although some information centers, clubs and sports
facilities rate considerably lower or even negative, but have very high social benefits which were
impossible to quantify reliably for the return analysis. Income-generating mini-projects have
IRRs ranging from 6% to over 100%. Some income-generating mini-projects are financially
unsustainable; some even don't cover recurrent costs (mainly sewing workshops, flour mills and
machinery repair). A total number of 57 mini-projects (or about 30% of the analyzed MPs) are
found to be financially unviable.

Carrying out an economic/financial appraisal of mini-projects is a complicated task due to lack
of information especially for social and environmental MPs as well as for income-generating
MPs when the book keeping is not a widespread practice among beneficiaries. The appraisal
also requires special knowledge and skills and involves certain costs (continuous availability of
skilled staff at HQ and local level and intensive field visits). Nevertheless, there is a clear
understanding among all stakeholders that mini-projects should be financially viable, although
this factor is considered less important while applying a CDD approach and solving
communities' priorities.

Recommendations:

1)      It is very important to raise awareness of the beneficiaries about the importance of
        performing financial analysis of mini-projects, which can be done during Social
        Mobilization training, in particular while preparing strategic plans.      The awareness
        should be built around the understanding that the financial viability appraisal allows for
        consideration of various options for any investment, either in terms of prioritization,
        sequence, objectives or solutions.



                                                 29

2)      In view of finding a balance between usefulness and costs, the financial appraisal should
        be undertaken prior to implementation only for the economic (productive) infrastructure
        MPs due to their higher costs and wider impact. The objective of such an appraisal is to
        present its findings to communities for their deliberation while making investment
        decisions (the principle of full information disclosure for the educated decision making).

3)      The financial appraisal is not recommended for social MPs due to complexity, although
        the social mini-projects which generate income (like public saunas, toilets, information
        centers, etc.) should be treated as economic infrastructure mini-projects.

4)      The requirement of presenting a small business plan (including cash flow calculations)
        for income-generating mini-projects8 is considered sufficient for the selection and
        investment decision process. However, monitoring of such mini-projects needs to be
        strengthened, in terms of fulfilling by MPGs any social obligations and projected benefits
        in particular for employment creation. To this extent, the information boards either at the
        AO or LIC offices should play a greater dissemination role. Moreover, special attention
        should be paid to the financially unsustainable income-generating mini projects. ARIS
        needs to develop a procedure when a business advice could be provided to MPGs on how
        to improve a mini-project's performance, for example by creation of an advisory group
        on a call basis.

5)      ARIS should continue mini-projects' post financial appraisal (on a sample basis) of its
        ongoing operation (VIP2), the finding of which should be widely distributed among
        TICs, VICs, CDSOs and ARIS local specialists.

6)      A special point should be made of building book-keeping capacity in income-generating
        project groups, as a preparation for successful commercial activity.




8Cash flow analysis for income-generating MPs is not the same as an investment financial
viability appraisal though some of the elements usually used for the former will normally be used
for appraisal.

                            Annex 5: Beneficiary Impact Assessment


ARIS conducted two major beneficiary surveys: a baseline survey in 2005 and impact
assessment survey in 2007. There were other intermediary surveys conducted on training
activities, social mobilization and other specific Project issues. The survey of 2005 covered 14
AKO and was aimed at collecting data and information on employment, income, and social and
economic infrastructure. However, results of this survey were not used for follow up monitoring
and impact assessment.

Large scale impact assessment was conducted by the consortium of Kyrgyz research NGOs
commissioned by the DFID at the end of 2007, at the completion stage of VIP-1. There were
2,600 respondents included in the survey and about 1,000 participants of a qualitative study. The
survey and study covered 28 AKO, including 14 selected randomly out of oldest cohort of AKO
(those which entered VIP first) and 14 of the newest cohort of AKO. The qualitative study
included semi structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) with experts
(stakeholders involved in VIP implementation, such as members of MPGs, VICs, LICs, AO,
AK) and vulnerable segments of rural population (this segment included poor, youth, women and
old people).

The major objective of this study was to assess the impact of VIP on people's knowledge and
skills, their outlook, and on their activities. The results of this survey confirm other general
conclusions on VIP impacts.

VIP made a big impact on life of rural people, especially through creating new and
rehabilitating existing social infrastructure. People noted that with this project access to
drinking and irrigation water, health and educational services increased.

VIP empowered people with new knowledge and skills. Survey results confirmed that almost
every fifth person in the villages went through ARIS training. The knowledge and skills
provided by VIP empowered people not only in the defining a vision and strategy for the
development of their community but also in other aspects of their lives, including in
development of their businesses. More than 80% of interviewed appreciated these training
opportunities and almost 20% of those interviewed used these skills to obtain grants, credits or in
opening a new business outside of VIP.

VIP increased people's mobilization to address community needs and problems. Survey
results showed that people think that with implementation of VIP, the number of villagers who
are not interested and not involved in community affairs decreased by six times. The sense of
responsibility and commitment of people towards their own communities have grown up and
especially this was true in regards to villagers which joined VIP in its first years.

VIP supported decentralization at the local level. VIP enhanced partnership between local
government bodies and population. AO and AK learnt new methods of planning and developing
strategies for their areas, of citizens' involvement in decision making. Data shows that VIP


                                                 33

strengthened trust of people to their government more than three times in comparison to the level
of trust before the project.

VIP included poor in the processes. The study showed that although poor and women are
reluctant to participate actively in community based activities, the rate of their involvement
grows with the second and third year of project implementation in the AKO. Indeed, this may be
a prime argument for extending the program.

                    Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


The ICR mission organized a one day stakeholders' workshop, jointly with the ARIS, in Bishkek
on October 20, 2008. Key VIP stakeholders were represented by community members (LICs,
MPGs, VICs, PMEG, village mobilizers), rural NGOs, local and central government, donor and
development organizations. ARIS staff from the raions, regions and central office were also
present at the workshop.

The objectives of this workshop were i) to assess level of satisfaction of major stakeholders with
the implementation and results of the VIP ­ I, ii) to jointly review lessons learnt from the Project
and how they are being used; and iii) to develop recommendations for follow up or any other
CDD activities in the country.

Stakeholders' satisfaction. The workshop's participants confirmed that the Capacity Building
and Empowerment Component of the VIP-2 continues to support rural communities through
social mobilization, strategic planning, training, introducing and strengthening good governance
approaches in all VIP processes. The importance of social mobilization activities is well
understood by all actors, and it is evident that it affects the quality of strategic planning, selection
of micro projects as well as their implementation. A social mobilization lays the foundation for
the implementation of the Village Investment Project 2 in newly covered as well as in continuing
villages. (While all AKOs were eventually included in VIP-1, there was neither time nor money
enough to include all the natural villages which constitute the AKOs). In newly covered
villages, social mobilization is conducted in a full scope while in villages which have been in the
VIP for more than a year, the social mobilization process is shorter in time and more focused on
preparation and selection of micro projects. Preparation and implementation of micro projects
was a long and difficult process for communities, especially during the first year of the Project.
Difficulties related to the lack of special technical expertise in the villages and even raion
centers, mean they need to go through lengthy and often painful process of agreeing technical
designs with various relevant state agencies. Beyond this weakness, there is an overall lack of
experience in communities on formulation of their needs and ways of addressing them. The
Project's design with limited disbursement per year, as well as limited timeframe also caused
some problems in effective completion of the MPs. There are also some issues which need to be
addressed to avoid overlap of functions and documents, such as development of strategic plans
by AO and by LICs, Village Profile of VIP and Passport of the AO.

Lessons Learnt and Recommendations:

Information dissemination. To include more people into the social mobilization, it should be
preceded by general awareness on the VIP approaches via mass media, such as newspaper
articles, TV programs. A social mobilization process consists of a number of sequential activities.
In starting social mobilization, ARIS and its CDSOs heavily rely on the heads of the aiyl okmotu
and on local elite (educated, better off people, with some degree of informal power in
community). While this reliance ensures commitment from the local self government bodies and
support from informal leaders, it also might lead in some cases to elite capturing. To avoid or at

                                                  35

least minimize elite capturing, ARIS might think about expansion of its general awareness
program, which would precede the mobilization process through dissemination of information to
all layers of population. This public awareness program would spread information on ARIS and
VIP objectives, approaches and processes. It might be useful to produce a short film on ARIS
activities and principles to show it on national and local TV channels. This would not only
inform about ARIS and its activities, but also spread information about VIP approaches among
the population.

There is also a need to review some of the employed governance mechanisms such as
informational boards which are often neglected, not regularly updated, or have little information
displayed on them relevant to VIP. There were a few options discussed during the stakeholders'
workshop, such as disclosure of information on micro projects and on TIC's decisions on the
informational boards in aiyl okmotu, or even by publishing reports in local newspapers. This
especially concerns income generating micro projects, when displaying of information on their
purposes, beneficiaries and on commitment of such MPGs to serve community and its vulnerable
members could provide additional protection from elite capturing and misuse of funds.

     Inclusion of vulnerable layers of population. Social mobilization process should be
        continued within VIP 2 every year in every participating AKO as prescribed in OM but
        need to try other methods as well. For example, the pilot experience with the use of
        Photo Voice methodology through reflecting problems and needs of women and children
        introduced by UNICEF Kyrgyzstan was well accepted and allowed to mobilize
        community in addressing problems with the VIP and in some cases own resources. (Poor
        women were trained in use of photo cameras to take photos of their daily life and of what
        bothers them. Through these photos they were able to focus on their problems, prioritize
        them and make decisions on how to address them). There is a need to try more of such
        innovative and cost efficient technologies in social mobilization of marginalized groups.

        There is a need to continue to employ participatory methods of broad involvement, such
        as village meetings as well as door-to-door awareness visits by village mobilizers. It is
        recognized by all that meetings with broad participation could be one of the most
        effective means of transparency and accountability. It is not recommended to reduce
        number and scope of these meetings and door-to-door visits within the VIP 2.

        Project's design with annual repetitiveness in selection and implementation of micro
        projects gives better chance to poor and vulnerable to get involved in the Project. Focus
        group discussions with poor and vulnerable, women and youth are important in including
        these layers of population in the Project and these groups of villagers tend to be more
        involved in the VIP usually after second year when they accumulate trust in these
        initiatives, get more self confidence that there is a role for them in the process as well,
        and see positive outcomes of earlier initiatives under the VIP. The possibility might be
        explored to have mixed groups of women and youth to see if they can merge efforts in
        lobbying their interests. The Project might explore other means of empowering these
        groups of people in influencing decision making at the VIC and LIC level.

     Effectiveness of social mobilization. It is recommended to pay more attention to the
        selection by the community of village mobilizers. These people should be mature, well
        respected members of community who are willing and able to help in mobilization on a

                                                36

volunteer basis. The major incentive for such people should be not only to serve their
community but also to gain new knowledge and skills. Thus it is recommended to have
more training programs for advanced and motivated village mobilizers within the VIP-2.

Strategic planning conducted within the social mobilization process of the VIP-2 in some
parts duplicates development of social and economic plans of the AKOs (Aiyl kenesh
okrug) by the aiyl okmotus. It is recommended to review Village Profile within VIP-2
and to include there data available in Passport of the AO, do not update annually
statistical data in the Village Profile, widen feedback from all focus groups, including
with youth and women on their needs and priorities.

Regional and oblast offices of ARIS have been trying different effective approaches to
social mobilization, such as work in teams, providing mutual support and assistance by
CDSOs to each other. ARIS might assess its mode of social mobilization campaign and
come up with suggestions on increasing effectiveness of the process.

 Lessons learnt and further development of the Capacity Building Program.            ARIS
conducts a capacity building program for members of community institutions, local self
government bodies, as well as for its staff. This program was of very good quality, well
appreciated by all and reaches its beneficiaries. However, to respond to growing needs of
these beneficiaries and the project itself, and to reach more and more people with
capacity building initiatives and informational materials, the workshop's participants
recommended to conduct a sample capacity building need assessment in a randomly
selected aiyl okmotu in order to review the capacity building program, including its topics
and methods of delivery. This capacity building program needs to stay within VIP - 2
objectives and only assist to achieve better its development objectives. This could be
done by ARIS M&E department.

To involve more marginalized groups and ethnic minorities, it was recommended that all
training and informational materials are issued not only in Russian, but also in Kyrgyz
and Uzbek languages. More efforts could be done in making these materials easier to be
understood and absorbed by villagers.

One of the most effective capacity building tools of the VIP-2 was community exchange
visits. These visits need to be continued and it would be beneficial to have TV programs
on this experience for dissemination of best practices and lessons learnt.

Some community members actively participating in VICs, LICs and other community
based institutions are already used by neighboring communities or groups for technical
advice. It is recommended to promote such experience and develop a database of strong
TIC, VIC, and MPG leaders capable to provide advice to the neighboring areas. It is
especially needed in cases when new MPG leaders could be trained by already
experienced MPG leaders in the same village.          In general, most advanced village
mobilizers, TIC, VIC, MPG members could be used as agents for social mobilization in
these communities in future activities.

All ARIS experts, including CDSOs, oblast, regional and national level staff need
exposure to social mobilization practices in other similar initiatives in Kyrgyzstan and

                                         37

 abroad. It is recommended that ARIS starts looking for various similar and maybe more
 advanced initiatives globally in order to learn from their experience.

 ARIS might think how to involve more representatives of local self government bodies
 for the capacity building program. In a need assessment for capacity building program
 within VIP 2 it might be interesting to explore the possibility of training of best
 performing aiyl okmotus on economic and marketing analysis.

 Implementation of investments.       The workshop participants discussed at length the
 process of preparation, selection and implementation of MPs. Major lessons learnt and
 recommendations concerned time frames for implementation of large infrastructure micro
 projects and need for more technical support to communities in selecting technical
 solutions and in supervising works. In debating the selection processes and exclusion of
 poor and vulnerable people in some AKO from the decision making, participants came to
 the conclusion that the current process is fair and adequate and needs to be maintained.
 However, to include the poor and vulnerable, ARIS needs to find ways of reaching them
 through special training and other outreach activities to make sure that their needs are
 well formulated and expressed.

 Assessment of micro projects showed that they are sometimes financially not viable.
 Workshop participants agreed that income generating and economic micro projects need
 to have some basic economic analysis before decisions on them are made to reduce risk
 of unsustainable and unviable investments.

 Communities also faced difficulties in maintenance of the micro projects due to unclear
 ownership of the created or improved assets. The Operational Manual needs to be
 revised in defining criteria of micro projects with regards to ownership status as well as
 general definition of types of micro projects to avoid confusion and ambiguity.

 Types of micro projects. There were debates on the income generating MPs among
 workshop participants. Although some people thought that these MPs should not be a
 part of the VIP, the majority agreed that they address issues of poverty in rural areas by
 supporting poor people through grants and through subsidized services and/or products.
 It was agreed that their size should be increased to cover inflation of costs.

 All participants agreed that types of MPs in all areas are very similar and focus primarily
 on social infrastructure. The rather limited range of MPs was explained by general desire
 of communities to have MPs which benefits could be shared among many, such as
 schools, clinics. Other reasons mentioned were the lack of information in rural areas
 about possible innovative initiatives, and the high cost of innovative technologies.

 Quality of MPs. It was agreed by all that a good social mobilization process, adequate
 training and good support from the local self government bodies are important factors of
 the quality of the micro projects. Participants agreed that some MPs are of poor quality.
 The lessons learnt were that planning of works and budget should be done more carefully
with consideration of projected inflation; complex works should be avoided in remote
areas where there is not enough technical expertise and machinery; there should be
careful consideration given to which works could be undertaken by the community and

                                          38

 which need to be performed by specialized experts; there could be better results if there
 were funds available for preparation of technically complex MPs.

 VIP community based organizations and institutions. VIP has created and nourished
CBOs new to the country in scope, nature and mission. In some early cases there may
have been elite capture of some micro projects, but with subsequent years of execution
this happened much less. The biggest concerns raised at the workshop were insufficient
involvement of local governments and their support to the VIP, and further sustainability
of these CBOs in development of their village areas.

                             Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR


This Annex summarizes those sections of the Borrower's Implementation Completion Report
which cover topics on which the Bank ICR gives relatively little information, or possibly with
different emphases.

1.      Microproject financing and communities' contributions.              The requirement for
community contribution according to Project procedures is 25%.             However, community
contributions were as high as 87% in some cases. This became possible as a result of effectively
conducted social mobilization and communities' commitment. While in 2004, communities
managed to collect as a contribution 4.3 million KGS$, in 2007 this sum amounted to 101.1
million KGS.       As of the end of 2007, cumulative community contributions for village
infrastructure totaled 198.5 million KGS. An analysis of these contributions indicates that over 4
years of VIP-1 implementation community contributions averaged to 47.2% which is 1.8 times
higher than the Project requirement. The highest community contributions were registered in
Batken oblast - 87.6%, Naryn oblast - 67.0%, Jalalabat oblast - 63%. The highest contribution in
cash was registered in Osh oblast - 16.2% which was substantially higher than the required
minimum of 3.75%. Communities' high contributions vividly demonstrate the communities'
interest, commitment, and eagerness to mobilize their internal resources for the microprojects
related to their vital needs.

Community contributions and collaboration of our Local Investment Committees (LICs) and
Village Investment Committees (VICs) with other donor organizations has to been notable. For
instance, Uchkorgon Aiyl Okmotu (AO), Batken oblast allocated 77,000 KGS in-kind for
repairing of kindergarten "Zebo", private entrepreneur M. Abdrazakov has contributed 12,500
KGS in cash and in-kind for implementation of microproject. Karadobo AO allocated 5000
KGS for repair of the polyclinic in Valakish village. In Leilek raion, community members of
Jakatal and Toguzbulak village established successful contact with UNIFEM and managed to
receive grant funds to purchase medical equipment for a rural medical clinic (First Aid Point
(FAP). Toguzbulak also obtained US$ 7,600 from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) to
equip the same FAP with solar power panels.

2.      Veterinary services. 61 microprojects related to veterinary services were implemented
under VIP 1.

3.      "Employment and income generating microprojects. One of the main objectives of
the Project was to increase the income level of rural residents by increasing the employment rate
in rural areas. Employment in rural areas was identified in focus groups as one of the most
vexing issues in rural areas. Over the period from 2004 to 2007, 4662 jobs were created through
the Project. Most of these jobs were created through income generating microprojects. An
average 2.6 jobs were created per one income generating microproject created, whereas social
MPs created only 0.4 jobs.         Sewing shops are the most supported income generating
microprojects by communities (224 MPs) and created 968 jobs for women. 329 jobs were
created through joiner's (carpentry) shop MPs. 230 jobs were created through MPs for technical


                                                40

maintenance and service stations, and 130 jobs through the implementation of milling MP. Job
and employment helped to increase the income level of Project beneficiaries to a certain extent."

4.      Governmental and municipal structures in the implementation of microprojects.
Alongside with the merits of the communities, it is necessary to note the important role
governmental structures and local self-governments played to support micro-project
implementation in the communities. This included provision of office spaces, communications
from the regional and state organizations at raion level. In addition, great assistance was
provided from the governmental agencies at the raion level including state architecture
department, taxation offices, raion level statistics' committees and supervisory bodies. For
micro-project implementation, funds were provided by the Employment Center to pay salaries to
community members that participated in micro-project implementation. Funds of sponsors,
heads of local self-government bodies (LSGBs), and other governmental structures were used for
procuring equipment, materials, products and hot meals supply during micro-project
implementation. This kind of interaction of micro-project groups implementing micro-projects
with governmental structures allowed for drawing additional funds and materials for micro-
project implementation. This is also a good example of relationships of communities with
governmental municipal structures.

5.      Preparations for village graduation from the program. Communities are provided
with 4 years of support after which they are expected to graduate from VIP. However, for a
community to graduate from the project, specific procedures and requirements on microproject
component shall be met to ensure future sustainability of community microproject outputs.
Requirements included such activities as handover statement of completed MPs (microprojects)
to the owners (generally aiyl kenesh okrug, sometimes LIC) accounts, scanned version of
documents, no accounts payable, availability of State Commissioning Statement, etc. A special
MIS module was developed for entry of documents, to allow the ARIS staff to monitor
community graduation activities.

In 2008, for the first time communities will be exiting Village Investment Project after
successfully accomplishing a 4-year cycle of development activities. ARIS specialists have
worked out project exit matrix to ensure successful graduation of 73 communities. Matrix
consists of 12 successive steps of social mobilization and lasts 20-25 days.

Communities of various regions of our Republic in collaboration with representatives of AKs
and AOs developed various mechanisms to ensure sustainability of LICs and VICs after their
exit from the Project. For example, in Salamalik LIC in Osh oblast the AO allotted 3 hectares of
land for 49 years to transplant walnut trees. Another example is when Kurshab LIC was allotted
10 hectares of land and one employee for transplanting trees; Nariman AK from its own budget
allocated 700 thousand KGS to Nariman LIC to finance microprojects following ARIS
procedures.

6.      Exchange visits. Exchange visits were the most effective form of trainings and exchange
of experience between the participating communities. Over 2004-2007, 155 exchange visits
were held.    During these visits, communities in years 2-4 shared their experience with
communities in their first year.      Exchange visits were organized not only between the
communities, but also between ARIS personnel. For instance, ARIS Chui-East office and Talas
oblast made exchange visits to communities in Akjol, Janypol, Karajygach, Kyzyltuu, and Aksy

                                                41

raions in Jalalabat oblast. Similar exchange visits were organized at raion and oblast levels, with
exchange visits in Panfilovskiy, Moskovskiy, Sokuluk, Alamedin, Issyk-Ata, and Kemin raions
of Chui oblast.      Community members, participatory monitoring and evaluation groups,
microproject groups, aiyl okmotu members, VIC, LIC, ARIS CDSOs (community development
support officers) took part in such exchange visits, which were organized based on the analysis
of on-going microproject implementation.

7.      Capacity building and further public service. It should be noted that due to ARIS
capacity building activities, many activists involved in the VIP implementation (LIC, VIC, MPG
members and village mobilizers) were elected aiyl kenesh members and heads of aiyl okmotus.

8.      Expanded role of Community Development Support Officers (CDSOs), the basic
ARIS field officer.       During 2004-2007, 130 ARIS CDSOs directly working with the
communities received 7-8 trainings. Training of trainers (ToTs) among CDSOs enabled CDSOs
to provide 35% of all trainings for communities by 2003-4, and in 2007, 99% of all trainings
were conducted by CDSOs.

9.      ARIS, with help from a DFID grant, prepared an excellent series of guide books for
village preparers of microprojects. By disseminating these guide books, ARIS facilitated the
self-education of the communities, these serve as a guiding line for communities in selecting
priority micro-projects. In practice, 1-3 months is required for a community to identify priority
micro-projects, and this requires sufficient efforts and funds for a community to be able to
identify the right priority micro-projects on their own. The guide books allowed for reduction
efforts and expenses due to community self-education.         In addition self-education enabled
communities to get new ideas, as well as access resources for implementation and future micro-
projects. The guide books also aroused a tremendous interest of the villagers in all regions of the
Republic.
