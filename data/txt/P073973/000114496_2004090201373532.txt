Re: 
Kyrgyz Republic: Japan Social Development Fund 
 
Grant for the Community Driven Village  
 
Investments Pilot Project (TF052269) 
 
Amendment to the Letter Agreement 
 
 
Excellency: 
 
I
refer to the Japan Social Development Fund Letter Agreement (TF 052269) for the 
Community Driven Village Investments Pilot Project, dated May 30, 2003 and countersigned on 
July 16, 2003 (the Letter Agreement), between the Kyrgyz Republic (the Recipient) and the 
International Development Association (the Association).  I also refer to the letter from  
Mr. Moldokulov, Deputy Minister of Finance, dated February 16, 2004, requesting the 
Association to increase the authorized allocation amount for the Special Account to US$300,000. 
I
would like to inform you that the Association has agreed to increase the authorized allocation 
amount for the Special Account, partially, to US$200,000. The proposed amount is considered 
justifiable taking into account the current Project disbursement rate which is expected to peak at 
about US$150,000 per month in the nine months period left before the Closing Date of the Letter 
Agreement.  
 
Consequently, the said Letter Agreement is amended as follows: 
 
The authoriz
ed allocation amount “US$100,000” set forth in Sub-paragraph 1(c) of 
Attachment II to the Letter Agreement is replaced with “US$200,000”.   
 
All the terms and conditions of the Letter Agreement, as amended hereby, shall remain in 
full force and effect. 
 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing, dating and 
returning to us the attached copy of this letter.  This amendment will become effective as of the 
date of countersignature upon receipt by the Association of the countersigned copy of this letter.
 
Sincerely, 
/s/   Dennis de Tray
