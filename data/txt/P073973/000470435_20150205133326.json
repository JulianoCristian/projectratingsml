Over the last two years, the\n            Village Investment Project has supported 1,600\n            micro-projects in about 80 different categories - from\n            pushbutton traffic lights that save the lives of school\n            children crossing busy roads, to school heating systems,\n            bridges, health posts, computer centers, machinery\n            workshops, textile cooperatives, storefronts and even a\n            morgue. These projects have affected almost half of the\n            Kyrgyz Republic's scattered population of 5 million. A\n            financial return assessment conducted last year found that\n            most projects had spectacular rates of return because of the\n            thriftiness and ingenuity of the villagers who co-financed\n            them. Gotz Schreiber, the project's Task Team Leader at\n            the World Bank says he has seen villagers use an abandoned\n            factory chimney to patch up a broken irrigation canal, and\n            bridges built for as little as $4,000 where the Ministry of\n            Transport might have spent $40,000 all counted."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
