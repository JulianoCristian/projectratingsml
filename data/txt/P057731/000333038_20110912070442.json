Transport Integration Project for Philippines were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; the risk to\n            development outcome was significant; the Bank's\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and the\n            Borrower's performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a realistic\n            assessment of the resources available, skills and commitment\n            of the Implementing Agency's (IAs) could have led to\n            better project implementation structure. The problems\n            experienced by the project underscores the need for an\n            Operations Manual (OM) that can serve as a guide in the\n            implementation of a complex project. The OM should clearly\n            specify the roles and responsibilities of the implementing\n            agencies. It can also ensure consistency in the application\n            of procedures, consolidation of required outputs, and\n            continuity in the event of management and personnel changes\n            during project implementation. The manual can also instruct\n            how to develop maintenance and budget plans and other\n            maintenance activities. Ideally spelled out in the OM, these\n            requirements should be clearly identified prior to project\n            start up. A seeming shortcoming in the entire project cycle\n            is the lack of formal participation of key stakeholders in\n            design and implementation."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
