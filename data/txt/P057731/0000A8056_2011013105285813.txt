                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         To improve the operational efficiency and safety of the transport system of Metro Manila, with better opportunities to use public transport and nonmotorized
                         transport, the dominant transport modes of low-income residents.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Global Environment Objective of the proposed Non-Motorized Transport Global Environment Facility (GEF) Grant supported component is to reduce
                         greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the use of zero-emission bicycle and pedestrian transport. A second objective is to demonstrate and publicize the
                         benefits and viability of bicycles as an alternate transport mode to encourage replication of this pilot program in other parts of Metro Manila, elsewhere in the
                         Philippines, and in other countries.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Final supervision was conducted in March 2010 to: a) follow up on the completion of activities; and b) discuss preparation of the project ICR. The mission found the project to have
                         substantially achieved the DOs notwithstanding the reduction in scope. As of March 23, 2010, disbursement was $51.09 million (around 85% of total loan) while $51.62 million (or
                         86% of the loan) have been committed. The project was unable to complete the programmed activities and fully disburse the loan. The total undisbursed amount is $8.38 million. The
                         Borrower requested (and the Bank agreed) to extend the loan closing date and reallocate some portions of the loan to allow for the completion of the remaining project activities.
                         These activities however were eventually dropped because the required budget was not released to MMDA. The mission sought assurances from the DPWH, MMDA, and City of
                         Marikina that facilities and improvements introduced by the project are properly maintained. The agencies informed that they will continue to seek O&M funds. An ICR mission was

                         carried out on May 31 to June 10 to discuss the preparation of the project completion report, including how to assess the project given the lack of baseline and target values for the
                         performance indicators. DPWH and MMDA indicated plans to seek Bank support to a follow up Urban Transport Improvement Project. The mission, DPWH, MMDA and the
                         Department of Transport and Communications (DOTC) exchanged ideas on the potential components of the next urban transport project and how this can be executed.

                         This ISR was prepared in July 2010. Changes in the ISR and system glitches prevented its submission in the system until now. This represents the state of the project as of July
                         2010.
