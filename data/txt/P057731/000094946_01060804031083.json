Government of the Philippines in enhancing the\n            economic productivity and quality of life of Metro Manila\n            residents by improving the operational efficiency and safety\n            of the transport system and access to public transport and\n            nonmotorized transport. The project has five components. The\n            first funds public transport improvement measures comprising\n            integration between modes, improvement of interchange\n            facilities, and measures for introducing public transport\n            priority; traffic management; measures for controlling\n            inappropriate frontage activity and measures for improving\n            road safety for pedestrians by providing sidewlaks and other\n            facilities; measures for bicycles and pedicabs; and safe\n            bicycle parking at stations. Landscaping and greening will\n            be included in all project components. The second component\n            improves access to the MARIPAS-Marikina Valley area\n            (Marikina, Rizal, and Pasig), specificallyrelieving the\n            Marcos Highway/Aurora Boulevard corridor and establishing an\n            at-grade traffic management scheme--which will act as an\n            efficient conduit for traffic to and from Metro Manila, and\n            extending a critical road section. The third component\n            comprises improvements to secondary roads such as pavement\n            rehabilitation and drainage and sidewalk improvements. The\n            fourth component supports non-motorized transport and the\n            fifth component builds capacity in traffic management."}, "docdt": "2001-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
