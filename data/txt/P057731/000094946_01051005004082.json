effects on the livelihoods of affected\n            populations, as a result of the Metro Manila Urban Transport\n            Integration Project, and examines the right of way (ROW)\n            issue facing the Don Mariano Marcos Avenue extension, as\n            well as issues related to the Marikina Bridge, and its\n            access road component. The ROW is a Government's\n            responsibility in regards to its alignment, and\n            compensation; local governments were included in discussions\n            on possible cost-sharing, and on the valuation of the ROW\n            costs. As of those discussions, the project area was cleared\n            for project implementation, though socioeconomic impacts did\n            occur as a result of demolitions, removal of trees, and,\n            adversity to farmland, and private residential land in the\n            Industrial Valley. However, land acquisition is no longer an\n            issue: properties along the ROW of the access road, and\n            Marikina Bridge are government owned, donated in January\n            1995, while private land should not be affected by the\n            project, based on an agreed new scheme. Affected\n            populations, mainly squatter families, were relocated to\n            different sites (government, or privately owned), of easy\n            access to job opportunities. Construction materials for\n            temporary shelters, transportation, and food assistance were\n            provided, and, displaced persons were encouraged to organize\n            as a community, with the provision of government assistance,\n            and training. Currently, monitoring concerns employment\n            problems, security measures at resettlement sites, and a\n            continuing technical assistance in the provision of infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2001-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
