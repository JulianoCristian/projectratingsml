The project will\n            consist of three components. Basin modeling and knowledge\n            base, which will develop necessary analytical tools and a\n            comprehensive basin simulation package to support MRC's\n            basin management decisions, determine, monitor and implement\n            the \"Rules for Water Utilization\"; and put\n            functional information sharing mechanisms in place; b) Rules\n            for Water Utilization, including, drafting rules to\n            establish minimum flows in the Mekong River and define water\n            sharing, utilization and water quality rules, preparing\n            detailed review and notification procedures; and assisting\n            in negotiations and consultation during formation of the\n            Rules.
