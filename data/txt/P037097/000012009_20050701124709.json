Lessons regarding design specify, and/or\n            reinforce that when school communities manage resources,\n            these are likely to be used more efficiently, being\n            conducive to greater long term participation in school\n            development. Within the framework of decentralization, the\n            Central Government, through the Ministry of National\n            Education (MONE) has a role in targeting strategies, to\n            address the education needs of the poorest communities, if\n            national goals for basic education are to be achieved.\n            Lessons concerning management report that the matching grant\n            mechanism for school quality improvement based on school\n            plans, became problematic when the Government's\n            development budgets were not released on time. Also, schools\n            often found that the price of goods and services had changed\n            between the time of preparing a proposal, and eventually\n            receiving the goods. It took time for schools to learn how\n            to match the books and equipment they ordered, with actual\n            student needs and the teachers' ability to make\n            effective use of them. Lessons regarding the project mapping\n            suggest that expanded access, and other poverty-alleviation\n            programs, and geographic targeting of services, should be\n            done on the basis of poverty. Estimates should be made down\n            to the village level, to benefit from mapping, an excellent\n            technique to support this process, but there should be a\n            pre-commitment to update the \"map\" each year -\n            thereby overcoming the static nature of most poverty map schemes."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
