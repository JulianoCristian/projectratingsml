Java and East Nusa Tenggara. The\n            project's objectives are to: 1) expand access to JSE in\n            a cost-effective and equitable way; 2) improve the teaching\n            of JSE; and 3) strengthen the management capacity at all\n            levels of the education system. The project comprises three\n            major components: 1) access to JSE including: (a) increase\n            in the number of places available at junior secondary level\n            by adding classrooms to existing schools and building new\n            schools located closer to the potential JSE demand; (b)\n            provision of existing and new Open JSE with instructional\n            material and training for tutors; (c) help to promising but\n            poor students to get access to JSE through the expansion and\n            improvement of the existing scholarship program; and (d)\n            stimulation of the demand for JSE through a social marketing\n            effort; 2) education quality consisting of: (a) provision of\n            training to underqualified teachers; (b) teacher dormitories\n            to insure the presence of teachers in remote areas; (c)\n            construction of library rooms and provision of library\n            books; (d) study of best teaching methods for science\n            education; and (e) establishment of a Student Performance\n            Assessment to provide teachers and principals with academic\n            feedback; and 3) education management including: (a)\n            expansion of the managerial skills of staff at central,\n            provincial, district, sub-district and school levels; (b)\n            improvement of the information management and utilization;\n            and (c) augmentation of the equipment in province and\n            district offices."}, "docdt": "1996-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
