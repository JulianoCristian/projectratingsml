First Highways Sector\n            Project.  Although included in the earlier project, Croatia\n            will also participate with an improved road maintenance\n            management component.  The project supports further\n            development and rehabilitation of sections of the\n            Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH), rehabilitation of other\n            primary routes, and improved road maintenance.  To that end,\n            the project includes:  (i) a three year (1988-90) time-slice\n            of the investment program of the ROs in Kosovo, Macedonia,\n            Montenegro and Vojvodina; (ii) limited training and\n            technical assistance and the provision of road monitoring\n            equipment; (iii) a training program for the staff of ROs,\n            maintenance enterprises and engineering institutions; and\n            (iv) provision of equipment for road maintenance in Croatia.\n            The main emphasis is on improvements and rehabilitation of\n            the TYH in Vojvodina and Macedonia and the rehabilitation of\n            other primary routes, including sections of the Adriatic\n            Highway in Montenegro and Kosovo."}, "docdt": "1987-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
