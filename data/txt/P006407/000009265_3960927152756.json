program for 1989-1993.\n            The project consists of: (i) selected water supply and\n            sewerage subprojects; (ii) engineering and consulting\n            services as required for design and construction\n            supervision; (iii) studies and technical assistance to\n            strengthen planning capacities for planning, marginal cost\n            analysis and pricing, reduction in costs, and domestic waste\n            water pollution assessment; and (iv) institutional\n            development to improve operations and maintenance. Compared\n            with past programs, increased emphasis is given to sewerage\n            works and to small and medium cities rather than\n            metropolitan areas. While covering urgently needed extension\n            of services, this project will strengthen the capacity of\n            the state water company to carry out more efficient planning\n            of investments, improved internal revenue mobilization, and\n            increased efficiency of operations."}, "docdt": "1989-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
