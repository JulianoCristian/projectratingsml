REPUBLIC OF LI1ERIA
APPRAISAL OF
PORT OF MONROVIA DREDGING PROJECT
SUMARY
i.        This report appraises a project for improvement of the port of
Monrovia. The proposed project consists of: dredging the harbor to 45 ft
to accommodate iron-ore carriers of 90,000 dead-weight tons (dwt); nro-
vision of two large tugs, a pilot launch and navigational aids; consultants'
services for feasibility studies of road apnroaches to the port! advisorv
services for the newly formed National Port Authority (NPA). The estimated
cost of the project is $4.2 million, of which the foreign cost component
to be financed by the proposed loan is $3.6 million equivalent. The loan
will be made to the Government; about  3.4t million will be relent to NRA
and the balance retained by the Government to carry out the road feasibilit;y
studies.
ii.       The Government's intentioni in            g i ing N*A is to increase
Liberian participation in the management of the public ports as a necessary
part of Liberian deveo-m.ent.   It will involve NrA Ataking over:
(a)  management of the port of Monrovia, the most iripor tant pub'ic port
of Liberia, from the Monrovia Port Management Company Limited (MP1Pi)
whose powers under itL E agreement withbl the Government extend to
policy and management and whose Board is largely composed of foreigti
users! representatives;
(b)  management of the minor ports of Greenville and Harper from the
Government, including in the case of Harper, the role of the
Guovernment in an existing cargo-handling contract with a private
company;
(c) jurisdiction over the large, mainly iron ore exporting port of
Buchanan, which was constructed and is cperated by Liberla
American-Swedish Minerals Company (LAMCO).
iii.      The newly-formed NPA will have to have management and an
organization before it can take full responsibility for the ports. This
will mean that day-to-day management of the ports will continue to be
carried out by management contracts until NiPA is able to assume full respons.l-
bility for all management functions. The project provides for training and
Liberianization of port staff. The law creating NPA does not ensure a
proper balance between Government representatives and port users on the
N-PA Board, does not provide for the necessary degree of administrative and
financial autonomy and, being based largely on a general Public Authorities
Law, does not provide for specialized port functions. It therefore needs
amendment to ensure that the ports of Liberia will provide essential services
efficiently and will develop to meet commercial requirements. The Govern-
ment has agreed to amend the law accordingly.



- ii -
iv.        The financial resources available to IPMC during the remainiiig
period of its existence and to NPA thereafter, will be sufficient to meet
the needs of the orolect.   The financial forecast for NPA for the longer
term, which allows for tariff increases at Monrovia, indicates sufficient
resources to cover deblt service and provide cash for caJpital investmPe-nPt.
It has been agreed that a capital investment program for the ports will be
prepnred by NPA in consultation wth the Governm.ent nnd the Bank.    Agree-
ment has been reached that the Government will provide financing for any

v.         Iron ore accounts for about 70p Of the value Of Liberia's exports
and 30% of its gross domestic product. Approximately half of these iron ore
exportvs - some 9.4 million tons in 1967 - are exported through the port of
Monrovia. The proposed port improvement will reduce the costs of transpor-
ting iron ore by permitting the use of larger ore carriers which wlil improv
the competitive position of Liberian iron ore in world markets. The econano'
rate of return of the project, based on the readily-quantifiable benefits, i-
28%.
vi.        Because of the highly competitive nature of the iron ore mining
industry, deepening the port is urgent. In addition, a contract between one
of the iron ore companies and a Japanese buyer, for the supply of 200,000
tons of iron ore, depends on a Government commitment to provide improved depth
of the port b;y April 1, 1969; this is deemed to be satisfied by commencing
the dredging on February 1, 1969, although dredging will not be completed umti.
October 1969. The contract for dredging was awarded in November 1968. Bid-
ding has been, and for the remaining items of the project will be, according
to the Bank's guidelines. Retroactive financing of some US$225,000 per mont!
will be involved as from February 1, 1969, the date on which dredging commen- .,.
vii.       The project is suitable for a loan of $3.6 million to the Govern-
ment for a period of 15 years, including 2½; years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
POR.T OF NO1K2OV1A flREiflaG PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION-
1.01      un February 2, 1968, the Government of Liberia asked the Bank
for assistance in financing the dredging of the port of Monrovia to accomnm!o-
date iron-ore, carriers of up to 90,000 dwt instead of the 45,O00 dwt maxinuI
that can presently be handled. The proposed loan of US$3.6 million covers
the foreign component of the cost of the project, estimated at US$4.2 million
equivalent. The loan will be made to the Government for the reasons given
in 6.04 and the Government will relend the bulk of the proceeds (US$3.385
million) to the National Port Authority (NPA).
1.02      The project consists of:
(a) dredging the approaches and an area within the port to
accommodate bulk ore carriers and tankers requiring
45 ft of calm water;
(b) provision of two 1,250 hp tugs and a pilot launch;
(c) provision of additional buoying and lighting of the
navigable channels;
(d) management assistance to EPA;
(e) engineering consultants' services;
(f) consultants' services for feasibility studies for the develop-
ment of road approaches to the port
1.03      This report is based upon the findings of a Bank appraisal mission
to Liberia in September 1968 by Messrs. Elsby (Port Engineer), Jones (Finan-
cial Analyst) and Parthasarathi (Economist)o The dat(e of the appraisal mi-sion
was postponed six weeks awaiting a consultant's report on the effect that
dredrging 17 ft helow the fouin&atjhrs - f +-he  alaiaters wollld have on thee

2. BACKGROUND
A. Country and People
2.01      Liberia is located on the south-western coast of West Africa and
h.f 4300 sqJ     . It" .J L). ItU Is bDordered on tlhile ntortuln by Sier-ra
Leone, on the northeast by Guinea and on the east by Ivory Coast.  The popu-
lation is about one million, representing a density of sorne 24 per squaxe

.JJL .L ~U.LialO.ed uu) grow±ing ad. ±L :.p a year t'Jli-1±C1 L  L  U(U
parisoh with other developing countries.
2.02      Beyond a level coastal plain ranging in width from 20 to 40 miles,
the land slopes gradually to an altitude of 4,000 feet near the border wit!L
Guinea. The climate and vegetation are tropical, with a rainfall of 200
inches per zauium on the coast gradually declining to 70 inches in the irte-
rior.
B. The Econorn
2.03      In 1.967, the gross domestic product (GDP) was $330 million, with
a per capita income of about $210. The economy is marked by a dichotomy
between the mainly foreign-run iron ore mines and rubber plantations (which
accounted for 30% and 10% respectively of GDP and for 70% and 15% of expo:.-.s
and the rest of the largely indigenous economy. Other agriculture (includ-
ing subsistence activities) provided 15% of GDP, trade 10%, government 10%,
and manufacturing, construction and miscellaneous services the balance.
2.04      Economic growth, in terms of physical volumes of output of goods
and services, has been over 10% a year between 1960 and 1967, but only aroun
5% per annum i.n value terms, because of the deterioration of prices for the
country's main exports. Per capita income has grown by 31a$ a year.
2.05      Liberia has substantial mineral resources, particularly iron ore
of high grade. Iron ore mining complexes have been developed by Liberia
JYining Company (LMC) at Bomi Hills, National Iron Ore Company (NIOC) at
Mano River, Bong Minirg Company (BMC) at Bong Range and Liberia American-
Swedish Minerals Company (LAM4CO) at Mount Nimba. From these sources about
18 million toris of ore were exported in 1967. There is some diamond and
gold mining, and bauxite, manganese, lead, mica and ilmenite deposits have
been located.
C. Transport Facilities
2.06      A road network has been constructed over the past 15 years, largel-y
with technical and financial aid from the USA. As compared with about 300
miles of unsurfaced roads in poor condition in 1950, there are now 2,200
miles of public roads (of which 200 miles are asphalt-paved) and 1.200 miles
of privately-built roads open to the public (of which 40 miles are paved).
The number of vehicles in operation has increased from less than 1.000 in
1950 to 13,500 in 1967 (including 2,060 trucks and buses). Gasoline con-
sumption has tripled between 1958 and 1967 to over 12 million gallons ner
year.
2.07      There are three private railway lines totalling 303 miles in
length, one from Monrovia to Bomi Hills and Mano River; annn-i%hpr frn-m Mon-
rovia to the Bong Range and the third from Buchanan to I'Mount Nimba. They



- 3 -
were designed primarily to carry iron ore and other traffic of the mining
companies. Only the Buchanan-Mount 1ximbeta lie is open to C,o,lercial +r2..
fic, which in 1967 amounted to 6,000 tons of logs and 10,000 tons of rubber.
2.08      There are four ports in Liberia - at Monrovia, Buchanan, Green-
vifle (Sinoe) and Harper (Cape Parras). Only tne first tw-o are deep-water
ports and each handles half of the country's iron ore exports. The total
general cargo traffic amounts to about 700,000 tons, about WOt) is hla e
at Mionrovia, Just over 10% at Buchanan, and the balance at Greenville and
Harper.
2.09      The country has ten airports, only Roberts Field near 'rionro-va,
is an international jet airport; four can handle DC-3's and the other five
only smaller aircraft.  There are, in addition, 54 landing strips, mostly
in areas not accessible by road.
3. EXISTING PORT ORGAIRIZATION AND FACILITIES
A.  Existin   ) Organizaticn
3.01      The breakwater port of Monrovia (Map 2) was constructed by the U',
Government between 1943 and 1948 at a cost of approximately US$19.5 million.
It. is managed and operated by the Monrovia Port Management Company (MPMC)
under a contract with the Govermnent of Liberia (The Monrovia Port Manage-
ment AgremAnt'). The port of Buchanan is owned and operated by Liberia
American-&wedish Minerals Company (LINCO). The minor ports of Greenville
nnd HarPer arei owned bv the Government: Greenville is operated by a Govern-
ment Department and Harper is operated by Union Maritime et Commerciale
Liberia Corpo]nat±onn (TJVARCO) under a contract with the Government. The owner-
ship of the assets, and the responsibility for the debts of the ports are
set out in Ra,tio  8.  The nort of Monrovia is the largest and only substan-
tial source oE public port revenues, which, under the Monrovia Port Manage-
Ment hareement, nre admrinistered by EPMC.
3.02      A4 law establ±shing a National Port Authoritv (NPA) wras passed by
the legislature in April 1967, and was made operative in November 1968.
The C-Jvernmen assigned TPA its role under the Monrovia Port Management
Agreement on March 29, 1969. NPA is the Government's agency for administer-
ing the Monr oia Port Managemet Agreement ard the Port Harner Manaeement
Contract, and for managing the port of Greenville. It is the Government's
ar,d 1KAls inter.tion Whgi MD g-rdul-aly over several years take over the
management of the port of Monrovia from PPMC.
3.03      Eight of the ten members of the Board of MPMC represent large
foreign interests inCluding Minirng, shipp±-g, oil and rbber  compnles



The remaining two members are nominated by the Government. Board meetings arc
held in Neui York.  It possesses ;olic~' and management posers in tariff setting
and the disposal of revenues independent of the Government and ri'PA. Day-to-
day management staff of the port consists of twenty-one expatriates and two
Liberians, one of whom is the Acting Port Director.  In New Yorkc, apart from
the Board, the management comprises a companv secretary and small staff.
3-.n)     MPHIC carries out the fuhnctions of a nort authority, including
pilotage and control of shipping within the port limits. Wharf workers
are e-mrloed d-iretly by IPMjC, while stemvedores for cargo-handling aboard
ship are employed by the shipowners through stevedoring contractors. Pri-
vate fims have leased large areas of the nn-rt on t.ahirh thev have constructed
their own storage facilities.

) IX,
.0 uourrenuly, Y milli±on ±Uons of iron ore are export ed annuall±ly fro..
Monrovia by the iron ore companies (LMCO, NIOC and BMC). Iron ore is trans-
ported from the mines to the port by railways ownled and operated by the ore
companies. Each company has a storage area for iron ore, and owns and operates
its owr, loading equipment. BIVIC and N!UCC own their own piers; the pier used
by LIMC is partly owned by LMC and partly by the Government. BMC equipment can
load ore carriers at an hourly rate of 3,500 tons, NIOC at i,OOO tons and IC
at 1,400 tons.
3.07      The Government-owned general dry cargo wharf is 2,000 ft long.
All cargo is loaded and discharged by ships' gear. Ashore the cargo is moved
by fork lift trucks and tractor/trailers. Mobile cranes ranging from 3 to
15 tons capacity are available, as is a 50-ton crane with limited travel for
heavy lifts. The transit sheds, warehouse accommodation and open storage
areas are adequate for the present levels of traffic.
3.08      The T-headed petroleum pier is owned by the Government.  Petroleum
products are pumped ashore to tank farms owned by African Petroleum Terminals
(APT) and Mobil Oil Company. A new oil refinery has recently been completed
by Liberia Refining Company (IRC) on the outskirts of Monrovia, and this Com-
pary is providing a pier between the BMC and NIOC piers for discharging crude
oil.
3.09      United Nations Drive and the Mesurado Bridge were originally built
to provide access for the construction of the port and now provide road ac-
cess for port traffic. The city has developed considerably on both sides of
United Nations Drive and much of the traffic using it and the Mesurado Bridge
serves this development. Nevertheless, HPMC maintains the Mesurado Bridge
and reimburses the municipality for the maintenance of United Nations Drive.

port revenues; and an inordinate level of users' outstanding accounts.
.2. IMPROVEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      In NPA's take-over of the management of the Liberian ports,both
the Government and NPA are conscious of the need for maintaining the effi-
ciency of the day-to-day operations at Monrovia while gradually transferring
management functions to NPA. The program calls for improvements in the
NPA law and an orderly transfer of functions from MPMC to NPA.   The present;
NPA law does not ensure a proper balance between the Government and port
users on the NPA Board, does not provide for the necessary degree of
administrative and financial autonomy, and, being based largely on a general
Public Authorities Law, does not provide for specialized port functions.
The Governmen-t has undertaken to ensure that NPA has the necessary powers,
management, resources, capital structure and financial policies to enahle
it to handle its responsibilities efficiently. To accomplish this it has
agreed to amend the NPA law within a year to accord with the principles set
out in AppendiLx 1.
4.02      In order to modify MPM , NPA and MPMC have entered into an agreeii1,
to terminate the Monrovia Port Management Agreement by June 30, 1970.   The:Lr
agreement provides that NPA shall, prior to December 31, 1969, enter into
arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, with MPMC or another firm, for
continuity of day-to-day management of the Port of Monrovia and other NPA
ports. These arrangements will come into force on June 30, 1970, and will
terminate at -the end of 1971, except as may otherwise be agreed with the
Bank. The management firm will:
(i) provide such management staff in Liberia as shall be agreed between
the Government, NPA and the Bank;



(ii)  cooperate with NPA in improving the operating and accounting
procedures of NPA ports; and
'iii)  promote the Liberianization of such NPA staff as are under the
supervision of the management firm and Liberianize its own staff
in consuitation with NPA.
4.03       [n phasing out MPMC and transferring its functions to NPA the
influence of the users would diminish and that of the Government increase.
In order to maintain the users? influence in promoting day-to-day opera-
tional efficiency and preventing uneconomic port development, agreement
has been reached for the Goverrment to ensure port users adequate represen-
tation on the EPA Board.
4.04       For the purpose of developing NPA into an organization eventually
able to handle both policy and day-to-day management of all public ports,
agreement has been obtained that:
(a)   NPA will promptly establish an organizational structure acceptable
to the Bank, including the staff at NPA headquarters and at
each port;
(b)   NPA will. in consultation with the Bank. promptly engage a
Port Adviser and Port Accounting Adviser, for a period of two
years to assist EPA in taking over the manazement of all Dublic
ports (8.28). The Port Adviser will advise NPA on planning and
effecting an orderlv transfer of fimntions from YiPPMC to NPA.
HIe will seek to establish efficient management of all NPA's
rlorts.  He will aIls l dv ei o-n tnhe preparation of a dieve1onmernt
plan for the ports and on training schemes for NPA personnel;
(c)  NIPA will consult the Bank about any proposed appointment to the
rpost of NPA's Por+ Director;
(d)   NPA will establish and, as soon as practicable , fill the post
of Port Engineer by a qualified and experienced engineer;
(e)   the Harbor Master is at present empowered to direct and regulate
the- moeX'e.    -ofU- 4essel  withi  the 4oto' b  h uthr       of

(f)   upon termination of the management contract referred to in 4.C02
NPA will engage suitable personnel for the purpose of operatiLg
the ports; this personnel would be recruited largely from the
outgoing management firm and would in many cases be Liberian.

4.05      In order to provide NPA with sufficient resources to carry out
its operations efficiently and to provide for needed expansion, agreement
has been reached that a rev-ised tariff will be introduced at Monrovia
by May 31, 1970 to earn a rate of retiurn at this port of at least 5% in
1971 and 7% in 1972. It has also been agreed that the Government and
NPA will consult with the Bank on steps necessary to ensure the financial
viability of other NPA ports (8.26). NPA has agreed to prepare a com-
prehensive port developrment program in cousultation with the Bank and
will consult the Bank before carrying out any major port develcpment project.
4.06      The Mesurado Bridge, United Nations Drive and St. Paul River
Bridge are utilized by Port and other road traffic. They are therefore
highways as distinct from port facilities. Agreem3nt has been reached
that the present responsibility of IYL for maintenance of these facilities
will be given to an appropriate agency of the Government other than N?A.
5. TRTIC ANkD POR LPlTEVE-;LUP1L1NT
A. Shipping
5.01      In 1967, a total of 2,038 ships entered Liberian por-ts of which
1,622 ships totalling 6.9 million net registered tons entered the port of
'Monrovia; 306 ships entered the port of Buchanan; 80 ships called at
Greenville and' 30 at Harper (Table 1).
5.02      At Plonrovia the number of ship calls increased from 1,508 in
1964 to 1,622 in 1967 due primarily to the increase in iron ore exports.
Of the 1,o22 ships,375 were iron ore carriers. The average quantity of
iron ore taken per carrier increased from about 19,000 to 25,000 tons
during this period. With dredging to 4r5 ft the number of iron ore
carriers calling is expected to decline to about 250 vessels by 1972 with
an average load of about 45,000 tons.



B. Present and Future Traffic - Port of IMlonrovia
5.03      In 1967, Monrovia handled 82% of the country's general cargo
traffic, 76% of its petroleum products and 55% of its iron ore.  In volume,
the iron ore traffic was the most important, amounting to 9.4 million tons;
general cargo traffic was next with about 360,000 tons; the total of latex,
cement/clinker, rice and druimmed petroleum was 200,000 tons; and bulk petro-
leum amounted to about 180,000 tons (Table 2).
5.04      The outlook for the future is that the importance of Monrovia
will increase.  Iron ore exports are expected to rise to 11.3 million tons
by 1972. Bulk crude petroleum imports, to feed the recently cmpleted re-
finery, will replace the petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) imports of
Monrovia and the other ports.  Coastal,trade in POL from Monrovia to the
other ports is expected to develop. Clinker imports into Eonrovia, for a
recently-completed cement plant, have replaced cement imports through the
port but this will make no significant difference in port traffic. Some
temporary increases in general cargo traffic, arising from the importation
of equipment and material by DMC, which is installing an iron-ore pelleti-
zing plant, are expected during 1969 and 1970.
(i) Iron Ore Traffic
5.05      The prospects for Monrovia's iron-ore exports are of crucial im-
portance to the project.  LM0, NCIO, and DM0 are presently the sole export.-
ers of iron ore through the port. As can be seen from Table 2, their total
iron ore exports have increased steadily from 4.6 million tons in 1963 to
9.4 million tons in 1967.
5.06      The world iron ore market is expected to continue as a buyer's
market for some years   This, however, is un iely to affect Liberia's ex=-
ports in the near future for two reasons: firstly, about 75% of iron ore
ex-ports ar.- to the fCorei.. owners of t.eIAL rrLL.g comparIJles ad.d, secondly, in
view of Liberia's proximity to traditional markets in Europe and the USA,
it Shol-d A bne ablJe two M.I.antair. i ts frLee r,,arIket sUales at a"Jout thle present
level.
5.07      While 1TIC and NIOC have no plans to increase production or ex-
ports, they expect to mcauintain operations at arounrd the present level of
about 6.3 million tons per annum. The third company, DMC, is at present
operating at a c   uity of 3.6 million tons per annum. It is setting up
a pelletizing plant, to go into production in 1970, when it expects to ex-
port 5.0 milllion tons anniually, consisting of 3.0 million tons of ore  and
2.0 million tons of pellets.  Overall, iron ore and pellets exports throuai2
Monrovia are expected to amount to 11.3 million tons per annum by 1972.
The estimated reserves of the ore companies are adequate to maintain produ^-
tion at these levels for at least 15 years, and tne economic evaluation are
the term of the loan are based on this assessment.

(ii) GenEral Cargo and Other Traffic
5.08      Fluct,uations in general-cargo traffic in the past have generally
bhen in rpsponns: to maimr investmrnt-s in the country. Excluding traffic
which may be directly connected w,ith such large projects, general cargo
has remained at; arond 250,nn0 tons annualmly. Only a slight increase in
this level, in step with the expected population groarth, is assumed over
the nexrt few years. Rice iwrnorts, how.ever, are assiqmed to stay at a
level of 50,000 tons a year since domestic production might increase to
ca+er for- the- es cwNt ir pop 1at  V-ortS _oP ln+; r erctdtocn
tinue at 40,000 tons a year. Mention was made in 5.04 of the changes in

Traffic through Other Ports
5.09      Trafi'ic through the other ports in recent years has been as
follows:
(Thousands of tons)

NA - Not available.
5.10      General cargo traffic through the port of Buchanan is largely
LAMCO traffic. Tonnages are expected to remain at about the 100,000
level in the next few years, of which about half will be LAIMCO traffic.
About two-thirds of Greenville traffic is logs and timber and the
balance is general cargo and petroleum. Some increase in exports of logs
and timber is forecast but total traffic is not expected to exceed 20,000
tons. Harper braffic consists mainly of log and rubber exports and
general cargo :imnorts. If the exoansion plans of the Marvland Loggiana
Company are implemented, exports of logs and sawm timber from Harper
would roach an estimated 7q.OM tmnn  and total traffic about 90.000 tons
annually. This program would take several years to implement.



C. Port Development
5.11       No comprehensive development program exists for the public ports.
The only major investment, amounting to JS$250t 000 equivlrent, is beine
made by UYARCO in equipment for the port of Harper.     The Government has

6. THE PROJECT
6.01      The project consists of the following items:
(a)  Dredging of the BIC, LI4, and LRC berths to a depth of 45 ft
and of the    OCX. berth to a depth of u2 It beLow mean low water.
Dredging of the approaches to these berths within the calm
water of the harbor to 45 ft.    Dredging the narbor entrance
and the approaches outside the breakwaters to 47 ft and 49 ft
rsUpecuvely, to allow for the roll ana pitch of deep-draft
vessels.
(b)  Provision of two 1,250 hp tugs and a pilot launch.
(c)  Provision of additional buoying and lighting of the dredged
channels.
(d)  Provision of management assistance to NPA for two years of:
(i) a Port Adviser; and
(ii) a Port Accounting Adviser.
(e)  Provision of engineering consultants' services for supervisicn
of the dredging contract, and for the design, preparation of
contract documents and inspection of the tugs, pilot launch,
buoys and lights.
(f)  Provision of consultants' services for feasibility studies.
6.02       The total estimated cost of the project is US$4.2 million
equivalent, including US$3.6 million equivalent for foreign costs made

(a)  Dredging of Berths, Harbor and Approaches
(i) The works included under this ite-m are shotn on M2ap 2.
The dredging will permit iron ore carriers and tankers of up to about 90,000
deft to use the tWC and LRC berths, and those of un to 65,000 dwt to use the
NIOC berth. I'he NIOC berth cannot be dredged to a greater depth without ex-
tensive strengthening of the pier.  This would, at present; not be justified
as few, if any-, of the carriers using the berth would exceed 65,000 dwt o iIrc,
to the depth limitations of the norts of destination seri-ig the .main cus-
tomers. In the event of larger carriers requiring iron ore from NIOC, arrang2-
ments could be made to load through LTMGC facilities.
(ii)  For carri-ers of up to 90,000 dwt to use the B1MIC berth, a
turning area will be required as shown on Nlap 2. BMC has undertaken to
dredge the turning area at its oir. cost.
(liii)  The total quantity of spoil to be dredged by IMP is 2.8
million cubic yards, mainly silt and sand, but a small amount of rock, as
shown on Map 2, may foul the dredged depth.   uring negotiations it was
agreed that ary rock above dredged level will be removed by NPA as it has
eXisting arrangements for removal of ths rock.

(b)  Provision of fTo Tugs and a Pilot Launch
The four existing tugs are greatly under-powered for handling
large vessels. Thev are also in a poor    ta   rff repaii- andi too nldc to bh
reconditioned. Two tugs of 1,250 hp are required. A pilot launch is

The :need for a Port Adviser and a Port ACCUo-iLng Auviser for
two years is explained in 4.04, 4.06 and 8.28.
(e)  Provision of Engineering Consultants' Services
These services would include engineer's services under the
dredging contract, and the design and preparation of contract documents
for, and inspection of, the tugs, pilot launch, buoys and lights to be
prccured.
(f)  Feasibil ity Studies
A significant proportion of the road traffic utilizing the
kiesurado River Bridge, United Nations Drive and the Monrovia By-pass
Freeway (Map 2) is traffic to and from the port of Monrovia.   T'he Mesurado
River Bridge and United Nations Drive are constructed for two-lane traffic.
The traffic using the bridge and Drive is heavy and there are more than
8,000 vehicles per day.. The Mesurado River Bridge is a temporary struc-
ture built dur-ing World War II and is at present being under-pinned to
prevent failure of the foundations.   The Monrovia By-pass Freeway comprises
B4 miles of four-lane highway joining the port of Monrovia to the Main
National Highway and is largely cormiplete with the exception of the permanar.b
surfacing. Economic and engineering feasibility studies for the following
are included in the project:
(i) the replacement or reconstruction of the Nesurado
River Bridge to provide for more than the two
existing traffic lanes:
(ii) the best means of widening the United Nations Drive;
(iii)  the tvne of suirfaohng to be nrovidd onn thA Nonnnrnvia
By-pass Freeway.



- 13 -
In order to ensure that the feasibility studies do not become a charge
on NPA, the Goverrnment will retain the portion of the loan necessary to
finance the foreign exchange element of the cost of the feasibility stu(ies.
The Public WATorks Department will be responsible for having the studies
carried out by consultants approved by the Bank. The Bank will also re*-
view the terms of reference and the consultants' contract.
6.03      The above cost estimates are realistic as they are based on (a)
the actual contract price for dLiedging (60o5j),  (b) cuirrent prices for
floatiAig craft, andi (c) the Baiik's experi2-nce for consulting services.
Physical contingencies of 10% avnd nrice comilnqencies of anproximatelv {
on all preceding items are considered adequate.
Disbt::r semet_Procedure
6.04      Until the arrangements between NPA and IATEC referred to in 4.03
are carried out and 1PA takes over the ass-ts and lJnbilits of the port
of Monrovia, the financial standing and viability of NPA would not be
established1 and NIPA would have to rely on 11iC or th.e G-vVerment for fun  for
the project.  The 'Loan Agreement has therefore been made wJith the Government.
For the reasons given in 6.02(, $0.21 uil         ofU    l     ;    e retaIlned
by the Government for the feasibility studies and $3.385 miLLion relent to
tMA   Th.e :loar. to 'IM A wJUll be for a per-Lo' of 15 years, ir,cluding a Iwo ax,.d
one-half year grace period.
6.05      Disbursement of the main (dredging) item of the loan will be based
on. 80% of the contracted dredging cost which is the foreign cost corTonerlt.
Disbursement on alL other items will be based on actual approved foreign ex-
chaLge expend-tures. The estimated schedule of disbursement is as follows:
Year                 Estimated Disbursement
(US$ '000)T 
1969                        3,000

6.06      A4ny surplus funds available on completion of the project wNill be
cancelled.
6.07      As is in.dicated in Section 8 of this report, the financial projec-
tions show that IPMC/APA will have ample resources to pay the local cos;Js of
the port share of t;he project.  hne local costs of the feasibility studiLes
will be included in the Public Works Department's budget.

Procurement
6.08      The dredging contract was let on November 20, 1968, to Bauer
Drp8ginop and Co:n.nt.rrn.tion Comnanvr of Htew York Citv. after international
bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. Dredging commenced in February
196°.  Contract evnrIit.1resq nncludnng Pngnppring supervision, are esti-

Contracts for the provision of the two tugs, the pilot launch and additional
lightinLg and bu.oyiLg will be let i accordance -with internationl bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The Bank's requirements were confirmed
during negotiations.
General
6.O9      It is expected that the dredging contract will be com)leted
by Oc-tober 1969. The other items, mainly procurement and services, will
take an additional two years to complete.   VFA is considered competent to
execute the project with the help of the engineering consultants' services
provided in the project.
6.10      Lyon Associates Inc. of Arlington, Virginia, USA, have been ap-
pointed as engineering consultants for the dredging. The Government and
NPA were advised during negotiations of the Bank's procedures for appoint-
ing and retaining consultants for other project items.
7. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits of Dredging
7.01      The proposed port improvement will reduce   the costs of trans-
porting iron ore. which will improve the competitive position- sf Liberian
ore in world markets. The directly quantifiable benefits are reductions
of oce--n    _ -- _ shppn   cot  by_ us,g lage  vesl  th I< -  _  I  _. car no  be accol, 'L  a, xodabed.3 -

These reductions will result from lower cargo costs per ton, both for the
voyage and for time in port, since the larger vessels can use faster loadin2-
facilities. As with many similar port improvement projects, these savings
will, in the first instance, accrue largely to foreign buyers and/or exporterz
of iron ore from Liberia.   However, port dues to be levied on iron ore vessel.t
as described in 8.02,will help recover the cost of the investment from the
users.



- 15 -
7.02      In Whe case of two of the mining companies - LMC and NIOC - sales
are on an f.o.b. basis.   Consequently, the savings in shipping costs resuLtb-
ing from the dredging will benefit the foreign buyers. However, the mining
comnanies should be able to negotiate better f.o.b. prices on future sales
as and when t]eir present contracts with buyers expire in the course of the
next. 3-4 vears. Tf - as a rApnitl th.-  p.rfJts of +heSe twro companieS im-

of their net profi+s.

to its principals, the benefit of dredging will be an outright reduction

companies, trle Governm-ent Of LiDeria intends to review tone concessio, aEgres-
ments to define more precisely the basis for computing their net profits.
B. Economic Return
7.05      Almost all the iron ore nowJ exported from Monrovia is destined
for Europe and the USA. As mentioned above, total iron ore exports are
expected to increase and be maintained at a high level. The economic evalua-
tion, therefore, assesses the advantages, irn minimum cost terms, of shipping
these exports in larger bulk-carriers than those now used. The Bank esti-
mates that, on the average, savings in shipping costs resulting from the
use of ships requiring a depth of more than 38 ft and up to 45 ft as against
ships requiring 38 ft (the present depth alongside the iron ore berths in
Monrovia port) will be about 35 cents per ton of ore (or 15% of existing
per ton shipping costs) on voyages to Europe and the USA. The savings could
be even larger in the case of longer voyages to countries in the Far East.
7.06      Based on the iron ore export forecast in Section 5, the total
savings in shipping costs have been projected for 15 years, a conservative
estimate of the life of the project. Exports beyond 1973 have been assumed
to remain at that year's level.   The benefits of deeper draft will not, how-
ever, accrue on the entire quantity exported since larger ships can only
enter ports deep enough to accommodate them. Considering this, and based
on discussions with the mining companies, it is estimated that, by 1973,
about 6.5 million tons of ore will be carried in ships requiring more than
the present depth of 38 ft, resulting in savings of $2.2 million per year
in shipping costs. The remaining 4.8 million tons are assumed to be car-
ried in ships requiring up to 38 ft depth.



7.07      The estimated savings in shipping costs, after allowing for main-
t-enance -7-e- i,  w 'l yield a return of 28 Pan1 -, cost- of (i) th 4-U-

port,  (iii) the liguhtig cund buOyinlg equipmlent essentilc  for 1the safe navi-
gation of the larger vessels in the deeper and externded navigational area
and  (iv)  the improvements in shore and other ancillary faciiities.  The
last item, which will consist of improvements to ore-loading installations,
strengtheningr of piers and dolphins, etc., will be the responsibility of
the mining companies, but the estimated costs involved have been taken into
account in clCculating the economic return.  The possibility of adverse
variations in traffic forecasts and cost estimates is expected to be negli-
gible. If the savings in shipping costs are only half those estimated, the
economic retuirn will still be 10%, which is adequate.
7.08      On the direct Liberian investments in items (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, the Bank estimates the benefits to the Government alone to yield a
return of over 20%.
7.09      As and when other ports of destination increase their depth be-
yond 38 ft, the quantity of iron ore shipped from Monrovia in larger ves-
sels will increase and the benefits will be correspondingly larger. These,
however, have not been taken into account in estimating the economic returnn;
C. Feasibilitv Studies
7.10      The project; also inrludes feasibility studies for improving the
United Natioxis Drive, the Monrovia By-pass Freeway and the Mesurado Bridge.
The volum.e ard natnire of traffin on theh t.wo roads anrd the hriripe (6.02 (1'))

8LL01  plvied by PirYln are Uarbor uUe, wharfage
and handling charges, all on the basis of tonnage loaded and unloaded,
pilotaL1geU adlU tuWagu ucarguu to tUe bslhLp, ana storage charges on cargu.
There are also charges for hire of cranes and other equipment, supply of
fresh water and other miscellaneous services and facilities, and rentals
for land and buildings within the port limits. No charges are levied on
vessels carrying iron ore but the iron ore companies pay five cents for
each ton of iron ore exported. In the case of L1U, this charge is fixed
in its concession agreement with the Government. LIT and NICC also pay
two cents for each ton of iron ore crossing the nearby St. Paul River
Bridge.
8.02      Two tariff studies have been carried out since TMIAC was formed,
the first in 1952 (Sly-Hedden Report) and the second in 1962 (James C.
Buckley, Inc.). Both recommended substantial tariff revisions including
tariff increases. Very few of the recommendations were implemented and
tariffs have never been adjusted to reflect the cost of providing services.
This will be remedied as follows:
(a) Elimination of the five cents per ton charge on exports
of iron ore to be replaced by a combined charge on ore
exports and on ore carriers to reflect the cost of pro-
viding safe anchorage. Agreement, acceptable to the Bank
as to the initial level of the charge and its application
as from December 1, 1969, has been reached between the
Government, NPA and ANPMC on the one hand, and the ore
companies on the other. The Government has published
the level of charge and its date of application.
(b) A general revision of other port charges designed to
reflect costs. The James C. Buckley study provides a
suitable basis for revising the tariff. The Port Account-
ing Adviser, whose services would be financed under the
loan, would advise NPA on the carrying out of the tariff
revision (8.29). It has been agreed that tariffs will
be reasonably related to costs and that the first revision
uiUl be effeo'tcd by I'lay St, 1970.
Other Ports
8.03      The :port charges levied at Greenville are similar to but slightly
higher than those in Monrovia. At Port Harper charges are levied for
anchorage, wharfage, lighterage, towage and storage. Charges for handling
and storing genernl cargo and for pilotage and t.wage of ships are levried
at Buchanan by LADCO, owners and operators of the port.

B. Present Finances
Qperating Entities
8.04      To bring IMonrovia into existence as a functioning por;, the
principaL users incorporated 1MMC in 1a98 and entered into a maiagement
agreement with the Government to operate the port. The users c ntributed
the initial working capital to get port operations started.   The investment
in the original port assets and the debt to the United States for port con-
struction are not shown in tbe balance sheets of MPMC as these are consid-
ered assets and liabilities of the Government of Liberia. The management
agreement provided that POMIC co-ald set aside certain fuhnds for improvements,
after which operating surpluses were to be used to amortize the cost of
port construction. Until thbe debt was repaid, the United States Government
was to retain certain rights in port operation, the setting of port charges,
and the disposal of surpluses.  nowever, in 19614 Pu1l title to the port was
transferred to the Republic of Liberia by the United States Government, a
debt repayment schedule was agreed between the two Governments, and the
United States gave up its rights. The Government of Liberia then informed
MPlD that it would be expected to provide tne funds to repay the debt to the
U .S.
8.05      The new NPA has the responsibility for the other Liberian ports.
The port of Harper is operated by UIARC0 under a ten-year contract with t-he
Government made effective in September 1968. According to the terms of the
contract UNMRC() will invest $250,000 in port improvements and the Govern-
ment will share in the earnings from port operations. The Government
presently services the debt incurred in constructing the port.   The port of
Greenville is onerated for the Government by port experts supplied by the
Federal Republic of Germany. Debts incurred in constructing this port also
are serviced by the Government of Liberia.  The port of Buchanan was con-
structed and is operated by LhMCO. The Government, therefore, receives no
revenues and incurs no expenses in the operation of the port of Buchanan.
Port of Monrovia
8.06      The current financial position of NPM: is strong. Working capital
amounted to $1.6 million on July 31, 1968 and an additional $465,0o0 was
available to meet iunforeseen expenses.
Revenue Accounts
8.07      Revenues, expenses; surpluses and other financial data for MPMC
for the years ended December 31, 1965, 1966 and 1967 and the seven months
ended July 31, 1968 are given in Table 3 and are summarized below.

8.08     I?1ThM accounts reflect depreciation of the assets it has acquired
with surplus port revenue but not depreciation of the original investment
in breakwaters, docks, piers, buildings and other assets not purchased by
iPIPC. Applying the depreciation rates given in Appendix 2 to the cost
of the assets not purchased by IPMC, it is estimated that the annual pro-
vision for depreciation is understated by $264,000 and annual net operat-
ing revenues correspondingly overstated. Figures for debt service repre-
sent principal payments to the Government of Liberia to amortize the debt
to -the United States Government for port construction. This debt service
has been well covered ,although coverage has deteriorated,and the operat-
ing ratio has increased as revenues remained constant while expenses
increased for salaries and wages of port staff.
Balance Sheets
8.09      Summarized Balance Sheets of MPMC as of December 31, 1965, 1966

Fixed Assets
8.10      Investments in buildings, equipment and certain port installa-
tions totalling $4.3 million have been made by 1VIM4C over the years and as
of July 31, 1968 had a net book value of $1.9 million. Exrept for the
LMC pier w'hich was partly paid for by MPMC, the piers and installations
of the ore companies were constructed at their expense. As mentioned in
8.04, the values of the original investment in breankaters, channels,
piers, etc, are not shown in the acco*nts of         These assets cost ap-
proximately $19.5 million, which, on the basis of realistic rates of de-
preciation as sholn in ApPendi.x 2, had a net book value of $12.9 mili;on
on July 31, 1969.
Current Assets
8.11      The accounts receivable of MPMC as of July 31, 1968 stood at
$1,154,400 made up as fol'ows:
General                                   $ 443,680
Farrell Lines and Delta Lines               286,643
Iron ore billings                           169,606
Republic of Liberia                          210,526
Other                                         43.9
$1,154,400
8.12      Rather than following the normal practice of requiring that pay-
ments be maude on a cash basis at the port, in the case of Farrell Lines.,
Delta Lines, LMC and NIOC, EIPC receives payment through its New York
Ofice. Thie anount due from the Republic of Liberia as of July 31, 1968
included $:L35,544 due for storage charges, from which the Government claims
it is exempt.  ]9IviC has written off a further $251,755 due from Government
for storage in 1966 and 1967 which was considered uncollectable. The large
amounts of outstanding receivables has kept HEMC short of cash, and, there-
fore, of investment funds.
Long-term Debt
8.13     Als previously mentioned, the loan from the United States to the
Republic of Liberia for port constructiorn is not shown in iMIPC's balance
sheets although i'llC has made certain payments out of surplus port revenues
to amortize the debt. Until 1964, when a debt repayment schedule was agreed
between the United States and Liberia, only $0.5 million of the loan had been
repaid.  Subsequently, a further $0.8 million was repaid by PaIC bringinLg
the outstanding balonce of the loan to $18.2 million as of July 31, l968. The
schedule provides for payments  rising    from $225,000 in 1969 to a final.
payment of about $778,000 in 1999.   The loan is interest-free.

Other Ports
8.15      The res uLts of operations for the ports of Greenville and Harper
are summarizedi below for the years 1965-1967 and seven months in 1968.
-----------Greenville--------------     Harper
Surplus     Payments to
Revenues    Expenses     (Deficit)    Government
1965                 $70,030      $76,610      $ (6,580)      $10,473
1966                  90,400       81,726         8,67h        10,210

1968 (7 months)       59,750       52,766         6,984         7,h08
The above figures for Greenville do not include any provision for deprecia*-
tion or interest on the port's long-term debts. The port was built at an
estimated cost of $7.7 million but no balance sheets are prepared and the
costs of indivridual assets could not be obtained. At the end of 1967, there
were two outstanding loans for Greenville port construction, as follows:
Arbeitsgemeinschaft Sinoe-Lenz-Bau AG/Prien              $1,552,000
payments due through 1971 with interest at 7%
Kreditanstalt Fur Wiederaufbau                           $2,534Y000
payments due through 1977 with interest
at                                                        _     _
$M,0861000
Until Septembe!r 1968, the port of Harper was managed by Messrs. Frey and
Lusli, a shipping agency who made the payments indicated above to the
Government as its share of operating surpluses.   No other financial data
was available. As of June 30, 1968, the Government owed the U.S. Export-
Import Bank about $950.000 of the $1.6 million cost of port construction.
The loan is tc be repaid by March 1980 with interest at 4-3/4%.
C. Future Finances
General
8.16      The Government intends for NPA to take over the public assets
and liabilities (including the servicing of the long-term, deb   inc-urred
by Government for port construction) of the ports of Monrovia, Greenville, ani
Harper, and of any other port' placed under its jur-.SUctionD..Until
the takeover o.f ilonrovia (to take place when the M4onrovia Port IIanagement
contract is te:rminated), NPA Will not have access to its cash resources



- 22 -
and will have no funds with wlhich to service the outstanding debts of
Harper and Greenville ports or to pay the local costs of the project.  Durxng
this interiim period, the Government has agreed to continue to pay the debts
and any ope:rating deficits incurred at tbese ports. TIPY has agreed to
cooperate fully with NPA in carrying out the project, including provision
of funds.
8.17      When management oI Monirov`.a -s transferred from MT' to NPA  pay-
ments for port services from Farrell and Delta Lines, LIM and NI0v will be
made in Liberia at the time services are rendered and there will no longer
be large outstanding balances due from these companies. NPA will be able
to collect ifor port services rendered to the Governmient when the N.PA law
is amended to prohibit the granting of any exemptions from the payment of'
port charges. This requirement is spelled out in the principles to be
followed in amending the NPA law (Appendix 1).
8.18      The effects of the above have been taken into account in the
financial projections of NPA. The following cash flow statement for ITK
for 1969 and for NPA for 1970 and 1971 (the period when the project will
be carried out and of the NPA takeover of the assets and liabilities of the
Liberian ports), highlights the importance of the tariff increases for t>.e
financial viability of NPA. Given these increases, NPA wiil have ample
resources to pay the local costs of the project.

Q.20      Forecasts of operating revenue are caluulated or. the assun-tiora
that a cost-based tariff is introduced by NIay 31, 1970 to produce a 7%
rate of return on average net fixed assets by 1972. This wi-l require an
average increase of about 27% on port charges other than port dues on ore
carriers-,whdch has been fixed separately. On this assumption, the operating
ratio and fi-nancial rate of return will be acceptable, the latter increasing
from 57 in i97i to 770 in 1972.

at Greenville and Harper due to the low levels of throughput at these polts

Fixed assets are valued on the basis of historical cost (estimated in the
case of Greenville and Harper) less straight-line depreciation at rates
given in Appendix 2. No revaluation has been made at M4onrovia since port,
constructiorn fas coirpleted in 1948. It has been agreed that a revaluation
of all port assets of NPA, including land, will be carried out by the end.
of 1970.



Cash Flow
8.25      A Cash Flow forecast for IMlPIC for 1969 and for NPA for 1970-1973
is given in Table 6. Cash su pluses for 1969-1973 will total about $i.6
million.  No provision has been made in the financial forecasts for re-
placements or- Junvest-mer-ts at ports other than Mvonrovia, but it is not con-
sidered that they will exceed $100,000 during this period. Cash availabl]e at
the end of 1.973 wil  amount to $2.3 mili on, plus $465,000 for unforeseen,
expenses (Table 5), of wfhich it is estimated that about $2.0 million will
be available for potential future port expansion. Considering the very
high debt/equity ratio, future borrowing will have to be str:ictly limited
and the Government has agreed to consult the Bank before any major port
development is initiated, to provide financing for any major development
undertaken without the Bankts approval, to service any debts incurred in
respect of such projects and to cover any operating deficits.
Financial Rate of Return and Tariff Covenant
8.26      Agreement has been reached that lJPA will earn a rate of return of
at least 5', in 1971 and 7%0 in 1972 on the average net fixed assets in use
at Monrovia, the fixed assets to be valued on the basis of historical cost
less depreciation. It has also been agreed that all NPA assets including
land, will be revalued by the end of 1970, after which the Government and
NPA will consult with the Bank about the steps to be taken to ensure the
financial viability of NPA ports other than the port of 150nrovia and a
reasonable rate of return on the value of NPA's assets in such ports.
Disposition of Unused Surpluses
8.27      The Borrower has agreed to exempt NIPA from making any payments to
it by way of (i) return on the Borrower's equity investment in NPA, (ii)
anortization on   the outstanding amount of the U.S. loan, (iii) taxes,
(iv) distribution of surplus revenues; -unt.il such time as NPA shall have
prepared a comprehensive port development program (5.12) when the BorrowJer
will review payments to be made by NPA to the Borrower.
Port Accounting Adviser
8.28      Until NPA assumes funll responsbillity for the .m anagement and opera-
tion of the Fbrt of Monrovia and for some time thereafter, it will require
the services of a Port Accolnting Advhiser (as provided for inr the project).
He will be required to advise on cost studies needed for tariff revision,
the revaluation of asse     the establishm-ent of a 'ting systems at Ge

EASES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FINATCIAL PROJECTIONS
Port oI Mionrovia
1.        Operating revenues have been estimated on the basis of the present
tariff except for charges on exports of iron ore and harbor clues on ore
carriers which were assessed separately. Additional revenues from tariff
increases averaging 27% were assumed in all categories except harbor dues.
Revised rates for iron ore exports and harbor dues on ore carriers were
calculated from December 1, 1969, other increases from Hay 31, 1970.
2.       -Operating costs have been computed with price increases, includ-
ing wages, at the same rate as experienced in the 1966-68 period and allow-
ance made for increased throughput.
3.        No allowance for depreciation on the original port assets (those,
not purchased by 14RIC) is included in the estimates until 1970 vhen it is
assumed NPA will take over operations from MPMC. Rates of depreciation on
these assets are as follows:
Channel, Basin and Breakwaters      1%
Other Maritime Stractures           2.5%
Buildings, bridges, cranes          2%
Tanks. fences. utilities
1h.       Provision has been mripe for mintesnnce dredring in the amount
of $200,000 annually, commencing in 1971, which is considered an ample
allowance. 'hese costs sre rer.nverer in the harbnr dues and to the extent

8.        ProvisioIn has been made for a Bank loan of US$ 3.385 million at
6-1/2% per annum for a period of 15 years including a grace period of twJo
and one half years. Interest during construction has not been added to
the loan but has been charged in the Revenue Account.
9.        It is assumed that when the NPA Law is amended in accordance
with princ:iples agreed with the Bank, the Government will pay for all
port services with which it is provided and that its account with NPA will
be kept current.
National Port Authority
10.       Servicing of all the outstanding debts for port construction at
Monrovia  (zreenville and Harper is assumed by NPA, effective July 1, 1970,
when it is expected that NPA will take over Monrovia port from MPMCo Until
then, the iovernment is responsible for servicing debts incurred in port
construction at Greenville and Harper and for all deficits or other
expenditures incurred in regard to these ports and Buchanan.
11.       The following rates were used in calculating depreciation at the
ports of Greenville and Harnper:
Greenville:
Breakwater, wharves, etc.      2%
