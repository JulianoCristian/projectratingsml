"versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "3920", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory.\n            Project sustainability is likely. The overall performance of\n            the World Bank is rated satisfactory. Considering the\n            important achievements of the project, all due to the good\n            performance of the Borrower and the executing agencies, the\n            overall Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory. The\n            most important positive lessons learned include: 1) The\n            project was a success because its objectives were an\n            integral part of a broader Government program for public\n            sector reform, which promoted more efficiency in public\n            services and displacement of the state in business that can\n            be provided by the private sector. 2) Project objectives and\n            components were well defined. 3) The Government's\n            commitment and ownership assured the project's success:\n            El Salvador is one of the few countries in where there has\n            been continuity in the reform programs, regardless of the\n            political party in control of the government. 4) The\n            Government's dialogue with the institutions to be\n            affected by the project was an element assuring the\n            project's success. Among the negative lessons, the\n            following were mentioned: 1) The unit in charge of the\n            execution of the project has to receive the full support and\n            attention of the Bank's supervision missions at the\n            onset of the project execution, since project schedules do\n            not provide much time for on-the-job training of the unit.\n            The same holds for bid document preparation. The Government\n            and the Bank yielded to outside pressure by nongovernmental\n            organizations and cancelled the feasibility study of a new\n            hydroelectric project for future development by the private\n            or public sector--although it had been included as one of\n            the project components. 3) The Borrower preferred to use\n            other sources of funds than funds from the Bank's loan\n            when financing one of the components because it viewed the\n            Bank's procurement guidelines as too restrictive and\n            requiring of long periods of time for drafting and\n            approvals. The Bank should discuss clearly with the Borrower\n            the conditions for the use of Bank funds and other sources\n            of financing, or should not finance components where other\n            less restrictive sources of funds are financing the same\n            project as co-financing or independent financing."}, "docdt": "2002-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
