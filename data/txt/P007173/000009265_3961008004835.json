        systems; and (b) assist in the restructuring of the\n            sector's legal and regulatory framework through the\n            preparation of secondary legislation and procedures, and to\n            support the Electricity and Hydrocarbons Regulatory\n            Commission (EHRC) and the National Energy Council (NEC) when\n            their respective laws are enacted.
