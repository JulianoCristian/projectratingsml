Nisab, in the presently isolated Shabwah\n            Governorate, through construction of a two-lane paved road.\n            This road is also expected to stimulate agricultural\n            production in the vicinity of these towns. It will also\n            strengthen PDRY's road construction capabilities: (i)\n            through about 130 manmonths of consultants assistance to the\n            Ministry of Construction (MOC) for improvement of project\n            preparation capabilities, management, and operations of the\n            MOC's construction units, including the independent\n            construction unit (ICU) established under the project; and\n            (ii) through training of MOC and ICU staff including about\n            90 manmonths of long and short-term overseas fellowships."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
