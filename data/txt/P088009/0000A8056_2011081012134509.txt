                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global environmental objective is to arrest and reverse land degradation processes in riparian ecosystems and adjacent agro-ecosystems by increasing on-
                         the-ground investments and strengthening policy, regulatory, economic, and institutional incentive frameworks to encourage sustainable land management,
                         hence increasing carbon sequestration and restoring ecosystem stability, functions and services.

                         Discussions during the supervision mission in October 2010, resulted in a key decision to hold a synthesis workshop on payments for environmental services at the end on March
                         2011 and to develop and publish a book in Portuguese on payments for environmental services to facilitate widespread dissemination of project outcomes and lessons learned.
