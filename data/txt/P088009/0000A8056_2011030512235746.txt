                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global environmental objective is to arrest and reverse land degradation processes in riparian ecosystems and adjacent agro-ecosystems by increasing on-
                         the-ground investments and strengthening policy, regulatory, economic, and institutional incentive frameworks to encourage sustainable land management,
                         hence increasing carbon sequestration and restoring ecosystem stability, functions and services.
