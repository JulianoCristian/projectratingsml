PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 608-YU)
Highlights
This project has been successfully completed. Most civil works
were completed close to the appraisal schedule. Although a 33% cost over-
run occurred, about half of it was due to price increases not anticipated
at appraisal. The audit rates of return for two of the three roads in-
cluded in the project are satisfactory, while that for the remaining road
is only marginal.
The project illustrates the risks associated with the economic
justification of a project when benefits depend upon a non-project item
such as complementary investment. It also illustrates the need to adequately
study tolls, so that their imposition does not impede the optimum use of
roads. On the road whose audit rate of return is only marginal, high tolls
and the failure to realize complementary investments were the maior factors
preventing full realization of the economic benefits.
The project also illustrates a successful method of channeling
road funds in cases of highly decentralized highway administration.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
YUGOSLAVIA THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 608-YU)
Project Summary
l.        The Government of Yugoslavia requested the Bank to assist in financing
a highway construction program in July 1968. An appraisal mission visited
Yugoslavia in October/November 1968 and identified a number of possible road
projects. The preparation of three of these roads in the Republics of Croatia,
Slovenia and Macedonia was well-advanced, final engineering had been completed
and bidding documents were being prepared (See Map). These three roads were
selected for inclusion in the project and it was agreed at the time that the
remaining roads would be considered for financing later on.
2.        The preparation and appraisal of the project was expeditious and by
June 5, 1969, less than one year after the initial request, a loan for US$30
million was signed. The efficiency with which this project was appraised was
influenced by:
(a) the continuing contact with Yugoslavia and the experiences
gained thrnoah the Pirst Highway Proipcf, TLnan 344-Yu, of
1963 and the Second Highway Project, Loan 485-YU,of 1967;
(b) the well-advanced stage in which the three roads were presented
to the Bank and the fact the other roads we-re deferred thus
avoiding delays; and
(c) the prompt exchange of correspondence between Bank and Government.
3.        The Third Highway Project for US$30 million financed:
(a) in Croatia, a highway from Zagreb to Karlovac with access roads
in Zagreb and in Karlovac, accounting for 34% of project costs;
(D)  in Slovenia, a highway from Vrhnika to Postojna accounting for
54% of project costs; and
(c) in Macedonia, a highway from Gostivar to Kicevo accounting
fCor 12I/m of project costs (Attachment, para. 1).
LLhe sections Li LroatLa anu Slovenia, the more developed northern   part of the
country, formed parts of new international highways linking Yugoslavia's
Adriatic coast to road networks in neighboring countries and were important

for expanding tourist traffic. Both of these sections would be operated as
toll facilities. The Croatia section would also support the planned expansion
of the Port of Riieka. The third section in Macedonia replaced a low standard,
mountainous road. All three sections would follow new alignments because it
would be uneconomical to upgrade the existing roads.
4.        The maior coymnonents of the loan were comnleted slightlv hphind the
appraisal schedule while minor components (the Karlovac and Zagreb access
roads)  were severelv delaevd and wpre rnmnplPetd in T'cepmber 1Q73 and Tuine 1974,
respectively, one and a half to two years behind the appraisal schedule (Attach-
ment, paras. 5-6). In the case of theZagreb access, progress was slow because
the designs were modified, leading to expropriation problems and difficulties

respect to maintenance improvement and transport planning and coordination,
the Bank is maintaining contact with the Goverrnent to ensure continued progress
in these areas.
6.        An interesting aspect of project implementation was the channeling of
road funds. Highway administration had been decentralized in 1967, when the
Government transferred its responsibility for public roads to the Republics and
Autonomous Provinces of Yugoslavia. Because there was no central highway
agency, the Bank considered making separate loans to each of the three Republics.
But roads identified at appraisal for later Bank financing were located in
other Republics which would entail the appraisal of a number of new borrowers
each time a loan was made. Consequently the Bank discussed alternative methods
of channeling funds with the Government. It was agreed that the Yugoslav
Investment Bank (which had participated in previous Bank loans) would be the
coordinator in matters related to project execution. The Government would then
enter into subsidiary loan agreements with each Republic. The practice of
entering into subsidiary loan agreements was successful and was used under the
Fourth Highway Project, Loan 578-YU.   It was continued under the Fifth Highway
Project, Loan 751-YJ, aI'houg:i :ae Yugoslav Investment Bank did not act as
coordina.or apparently because it was considered this service was no longer
needed. In the Sixth and Seventh Highway Projects, Loan 990-YU and Loan 1143-YU,
the Bank entered into agreements directly with the Republics involved. This
was possible becaulse these Republics had narticinated in orevious Bank-financed
projects and their performance had been satisfactory, removing the need to
annraise their canacitv.

7         The actual construction cost of the three project road sections of
Din 1,191.9 million (US$73.7 million in current dollars) represents an overrun
of 33% over the appraisal estimate (including contingencies) of Din 898.7
million (US$71.8    i,llion) and 43% over the total bid price of Din 835.1 million
(US$66.8 million).-   Additional quantities accounted for about half of the
Dinar overrun and price escalation for the remaining half (Attachment, Annex 3).
The actual cost of supervision is not available.
8.        The rates of return at appraisal for the Zagreb-Karlovac, Vrhnika-
Postojna and Gostivar-Kicevo roads were projected at 13%, 12% and 15% respectively
and the audit rates of return using the same methodology are 8%. 11% and 25%.
While the rate of return shown in the Attachment (Annex 8) for the Vrhnika-
Postoina section is 9%, recent additional traffic data for 1974 and 1975 received
since the Attachment was prepared, indicate the audit rate of return would be
abou  11%, QQ1onY sihtlv hblow the appraisal estimate of 12%_
9.        The audit - rates of rptu,rn exclude imnnrtant hpnefits surh as passenger
time savings and decongestion savings on the old roads. If the benefits from
time savings are included, the rate of return on the Zagreb-Karlovac Road is
satisfactory at 10%.   Although time savings were not included in the project
justification at appraisal, at writing, the B-ank, considers it to be an i;.portant
benefit on four-lane roads such as these.   The methodology used in the Attachment
f-or com-putfing tiEme savings jis simlilar to that  :--g -----osedb  te Bn  o
use in theEighthHighway Project, and it seems satisfactory.     The other benefit
arising from decongestiLon savings would improve the rates oL return on all
three roads even more, but it is not possible to include it due to lack of
adequate information.
1O.       The lower than expected rates of return on the Zagreb-Karlovac Road
and, to a lesser extent, on the Vrhnika-Postojna Road (using the appraisal
methodology), result from the combined effect of cost overruns and traffic
underruns. The higher than expected rate of return for the Gostivar-Kicevo Road
is explained by the favorable development of traffic.
1l.       In 1973, traffic on the Zagreb-Karlovac Road was 46% of the appraisal
forecast and traffic on the Vrhnika-Postojna Road was 64% of the appraisal fore-
cast (Annex 1). The two additional years of traffic counts available only
for the Vrhnika-Postojna Road and received since the Attachment was prepared,       2/
indicate that traffic on that road has grown 20% between 1973 and 1975 (Annex 2),-
mainly because of the completion of the adjoining road between Postojna and
Razdtro. But despite this substantial growth, traffic in 1975 was still only
72% of the appraisal forecast.
l/In real terms, the 43% cost overrun is reduced to only 10% when expressed
in US$ due to exchange rate movements occurring since the time of appraisal.
2/
- Discrepancies in traffic data on the old Vrhnika-Postoina Road contained in
Annex 4 of the Attachment and Annex 2 of the auditare explained by the use of
counts from a sample survey in the case of the former, while the latter uses
updated average annual traffic counts.



- 4 -
12.       It is difficult to determine if the overestimation of traffic on
the Zagreb-Karlovac and Vrhnika-Postojna roads could have been avoided. At
appraisal, the growth trend of traffic for the preceding six-year period
(i962-i968) nad been over 24% per annum. The regions the roads traversed
were expected to continue to grow, so that the forecast of about 7% per annum
for the succeeding six-year period would seem conservative. A possible ex-
planation for the underrun on the Zagreb-Karlovac Road is the failure to carry
through with the planned expansion ot the Port ot Rijeka which reduced antici-
pated traffic growth. If the port were expanded, it is likely that traffic will
increase significantly. Also if the Zagreb-Karlovac Road were extended beyond
Karlovac to Rijeka, traffic could be expected to increase.
Main Issues
13.       The first issue arising from this project is the approach to construction
used on the Zagreb-Karlovac Road. During project preparation, two construction
alternatives were studied: the first was to construct two lanes in 1969-1970,
and add two more lanes in 1974-1975; the second was to construct all four
lanes in 1969-1971. The second alternative was selected as economically
optimal after study by the highway authorities. However, the justification
of four lanes depended on fairly rapid traffic growth based on the planned
expansion of the Port of Rijeka, an item not included in the project. As it
turned out, the expansion of the port was not undertaken and the traffic failed
to materialize fully. In retrospect, the stage construction alternative might
have been more economical. This experience suggests that a more cautionq
approach toward traffic projections be used when traffic depends on the
materialization of a non-pronect item
14.       The speond isupe is that the tnlls iTmnosed on the Zagreb-Karloc PRo,a
appear to be high, thus impeding the optimum use of the road and discouraging
nntent ia 1  r ff ic which continues to use the older route to avoid paying the
toll (Attachment, para. 12). In principle, tolls are intended to promote
ef fectilve ratio ni;ng of the use of an -xsiE  newr when it -is congested
The imposition of tolls on an uncongested road however can clearly lead to sub-
JjvL.iiia. UOM'JL Li~ £L L L Ly  [JLL                    d I  L1  l  J. XI dL WUW U LIave
used the road in the absence of tolls uses it. Instead, this traffic continues
to use alternative routes anrd the full benefits associated with tie road improve-
ment, i.e., the reduction of vehicle operating costs, is not realized.  The
Tilailand Tnird Hignway Project (Loan 535-T1) studied under Audit Report No. 758
(pp.6-7) provides an interesting example of a similar situation. On one of the
roads financed by Loan 535-TH, traffic continued to use an older, inferior facility
-ecau.se of the toll chaires.  These charges were particularly high for trucks and
heavy vehicles and consequently over half of the traffic in these categories
continued to use the old road. Following the Bank's concern with this issue,
tolls were reduced, and traffic using the older road began to divert to the
new facility. This led to better utilization of the new road and to a lower
social transport cost for traffic in the corridor.
15.      The higher vehicle operating costs for the traffic using inferior,
alternative routes constitute the social cost associated with the extra
revenue that the Government raises through the tolls. Therefore, the issue
in situations such as this where tolls are imposed on uncongested roads, is
whether the same revenue could be collected at a lower social cost. In the



-5-
case of the Zagreb-Karlovac Road, a major objective of the Government in levying
the toll is to tax the tourist traffic using the road. A lower level for the
social cost associated with the collection of this tax can be estimated through
the higher vehicle operating cost of the traffic which continues to use the
old road because of the tolls on the new road. In 1973, this cost was about
US$200,000 (Din 3.1 million).   It is estimated in the Attachment that i*f the
traffic which continues to use the old road diverts to the new facility, the
first year benefits wottld increase by 18% on the Zagreb-Karlovac Road.  These
additional benefits would increase the rate of return on this road from about
10% to 192%  The present hila social cost and the opportunity for fully realizing
the benefits of the road improvement suggest that alternative ways of raising
equivalent revenue at lower co-sts m.igh't 'be explored.

tolls is impeding the optimum use of the Vrhnika-Postojna Road.   Traffic data
received siLnce the preparatior  of the .Lttachwiaent sh[Iow  thl-at between 1973 and
1975 traffic increasingly used the toll road in spite of a 25% increase in the
toll amount uitposeu in October 1974.  The additional traffic data contribute
to a satisfactory rate of return of 11% at audit compared with 9% in the
Attachment. In spite of this favorable impact however traffic is still lower
than the appraisal forecast and the increase in traffic in 1975 results from
the improvement of the section extending beyond Postojna to Razdtro.   In view
of this, the effect of tolls could be further explored. It is possible that
alternative ways of raising revenue might be more economical and that traffic
on this road could be increased by reducing the toll thus further increasing
the rate of return.
Conclusions
17.       The project has been successfully completed.   Most of the works were
completed nearly within the expected completion date and half of the 33% cost
overrun is explained by price escalation. Applying the methodology used at
appraisal, the rate of return on one of the three roads is lower than 10%,
mainly because of substantial traffic underruns. This underrun in traffic is
probably due to the failure of anticipated investments in the Port of Rijeka
to materialize and to the high tolls imposed by the Government, although it may
be that the original appraisal estimates were also overly optimistic. However,
if the important benefit of time savings, excluded at appraisal, were considered,
the rate of return rises to 10% and, were the toll to be reduced, the audit
rate of return could rise further to 12%.
18.       The role of the Bank in this project was satisfactory.   It set up a
workable system of channeling funds to the three borrowing Republicsj it foresaw
that the roads connecting the sections to be financed should also be upgraded,
and it took a positive role in the exneditious and efficient nreparation of the
project.  There were some problems of communication between the Government and
the Bank with respect to the minor conponents of the project, and the Ba.k was
not kept informed of changes made on the access roads; however, these did not
affect the outcome of the project in any significant way.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LOAN 608-YU - THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
A. Description and Objectives of the Project
1.        The project consisted of the construction of three highway sections:
(i) in Croatia: a four-lane divided highway from Zagreb to
Karlovac (45 km), with access roads in Karlovac (2.7 km)
and in Zagreb (2.5 km)
(ii)  in Macedonia:  a two-lane highway from Gostivar to Kicevo
(46 km); and
(iii)  in Slovenia:  a four-lane divided highway from Vrhnika to
Postojna (32 km).
2.        The objectives of the construction of the three highway sections
were to generate savings in vehicle operating costs by providing four-lane
divided highway sections in Croatia and Slovenia in addition to the existing
two-lane highwavs and to ungrade the Gostivar - Kicevo highwav from a sub-
standard 4-5 m wide water-bound macadam road to a 6-7 m wide paved road with
imnroved design charartpriqtir=    Proeipct data are attarhpd as Annex 1=
B. Projaect Execution
3.        The loan became effective on October 22, 1969, three weeks late
as compared to the originally anticipated date for loan effectiveness.    Annex
2 shows particulars of the highway sections, the contracting fij.,.s that won
the contracts, the cost figures and the starting and completion dates of the
civil works.  Because of two adjustm.ents in the foreign ex.change rate between
the Yugoslav Dinar and the US Dollar (January 1971 and December 1971) the cost
fi4resa 4in t-he f-t-able are m-sraA in Yugoslav Dnar.   All connta-cnta werao wan
by Yugoslav firms.
4.        After prequalification of contractors by the three Road Organizations
~~ incA, Li2      9  - oe-can          - 2
was completed in UOctobuer 1969, bid.s Lrom domLetLc.L aU LfLo.LL cnLtacLLorUL  WreL
invited in November 1969 to be submitted in January 1970.    The Bank approved
in MIaIrch 1970 thIle awardU oi contracts to dUorestic contracting Li m"L±s aisl proposed
by the Road Organizations and the execution of the civil engineering works
started immediately thereafter in March/April 1970, i.e., about i montns
after the Board's Approval of the project. None of the prequalified foreign
contractors submitted bids.
5.        The road works in Macedonia were completed in November 1971, about
two months behind schedule. In Slovenia completion, originally due in October
of 1972, was delayed until late December 1972. Since the project was estimated
at appraisal to be completed by June 30, 1972, the total delay in completion of



- A.2 -
these parts of the project was about six months, caused by the cumulative
effect of administrative delays in the procurement phase of the project
(prequalification and bidding procedures) and delay in the execution of the
civil works.
6.        A much more severe delay occurred, however, in the completion of the
sections in Croatia; specifically the access roads to the Zagreb - Karlovac
road in Karlovac (2.7 km) and in Zagreb (2.5 km).   The access road in Karlovac
serves as a transit road through the city of Karlovac for traffic from or to
Split and Rijeka.   The access road in Zagreb leads traffic via a bridge over
the river Sava to the Center of Zagreb.   Its function has also been extended
as part of a bypass road which leads traffic from Karlovac via a newly built
bridge over the Sava river to the Zagreb - Belgrade road. The construction
of the access roads in Karlovac and Zagreb was delayed because of expropriation
problems, and because of delays in the execution of works for municipal services
(sewerage ducts, telephone cables, electricity cables). The original closing
date of December 31, 1972 had therefore to be postponed to December 31, 1973 and
again to August 31- 1974 because of the delay in the comnletion of the access
road in Zagreb. Traffic on the Zagreb - Karlovac road was, however, not impeded
in any major way since traffir rniih iis  the existing roads in Karlovac and
Zagreb.
7.        The civil works were carried out on the basis of unit priced con-
tracts by, prequalife4 Yvuosiav contractors resulting in an entirely ssti
factory standard of construction. Some amendments were made in the drainage
works of the Zagreb     arlovac road because of the execution of a drainage
scheme for the region through which the road traverses. These works were
measure'U separately fromu the original contract works andu are on'ly incIlu.eLUU
in the final cost figure of the road in as far as they were needed for drainage
of LIth Lruau Ue:u'
8.        .u'execution of1 LLe cvl. works was adequateiy supervisea oy tne Roaa
Organizations of the Republics of Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia. Technical
institutes in the three Republics (IGH in Croatia, the Federal Institute of the
Skopje University in Macedonia and the Institute for Material and Construction
Research and the Geological institute in Slovenia) assisted the Road organiza-
tion in materials testing in their main and site laboratories.
C. Cost of the Project
9.        Price escalation amounted to 27%, 12% and 19% of the bids in Croatia,
Macedonia and Slovenia respectively. Additionally, the final cost of the sub-
projects in Croatia and Slovenia increased by 19% and 28% respectively, due to
extra quantities and additional works (see Annex 3 for details). The appraisal
cost estimate provided for a 10% contingency allowance for physical quantities
and a contingency allowance of 5% for price escalation.
D. Performance of the Borrower
10.       The loan was made to the Federal Government of Yugoslavia which
concluded subsidiary loan agreements with the Republics of Croatia, Macedonia
and Slovenia. Coordination among the three Repubics in matters relating to



- A.3 -
th_e Bank. (dlisburser..ents, progress reports, et"c.) was acLhLieved th.rough thI e
services of the Yugoslav Investment Bank. Performance of the Borrower,
the subsidiary Borrowers andU the YugUos laV LLLVC LLLLn-ve L DL.LmIent BL  relaLiI11s
with the Bank was satisfactory.
E. Toll Roads
11.       Tolls are imposed on the project highway sections in Croatia and
Siovenia. Both Republics undertook in the subsidiary Loan Agreements that
if any tolls would be imposed, they would be set at such rates as to ensure
an economic use ot the toll roads and alternative routes or means ot trans-
portation. Recent traffic data on both toll roads and existing parallel roads
are shown in Annex 4.
Zagreb - Karlovac Toll Road
12.       The tolls imposed on the various vehicle types are set out in
Annex 5. The traffic data (Annex 4) indicate that 52.5% of the traffic between
the two cities uses the toll road as compared to the assumption of 65% in the
Appraisal Report. A majority of the truck drivers still prefer to use the old
road. An investigation among road users, carried out by the Road Organization
of Croatia in April and July 1973, indicates that 20% of the traffic on the
old road could have used the toll road. Although local traffic constitutes
about 40% of the total traffic on both roads, about 10% of the total traffic
was getting diverted to free but inferior facilities resulting in important
economic losses. The diversion of these road users to the new facility would
increase the present benefits by about 18%. Thus, the full potential economic
benefits of the improved four-lane divided highway are not being realized.
Vrhnika - Postoina Toll Road
13.       The tolls imnosed are set out in Annex 9.   About 70% of total traffi.-
uses the toll road as compared to 65% envisaged in the Appraisal Report. De-
tailpd traffic inupvttioaI-innq wrp-p crarripd  uit- on t-hic tI-ll road.i I TI wan noteid
that about 66% of the traffic moving on the existing old road was local traffic.
Nevertheless, a considprablp nmmbpr of mTdiiwm heavy and heau tI-ruircs incliuding
truck trailers were using the old road primarily due to the tolls on the free-
way; if all notPntinl traffir wnuld iiue t-he new road the present- benefit- would
be increased by about 14%.
14.       The introduction of tolls appears therefore to impede the optimum
flfl    01100Fl us-e o ,  1ot   highways  M orevner ,  the  toll  rates  cor  con.. -.ercial

the new roads.  From the more limited Yugoslav point of view it should be worth-

parison to the loss of benefits for domestic traffic because of the toll system.
F. Economic Evaluation
15.       The main objective of the project was to reduce the cost of transport
and relieve congestions on three highway sections in the Republics of Croatia,
Slovenia and Macedonia by replacing or improving the existing inadequate road



- A.4 -
sections. The average daily traffic volumes on the project road sections
as estimated at appraisal and from actual counts in 1972-1974 are shown
in Annex 6. Average actual traffic on the two four-lane highways in
Croatia and Slovenia is lower than the estimated volumes by about 50% and
30% respectively. On the third section in Macedonia, the average actual
traffic on the other hand has turned out to be about 28% higher than the
anticipated volume. The shortfall of traffic on the Zagreb-Karlovac highway
section in Croatia is primarily due to non-realization of planned expansion
of the port of Rijeka. At the time of appraisal the intention was to expand
the handling capacity of Rijeka port from about 9 million tons in 1970 to
about 20 million tons by 1985. But this development plan has not taken any
concrete shape so far. Apparently the appraisal assessment of the prospect for
traffic growth on the highway section in Slovenia was also somewhat optimistic.
However, the traffic anticipations are more than realized in Macedonia as a re-
sult of increased economic activity in the region. The recent comnpetion of the
connecting sections of this highway which is only a part of the western road,
Skonipe - 1Cievo - Ohrid- would further farilit2t-e nnt-imim uitilizat-ion of t-his
new infrastructure facility.
16.       The nrincinal hpnpfit-.q derived froTm t-he proiect are savings in
vehicle operating costs.   Vehicle operating costs by road section are shown

by an average of 50% from 1969 to 1972 and by another 16% from 1972 to 1973.
This incre4ase is4 partly due to -irnfl atii4on .-A partly to the recent producer
price increases in petroleum products.
17.       The rates of return of the project road sections are shown in

revised     1LmLU returnL (ER)I1j, e2luuLLg benefits of passenger LtLIlU Ls as hLgh
as 25% in the case of the Gostivar-Kicevo section but only 8.5% and 9% for
Zagreb-Karlovac and Vrhnika-Postojna sections respectively. If the benefits
due to savings of passenger time are included, the economic return increases
to 12% for Vrhnika-Postojna section, confirming that this project is also
economically justified. But the rate of return for the Zagreb-Karlovac Section,
even after allowing for savings in passenger time, turns out to be marginal
because of 50% shortfall in traffic volume and about 55% increase in construc-
tion costs. In retrospect, the staged improvement of this section to a four-
lane divided highway might have been a better proposition.
G. Loan Covenants and Project Agreements
18.       The following loan covenants were undertaken by the Government in
Loan 608-YU:
(i)  To improve transport coordination by:   improving the collection
and DreDaration of traffic data: reviewing Dertinent legislation
with a view to developing highways within the framework of
general economic development; and exchanging views with Rank
on transport studies which would be undertaken by the Transport
Insttitua- of Beg1oradeI

- A.5 -
for both maintenance and improvement would be allocated so
that funds for maintenance would be adequate; improve data
collection to ensure proper planning, maintenance and
improvement; and, enforce vehicle axle load limits.
(iii)  To improve those roads providing access to the highways in
Croatia and Slovenia.
(iv)  To ensure that tolls for the Zagreb-Karlovac and Vrhnika-Postojna
hi g.hay would be setl atC levels Bwhich wouldJ permit economic use.
19.       Transport policy and coordination was a central issue during loan
negotiations. The decentralization of decision making to Republics, Provinces,
Communes and Enterprises in 1967 enhanced the need for coordinating the efforts
of a large number of decision makers.   The Bank played a useful role in this
context in the establishment of the:
(i)  Council of Republic and Provincial Roads Organization (CRj);
(ii) Federal Committee for Transport and Communications; and
(iii)  Secretariats for Transport in the Republics and rLovinces.

mous Provinces. It has also been instrumental in the preparation of uniform
guidelines for feasibility studies. Yowever, it does not have the legal
status or authority to play a fully effective role in overall transport planning
and coordination between the Republics and Provinces.   The Bank has maintained
a close dialogue with the Yugoslav authorities concerning the institutional
nrnhIpTmn and the goals of improePd transnprt ronrdinatinn rcntinuip tn guiide
Bank lending for future highway projects.
21.        The loan covenants under this project are substantially met except
those for the Zagreb-Karlovac section where tolls appear to have been set at
such rates which do not seem to ensure economic use of the new highway.
H. Conclusions
22.       The main benefits from the newly constructed roads are savings in
transport costs. The economic returns of road construction for the two sections,
Gostivar - Kicevo and Vrhnika - Postojna are now estimated at about 28% and 12%
inclusive of benefits from savings in passenger time. Tne overall economic
feasibility of these two sub-projects is, therefore, confirmed.
23.       The economic return of about 10% (including passenger time saving)
for the Zagreb - Karlovac four-lane divided hghwlay, however, indicates this
section to be marginally justified. Traffic projections for this road were
based on the dUata anLdU inforhation provided -L tLle timee ol apprasl-  Y*   r,
significant traffic generation such as the planned expansion of the port of
2L J e'I.a andu thLle iLmprove UVCo L Cti LcoLnti   roa  with A-t  yethV  -  materia14zed
Moreover, the distribution of traffic between the new road and the old road is
less favorable than the 65/35 ratio assumed at appra4sal.   In the light of the
actual traffic situation the construction of an initial two-lane facility with
t-h.e aAA,on of two more lanes afte   aut fivu years mTiht therefore have been
a better proposition than constructing the four-lane highway immediately.
