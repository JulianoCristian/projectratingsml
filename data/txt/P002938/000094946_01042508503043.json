           institutional development impact. Lessons suggest that the\n            changing nature of a research organization, such as national\n            agricultural research systems (NARS), from government\n            entities to semi-autonomous organizations, does not\n            necessarily imply a more dynamic management, nor greater\n            efficiency. Rather, effective research management systems,\n            specifically research planning, and operational procedures,\n            as well as budgeting, financial management, and controls\n            need to be in place, and within the context of a pro-active\n            Bank supervision, and local management, with attention to\n            performance indicators, and monitoring. To exploit genetic\n            potential of existing varieties, research and extension\n            should address farm, and crop management constraints\n            vis-e-vis plant breeding. Likewise, as illustrated by the\n            cassava, and water hyacinth programs, research should be\n            focused on few production issues, whose resolution may lead\n            to rapid, and substantial impacts, instead of diverting over\n            a large number of small activities. Given the under-funded\n            status of many NARS, financial sustainability should not\n            depend on Government, and donor support alone, but fund\n            raising should become a recognized function of research managers."}, "docdt": "2001-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
