technology.  It will\n            provide financial assistance to support four broad sets of\n            activities.  First, the project will support the\n            institutional development of the National Agricultural\n            Research System.  It will finance the activities of the\n            National Agricultural Research Organization Board and\n            Secretariat, develop and implement improved administrative,\n            evaluative and priority-setting systems for research\n            programs, and upgrade the capacity of researchers to\n            implement the priority research programs.  Second, the\n            project will support the rehabilitation of research\n            institutes at Serere, Tororo, Jinja and Kifu, and provide\n            the requisite vehicles and research equipment.  Third, it\n            will support the implementation of the high-priority\n            research programs by providing payments for incremental\n            recurrent operating costs, including salaries and allowances\n            under the newly introduced Terms and Conditions of Service\n            for research.  Fourth, the project will support\n            strengthening agricultural education and training\n            capabilities at Makerere University.  Especially, it will\n            support the domestic and foreign based education of degree\n            candidates and staff, the upgrade of facilities and\n            equipment at three faculties and improved curricula for the\n            programs at the Colleges of the Ministry of Agriculture,\n            Animal Industry and Fisheries."}, "docdt": "1992-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
