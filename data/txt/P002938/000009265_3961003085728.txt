MEMORANDUM AND RECOM!MNDATION OF TEE PRIDENT OF THIE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELO!PENT ASSOCaTICN TO THE EXEUIVE DBRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDrr TO THE REPULC OF UGANDA FOR
AN AGICULTURAL  ESEARCI AND T1ANNG PROJECT
1.    I submit for your apprv  the following m  randum and recoeaon on a proposed
development credit to the Government of Uganda of SDR 17.80 million, the equivalent of US$25.04
million. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA tem wth a maturiy of 40 years to help fince
the strengtening of Ugada's agricultural reseasdh system
County and Sedor Bacgound
2.   ITe Ugandan economy has been dsrupted by decades of polidcal instability and civil strlife.
Income per cpita was about US$220 In !990. Economic recovery is underway, and it depends heaviy
on agricultul growth. In 1990, the agriculural sector accounted for 60 peet of GDP, contributed
over 90 pcet of ewpors, and provided 80 percent of employment. Agricultural GDP in 1990 was
distributed as follows: food crops (74 percent); livestock product (16 percat); fisheries and forestry (6
peret); and exports crops (4 percet).  Only one-tid of food crW  production was marketed.
AgriculuWal output comes almost exclusively from smallholder farmers. Of about 2.5 million smallholder
famers, 85 percent have less m  2 hectares of farmlad. warmers are poor, and they use few purchased
inputs. Income per capita at maket exchange rates was about US$140 in 1990. Improved agriculWual
varieties and husbandry will substantially expand the scope for a sustainable increase In production and
income in the small-farmer sector.
3.    IDA has supported the Govent's Economic Recovery Program through a series of stuctural
adjustment opera . The currnt Stuctra Adjustmet Credi (SAC-Cr. 2314-UG) Includes measures
for impoving tax revenue collecton, rediect  the allocation of expedures toward development
priorites (such as agricutural roe     and eension), im ng the fiancial management of the
Government and streamlining the administr-tion of key ministrs, including the Minstry of Agriulture,
Anima ndustry and Fisheries (MAAI). The receny  wroved Economic and Financial Maagement
Project   MP) wl swport f er impvents in the efficiency of the civl service. Ihe agriculture
sector has bsen supported thrugh inct   rehabilitation and ar  development projects, as well
as operations in the sugar, livestock and forestry subsecnors. The Agricultural Sector Adjustmem Credit
(ASAC-Cr. 2190-UG), effcive in Jany 1991, suorted In liberalizing coff ee;eport Marketg, and
set the stage for improving the agiculural research and exenson services of the Governmen
4.    Agricultural research plays a vkal role in suppoting agricultural growth. For resource-poor
smallholder farmers, technological change such as  sive, higher-yielding, disease-resistant planting
materials, improved chemical inputs, and more efectve husbady techniques-can provide one of the
few vehicles for aing Income and output. In te expor industies, where international compeveness
is detmined by firmievel efficiecy, research on methods for raising yields, reducing inputs costs,
incraig disease resistace and improvig the qualty of crops are crucial elements of efforts to increase
prodctivity. Research to support the profitable development of no onal agdcutural expos is also
essental.
5.    The effeveness of the Govment's agritural research seice is severdy consained by poor
management, a lack of saff motivation, inaquae building and research facilities, insuffiien find
for operations and ineffecdve lIges with the etosion service. In 1990, the Government of Ugan
preprd a National Agricultura Researh Strateg and Plan to address these problems. A key element
of the rearch sategy and plan called for establishing a National Agricultura Research Orgnization
(NARO) to take the lead in carrg out the necea  reyfrO     agricultur rearch. NARO wil
consolidat egt research iuitute and two resrch statio  of three agricuue-ead ministries



2-2
(MAAIF; the Ministry of Watr, Minerals, Ener  and Enviroent Protectin; and the Ministry of
Commerce, Indust and Cooperatv) Into one organization.
Project Objectives
6.    Mm project would support the Gvenment's strate  for improving productivity and
diversification in the agricultural sector through the development and trasfer of improved technology.
The broad obJective of the proJect is to develop an orgaonal framework and Institutional processes
for agricul:ural research which are sustinable and efficient as well as responsive to the production
constraints facing farmers in Ugmda. The specific objectives of the project are threefold: (a) launch and
support the key activities of NAlRO, including high priority research; (b) stenhen the lnkages and
coordlnatioa among the research system, the extension service and the agricultural faculties of the
university; and (c) improve agricultural education and traning capacity.
Project Description
7.    The projec would provide finnci assistance to support four broad sets of activities. First, the
project would support the  suatioa, deelopmen of Oe Naotiol Agdadtwl Reseorc  System
(US$7.02 millo) by financing the activiies of the NARO Board and Secretariat, improving management
systems for research programs, and impoving administrative and financia procedures. Moreover, it
would upgrade the capacity of researchers to implement the priority research programs, and it would
support efforts to design the Foresty Research Institute and NARO headquarters office, constuct the first
phase of the NARO headquarters office, undertake studies on geneating funds for research, and perform
a midterm review of progress. Second, the project would support the re n  of research Isi_tes
(-JS$4.20 million) at Setere, Tororo, Jinja and Kifu. k would also provide necessary vehicles and
research equipment. TIr, the project would support the execution of high-pri   researh program
(UJS$12.34 million) by financing incremental recurren operating cost, including salaries and allowances
under the newly introduced Terms and Conditions of Service for Research. Fourth the project would
support t     ea   the  a d   edton and enin capacity (US$5.31 million) of Makerere
University, by suppordng the tain  progms, upgrading of staff qualifications and improving facilities
and equipme  at three faculties-Agrlture and Forestry, Veterinary Medicine, and Science. The
curricula at the Colleges of MAA1F would also be improved with assistance from Makerere.
ProJect F_n ing
8. The proposed IDA Credit of US$25.04 million would finance 90 percent of total project costs,
nea of taxes. The Credit would finance 100 percent of foreign-exchange costs and between 80 and 85
percent of icmenta opeating costs and salaries. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amount and methods of proWCUrement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
scheue, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
opeation in Uganda are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. More detailed information on the
project is provided in the Staff AppraiW Report No. 11238-UG. To ease the financing of local costs in
the early years of the project, IDA would finance 100 percent of selected local-cost expendit
(incrementl salaries, aRlowances and opeating costs) for the fir  two years of the project. IDA
financing would be reduced to 70 percent of staff emoluments and 70 percent of operating oosts
thereafter. This funding arrgemet is designed to provide some lead time to enable the Government
to implement its civil service budgetary and revenue collection reform programs supported by the SAC
and EFMP, and to enable NARO to develop improved financial management systems that can respond
efficienty to changes in funding flows.

Project Jmpleutatlo
9.    The Board of NARO would oversee project implementation. The Board, through its Secretariat,
would coordinate project activities, monior and review the progress of projecs, prepare semianmual
reports for the Bank, coordinate with Makerere University on such mattets as training and contract
research, prepare required financial reports, and submit disbursement applicatios to IDA. NARO would
be establ.-shed as an autonomous agency, with responsibility for managing its own finmcial and human
resources. A Subsidiary Agreement would be entered ito betweea the Government and NARO to make
available the proceeds of the Credit to NARO. High-priority research programs would be executed by
each institut, within the framework of the rolling Five Yw Strategic Plan and the Aimual Work Plan.
Implementation of the education and traing component would be coordinated by a Training Committee
responsible to the NARO Board, which shall be chaired by the Dean of the Makerere University (MU)
Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry. Institutional twinning and mentoring arrangements would be set up
between MU and a foreign agriculural education institution to support the development of training and
research capacity at MU.
ProJec Sustaimbility
10. The availability and continuity of funding to support ongoing research activities is the greatest
threat to project sustainability. This potentW risk has been explicitly taken into account in project design.
In order to minimize funding ruiremen  only essent  facilities and equipment would be rehabilitated
and selected key staff would be trained. No new research facilities would be built. Alternative funding
sources would be explored. The Government has allocated a portion of the cess on coffee exports to fund
coffee research. The same approach is being discussed for the cotton and tea sub-secors. The project
would also finawc a study on the feasibility and modalities of an Agricultural Research Trust Fund and
othe mechanisnr for generating funds for research. At the midterm review Government's performance
in generating revenues as well as NARO's ability to obtain funding for its research programs would be
evaluated. A decision would then be taken on the need for a follow-on project to provide contned
SUpport for strengthening agricultural research in Uganda.
Leons from Put Experiec
11.   Project performance in Uganda has been adverely affected by indequate and tardy countepart
funding, inadequate salaries, weak management and financial systems, and overly complex designs. Ihe
expected beneft of other Bak-funded research projects did not materWiaz because the research was not
relevant to the needs of farmers. Ihese issues would be addressed both by IDA's adjusent agenda and
under this project. A series of measures under SAC, EFMP and ASAC (para 3) seek to improve the
availability of funding and the efficiency of the civil service. Specifically witiin the project, streamlined
finacial and managerial arrangements would Improve project management and the flow of funds. The
scheme of service, designed specifically for NARO would provide incentives to generate quality work
and reward results relevant to etension and farmer needs.
12.   A review of the implemeion experience in arcult   resech and extension ME) in Africa,
Asia and Latin America has also provided usefl lessons. In these regions, the more successful research
o    cganizatos  displayed some combination of the following caactetcs: (a) a strong central
organizaion, with overall responsibility for nost aspects of national research and the funding control to
back it up; (b) a degree of autonomy from the r utine bureaucratic structure of the Ministry of
Agriculture; (c) solid links to ngional planners and policymaers, despite the semi-autonomous or
autonomous status of the organiztion; (d) the decetralization of regional research; and (e) the active

Ratioae for tDA   lvement
13.   The proposed project supports the Country Asistance Strat  approved by the Board in March
15, 1991. IDA has suppored GOU's economic recwovery program and under ASAC is assisting in the
deepen  and broadening of the agriculture sector reform program. This project will fiufll the need for
smaller, more foced investment project to restore the effectiveness of key agriculbtu  support services
as a meam to promoto rowth. Support is necessary to strengthen sctora mangement, refurbish the
research and extension services, and to accderate and  tinalize manpower training. The success of the
IDA-supported adjustwmt process depends on rapid growth in the arictura sector. Resarch has an
importan role to play in promotag agricultal growth. IDA's direct involvement in this project Is
essental for: (a) ensuring continuity in efforts to restruce    management of agricutural research; (b)
promotng strong linkages among r  h insttutes, etenion and farmers; (c) Improving the availabity
of local funding for agcultuirl research; and (d) enhancing effective coordination among donors. The
project would also augment the impact of its recenty approved companion project in the agricultural
extnsion area.
Ach as and M  As
14.   The pposed organ ational nges in research arnmgem    have evolved from in-depth
discussion among al relevan parties. Conseu  has been reached and acton has been Intated on all
major areas. NARO has been legaly established by an Act of Parliamen  In order to ewas ba4y
bpkaeatadea,  conteud W  efidb*wr  include the appointmet of NARO's Board, the appohinent
of the NARO's Director Genral and Deputy Director General, and the apprval of a new Tem  and
Conditions of Sevice for AgricultWr Rech. In order So bU ldtio*eal c4packy ad cat an
enabin  eaJw .at jmr ueA, aursan    were obtained that: (a)  spealists in research
management, prou-remet and financial          with qualifications satisfactory to IDA will be
recruited priof to credit effectveness; (b) satisfactory system  would be established for financial,
accountig, ptoceme  and other admnisaive procedur; (c) staff wil be trained to operate the
systems within the first two years of the project; and (d) the newly Introduced Terms and Conditions of
Service for research staff will be Implmented sadsfactorily to IDA.
15.   In order to ensure that the &dlin  prgmws ar developed adequately and Implemented
expedWouay, It was agreed during negotiations that Maklr Univesity enter into 'a twInnig
arngement satis try to IDA, with an Itnalonay renownd university, which would prvide
asisncein varims nia fidds (agiuturaleension eduato, agricutural eonomics, agriculrd
engineering, food scince and thology) and in   ttution        lopm .  To incease cost
effectives, the project wod give prority to training in Eat African universides (Kenya, Tanzania
and Zmabwe) and to other countries li bdia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
h        _ fronme Assal
16.   The project, classified as Category B, is expcted to have a benign effect on the e n
Research proposas would be sdected and evaluated according to environental impact creda. Potenti
environmeal problems asociated with intesification, such as soil erosion or the Incresod use of
chemical frtilizers ad chemicals, would be addressed by reseah. Resrch on soil management
prces, crop rotion, integratd pes management ad other crop and livestock husbany pract



would reduce the potentaiY degrading ffect of cultvation and grzing on soU and water resources, and
enhnce tie susaility of cultivaton paices.
Ptm  Objecve Categries
17.   Ihe project would address the 1m1pw,y issue directly by improving the productivity of small
farmers. Ihe increase in productivity would also benefit rural women, who comprise 68 and 53 pece
of the labor for food cop and cash crep production, respectively. 'he education and trainn component
would seek to increase the awunr   and   ftcas of woemn in emnswon ant reseach, thus
impwving cOm ction between these services and their client female farmers.  More fale
reswcers and extension workers would be vilable to work with women's groups to conduct on-farm
trials that would verify the effc*dlwe   et reowwe qf ew tedmelosga, as well as to demonstrate
the superrity of these new technologies over existing pices.
Project Benefits
18.   The techological advanes reuting from a strengthened agricultural research service would
improve the productivity and profitability of crop and livestock husbandry practices among small farmers.
Farmers would increase their income. Ariculttral outu would be enhW -ed and diversified, thus
expanding food supplies and expois. The sustanability of agricuhural growth would be enhanced futher
by the education and ting component, which would focus on improving the quality ad availability
of local. trained raseachers and technicians.
19.   The uncertainty associated with depending on fin    from the Govement budget, ad potenal
weakns   with project managemen, are the prmary  ntrai  on nalizing the objectives of the
project. Elemen  of IDAWs effots to mimize fning problems by implemeng mea            at the
macro-ecomic and proje tlevel have been described in paras 3, 8, 10 and l1. These measures include
enhancing revenue collection, shifting budgetay priorities, improving the efficiency of the financial
managemnent of the Government, diversifying the sources for reseach fu , and front-loading the IDA
conttion to the project. Manageral effectiveness would be enhanced with training, technical
assistance, and iwroved moniaring ad conrol systems. A midterm review would be held prior to the
end of year 3, to asse difficulties, if any, ad adjust the deign of the project, if necary.

UGANDA: DISBURSET ISSIES
1.    Overall disbursements on the 28 investment projects in the U8anda portfolio are
satisfactoy as compaed to the country's disbursement proffle, although there has been a
marked slow-down in the growth of disbursement compaed to that of commitments. Three
projects in the portfolio, all approved In 1985, were slow disbursing: Cr. 1539-UG,
Agricultu  Development; Cr. 1560-UG, Second Power; and Cr. 1561-UG, Petroleum
Exploradon. In all three projects the civil war and subsequent tumoil and lack of security
delayed the strt implementaton by about two years. The start of the Agricultural
Development Project was particularly slow, since unrest pess  in the north untl about two
years ago. R was restructured in March 1991, and implementation has considerably improved
since then. Implemention of the Second Power Project and the Petroleum Exploration
Project was delayed by about two years becamse of the civil war (ack of access to the field
was a serious problem for the petroleum project), but the rate of implementation for both is
now satisfactory. Ptogress on PAPSCA (Project for Alleviation of Poverty and the Social
Costs of Adjustment, Cr. 2088-UG) was intially slow. The project's various component had
first to be sub-contracted to several NOOs who, in urn, had to become familiar with Bank
procurement procedures and required time to establish appropriate field implementation units
to reach the widely dispersed beneficiaries. Implemation is now satisfactory.
2.    In the agricultura portfolio, disb  in two other projects are behind appraisal
esmates. The South West Regon Agricultral Rehabiliton Project (Cr.1869-UG,
approved in FY88) was delayed because of istiutional problems in the implementation of the
feeder road component which accuns for about half of project costs. These problems have
been receny resolved and disbun are expected to accelerate. The Sugar
Rehabilitation Project (Cr 1893-UG, approved FY88) is being succsly implementd under
prate management. Disbursemeots have been slower than appraisal esmates because the
management has r-hased the rebabilitation program in order to maximize profitability.
Major procuremnt activities are underway or planmed and the project is expected to be fully
disbursed on schedule.
3.    At a Country Imle    ton Review, joindy organized by Government and the Bank,
the main recommendations for continued good implementation performance focussed on
measures to ensue: adequa and timely release of counterart funds; timely procurement of
goods and services; adequate use of Speela Account hinds and prompt dibursement
processing; improved financial management, budgetary controls, and compliance with audit
covenants; expeditious credit effectiveness; and effecdve project management and
coordination.
