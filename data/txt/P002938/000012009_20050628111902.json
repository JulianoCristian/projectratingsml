The main\n            lessons from the CSSDP, and of wide general application\n            suggest that despite commodity prices and natural\n            conditions, at times being unfavorable, a dilapidated\n            agricultural industry can re-emerge relatively quickly\n            through a committed government, and appropriate economic and\n            social policies. Moreover, the financial restructuring of a\n            bankrupt processing industry, which in this case facilitated\n            the return of experienced international operators, proved an\n            essential requirement for agricultural rehabilitation.\n            However, it is underlined that Project designs should be\n            fully complete at approval, especially in\n            production-oriented projects where some components are\n            needed to ensure that output objectives can be achieved.\n            Regarding the Agricultural Research Project, lessons suggest\n            that sustaining smallholder production requires a flow of\n            technology from research, particularly public sector\n            research is especially important in a sector dominated by\n            poor subsistence farmers, dependent on food crops. This is\n            justified on public goods and social safety net grounds, and\n            in terms of financial and economic efficiency, given the\n            high returns to agricultural research for rural areas.\n            Further lessons highlight farm systems approach, and, the\n            complementarity of research and extension."}, "docdt": "2005-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
