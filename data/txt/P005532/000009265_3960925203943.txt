SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Oman
Second Education Project (Ln. 2419-OM}
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Oman - Second Education Project
(Lu. 2419-OM) prepared by the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office. Part II was
prepared by the Borrower.
IEn Project Completion Report gives an adequate review of the project's history
but does not sufficiently discuss the full background to the delayed, restructured technical
assistance, notwithstanding that technical assistance utilization is a frequent issue for the region.
The outcome is rated as satisfactory. The project achieved its main objectives
which were appropriate given the early stage of the country's economic and school system
development. The project expanded school and teacher training facilities and increased the
supply of Omani graduates for the labor force. The project also provided rehabilitation for over
300 other govermnent schools under a loan amendment extending the closing date by two years.
This broadening of scope helped meet urgent needs for maintenance while nearly doubling the
cost of the construction component.
Technical assistance and fellowships were largely unused until the fifth year of
implementation when agreement was reached to transfer two out of three packages to the third,
follow-up project Quality improvement objectives such as curriculum development which
depended on the technical assistance were not achieved.
Institutional development was only partial. It was considerable in Project
Implementation Unit management and in sector planning where technical assistance was
implemented but not in teacher training and curiculum.
Sustainability is likely due to the Borrower's commitment to human resource
developme nt through educational expansion, efficient management and adequate local funding for
future capital and recurrent costs.
An audit is planned along with previous and/or follow-on project

SECOND EDUCATIiN PRECT (WAN 2419-OM
PROJECT COMPLETION  QPORT
This is the Project Completioc Report (PCR) for the Second
Education project in the Sultanate of Oman, for which a Bank loan 2419-OM, in
the amount of US$15.0 million was approved on May 17, 1984. The loan was
fully disbursed on May 28, 1992, about seven months before the revised Closing
Date of December 31, 1992.   The original Closing Date was December 31, 1990.
The PCM was jointly prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Division of the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Svimnary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
The preparation of the report was facilitated by data collected
during a project completion mission to Oman in September 1992. The PCR is
based, inter alia, on information contained in the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Loan Agreement, superviaion reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower, internal Bank memoranda and interviews with Omani Government
officials who were closely associated with the project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THE SlJLTTt OF QW
SECOND EDUCATION PJQOJECT
(LOAN 2419-ON)
EVALUATION SUNMARY
A.    Prolect Obiectives
1.    The project provided a mechanism for achieving the following goals: (i)
improving the quality of primary and preparatory schooling through increased
provision of teacher training; (ii) increasing the capacity and quality of
secondary education; (iii) providing increased education and training
opportunities for girls; and (iv) improving planning, management, and
financial procedures in the Ministry of Education (MOE). To accomplish these
objectives, the project financed.
(a) construction, furniture and equipment for: one teacher training
institute for boys; two general secondary schools (one for boys and one
for girls); and or.e commercial secondary school for girls;
(b) project-related technical assistance (TA) for: (i) developing
teacher training; (ii) the preparation of teachers, guides and training
programs for general secondary school science teachers; and (iii)
curriculum development for commercial secondary schools; and
(c) additional TA for: (i) improvement of planning, cost control and
management in the MOR; (ii) curriculum development for the secondary
technical school; and (iii) project implementation.
2.    In September 1989, the Government requested, and the Bank agreed to
include financing for the rehabilitation of Government-financed schools in the
project.
S.    Imnlementation BEoerience
3.    The project was successful in mieeting its objectives.  This achievement
was in part due to the fact that project school sites (with the exception of
the planned commercial school for girls - later changed to a general secondary
school for boys) were selected and acquired before the project became
effective. As a result of this action-oriented preparation strategy, all
civil works were completed between S to 12 months in advance of the appraisal
estimates. Equipment and furniture procurement experienced a minor (five-



- iv -
month) delay mainly due to its acquisition through bulk packaging with other
Government-financed school procurement. Legal covenants were all complied
with and the TA component was amended to cover assistance in the areas of: (a)
curriculum development in technical education; (b) education technology; and
(c) education plaaning. An edu4ation planning component was completed and the
remainder of the TA program is being implemented under the ongoing Third
Education project (Loan 2799-0M). Variances in project costs were the result
of increased civil works relative to the rehabilitation of ninety-seven
Government-financed schools. There was considerable savings realized in the
e -uipment and furniture component of the loan due to the bulk purchasing
n,ethod of procurement for all Government schools. The project's loan account
was fully disbursed about seven months before the amended closing date
(December 1992).
C.   Protect Results
4.   The project's objectives of expanding teacher training for primary and
preparatory school teachers and increasing secondary schooling were
accomplished. As a result, current enrollments exceed &ppraisal targets and
the institutions are currently overcrowded, even though some extensions have
been made to the original designs. Experts' services and fellowships,
although incomplete before the project's closure, were beneficial to the MON's
Projects Department as well as to the Education Planning Department in
improving the operations of these departments. The educational planning
portion of the TA package, which was completed before the project closed, was
successful in training technicians in the preparation and implementation of
school mapping; using and implementing comprehensive methods and procedures
for data gathering, analysis, costing and planning; and contributing to the
preparation of the education and human resources chapters of the national
development plan.
D.    Pro-ect Sustainabilitv
S. The efficient and economical use of' the project-financed schools is
helping to minimize the increase in recurrent expenditures. Recurrent
expenditures for the operation of project facilities are being covered by the
Government, which continues to give high priority to human resource
development. Long term assistance already in progress from the Omani-American
Joint Commission for Economic and Technical Cooperation (OPJC) is currently
providing extensive support (US$88.4 million) to Oman's education sector
through a renewed 10-year agreement.
D.   Lessons Learned
6.    The project's implementation demonstrated:
(a) the lost opportuniity for efficiency in not using a standard
design for schools (para.9); and
(b)   the lack of foresight in not including a maintenance component
into the project's design which would have put in place a
systematic program of building maintenance (para.20).

Sector:           Education
Subsector:        Secondary Education; Teacher Training for
Primary and Preparatory School Teachers.
B.    Prolect Backcround
1.    Sector De_eloyment Obiectives and Issues.  The project was prepared and
appraised during the la*te; half of 1983, mid-way through the country's Second
Five-Year Development Plan (1981-1985) which gave priority to the development
of Oman's Education and Training System (ETS) in order to meet its economic
needs for skilled manpower. During that period, there was a critical shortage
of skilled Omani labor (55 percent of the total workforce was expatriate) and
an extreme scarcity of teachers, due primarily to increased competition from
neighboring countries in recruiting high quality expatriate teachers.   Omani
teachers were few in number -- in the 1986/87 school year, there were 1750
teachers. Their numbers increased to 4,397 by 1990/91. Government's policy
also included the promotion of women's education in order to facilitate female
employment and alleviate labor shortages. Female participation in the public
sector labor force rose rapidly (an increase of 81 percent between 1979 and
1982); yet women represented only 7 percent of Omani public sector employment
in 1982.
2.    Policy Context.  Humarn resources development is closely related to the
Government's policy of Omanization, which is a major objective of -he current
Fourth (1991-95) and previous five-year development plans. The plan under
implementation at the time the project was developed focussed on three main
areas: (a) development of the formal education system, including primary,
preparatory, secondary general, specialized schools and post-secondary teacher
training; (b) improving the quality and effectiveness of existing programs;
and (c) establishing effective monitoring and review procedures to assist
future development of the ETS.   The Bank's First Education project in Oman



-2-
(Loan 980-OM) contributed significantly to the Government's efforts to lay the
fct.ndation of a modern ETS and provided critically needed student places to
cope with rapid expansion, and introduced relevant programs and curricula into
areas that were crucial to the future development of the ETS.
3.    Linka@es Between Project. Sector adMacro Policy Objectives.   In order
to address the problem of over-dependence on expatriate teachers, it was
necessary to increase secondary school (grades 10-12) places, develop
specialized secondaz.y schools and improve the quality of education.   The
Second Education project (Ln.2419) continued to support Government policy to
alleviate labor shortages through the cost-effective development of human
resources, specifically with regard to increased female participation in
education and training, to the further development of teacher training, and to
reduction of the recurrent and capital costs of education.
C.    Proiect Objectives and DescriRtion
4.    Project Objectives.  The objectives of the Second Education project
included key education and training goals such as: (i) improving the quality
of primary and preparatory schooling through increased provision of teacher
training; (ii) increasing the capacity and quality of secondary education;
(iii) providing increased edu.ation and training opport.unities for girls; and
(iv) improving planning, management, and financial procedures in the MOE. To
accomplish these objectives, the project aimed to:
(a) support the expansion of teacher training for primary and
preparatory teachers through the construction of a new teacher training
institute for boys;
(b) provide increased secondary schooling through the construction of
two general secondary schools (one for boys and one for girls) and a
girls' commercial secondary school;
(c) improve the quality of secondary education through the development
of specialized curricula and teachers' guides; and
(d) improve planning, management and financial procedures in the MOB by
introducing new planning and cost control techniques.
5.    Protect Comoonents. At . -raisal, the project consisted of the
following components:
(a) construction, furniture and equipment for: one teacher training
institute for boys; two general secondary schools (one for
boys and one for girls); and one commercial secondary school for
girls;
(b) project-related technical assistance (TA) fort (i) development of
teacher training; (ii) preparation of teachers' guides and training
programs for science teachers for general secondary schools; and (iii)
curriculum development for commercial secondary schools; and



-3-
(c) additional TA to: (i) impiove planning, cost control and nunagement
in the MOE; (ii) curriculum development for the secondary technical
school; and (iii) project implementation.
6.    Civil works were completed by April 1988 and equipment and furniture
procurement by August 1989. The Government requested and the Bank agreed to
amend the project description to include the rehabilitation of Government-
financed schools. The Loaa Agreement was amended in September 1989; and, to
ensure the completion of this work, the project - closing date was extended by
two years (to December 1992).
D.    Proiect Desian and Orcanization
7.    The project was designed and organized to respond to the urgent sectoral
needs and manpower shortages as identified in the Seccad Five-Year plan (1981-
1985). In retrospect, the project's overall design was simple and flexible
enough to incorporate the modifications requested by Government during
project implementation. M reover, the project was well prepared with a clear
and easily interpreted implementation plan that was not difficult to follow.
The counterpart Projects Department teams were well organized and
professionally well equipped to carry out the program as proposed in the
appraisal report, and they worked closely with the Bank and their counterparts
at MOE's Purchasing Department to coordinate efficiently the supply of
furniture and equipment to the newly constructed sites.
S.    Spec-ific civil works projects included the teacher training institute
(TTI) at Sur which was to assist the MOE in expanding teacher training with
the aim of graduating about 110 students each year from the two-year program
and thereby increase the annual output of trained teachers by about 18 percent
by 1990. The two secondary schools would provide secondary school
opportunities for students in the Ibra and Sahim regions. It was anticipated
that about 70 percent of the graduates would proceed to higher education or
training with the remainder proceeding to employment. The commercial
secondary school for girls in Muscat was intended to expand training
opportunities for girls, and was to be the country's first secondary
commercial school for girls, with a capacity of 270 students and an estimated
annual output of 80. However, the school was converted to a boys secondary
school, when the Government presented a compelling case that the need for such
a facility in the Muscat area had become more urgent than the need for the
girls school. The girls were compensated under the Third Education project
(Ln.2799-O0) when it was designed, as one of its boys schools was converted to
a girls school.
9.    In retrospect, a more standardized design could have been used for the
secondary schools which would have provided a simple method of improving
future building layouts and evaluating the construction implementation
experience. Moreover, it would have permitted a more focussed selection of
tested materials and fixtures, and would have improved cost-effectiveness.
The MOB Projects Department has now adopted a two-story standardized
conceptual design for secondary school buildings.



-4-
10.   In order to enhance and safeguard the investment made in the
-onstruction of the project institutions, particularly after the expiration of
the maintenance period for civil works contractual agreements, the project's
design should have incorporated a maintenance component, to facilitate a
systematic preventive maintenance and repair program. There is already some
evidence of premature cracks, water marks and peeling of building surfaces on
the newly constructed and rehabilitated schools. These may deteriorate to a
degree where emergency repairs become more costly than under a systematic
preventive maintenance lprogram. In retrospect, a maintenance component would
have improved planning and management procedures within the MOB regarding the
upkeep of buildings.
11.   The project's TA was well-conceived and organized to meet the needs of
the sector with regard to planning, cost control and management. However, its
sta-t-up was delayed until the contract with UNESCO was signed in August 1989
and October 1989 (by UNESCO and the Government respectively). The Government
then requested that the TA's design be restructured to reflect current
priorities such as the development of expertise in audio-visual technology;
curriculum development for technical education; and education planning. The
Bank agreed to this request and the contract and design of the component were
amended by UNESCO in close collaboration with the Government and tne Bank.
E.   Protect lmilementation
12.  The scope and duration of the project were changed during its
implementation phase. The original Loan Agreement, signed in June 1984 was
amended to refleot the Government's request that the commercial secondary
school for girls be changed into a general secondary school (GSS) for boys as
the demand for this type of school proved to be greater than for the
commercial type of institution, or for a girls' GSS. The Bank also approved
financing for the rehabilitation of 97 existing schools (a total of 373
classrooms) (see para. 6). To facilitate the completion of this work, the
project's closing date was extended by two years (from December 1990 to
December 1992).
13.    Project school sites (with the exception of the planned commercial
school) were selected and acquired before the arrival of the appraisal
mission. During the project's preparation phase, architectural design work
was carried out by experienced foreign architectural firms engaged by the
Projects Department.   As a result of this efficient action-oriented program
of project design, all civil works were completed between 5 to 12 months in
advance of the appraisal estimates despite the delays (actual versus appraisal
estimates) in the civil works procurement schedule, and in the tendering and
contract approval process.
14.   Equipment and furniture procurement experienced a five-month delay
mainly due to packaging with other Government-financed school procurement.
All procurement was carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines and Omani
law and contracts were approved and awarded by the National Tender Board.
Major international companies are well-established and represented in Oman;
however, the relatively small size of the works financed under the project



inhibited major international contractors, not already established in Oman,
from participating in the bidding process.
15.   Legal covenants stipulated in the Loan Agreement were all met by the
Borrower under the efficient coordination of the MOPE and the MOE. The TA
component which began after some delay and was amended late:, at Government's
request (para. 11), is being completed under the Third Education project (Loan
2799-OM) through a management services contract between UNESCO and the
Government of Oman. The original scope of the component was restructured to
cover assistance in the areas of: (a) curriculum development in technical
education; (b) education technology; and (c) education planning.
16.   Variations in original targets compared with actual implementation
performance relate primarily to project costs for civil works identified at
appraisal, which were lower than estimates due to the strength of the US
dollar and an efficienz and competitive construction industry in Oman at the
time of implementation. The actual costs for civil works increased (from the
appraisal estimate of US$14.3 million to the actual cost of US$21.36 million)
when the Bank agreed to provide further support for civil works through the
rehabilitation of some 97 schools. There was a minor delay (five months) in
the completion of equipment and furniture procurement, but the delay was cost
effective due to savings incurred through bulk procurement. Only a small
portion of the amount allocated for technical assistance was expended because
of the late start-up of TA. The loan was fully lisbursed about seven months
before the amended closing date (December 1992).
P.   Proiect Results
17.   All construction, equipping and furnishing of the institutions planned
at appraisal have been completed and 373 additional classrooms (included five
years after the project's start up) were rehabilitated. In this regard, the
project's objectives of expanding teacher training for primary and preparatory
school teachers and increasing secondary schooling were accomplished. As a
result, current enrollments exceed appraisal targets, and the schools are
currently overcrowded even though some extensions have been made to the
original designs.
18.   Only one of the three TA programs was completed under the Second
Education project - the education planning component was implemented in
cooperation with UNESCO consultants and the MOE Departments of Training,
Personnel and Planning. The TA program was successful in training technicians
in the preparation and implementation of school mapping; in devising and
implementing comprehensive methods and procedures for data gathering,
analysis, costing and planning; and in contributing to the preparation of the
education and human resources chapters of the national development plan.
Experts services and fellowships, although incomplete before the project's
closure, were beneficial to the MOE's Projects Department as well as to the
Education Planning Department in improving the operations of these
departments. Through the restructuring of the project's original TA program,
support will be provided now for curriculum development in technical
education, education technology and education planning, all of which have been



-6-
determined by the Government to be more relevant to current needs of the
country, under the Third Education Project (Loan 2799-OM).
G.    Prolect Sustainabilitv
19.   The efficient and economical use of the project-financed schools is
helping to minimize the increase in recurrent expenditures. Recurrent
expenditures for the operation of project facilities are being covered by the
Government, which continues to give high priority to human resource
development.  An ongoing Bank project - the Third Education project (Loan
2799-OM) - is assisting in consolidating the Government's priorities for the
sector and the achievements of the two completed projects (Loans 980 and 2419-
OM: the First and Second Education Projects), particularly in the area of
developing key services (management, planning and curriculum development in
the MOE); training and upgrading teachers; and increasing access to education,
particularly for girls and for children of the poor in rural areas.
20.  USAID, whose funds are administered locally by the OAJC, is currently
providing extensive support to Oman's education sector through a renewed 10-
year agreement to maintain substantial development assistance through jointly-
financed development projects. A total of US$88.4 million has been allocated
recently for scholarships, training, and school construction. OAJC assistance
has been instrumental in supporting the government's school construction
program since 1980.
H.    Bank's Performance
21.   Supervision missions were fielded annually and were assisted
considerably by the Omani authorities in the execution of their monitoring
function, specifically with regard to the civil works and equipment
procurement components of the project. The Bank's initial expertise in the
project's design and preparation was instrumental in the efficient start up of
the project. This momentum was broken when the Bank was unable to provide
more support to expedite the TA process, which was delayed until a suitable
agency could be identified to undertake its implementation. By the time the
TA got underway, the Government requested its restructuring to suit more
current needs and later requested that the component be completed under the
ongoing Third Education Project (Ln.2799-OM). The Bank was prompt in its
response to Government requests for project restructuring (e.g., in
facilitating the use of loan funds to rehabilitate Government-financed schools
and in making the project's TA program more relevant to current needs).
I.    Borrower' a Performance
22.  The role of the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOPE) as the overall
coordinator of the project's implementation was very useful and efficient.
The counterparts in charge of project supervision were well organized and
capable individuals who were greatly assisted in their daily operations by the
efficient and well-coordinated administrative systems at the MOPE and the MOE.
Bank requests for information were promptly relayed to the relevant line
agencies and Bank supervision missions were assisted in every area in the
execution of their functions.



-7-
23. The implementation of the civil works program by the Projects Department
was efficient, particularly due to the high standard of professional training
of the officials in charge and their staff. Considerable time and effort was
expended in monitoring the progress of work and construction supervision and
consultants to ensure a high standard of quality and workmanship. Project
management staff were prompt in requesting Bank approval to use loan funds to
rehabilitate 97 Government-financed schools and adapt the TA program proposed
at appraisal to one more relevant to current needs.
24.   The method of procurement of furniture and equipment, while efficiently
hand7ed through bulk purchasing for all public institutions, did not fully
facilitate the use of loan funds for this category, as the project-financed
schools were not identified for separate accounting and subsequent
reimbursement from the loan. Moreover, the records for the Bank-financed
institutions were not kept separate from those of the other Government-
financed schools and as a result, it was difficult to desegregate all of the
payments made for the project's schools from payments made for others.
Significant delays in the start up of technical assistance resulted in part
from the late designation of a local coordinator for the TA program, but TA
consultants were assisted to the extent possible in conducting their studies
and workshops to finalize the education planning program of the TA component.
J.    Borrower-Bank Relations
25.   Relations between the Bank and the Government personnel administering
the various components of the project were congenial and mutually beneficial.
supervision missions were always provided with all documentation requested and
their suggestions and recommendations were carefully considered and amiably
discussed with the relevant Government counterparts. Both parties benefitted
from each other's experience, expertise and professionalism.
K.    Consultincr Services
26.   consultant services were used, inter alia, for the preparation of
engineering designs, drawings, specifications, site surveys and construction
supervision. With regard to design services, basic requirements such as the
number and size of classrooms were provided by the MOR Projects Department.
The consultants were then free to suggest layouts for approval, and plans were
provided for new facilities and extensions, preparation of tender documents,
tender analysis, reporting, and the preparation of contract documents.
Supervision of construction sites were provided for a twelve-month period with
a full-time resident engineer at site. In summary, the expert services
utilized for executing the project's civil works were of a high, professional
standard. The ongoing TA program will be completed under the Third Education
project (Loan 2799-OM) which is due to close in December 1994.

L.    Prolect Documentation and Data
27.   The staff appraisal report and the relevant working papers provided a
useful framework for the various agencies responsible for project
implementation. These records were well documented, easy to follow and
readily available in divisional project files and central regional files. The
PCR mission was greatly facilitated in its task by both the MOFE staff, who
had all the project cost details efficiently and accurately computerized, and
the MOE's Projects Department staff, who facilitated Bank staff site visits
and the review of design specifications and plans.   As previously noted,
desegregated furniture and equipment procurement information was not readily
available, as project-specific sites had not been separated during the
purchasing exercise for all other Government schools constructed during the
same period.
M.    Conclusions and Lessons Learned
28.   The main observations and lessons of experience gained from this
project's implementation relate to the (a) lost opportunity of using one
design for the secondary schools which may have been more cost effective and
efficient (para. 9); and (b) the lack of foresight in not including a
maintenance component into the project's design which would have put in place
a systematic program of building maintenance and improved the monitoring and
upkeep of schools (para.10).

MART II: PROJECT REVI=W FROM BORROWIERS PERSPECTIVE
A.  Adeauacv and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part IIt
29.  The information contained in Part III of this Report is quite adequate
and accurate to give a reader an appreciation, in summary, of the project
statistics, objectives and speed of implementation.
B. Bank Perfomance:
30.  The supervision mission that had been coming annually during the
implementation of the project helped the borrower a lot. Not only were the
missions performing a monitoring function regarding civil works and equipment
procurement components of the project, they were also sharing with the
Borrower their world experience in projects management--drawing our attention
to possible areas of problems so that we could be on the alert. This
relationship is very much valued by us and we are thankful to all missions
that visited us.
C. Borrower's Performance:
31.  The Borrower had a need to be satisfied.  Immediately after the project
became effective, the Borrower set out to implement the project with full
speed. The completion of the schools fitted in well with the overall plan of
the Ministry. The schools were immediately put to use. A delay in
implementing a project causes increase in cost and ioss of opportunities. By
prompt implementation of the project, the Borrower implemented the original
scope of the project and rehabilitated 373 additional classrooms.
32. Second Education Project was a great success.
Ij This section was transmitted to the Bank, as shown, by the Ministry of
Education.

3/    Technical Assistance (TA) under this project was packaged under a
management services contract with UNESCO (signed in August 1989 and
October 1989 by UNESCO and the Government respectively) along with TA
for the Third Education Project (Loan 2799-ON) The education planning
component of the TA package was completed in December 1990 and its
execution was considered to be satisfactory by the Omani Government.
Nine manmonths of specialist services were utilized; one fellow training
program and one study visit were completed. The curriculum development
and project implementation components are still being implemented under
the Third Education Project, which is due to close in December 1994.

I/ The Bank, by an amendment of the Loan Agreement in October
1989, approved the Government's request to expand the
civil works for the project to include the rehabilitation
of Government-built schools.
aJ Government's policy of procuring furniture and equipment
in bulk for all Government schools greatly reduced the
cost of procuring furniture and equipment for the schools
financed under the project.
l) Technical assistance, consisting of three components, is being
completed under a management services contract with UNESCO,
under the Third Education project (Loan 2799-OM). The Education Planning
component was completed under this project.
if  The Special Account was opened on August 22, 1984 and
was replenished approximately every six months. The
last replenishment of the account took place on
September 9, 1991.
