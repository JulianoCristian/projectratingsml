high demand for educated and\n            skilled manpower. The project would provide construction,\n            equipment, furniture and technical assistance (TA) for a\n            teacher training institute, two general secondary schools\n            and a commercial secondary school for girls.  Additional TA\n            would be included to assist the Ministry of Education and\n            Youth Affairs (MOE) to improve planning, cost control and\n            management of the education and training system to support\n            the development of technical education.  The project would\n            contribute to the institutional development of the MOE;\n            improve the quality of primary and preparatory schooling by\n            increasing the output of teachers, thereby alleviating the\n            acute shortage of Omani primary and preparatory teachers;\n            increase general secondary education capacity for girls and\n            provide for the first time commerical training opportunities\n            for girls, thus facilitating female participation in the\n            labor force and in higher education; and increase the\n            general secondary school places and improve the quality of\n            general and specialized secondary schooling."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
