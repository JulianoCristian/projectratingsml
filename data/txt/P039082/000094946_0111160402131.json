The overall purpose of the project was\n            to improve transport conditions along a strategic highway\n            corrisor linking Bogota with Medelllin and the ports on the\n            north coast, through an effective and sustainable\n            private-public partnership. The early termination of the\n            concession has made impossible the attainment of the Project\n            objectives in the manner and timeframe envisaged at\n            appraisal. It also left the construction works along Link 3\n            incomplete.
