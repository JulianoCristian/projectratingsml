Project aims to\n            improve transport conditions along a strategic road corridor\n            linking Bogota with Medellin and the ports on the north\n            coast through an effective and sustainable private-public\n            partnership. There are 3 components. The first comprises the\n            project works to be undertaken during the construction phase\n            of the concession. They entail re-building, operating, and\n            maintaining existing roads; constructing a new highway; and\n            establishing and managing a natural reserve of sub-Andean\n            forest to offset the project's environmental impact.\n            Road improvements include an asphalt concrete overlay and\n            improvements to sections in critical condition due to\n            recurring landslides and drainage deficiencies; tunnels,\n            bridges, and viaducts; and repaving works needed to maintain\n            the level of service along the road network assigned to the\n            concessionaire and to build the infrastructure needed to\n            collect tolls and operate the natural reserve along the Rio\n            Negro. The second component comprises 1) all the studies and\n            services needed to develop and manage the project, finalize\n            the engineering designs, and assure quality control of\n            construction and operation activities during the\n            pre-construction and construction phases; and 2) external\n            supervision services to be hired to oversee the execution of\n            the concession contract. The third component comprises\n            project expenditures related to construction that are needed\n            to mobilize private financing."}, "docdt": "1998-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
