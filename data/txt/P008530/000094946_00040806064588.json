It is expected that heating\n            plants do not cause significant odor, or dust problems,\n            since natural gas, or heavy fuel oils are to be used.\n            Neither does noise disturbances seem to be of great concern.\n            However, air quality may be potentially harmful. In\n            accordance with Latvian laws, all plants have to apply for\n            operational permits, and comply with regional environmental\n            protection regulations, and are also liable for taxes\n            regarding emissions. While its is difficult to establish\n            emissions' costs on the environment, the report\n            compares these with Swedish environmental taxes, and\n            determines each situation after suggested conversion,\n            considering the emission levels, be it from carbon dioxide,\n            sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen oxides. Demolition should be\n            performed to contain asbestos, preventing its release, by\n            packing asbestos waste until disposed at an approved\n            landfill.
