F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The operation would support three pillars - fiscal management, public sector management,
and private sector development - in two stages, with the initial disbursement made
conditional on progress to date at the time of negotiations, and the second disbursement
tied to clearly defined future goals in each area.

The benefits of the operation can be divided into three levels. At the first level, the
operation brings benefits in terms of reinforcing the Fiscal Responsibility Law and
Brazil's system of fiscal federal checks and balances. As discussed elsewhere in this
document, this system has been fundamental to assuring Brazil's national
macroeconomic stability since the Real Plan, and by reinforcing the successful
adjustment of Brazil's second largest state, the operation has considerable significance at
the national level.

Second, within the state itself, the fiscal adjustment combined with improved economic
performance will lead to poverty reduction both through higher incomes and through
increased spending available for direct poverty-reducing spending, such as education,
health, and basic local infrastructure. Work at the national level suggests that the
elasticity of poverty with respect to economic growth in Brazil is about one, and Minas is
unlikely to be a significant exception to this statistical regularity at the level of the
country. Furthermore, there is a 25% headcount ratio of poverty in the state. This
implies that a one percent increase in economic growth is likely to reduce poverty in
Minas by about a quarter of a percentage point per year, or one percent every four years.

Third, the improvements in the quality of public management in Minas will bring better
service delivery to the poor. Efforts such as results-based management and performance-
based human resource management are key in this regard.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Background

Minas Gerais is sometimes called a microcosm of Brazil. While its income level is
close to Brazil's national average (ranked 10th out of 27 states including the Federal
District), Minas contains a poor Northeastern region with the same conditions of
extreme poverty, subsistence agriculture, semi-arid climate and intermittent drought
experienced in the rest of the Northeastern Sertão. At the other extreme, the state
contains some of Brazil's most dynamic industrial areas (e.g., the Triângulo
Mineiro) and the metropolis of Belo Horizonte. In the late 1990s, that State
experienced a major fiscal crisis and defaulted on its debts with the Federal
Government. In response to the request of the new state government elected in 2003,
the Partnership for Development DPL was structured to support the Borrower in the
implementation of a significant reform program. The general context at appraisal
was as follows:

Economic Growth. Throughout the late 1980s and the 1990s the growth rate of the
Minas state economy was very close to that of Brazil. For example, after the Real
Plan, for the period 1995-1999, Brazilian GDP grew at 2.6 percent per anum, while
in Minas this growth rate was 2.9 percent (Minas' population growth has also been
close to the national rate). The exception to this representative performance was the
period 1999-2002. During this period, Minas' real incomes declined by 0.6 percent
a year while national real per capita growth was low but still positive (0.5 percent
per annum over four years).

Poverty Reduction: Poverty in Minas also broadly reflected national levels. At the
time of appraisal, using a national food-based poverty line for household per-capita
income of about R$146 (US$54) per month, Minas had a poverty headcount ratio of
about 25 percent, implying a poverty headcount of about 5 million. Using an
extreme poverty line (about half the poverty line), Minas had an extreme poverty
headcount ratio of about 8 percent (roughly 1.5 million).          Poverty had been
declining in Minas since the Real Plan, while in the Southeast as a whole it has
increased since 1998, mainly due to rising poverty in São Paulo. Between 1997 and
2003, extreme poverty in Minas Gerais fell from 9.8 percent to 8.1 percent, a
decline of 17 percent. These overall poverty figures masked considerable variation
within Minas Gerais, with lows of 10 percent in the Triângulo Mineiro and highs of
56 percent in the Vale do Jequitinhonha.

Economic Management: Upon assuming power on January 1, 2003, the State
Government launched a managerial shake-up that aimed for a major fiscal
turnaround and to lay the foundations for improved public-sector management.
Such an adjustment required further detailed legal reforms and fundamental



                                      1

changes in the state model of public sector management. A major challenge was to
control growth of public expenditures.        In 2003, "rigid" state expenditures
(personnel, interest payments, constitutional transfers, and debt amortizations)
represented 82 percent of total expenditure (down from more than 85 percent
through 2000). Even the remaining 18 percent were not fully discretionary.

In addition, given the economic crisis the new Government had significant concerns
about the development and competitiveness of the state's private sector. It saw the
development of private­public partnerships (PPPs) as a key element to restoring
investment levels and developing the private sector.

At the time of appraisal three key benefits of the operation were foreseen. First, the
operation would reinforce the relatively new Fiscal Responsibility Law and the
checks and balances in Brazil's system of fiscal federalism. This system has been
fundamental to assuring Brazil's national macroeconomic stability since the Real
Plan and the operation helped to reinforce the successful adjustment of one of
Brazil's largest states.   Second, within the state itself, the fiscal adjustment
combined with improved economic performance would lead to reduced poverty
both through higher incomes and through increased spending available for
education, health, and basic local infrastructure. Third, the improvements in the
quality of public management in Minas would bring better service delivery to the
poor. Efforts to develop results-based management and performance-based human
resource management were seen as critical in this regard.

Rationale for Bank involvement

This operation was consistent with CAS objectives. The Bank Country Assistance
Strategy for Brazil, 2004­07, sought a more equitable, sustainable, competitive
Brazil. The State's own development strategy and the operational structure reflected
the CAS design: the Partnership for Development aimed at pursuing a more
equitable,   sustainable,  competitive   Minas     Gerais.  By    supporting   fiscal
sustainability, public sector management (with elements that enhance both equity
and sustainability) and private sector competitiveness, the operation was consistent
with the CAS.

As mentioned above, the operation aimed at reinforcing the Fiscal Responsibility
Law. By improving the quality of state government spending, and by tying
disbursement to the achievement of fiscal targets agreed to with the Federal
Government but at the same time providing the state with funding protection for its
own priority investments, the operation contributed to the overall strengthening of
Brazilian fiscal federalism as embodied in the LRF and related agreements.

Another rationale for Bank involvement was technical knowledge transfer. Within
certain areas there was scope for the Bank to advise the Government on technical
aspects of policy design. Examples are the design of PPP contracts and regulatory
framework, in systems of results-based management, and in human resource
management. Technical inputs had already been provided at project preparation


                                      2

stage on some of these issues. All were areas where the Bank had technical
expertise to offer.

In addition, the project provided an internal commitment device for complex
reforms. Even in cases where technically the State Government had already
developed clear proposals, many of the reforms envisaged were quite complex. By
laying out an action plan and timetable for implementation of the reforms, the
operation was meant to assist the Government's own efforts.

The project also protected core investments. The liquidity provided by the loan in
combination with the commitments undertaken by the Government to accord
priority to certain structural projects implied that the loan enhanced the
Government's ability to plan for a prolonged program of core investments,
particularly in infrastructure.

Finally, providing external credibility to a serious state reform and promoting
Minas Gerais to investors was another rationale for Bank involvement. The
signaling role of a Bank project at that stage, clearly associated with the
Government's program of structural reforms was very important to a Government
coming out of a difficult economic period. This was validated by the strength of the
Government's team putting the reforms together and the seriousness with which the
program was pursued.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

As per the Program Document, the operation would support three pillars - fiscal
management, public sector management, and private sector development - in two
stages, with the initial disbursement made conditional on progress to date at the
time of negotiations, and the second disbursement tied to clearly defined future
goals in each area. The specific PDO and intermediate indicators are set out in the
following table:

                                     minimization of fiscal risks.

(i)     Ensuring Fiscal Balance

1) Compliance with the federal fiscal framework

The strong fiscal adjustments in Brazil since 1998 have been underpinned by a set
of robust legal and administrative mechanisms to encourage sub-national
governments to comply with the national fiscal adjustment goals. Two of the most
important mechanisms are the bilateral debt refinancing agreements between the
National Treasury (STN) and each state government, including Minas Gerais, and
the Law of Fiscal Responsibility (LRF). Since 2003, the Minas Government has
managed to meet the set of performance targets specified by both these mechanisms,
including the steady increase in the primary surplus (from R$665 million in 2002 to
R$1,263 million in 2004) and the reduction in the ratio of personnel expenditures to
net current revenues (RCL) to the level stipulated in the agreement of the state with
the STN (from 71% in 2002 to 61% in 2004). These achievements constituted
conditions for the first-tranche release.

For the second tranche, the State Government committed itself to achieving the
level of primary surplus in 2005 as agreed to in its agreement with the STN
(R$1,596 million), and to maintaining the ratio of personnel expenditures to 60%
or less of the RCL. These key fiscal variables are under the Government's direct
control and thus are the best indicators of the maintenance of the sound fiscal policy
during the duration of the operation. Barring negative movements in other variables
that affect the debt dynamics of the state (e.g., exchange rate), these measures were
expected to contribute positively to improvements in key macro indicators
including the debt burden, as measured in terms of the debt to net current revenue
ratio.

2) Reduction of the public debt burden

At project appraisal, one of the major risks to debt sustainability was the sheer size
of the current stock of debt and the high financial costs involved with some of the
debts. The State Government had been aggressively pursuing a strategy of reducing
financial costs of the debt stock. One of the concrete measures taken was to reduce
significantly floating debts (pending payments) owed to providers of goods and
services (by R$441 million in 2003 and R$611 in 2004). Such floating debts would
have arisen from irresponsible expenditure management, where purchase
commitments were made beyond the Government's capacity to pay. The reduction
of these pending payments (debts) to providers of goods and services to the State
Government has reportedly brought about an additional benefit of lowering the cost
of government procurement. The assurance of timely payment removes private
suppliers' incentives to try to cover the cost of delayed payments with inflation of
bidding prices.



                                       10

Most of the state's debt is now owed to the Federal Government through the
aforementioned debt refinancing agreement, and thus is not subject to financial
management for the purpose of cost reduction.           For the second tranche, the
Government's debt management plan called for it to retire at least R$100 million
worth of the most costly debts from the stock of the consolidated debt and/or the
outstanding floating debt, which was accomplished.

3) Modernization of the State Revenue Sub-Secretariat

The long-term aim of the state in the area of tax collection was to generate
sufficient stable revenue from its own sources (i.e., net of transfers from the Federal
Government, which in 2003 represented approximately 14 percent of total
revenues) to smooth the State Government's spending over the economic cycle and
thus make the state's fiscal policy counter-cyclical.

A significant step forward was the establishment of "matrix management" of tax
collection in the state revenue service (SRE). This brought the state the ability to
cross-check tax claims from different information sources, increasing its ability to
enforce tax collection and detect evasion. To further sharpen a results focus, SRE
signed a results agreement (as part of the SEPLAG-led Choque de Gestão) to
formalize its performance management scheme, and installed a computerized
information management system for tax payer registration and information under
the Tax Administration Modernization Project (PROMAT).                These measures
translated into a 6.2 percent real rise in ICMS receipts in 2003 over 2002 (versus
3.9 percent nationally) and an estimated 12.2 percent real rise in ICMS receipts in
2004 over 2003 (versus 8.9 percent nationally). These gains were based mostly on
improvements in efficiency (as opposed to economic growth or changes in the tax
code). Collection efficiency also increased on the other taxes raised by the State
Government. These efficiency gains came from modernized systems, the above-
mentioned matrix management, and improved human-resource management in the
state revenue service. The long-term measure of impact is the rate of growth of the
state's own tax revenues, which has continued to increase since the time of
appraisal.

For the second tranche release, the Government installed additional modules of the
State's Integrated Tax Administration System (Sistema Integrado de Arrecadação
da Receita Estadual, SIARE), with the inclusion of the following modules on tax
collection: the taxpayers' fiscal balance (tax debt and credit to the Government), the
special regime of control and supervision, the authorized fiscal document control,
the automatic issuance of tax receipts for small firms and independent producers,
and electronic data management.

(ii)    Excellence in Public Management

1) Optimization of human resource management



                                      11

Having achieved important financial savings from rationalization of the wage bill,
the Government was keen to ensure that the financial gains achieved through
control of the aggregate wage bill were not easily reversed by imprudent future
decisions. To this end, the Government adopted a centralized decision-making
structure to ensure new hiring decisions were made with present and future fiscal
implications in mind. In parallel, SEPLAG had centralized management of payrolls,
including of the Indirect Administration entities to gain full control over salary
payments and standardize criteria for concession of benefits to public servants. A
key element of this approach was the objective of reducing the automatic growth
("crescimento vegetativo") of the wage bill inherent in pay systems with bonuses
based on seniority.

To aid the centralizing decisions in order to establish strategic control, the
Government has worked to improve its integrated personnel data system (SISAP).
Some of the SISAP modules were not fully operational, but the Government
worked toward the system's full operationalization during 2006. Installation of a
new payment module that is integrated with SISAP was a condition for a second-
tranche release.

Another key pillar of the Minas Gerais Government's human resource management
reforms was to enhance the merit basis and performance orientation of public
servants. The Government introduced a new career structure and established 14
groupings for its civil servants, not only with a view to developing merit-based
human resource structures, but also to increase flexibility in strategic management
of human resources.      Seventy percent of its staff was re-assigned into such
groupings at the time. Besides strengthening the merit principle in staff recruitment,
the new careers would provide clear incentives for both aspirants to the public
service and those who are already working for the public administration, allowing
the Government to invest in capacity building of the existing staff, and, because of
its more flexible design, letting the Government re-deploy staff more easily than in
the past.

2) Efficiency and economy in logistics and supply management

In January 2004 the State Government launched a new IT system named SIAD ­
Sistema Integrado de Administração de Bens e Serviços ­ which had been a key
component in the State's efforts to control expenditures, decrease waste, and
improve value for money. Unit costs for supplies were cut (in the case of certain
medical supplies by up to 50 percent) through cross-checking prices and tighter
controls over procurement. Overall the average economy on government purchases
had been of the order of 18 percent. By 2005, the system covered more than 90
percent of purchases.

The Government expanded the use of the registration of prices method of
procurement more widely. This is a method, authorized in the federal procurement



                                      12

       law, whereby the government can solicit price proposals from would-be suppliers
       without having to commit to purchasing services at the time of the bidding. The
       Government operationalized this method through installation of a SIAD module for
       the use of electronic registration of prices in government purchases through the
       pregão modality (reverse auction). It also created a new SIAD vehicle registration
       module for all the 16 State Secretariats so that the fleets of motor vehicles, an
       important segment of the state's physical assets, were and continue to be efficiently
       managed.

       3) Installation of results-based management

       The core of the Minas Gerais Government's results-based management initiative
       was the creation of GERAES Program as an operational framework for strategic
       management of Government priorities through the 31 "structural projects." These
       projects received preferential treatment in terms of management attention and
       budgetary allocations.        In 2005, the Government defined and agreed on
       performance goals and benchmarks for all 31 of the "structural projects" and
       entered this data in the central project monitoring system ("Control Panel") for
       regular monitoring of their performance.

       Results agreements were a key managerial instrument introduced to enhance the
       results-orientations not only of the "structural projects" but also of selected
       government agencies.        At first tranche, the Government had signed results
       agreement with three "structural projects" and seventeen government agencies,
       and, as second-tranche conditions, extended the number of results agreements to
       one more agency and also reviewed and renewed existing results agreements of at
       least five of the six agencies listed below:1

               · Instituto Estadual de Florestas ­ IEF;
               · Fundação Estadual do Meio Ambiente ­ FEAM;
               · Instituto Mineiro de Gestão das Águas ­ IGAM;
               · Instituto Mineiro de Agropecuária ­ IMA;
               · Instituto de Pesos e Medidas do Estado de Minas Gerais ­ IPEM;
               · Secretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente - SEMAD.

       Finally, a new initiative the state was developing to improve the quality of social
       service delivery was the use of so-called OSCIPs (Civil Society Organizations with
       Public Interests). In this OSCIP arrangement, the Government would first certify
       interested organizations as potential candidates for eventual performance-based
       contracts, and then enter into partnership agreements with those organizations that

Secretariats and in 2007 the approach to results agreements was updated and refined based
on the experience to date.

are deemed most suited to provide specified social services. The Government had
already signed six partnership agreements for OSCIP arrangements.

4) Promotion of transparency and access to government information and services
    (e-government)

Systematic and extensive use of e-government tools was one of the features of the
Minas Gerais Government's approach to public management reform.                 The
Government created the Executive Committee of the Electronic Government to
establish a common focus among the e-government initiatives. Composed of 21
Deputy-Secretaries, the Committee has the authority to set standards for content and
quality of information and services provided by Portal Minas, the Government
website. The Electronic Governance Department from SEPLAG was responsible
for implementation of Committee resolutions such as carrying on content
evaluations and audit of each agency's home page.

Portal Minas was created in 2004 to be a door for government services. The
concept was to change organization of information from a formal (institutional)
structure into a more user-friendly one according to subject matters of interest to
citizens (education, health) and types of services that they seek. The portal's user-
friendliness is enhanced with the organization of access to government services
around "life events," which use more accessible language, like "Getting you
driver's license", "Paying the IPVA" to make information search easier and faster.

Finally, as further effort to promote information flow, the Government created a
new portal, the Portal de Planejamento e Orçamento, with the purpose of
consolidating the integration of the planning and budgeting processes so as to
improve the monitoring of the structural projects. This portal made the project
management methodology more efficient through the use of technology.            The
launch of the Portal de Planejamento e Orçamento constituted a second-tranche
release condition.

(iii)   Promotion of Private Sector Development

1) Enhancement of the investment climate

Many of the reforms described in earlier sections represented contributions to the
investment climate; for example, e-government and procurement reform, as well as
the elimination of arrears in the public accounts, all bring benefits to the private
sector.   In addition, the following specific reforms strengthened the business
environment in Minas Gerais.

First, the State Government initiated a set of streamlined processes for
entrepreneurs wishing to start a business, including linkages to investment
promotion, advisory, credit, and training services provided by the state for
businesses wishing to invest there. These measures had been implemented under



                                     14

the umbrella project Facilitá Minas, which includes a special line of credit for small
and micro enterprises and a "one-stop shop" (Minas Fácil) for registering new firms.

Second, Simples Minas, a program initiated in January 2005, provides micro, small
and medium enterprises with differentiated tax administration systems more
appropriate to their needs, dispensing with the need for onerous paperwork,
reducing the number of procedures, and simplifying tax calculations.

Third, adoption of a streamlined environmental licensing procedure with the use of
decentralized regional offices and web-based applications for environmental
licenses simplified private firms' investment decisions. Minas Gerais is a national
leader in decentralizing, automating, and enhancing its system of environmental
licensing. Environmental licensing has now been streamlined into a "one-stop
shop" operation, in the sense that companies registering for licensing of any activity
submit a single request to the Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable
Development (SEMAD) and receive guidance on the whole environmental
licensing procedure.

The establishment of Facilitá Minas, Simples Minas, and the new environmental
licensing procedure constituted the conditions for the first-tranche release. For the
second tranche, the Government deepened these reforms by integrating the registry
of taxpayers of the state value-added tax (ICMS) into the Integrated Revenue
Administration System (SIARE) with the registry of suppliers in SIAD so that a firm
interested in bidding for government procurement would not have to contact the
Finance Secretariat separately to obtain the proof of no ICMS tax debt.



2) Public-private partnership

Minas Gerais was the first Brazilian state to pass a PPP law (Law 14.868, of
December 16, 2003: see Annex 7). Management structures were already in place
within the Secretariat for Economic Development (with grant financing from IDB),
financial guarantee mechanisms were developed, and the modeling of the first five
projects was at that time underway. PPP was viewed by the state government as an
innovative means to provide core infrastructure services with emphasis on roads
and sanitation, to improve public service delivery, and to reduce regional disparities.

The Minas Gerais PPP Law, like its Federal counterpart, established the legal and
administrative framework within which PPP can occur. Key elements of the new
framework included the creation of guarantee mechanisms, with the participation of
a state company (CODEMIG: Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Estado de Minas
Gerais) as a contractual counterpart and the holder of assets to finance the payment
of private-sector partners.




                                     15

The Minas law is in some aspects more restrictive than the federal law (or that of
São Paulo, another state with its own PPP law): projects must appear in the state
multiyear investment plan (PPAG), and PPP cannot cover, for example, the simple
sub-contracting of public-service delivery labor costs. Projects must also cover a
period of at least five years and be for a value in excess of R$20 million. These
restrictions are designed to reduce the risk of PPP becoming a source of significant
future fiscal risk, through its overuse in cases where other modes of public
contracting are already appropriate. Finally, and perhaps most important, the law
requires that for all PPP contracts, prior technical studies clearly establish cost-
benefit gains of PPP in comparison with the alternative of public provision, to
ensure that PPP improves the efficiency of the use of public resources by the state
government.

For the purpose of loan disbursement, the prior actions for the first tranche were the
approval by the Minas Gerais Legislative Assembly of the State PPP Law and the
creation of the specialized PPP unit within the Secretariat of Economic
Development.     Prior to the second tranche release, the Government planned
concluded the design of a PPP guarantee mechanism

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

The Government of Minas Gerais undertook the implementation of the reform
program with great dedication, seriousness and professionalism. The entire State
team was dedicated to implementation of the program and made great efforts to
assure that the entirety of the State's civil service understood the goals and
objectives of the program and bought into the major aspects of the program.
Coordination across the State's units was smooth aiding overall implementation

The program (and project) was implemented in an extremely effective way with
outcomes surpassing expectations, as seen below, implementation of many
conditions typically surpassed the required conditionality. The State has had a
major turnaround in its fiscal accounts with consistent surpluses since 2004,
investment has risen sharply and the Choque de Gestão approach is now well
known within Brazil (and internationally) as an example of effective results-based
management. In 2007, the State's Administration was re-elected by a significant
majority based on the success of the program.

           PPP.                                      to design a mechanism for provision of guarantees for
                                                     PPP projects. These consultancy services were paid
                                                     for by a Technical Assistance Grant from the IADB
                                                     and endorsed by the Borrower. Results from the
                                                     consultancy services suggested the creation of a public
                                                     enterprise, specifically dedicated to provide guarantees
                                                     for PPP projects. The Government of Minas has been
                                                     active in developing five major PPP projects as pilots
                                                     for moving forward on this front and has approached
                                                     the Bank for additional support in this area. Further
                                                     work on PPPs has been incorporated into the Second
                                                     Minas Gerais Development Partnership Operation.



2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Release of 1st tranche: Following the Board decision, the Minas Gerais Partnership
for Development ­Development Policy Loan was signed on April 28, 2006 by the
Borrower and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).
The Loan was declared effective on May 17, 2006. The first tranche was released
on May 24, 2006. The first tranche disbursed upon loan effectiveness in recognition
of the significant legal and administrative reforms which the State Government of
Minas Gerais had already undertaken.

Release of Second tranche: In view of the overall performance and progress with
the implementation of the program supported by the loan, and in compliance with
the specific conditions of release listed in Schedule II of the Loan Agreement, the
Bank released the second tranche in the equivalent of US$70 million, to the
Borrower. The latter submitted an application for withdrawal of funds on May 15th,
2007. There were no major issues affecting implementation negatively.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and
Utilization:


The M & E system for the operation was built upon the conditionalities of the loan
set out in the previous tables. The Bank team was consistently engaged with the
Minas Gerais authorities in the implementation of the program so the
implementation of the monitoring framework and assessment of progress was on-
going. The M & E framework was fully utilized.

In addition, the administration of this loan was the responsibility of the Secretariat
of Fazenda. In its fiduciary monitoring capacity, the team conducted a Safeguards
Assessment of the Country in order to establish whether the Minas Gerais Secretary
of Fazenda control, accounting, reporting and auditing systems were in place to
manage resources, including Bank disbursements, and that they were adequate to
ensure the integrity of the operation. The assessment was done in December 2003


                                      21

     and updated in March 2004.           The assessment concluded that the financial
     management system in Minas Gerais did not present widespread vulnerabilities that
     could compromise the safeguarding of the Bank's resources. In particular its audit
     is conducted by an internationally recognized audit firm, while its internal audit
     function contributed effectively to internal control systems.        Therefore from a
     fiduciary point of view, the control environment, procedures and regulations
     governing the Bank's operation were generally adequate. Given that there was
     adequate knowledge about the soundness of the country's public financial
     management system, additional fiduciary arrangements (such as using a dedicated
     Deposit Account) had not been deemed necessary.


     2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):


     The Bank has developed a strong partnership with Minas Gerais in the development
     of its reform program. The first Minas Development Partnership Loan (a DPL of
     US$170 million) closed successfully in December 2007. On May 1st, 2008, a new
     US$976 million multi-sector SWAp operation was approved by the World Bank's
     Board of Director's for the State of Minas Gerais. The objective of this new
     operation is to take the major achievements of fiscal and results-based management
     under the Choque de Gestão and embed them in key line Secretariats in Minas. It
     supports priority expenditure programs and reforms in the public, private,
     education, health and transport sectors. The three cross-cutting themes of the
     operation are to improve the quality of spending, to support innovation in public
     sector management and to strengthen the State's systems of monitoring and
     evaluation. The project also includes a large TA component. (See Report No.
     43232-BR for further details.)


     3. Assessment of Outcomes

     3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

     The 2003 Brazil CAS for 2004-07 laid out a vision of a more equitable, sustainable,
     competitive Brazil.2 The CAS also stated:
             "Building on progress over the past year, the Bank will continue its
             ongoing relationship with sub-national governments, working in a
             more coordinated and integrated fashion in the states and
             municipalities where it is already active. Going forward, the Bank
             will selectively lend to creditworthy states. State strategies, based on
             intensive dialogue with the state's economic team on development
             priorities and goals, focus on the full array of challenges and include



2World Bank Report No. 27043-BR, December 2003.



                                            22

               policy reviews, public expenditure and other economic analysis, and
               fiduciary reviews and related capacity building, as well as other
               partners' activities in the state."

       The strategy of support to Minas Gerais was (and is) therefore linked specifically to
       the CAS objectives of strengthening macroeconomic and good governance
       foundations and the competitiveness agenda in Brazil3. For the "foundations" the
       CAS identified three long-term goals: (i) sound macroeconomic management and
       fiscal reform; (ii) more efficient public expenditure management; and (iii) good
       governance. The project was highly relevant to addressing all of these objectives.
       For the "competitive Brazil pillar", the CAS listed the following long-term goals: (i)
       improved infrastructure; (ii) a broader and more efficient financial sector; (iii)
       improved investment climate and competition; and (iv) more modern innovation
       policy. This operation supported the State's policies that are relevant to (i) and (iii)
       of these long-term goals. Links between relevant medium-term outcomes for Brazil
       set forth in the 2003 CAS and the objectives pursued through this operation were
       presented in the Program Document and are displayed in Table 4.

       Furthermore, the operation's support for the State Government's results-based
       management was in line with a key objective of the 2003 Results-based CAS,
       which stated that "the Bank would assist governments at the federal and subnational
       levels to strengthen their frameworks for better results-based management and
       budgeting (original emphasis).4

       More importantly, however, the project's objectives, design and implementation
       have been highly relevant in the on-going dialogue within Brazil with respect to
       improving the performance of the public sector. The design of the operation focused
       on the critical issues for improved performance of the Brazilian economy: fiscal
       management, excellence in public sector management and improving the
       environment for private sector investment. The program's implementation was
       highly successful and indicated that progress could be made on these issues even in
       a context where the Federal level was not moving rapidly. The Choque de Gestão
       Program has become the benchmark of results-based management reform in Brazil
       and many other states, as well as the Federal Government are looking to the
       experience of Minas Gerais as a model. The project contributed in a significant way
       to the implementation of the Government's Program. The objectives, design and
       implementation of the project were thus highly relevant.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

As mentioned, Minas Gerais has been a model for implementation of a reform
program that supports fiscal stabilization, public sector reform and private sector
development. Second tranche conditions were completed promptly and in many
areas the results achieved go well beyond expectations and specifications.

A few graphs from the presentation that the Governor of Minas Gerais gave in
Washington, DC as part of PREM week (April 15th 2008) give an indication of the
achievement of objectives:

The reforms embedded in the project helped the Government of Minas Gerais attain
restored fiscal and macroeconomic balance, a strengthened and innovative new
approach to public sector management; and an improved environment for private
sector development. All of which have manifested themselves in the improved
growth performance and poverty reduction of the state.

In addition, the expected benefits of the operation were delivered at the three
anticipated levels. At the first level, the operation reinforced the Fiscal
Responsibility Law and the checks and balances in Brazil's system of fiscal
federalism. The operation significantly reinforced the successful adjustment of one
of Brazil's largest states. Second, within the state itself, the fiscal adjustment
combined with improved economic performance have led to reduced poverty both
through higher incomes and through increased spending available for education,
health, and basic local infrastructure. Third, the reforms have helped to reduce
poverty: the poverty headcount ratio in Minas Gerais has fallen from 25 percent of
the population in 2002 to 15.4 percent of the population in 2006 (based on the latest
household survey results). Minas now has the third lowest poverty headcount ratio
among the states and a relatively high per capita family income, though issues of
inequality clearly still remain.

The rating for the achievement of the project development outcomes is therefore
seen to be Highly Satisfactory.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The Government of Minas Gerais had full ownership of the program and worked
closely with the Bank team in its development. First tranche conditions were
implemented early and by the second tranche release in May 2007, results exceeded
targets in many of the areas in the results framework (see results table above). The
results in almost every area have been fully institutionalized and sustained and
Minas Gerais is now the example in Brazil of results-based management. Other
states and, indeed other countries, have contacted them regularly in order to know
more about their approach. The Government is using the reforms embodied in the
DPL as the foundation for further reforms of results­based management,
embedding the results framework in key sector such as education, health and
transport. Because the outcomes of the loan went well beyond expectations, we
believe that the loan is correctly classified as highly satisfactory.

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

     3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
     (if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
     (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

     As seen above the improved economic and fiscal management, as well as efforts to
     strengthen public management and service delivery have contributed to poverty
     reduction and to improved service delivery, therefore contributing to social
     development. There was no specific gender component to the loan.

     (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
     (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
     development)

     The project has had a highly significant impact on institutional change and
     strengthening in Minas Gerais and as an example for other states. The program
     supported, inter alia, a realignment and new incentive framework for institutions:
     including administrative reorganization, development of an approach of civil
     service management and results assessment, the development of results agreements
     with the secretariats and a new system of oversight and management of key
     strategic projects. At the same time many bureaucratic aspects of tax administration,
     business registry and procurement were simplified and put into an electronic
     platform. Finally, these new systems improved both information flow and
     accountability to the citizens of Minas Gerais.


     (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

     There are two unintended but positive outcomes:
     1) The success of the Minas Gerais program has prompted the Federal Government
     to consider developing similar approaches for the central government and efforts
     are now underway to develop and implement these;
     2) The considerable success of the Program has led to the first case in Brazil in
     which a Governor has been re-elected on a platform of improved public sector
     management. This has led to a previously unseen emphasis of many Governors on
     their record with respect to progress in public sector management.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risks to the sustainability of the development outcomes are low. The conditions
of the DPL were such that they put in place many irreversible institutional changes.
These changes contributed to very positive outcomes, on the basis of which the
Administration was re-elected. They are now seeking, with the Bank's help, to
deepen and assure the sustainability of reforms. Of course the economy of Brazil is
currently doing well and this assists sustainability, however, many of the measures
put in place will allow the Government of Minas Gerais to manage more effectively
when the expansion comes to an end.

The conditions of the loan focused on the key issues required to improve the State's
fiscal performance, to promote excellence in public management and to strengthen
development of the private sector. While the conditions and results are detailed
above, it is worth noting that the nature of many of them was to improve the
institutional structure and incentives for the effective operation of the state in Minas
Gerais. Structural reforms such as reorganization of the structure of the
Government, civil service grades and performance management are now deeply
embedded. Improvements in systems such as tax administration, civil service pay
management and procurement have created huge savings and are unlikely to be
reversed. While the results agreements themselves have been modified and updated,
throughout the discussions in the development of the new operation, civil servants
from all secretariats have indicated that management based on results is now
something that is irreversible in Minas Gerais. In addition, citizens have become
used to the high level of transparency and focus on services and therefore pressure
for the key elements of the program to be sustained will remain.

In the Second Minas Gerais Development Partnership Project (see above), the
Government of Minas Gerais has effectively committed itself to on-going and
deepened reforms through the year 2011. This new operation, a multi-sector SWAp,
has set out a specific agenda for reform in the public, private, health, education and
transport sector, all of which build on the reforms undertaken in the DPL (see
Report No: 43232-BR for details). As a result the probable sustainability of the
development outcomes of the DPL is very high and rated as satisfactory.

Rating: Satisfactory


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)



                                       29

The Bank fielded a very strong team to prepare this operation. Detailed analysis
was undertaken on the fiscal sustainability of the State, as well as on the
development of the different areas of the program -- fiscal reform, public sector and
private sector-- to assure that the activities supported by the loan were focused,
relevant and could be effectively implemented. The team developed with the
Government an approach to supervision that was more intensive than usual, both to
respond to the Government's request that the team remain engaged and to support
project implementation.

Rating: Satisfactory

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

In the development of the project the team put together a clear results framework
(linked closely to that of the CAS) that assisted overall M & E of the project.
Through both visits to the State and regular, on-going dialogue, the team remained
involved in the evaluation of the program and the attainment of specific
conditionalities. Information and evaluation in preparation of tranche releases was
timely, however, approval of the last tranche release was delayed due to a delay in
the legal department. It should be noted that the team managing the project changed
between first and second tranche, but continuity was maintained in service to the
client. The rating for Quality of supervision is thus assessed to be satisfactory.

Rating: Satisfactory


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The Bank team performed well in both the preparation and supervision of the
project as detailed above. The ultimate evidence of this is the fact that the
Government of Minas Gerais chose in July of 2007, shortly after the completion of
the DPL, to use its entire US $ 1 billion borrowing capacity with the World Bank as
opposed to spreading it across a number of lenders (many of whom would have
been delighted to work in Minas Gerais.). This demand from the client speaks for
itself.

Rating: Satisfactory

(a) Government Performance




                                       30

The Government of Minas Gerais was an exceptional counterpart in this project. It
was extremely focused and dedicated to the preparation and implementation of a
program of reforms that would attain positive results and could be effectively
implemented. There was complete and total ownership of the program.             The
Government was dedicated to exploring the different avenues for improving their
fiscal position, strengthening public sector management and improving the
environment for the public sector. Throughout preparation and supervision of the
loan, key counterparts were always available for dialogue, prompt with decision
making, and assiduous in follow up, no matter what the level of detail. The Bank
dealt primarily with two main counterparts on the loan ­ the Secretariat of Planning
and Management and the Secretary of Finance. There was impeccable coordination
and communication between these two organizations, resulting in seamless
execution and implementation of the project. As demonstrated in the section on
results above, a significant number of targets were reached early and exceeded.
Indeed the second tranche which could have been delayed until December 2007,
was released in May and would have been released a month earlier without delays
on the Bank side. With full ownership, open dialogue, dedicated follow up, early
attainment of results and progress beyond what was expected the performance of
the borrower was clearly highly satisfactory.

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: NA. There was no separate implementing agency. The Secretariat of
Planning and Management was the implementing agency ­ see comments above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
 Rating: Highly Satisfactory ­ see part a above.




6. Lessons Learned

The design of the proposed operation reflects several important lessons:

Client ownership: Strong client ownership of the reform program was critical in its
effective design and implementation. The Government took a proactive role in
defining the policy matrix with measures that were both high impact and feasible
within the time frame of the operation. Furthermore, the State Government strongly
supported the two-tranche design, as opposed to a single-tranche design, clearly
cognizant of the implication that the release of the second tranche would be
conditional on their fulfilling the agreed conditions.

Strong Leadership: Strong leadership at the highest levels of Government was also
important for significant fiscal adjustment and deep public sector reforms to
succeed. As attested to by a track record of over five full years in government, the



                                       31

Government of Minas Gerais benefits from the necessary strength of leadership
throughout the higher levels of government. The Governor was dedicated to the
reform proposals, but also built around him a qualified and dedicated team to assure
success of the program. This leadership was critical to the success of the project.

Importance of the Fiscal Responsibility Law.            The proposed operation was
designed to work within the Fiscal Responsibility Law ­ Brazil's well-known
legislation to maintain macroeconomic stability at the national and subnational level.
It was important for this operation to support and re-enforce the implementation of
the Fiscal Responsibility Law and to further the achievement of the objectives set in
the debt agreements between the states and the Federal Government. The operation
served to assure the Federal Government's confidence that the Bank would work
within the rules at the subnational level. The project demonstrated that it is possible
for states to use external credit effectively in the pursuit of reforms that would
contribute to both state and national objectives.

Policy synergies can create an economic "virtuous circle."               The project
emphasized fiscal adjustment, innovation in public sector management and private
sector development. The emphasis given to fiscal adjustment was key because it
provided an impetus for finding better ways of doing things in both the private and
public sectors. These new approaches assisted with reducing costs, thus
contributing to the fiscal adjustment. A virtuous circle was created whereby the set
of reforms, although each very difficult, contributed to increasing growth, poverty
reduction and an economic turn-around that improved the fiscal situation, growth
and conditions for the citizens of Minas Gerais.

Even in a complex environment, change is possible. At the end of the 1990s and
early 2000s, the economic situation of Minas Gerais was very poor. While in many
cases subnational entities assume that they have little in the way of options for
action, especially in the context of a complex national environment such as Brazil,
this operation demonstrates that with the proper leadership, commitment and
dedication, change is possible. In a period of four years, Minas Gerais transformed
itself from a "problem case" to the standard bearer for effective fiscal reform in
Brazil and an internationally-known example of results-based management. The
operation also shows that the Bank, when using its resources and skills well, can
indeed play a small, but critical role in such transformations.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The partnership with the World Bank has been very beneficial for the State of
Minas Gerais and can been seen as a key factor in the successful implementation of
public sector reforms in Minas, especially those leading to the establishment of a
results-based management. The partnership is seen as important for several aspects,
including its technical and its financial assistance as well as the restoration of the
state's external credibility.



                                       32

At the time of Project preparation, the newly elected Administration was deeply
involved and committed to implementing the fiscal adjustment and reforming the
public sector. The partnership with the Bank at this moment provided Minas with
access to the Bank's knowledge and experience and also signaled the State's
commitment with the reforms and fiscal adjustment. Furthermore, the loan allowed
the State to improve the composition of its debt, reducing vulnerability.

Overall, the implementation of the Program was successful without any issues.

Annex 3. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
          (if any)

While no specific stakeholder workshop was held on the DPL per se, the Government has
undertaken extensive consultations with the public on the Plano Mineiro de
Desinvolvimento Integrado (the PMDI) on which its program is based, the Pluri-Annual
Plan (PPAG) and on the Annual Budget Laws (LDO). These consultations have occurred
through public audiences and debates organized jointly by the Legislative Assembly and
the Executive Power and through State Councils, which represent different state
organizations.

The PMDI 2003-2020 and the PPAG 2004-2007 were discussed extensively in public
audiences in October 2003. At the end of the discussion the Commission for Popular
Participation incorporated 51 proposals from civil society into the PPAG and the
Government's plans.

State Councils also play a significant role in the discussion of the State's public policies.
Some 48 State councils exist, linked to 16 State Secretariats. 43 of the Councils include
representation of civil society. The nature of these Councils can be consultative (14),
deliberative (18) or both consultative and deliberative (11). Examples of such Councils
include the Council on Environmental Policy (COPOM), the State Council on Education
(CEE), the State Council on Health (CES), the State Council on Women CEM, and the
State Council on Adolescents (CEDCA, among others.

In the development of its current strategy and program (PMDI, 2007-20023), the
Government undertook extensive discussion, which in effect can be considered a
consultation with stakeholders on the performance of the Government (and implicitly the
DPL). The PMDI 2007-2023 was developed by the Council of Social and Economic
Development (CDES) comprising 31 members from Government, (19 from the Executive,
9 from the indirect administration, one from the Legislative Assembly, and two from public
universities) and by 43 representatives of diverse civil society organizations (the Minas
Association of Municipalities, 12 associations of workers, 20 business organizations, and
10 citizens designated by the Governor.) Thus, many stakeholders participated in the
evolution of the Government's strategy.

After submission to the Legislative Assembly, there was active discussion of the PMDI
2007-2023. For example, in June 2007 the Commission of Popular Participation
promulgated a series of debates on the PMDI in order to engage civil society further in the
process. The result of these debates was to include 11 suggestions emanating from the

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


As stated in the ICR, the year 2003 marks the beginning of a managerial shake-up in Minas
Gerais, aimed at a major fiscal turnaround and at laying the foundations for improved
public-sector management. In that sense, the Choque de Gestão was composed both of
more traditional measures to promote the fiscal adjustment and of measures aimed at
modifying institutional rules and routines. In this context, the partnership with the World
Bank was of great importance for Minas Gerais.

The operation targeted three pillars ­ fiscal management, public sector management, and
private sector development ­ that were at the core of the Government's strategy to achieve
its main priorities. Hence, the Bank supported the implementation of a course of action that
was of great importance for Minas Gerais. The Bank's technical and financial assistance
was key in the accomplishment of the public sector reforms and the establishment of a
results-based management. Furthermore, the efforts towards the development of a better
investment environment set the conditions for increased economic development.

As can be seen from the achievement of loan conditionalities, described in the ICR, the
Government of Minas Gerais was greatly committed with the fiscal adjustment, the
establishment of a results-based management and the development of a better investment
environment. Many of the conditionalities were met ahead of time and were exceeded. As a
result, the Government of Minas Gerais was able to successfully implement a results-based
management and regain its investment capacity. Moreover, the loan allowed the State to
improve the composition of its debt, reducing vulnerability.

Regarding the Public-Private Partnerships, it is important to mention that by the time of
loan effectiveness, the bidding documents for the first PPP project (restoration and
management of the MG-050 highway) had been published. Thus, the first PPP of Minas
Gerais was effective in the first semester of 2007. Progress was also made towards the PPP
for the construction and management of prisons and in the general design of the PPP
structure in Minas.
