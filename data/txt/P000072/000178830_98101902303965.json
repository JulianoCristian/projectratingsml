the port from 720,000 tons per year to about\n            1,100,000 tons, increase productivity by improving port and\n            cargo handling operations and training, and assist the\n            Government in introducing an adequate tariff structure for\n            the transit of goods. It would develop the transit traffic\n            which constitutes one of Benin's most important\n            economic activities by removing one of the major bottlenecks\n            on the Cotonou-Niger and Cotonou-Nigeria axes. The project\n            risk are linked to Benin's undertaking an investment\n            which would also serve Niger and Nigeria without a formal\n            commitment by these two countries to the project. However,\n            the competitive advantages of Cotonou are strong enough to\n            assure that both Niger and Nigeria will continue using it."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
