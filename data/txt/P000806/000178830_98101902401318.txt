REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
SECOND BANJUL PORT PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Republic of The Gambia
Beneficiary:           The Gambia Ports Authority (GPA)
Amount:                SDR 5.9 million (US$6.5 million equivalent).
Terms:                 Standard
Onlending Terms:       The Government would on-lend Credit proceeds to GPA
for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest
of 11.6 percent per annum.
Project Description:  The project would help The Gambia meet present and
future traffic demand at the congested port of Banjul
through rehabilitation and expansion of port infrastruc-
ture, and by provision of training to strengthen the
Ports Authority.  The major project components are:  (a)
civil works, including construction of a new deepwater
wharf; repair work at existing wharves; land reclama-
tion and navigational improvements; (b) procurement of
floating craft and spare parts for existin,g cargo-
handling equipment; and (c) consulting services and
technical assistance for supervision of civil works
construction, training assistance to dockyard personnel,
establishment of a data compilation and interpretation
system for GPA, and related technical studies.
Project Benefits
and Risks:             The major economic benefits of the proposed project
would be reduced ship-waiting costs, and avoided
overland transport costs for traffic that might be
diverted through the port of Dakar (Senegal) if Banjul
port did not have the required capacity. Unquantified
project benefits include reduced inventory costs for
goods tied up in waiting ships, increased navigational
safety, higher productivity at the dockyard as a result
of training assistance to be provided, and. increased
cargo-handling efficiency following construction
of the new deepwater wharf.
The project civil works have been designed in accordance
with standard engineering principles, and do not involve
significant technical risks. Some uncertainty remains
regarding the potential economic effects of closer links
between The Gambia and Senegal following establishment
of the Senegambia confederation in February 1982, but
even in certain negative circumatances, Banjul Port is
still expected to retain a competitive edge due to the
lower overall transport costs with respect to its eco-
nomic hinterland as compared with the Port of Dakar.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA FOR
THE SECOND BANJUL PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of The Gambia for SDR 5.9 milliLon (US$6.5
million equivalent) to help finance the Second Banjul Port Project. The
Credit would be on standard IDA terms. Credit proceeds would be onlent to the
Gambia Ports Authority (GPA) for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at 11.6
percent a year, including capitalization of FY83 interest charges. Additional
financing for the project would be provided by a loan from the African Develop-
ment Bank (AfDB) in the amount of US$7.0 million equivalent, and a grant from
the German Aid Agency Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) in the amount of
US$2.4 million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on the Gambia, dated December 23, 1980,
has been circulated to Executive Directors.  Its conclusions, as well as the
findings of subsequent missions, are reflected in the following assessment of
the state of the economy and its prospects. Country data appear in Annex I.
The Land and its People
3.        The Republic of the Gambia comprises a narrow east-west strip of
land bordering the Gambia River and surrounded on three sides by the Republic
of Senegal. The terrain is extremely flat, maxiumum elevation being only 35
meters above sea level. Three regions can be distinguished from the mouth of
the River inland: the mangrove belt, which extends upstream for over 240 km;
the "banto faros", which become brackish swamps in the rainy season and parts
of which are under rice cultivation; and, finally, the plateau of the eastern
portion of the country, which is intensively cultivated in groundnuts, millet
and other crops.
4.        The population (about 620,000 in 1981) is predominantly rural.  Some
80 percent of of the work force derive their livelihood from agriculture and
animal husbandry. Population pressure in the rural areas is high, with a
density of about 90 per km2 of arable land. Population density and persis-
tently disappointing harvests have in recent years prompted emigration to
urban districts. Urban population growth--at an annual rate of 5 percent, as
against the national average of 2.7 percent--has aggravated already serious
urban unemployment, particularly in and around the capital and commercial
center of Banjul on the coast.



- 2-
Changing Structure of the Economy
5.        The Gambian economy is traditionally centered on the production
of groundnuts, its major foreign exchange earner and the base of its only
significant processing industry, groundnut milling. Apart from groundnuts,
cereals (millet, sorghum and rice) and livestock represent the principal
products of the agricultural sector. Despite the importance of the sector in
terms of the share of the work force engaged, its importance in relation to
the economy's overall output has declined markedly since the mid-1970's.
Today, farming and livestock account for only a little over 20 percent of GDP,
about half of that attributable to groundnuts, as against 40 percent of GDP
just five years ago. The growth of trade and transport activity, on the other
hand, signals a structural change of significant proportions. Taken together,
trade and transport have expanded at an average rate of about 12 percent a
year since the mid-1970's, and their contribution to the economy (34 percent
of GDP in 1981, as against only 13 percent five years ago) now well surpasses
that of the agricultural sector. The tourism sector, though the object of
heavy investment in the past few years, has shown disappointing results and
presently accounts for less than 4 per cent of GDP (see para. 14). Industrial
activity is limited to two groundnut crushing mills, a beverage factory and a
shoe factory, all located in Banjul. Public sector administration is compara-
tively important (14 percent of GDP) and a major source of employment (25
percent of the salaried work force).
Recent Economic Developments
6.        Having stagnated in real terms over the course of three years
1978-80 (cumulative net decline of 1.6 percent), the Gambia's GDP fell
in 1981 by a further 4.1 percent. On a per capita basis, real GDP fell some
16 percent over that four-year period. 1/
7.        The weakness of the economy as a whole in recent years is owed
largely to shortfalls in groundnut production. These shortfalls are in turn
owed to repeated drought or unseasonal rainfall beginning 1977/78, as well
as to accumulated ecological consequences of overcropping, and a variety
of institutional and financial difficulties within the agricultural sector.
For the past two years (1979/80 and 1980/81), groundnut production has
averaged 73,000 metric tons per year, less than half that recorded in the
years preceding the 1977/78 drought; and although recovery to a level of
100-110,000 metric tons had originally been forecast for 1981/82 with the
return of favorable weather, current estimates indicate a substantial
shortfall in production, this time to about 85,000 metric tons.
1/   Owing to the adoption of a substantially revised national accounts base,
The Gambia's GNP per capita is now recorded as being considerably higher
than that previously published. For 1980, the revision means an upward
adjustment from US$248 per capita to US$352 per capita ("Atlas" metho-
dology) in current prices. GNP per capita in 1981 is estimated at
US$348.



- 3 -
8.        Reflecting the decline of its economy, the country has suffered
sharply increased budgetary and balance of payments deficits since 1977/78, 1/
and has consequently lost the margins of savings it had enjoyed in previous
years.  Budgetary deficits rose beginning 1977/78 when revenue levelled out
at the same time that the Government's capital spending was stepped up to
twice its previous amounts.  Although the increased spending was heavlly
foreign-financed, the corresponding counterpart fund requirements and debt
service have placed pressure on Government savings already narrowed by eco-
nomic stagnation. The overall deficit for the current fiscal year, 1981/82,
iB estimated to approach D100 million (US$48 million), 94 percent of that
amount to be financed by foreign grants and loans.
9.        Aggravating the Government's own financial difficulties have been
those of the public enterprises. Many of these enterprises, set up in the
1970's to promote important sectors of the economy (livestock, fisheries,
public utilities, among others) have in many cases drawn on Government re-
sources and/or made wide use of banking system credit to support operating
losses or to finance investments. On the other hand, the Gambian Produce
Marketing Board (GPMB), the groundnut marketing monopoly, has consistently
shown losses since 1978/79 not only as a result of poor harvests, but also as
its resources were diverted to support Government expenditure, including local
cost requirements of development projects.
10.       Balance of payments deficits similarly widened beginning 1977/78 as
rapidly expanding domestic credit (by an average of 54 percent a year 1977/78-
1978/79) produced strongly increased demand for imports at the same time that
groundnut exports faltered. In early 1979, net foreign reserves fell to a
modestly negative position for the first time since Independence (1965), and
have c:ontinued to fall since then. For the fiscal year ending June 1981,
net reserves amounted to minus US$34 million.
11.       In an effort to restore the public finance situation, the Government
recently reached agreement with the IMF on a financial program in support of
a Stand-by arrangement for SDR 16.9 million. The 12-month arrangement, effec-
tive February 1982, supplements earlier IMF support through compensatory
financing, Trust Fund lending, and a November 1979 Stand-by. In conjunction
with the new program, the Government has taken a wide number of measures,
including increases in producer prices for groundnnts and rice, iincreases in
interest rates, and increases in prices of selected consumer goods and ser-
vices; limitations on bank credit outstanding; limitations on external borrow-
ing; and a gradual reduction in outstanding payments arrears. Notwithstanding
the stability which can be restored over time through such measures, the
highly strained public finance situation indicates a continuing need for
substantial foreign assistance on concessional terms in order to sustain
the country's development effort.
Investment Policy, Development Constraints and Options
12.       The unsatisfactory performance of the Gambian economy in recent
years is owed in part to unfavorable weather and international price deve'lop-
ments, but, as is widely recognized in the Government today, inaidequate
1/   The fiscal year extends from July through June.



- 4 -
attention has been given in the past to providing appropriate incentives and
the institutional environment necessary to stimulate agricultural production.
Additionally, investment policy under the First Five-Year Development Plan
(1975/76-1980/81) 1/ lacked appropriate emphasis on the directly productive
sectors, while concentrating on heavy undertakings in road and air transport.
With substantial foreign assistance newly available, 2/ public investment rose
rapidly, peaking in 1977/78 at a level equivalent to 32 percent of GDP, as
against only 14 percent in 1975/76, the opening year of the Plan period. The
growth of the economy, on the other hand, averaged less than 2 percent per
annum in real terms over the First Plan period.
13.       The Second Five-Year Plan (1981/82-1985/86) places renewed emphasis
to the agricultural sector (28 percent of total investment as against only 16
percent under the First Plan). Given the resource endowment of the country
and the size of the Gambian market, the agricultural sector will continue to
be a mainstay of the economy for years to come, and increased productivity
through improved extension services and credit distribution must therefore be
accorded strong priority.
14.       At the same time, the need to diversify the country's economic base
is unquestionable. Even given its poor harvests of the past few years, The
Gambia still relies on groundnuts for as much as 85 percent of its foreign
exchange earnings from domestic exports. Unfortunately, the options for
diversification are limited. The somewhat disappointing results registered in
the tourism sector, for example, reflect the generally depressed state of the
industry worldwide, but in addition, exceptionally high import requirements in
The Gambia severely narrow net foreign exchange earnings in that sector.
15.       A few options rest within the agricultural sector itself.  Experi-
ments in irrigated cropping, especially in rice, are being pursued under the
Second Plan in hopes of eventually alleviating the foreign exchange burden
of importing some 30 percent of the country's cereal requirement. Meat
production is to be expanded by inducing higher off-take rates through a new
system of pricing, and by ensuring better quality through a major animal
health program. 3/ Finally, in a move closely related to the traditional
1/   The original Five-Year Plan period was extended to cover a sixth year,
1980/81.
2/   The strong increase in investment assistance was chiefly accounted for by
OPEC sources. At the beginning of the Plan period, 1976, the Bank Group
accounted for 43 percent of The Gambia's total debt outstanding (including
undisbursed) of $14 million. By January 1981, towards the close of the
Plan period, The Gambia's debt outstanding had risen to $218 million,
with the Bank Group accounting for 13 percent, and seven OPEC sources
together accounting for 34 percent.
3/   The Gambia has the highest livestock density in Western Africa.  The
estimated livestock population in fact slightly outnumbers the human
population.



- 5 -
agricultural sector, a major investment will be made to modernize The Gambia's
groundnut crushing mills and thereby take advantage of the somewhat stronger
international prices forecast for groundnut oil than for the unprocessed
nuts.
16.       The projected real growth to be achieved through the mid-1980's,
according to the Second Plan, is about 5 percent per annum. Much of that
growth is expected to arise through investment in traditional sectors such
as thosle referred to above. However, trade and transport services also have
an important role to play in support of Plan objectives, given the unique
geographical position of The Gambia, and its natural role as an entrepot for
neighboring countries. The proposed Second Banjul Port Project is the largest
single investment to be made in the transport sector under the current Develop-
ment P:Lan, and is central to exploiting the country's great natural endowment,
the Gamrbia River, as a major economic resource.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE GAMBIA
17.       To date, the Bank Group has financed eight operations in The Gambia
totalling US$28.9 million equivalent. Of these, two were in the transport
sector (including the First Banjul Port Project), two in the rural sector, and
the rest in tourism, education, rural and urban enterprises, and energy.
Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of March 31, 1982, and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
18.       Project implementation and disbursement performance for the few
ongoing operations have been generally satisfactory, and compare reasonably
well with that of other countries in West Africa with a profile similar to
that of The Gambia. The most serious problems encountered in execution have
been a general weakness in project administration (including inefficiency in
keeping project accounts), and a difficulty in recruiting and retaining
qualified local counterpart personnel.
19.       The abovementioned problems were particularly acute in the recently
completed Rural Development Project (co-financed with the Overseas Development
Ministry (UK) and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa), which was
the most difficult and ambitious project undertaken by Government since inde-
pendence. Whenever problems have arisen, however, Government has worked in
consultation with the Association to take appropriate corrective action.
Nevertheless, the design of future IDA-financed operations, especially those
in the agriculture sector, is being simplified within objectives which are
better adapted to existing manpower constraints in The Gambia.
20.       The Bank Group will continue to assist development of The Gambia's
economic infrastructure in the areas of transport and power, and to strengthen
its very modest human resource base by incorporating appropriate! training
compcnents in all projects, as well as through independent educaLtion projects.
A major element of the Bank Group's strategy, however, is to support the
country's main directly productive sector, agriculture. In that: sector,



- 6 -
emphasis is being placed on rural development projects designed to help
improve the institutional framework and to stimulate farmer incentive. At
the same time, the Bank Group is supporting the Government's objective of
introducing greater economic diversification by assisting the development of
small- and medium-scale industries, as well as through the proposed Second
Banjul Port Project presented in this report.
21.       The proposed project would build on the first port operation sup-
ported by the Association, and would expand and modernize port infrastructure
and strengthen its managing arm, The Gambia Ports Authority. Thus, while
agriculture remains the traditional centerpiece of the economy and accordingly
calls for major attention in the Bank Group-s strategy, the proposed Second
Banjul Port Project reflects the important role of The Gambia as a commercial
center, a role which has grown rapidly in recent years, and which holds
considerable potential for the economy.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Physical Network
22.       The location of the country's administrative and commercial capital
and the port of Banjul at the mouth of the Gambia River has supported the
development of an active trade and transport sector. This sector serves not
only the transport and communications requirements of The Gambia itself, but,
since it has to handle transit traffic to and from southern Senegal, also
meets very important regional needs.
23.       Transport demand stems mainly from:  (a) the seasonal movement of
groundnuts from the fields to storage depots and processing plants, and on to
Banjul Port (and to river ports) for export; (b) the transport of imported
goods (notably cement, rice, fertilizer, and general cargo) from Banjul Port
to the hinterland and, in some cases, also on to Senegal; (c) traffic for
neighboring Senegal, whose location on both sides of The Gambia demands
continuing transit service; and (d) passenger traffic, primarily between
Banjul and other towns and villages.
24.       The most important elements of the domestic transport network have
traditionally been the port of Banjul and the river transport system. How-
ever, the Government has given high priority over the past 20 years to
improving and expanding the highway network (which now includes about 300 km
of paved roads and about 1,000 km of improved gravel or earth roads), and in
establishing an international airport which serves The Gambia's commercial and
tourist traffic. The country has no domestic air services and no railway.
Transport Policy and Planning
25.       The vital economic importance of the sector led the Government to
allocate a high proportion of total public investments in the 1976-81 Plan
period to transport and communications (para. 12).  The ongoing 1982-86 Plan



- 7 -
not only reduces the share of such investment to a more appropriate 30 percent
of total expenditures, but rightly emphasizes rehabilitation and maintenance
of existing infrastructure, coordination among existing modes of transport,
optimum utilization and only limited expansion of facilities, and undertaking
of new construction projects only to relieve obvious bottleneck situations.
26.       Overall economic planning in The Gambia is done within the Ministry
of Economic Planning and Industrial Development. However, the steady growth
of the transport sector, together with the increasing need for assuring the
most efficient use of scarce resources, has demanded improved sectoral plan-
ning alt the national level. In recognition of this need, and following a
National Transport Study implemented during 1978, a Planning Unit was estab-
lished within the Ministry of Public Works and Communications (MPWC) to
coordinate investment programs between transport sub-sectors, and to plan a
comprehensive road development effort. The Government has agreed under the
ongoing IDA-financed Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 897-GM, US$5 Million,
1979) to maintain the Planning Unit within MPWC, and to give full support to
its activities.
The Ports Sub-Sector
27.       Port Organization and Operations.  The Gambia Ports Authority (GPA)
ia a financially and operationally autonomous public agency estabLished by the
Ports Act of July 1972.  GPA's policies are set by an eight-member board of
administration, but the authority for day-to-day operations is deLegated to
the Managing Director who is appointed by the Minister-in-charge (presently
MPWC). The post of Managing Director has been vacant since mid-1981, but the
management duties have been performed by a competent Acting Direcitor. Never-
theless, in view of the pressing need to ensure rather more stabi:Lity in the
management of GPA, the Government will take all necessary action to appoint
shortly a permanent Managing Director on terms and conditions accesptable to
the Association.
28.       GPA is responsible for all operations of the Port of Banjul and
the river port at Kaur (for groundnut exports), including cargo-handling and
stevedoring. GPA also has responsibility for some financially burdensome
non-port activities, particularly the ferry services and river triansport.
However, Government has under active consideration the establishment of a
separate state-owned Authority to manage these latter activities, and has
agreed under the proposed Second Banjul Port Project that management of
non-port services (except the dockyard) would be transferred from GPA to the
proposed new Authority; and starting in July 1983 and until the transfer is
effected, Government will compensate GPA for any losses incurred from opera-
tion of these services (Section 3.02 of draft Development Credit Agreement).
29.       GPA has been functioning satisfactorily, but maintenance of port
facilities has been inadequate and infrastructure is deteriorating. The GPA
personnel establishment provides for appointment of a port engineer with
specific responsibility for managing repairs and maintenance work at Banjul

Port. The draft job description and qualification requirements prepared by
GPA have been reviewed by IDA and found acceptable. The position will
be filled only after IDA has had an opportunity to review and comment on
the qualifications and experience of proposed candidates (Section 3.02 of
draft Project Agreement).
30.       Staffing and Training.  Staffing levels for work on port operations
(including cargo-handling and stevedoring) is about adequate, but there is
some deficiency in the ability of GPA personnel to execute their administra-
tive and operational responsibilities efficiently. This deficiency is
currently being addressed by the provision of technical assistance (and
cargo-handling equipment) under a grant of US$1.5 million equivalent from the
Overseas Development Administration (U.K.). Under this assistance program,
two experts were assigned to Banjul Port in January 1982 for a period of
two years to train mechanics in the repair of cargo-handling equipment, and
to train stevedores and longshoremen in cargo-handling techniques. This ODA
assistance is being provided outside the proposed Second Banjul Port Project,
but the Association has been given the opportunity to review the detailed work
program of the experts, and ODA has agreed to make their periodic progress
reports available for review and comment.
31.       The proposed project will address one other identified weakness in
GPA's operations, namely the training of dockyard employees in mechanical
repairs, and in job costing and billing systems. Provision for this training
should ideally have been included in a Fisheries Development Project being
prepared for financing by the African Development Bank (AfDB), since this
project also provides for some improvements to the dockyard. However, inas-
much as the dockyard is a part of GPA and its inefficiencies constitute a
drain on GPA's finances, the proposed Second Banjul Port Project includes
appropriate provision for the training. More generally, the project also
provides technical assistance to establish an information system of data
compilation and interpretation to assist in management decision-making.
32.       Accounting, Budgeting, Auditing, Insurance.  GPA's accounting system
has improved considerably in recent years--partly as a result of assistance
provided under the First Banjul Port Project (paras. 38-40)--and is now main-
tained on commercial principles. Separate accounts are kept for port and
non-port activities. Fixed assets were revalued in 1979 with the assistance
of foreign consultants, and since then, have been updated annually by applying
appropriate cost indices. GPA has provided assurances under the proposed
project that a physical revaluation of fixed assets will be carried out once
every five years, and cost indices will be applied annually between the
revaluations; results of the revaluation will be incorporated in the balance
sheet for the year under review (Section 4.04 of draft Project Agreement).
33.       Annual capital and operating budgets are prepared by GPA, and
submitted through its Board to MPWC for approval. Preparation and timely
presentation of the budget have improved significantly in recent years, and it
now includes statements of operating revenues and expenditures, capital
expenditures, and a cash flow forecast for the following year.

34.       GPA's internal auditing department functions adequately under the
direct supervision of the Managing Director, and the results of the internal
audit are now included in the annual report. External audits are carried out
by a private independent auditing firm whose performance under the First
Banjul Port Project has been satisfactory. However, the audit has not
included comments on the efficiency of GPA's management or on performance of
the ports as is desirable, and there have been delays in forwarding the
reports to the Bank. GPA has agreed under the proposed Second Banjul Port
Project to take necessary corrective action and to honor the terms of the
standard audit covenant (Section 4.02 of draft Project Agreement).
35.       All fixed assets of GPA are insured with a reputable local firm, the
Gambia National Insurance Company (GNIC). GNIC reinsures GPA's assets with
foreign insurance agents, but it does not indemnify losses in freely usable
foreign currency because GPA pays its premium only in local currency. Due to
the current foreign exchange difficulties in The Gambia, GPA cannot readily
obtain foreign currency in the event this is needed to replace dauLaged or lost
equipment. In recognition of this situation, GNIC has recently agreed in
principle with the Ministry of Finance and Trade that losses incurred on GPA's
fixed assets would in future be covered up to 90 percent by a foreign agent in
freely usable foreign currencies, and the balance would be contributed by GNIC
in local currency. The Ministry would then undertake to provide foreign
exchange as required by GPA. These arrangements are now being formalized
within the Gambian administration, and the results will be communicated to the
Association.
36.       Financial Performance of GPA.  The financial indicators for port
operations over 1975-80 demonstrate that GPA has maintained a satisfactory
financial condition; particularly, the operating ratio has improvead substan-
tially over the period, and the return on net fixed assets showed good
progress from about 9% to about 21% in 1980. By contrast, the financial
results of non-port activities (ferry services, river transport, dockyard)
have been poor, largely due to high depreciation charges caused by the rapid
addition of fixed assets, and Government's reluctance, for social reasons, to
grant needed tariff increases. This situation is expected to improve starting
in fiscal year 1983 when GPA will be relieved of non-port activities (except
the dockyard), and will receive compensation from Government for losses
incurred prior to that time (para. 28). The poor performance record of non-
port activities has however led to a deterioration in GPA's overall perfor-
mance; nevertheless, its balance sheets for 1975-80 reflect a sound position,
with working capital at a satisfactory level.
37.       GPA's long-term financial objective should be to remairL as a com-
mercially-oriented, profitable, and self-sufficient entity. It Ehould
continue to generate sufficient revenue to cover all operating costs, service
its debts, and make a reasonable contribution to justified renewal and expan-
sion investments. Given these objectives, and on the basis of analysis of
GPA's forecast financial performance over 1982-88, the following principal
undertakings have been agreed under the proposed project: (i) GPA will take
all necessary measures (including tariff increases as appropriate) to achieve



- 10 -
for GPA's port operations a rate of return on average revalued net fixed
assets of not less than 7 percent per annum during the forecast period 1982-88
(Section 4.03 of draft Project Agreement); (ii) unless otherwise agreed with
the Association, GPA will not incur capital expenditures exceeding the amounts
in its investment plan for 1982-85 in the aggregate of D 2 million per year,
nor any new debt exceeding the equivalent of D 2 million per year (Section
3.05 of draft Project Agreement); and (iii) GPA will tighten its credit
policy, and the accounts receivable situation will be corrected to reduce it
to a satisfactory level of not more than 25% beginning in fiscal year 1984
(Section 4.05 of draft Project Agreement).
Bank Group Activities in the Transport Sector
38.       The Association has helped finance two transport projects in The
Gambia. The Highway Maintenance Project (partly financed by Credit 897-GM,
US$5.0 million and by EEC Special Action Credit 6-GM, US$1.7 million) was
approved in mid-1979 and has been progressing reasonably well, except for
persistent difficulties in procurement of necessary spare parts for mainte-
nance equipment. The First Banjul Port Project (partly financed by Credit
187-GM, US$2.1 million, 1971) provided for construction of a new wharf to
replace an old timber structure, a public wharf for river transport and
fishing vessels, transit sheds and other buildings, procurement of cargo-
handling equipment and small dredger, and advisory consulting services and
technical assistance for training. The project was completed successfully,
although there were some delays mainly associated with the wharf construction,
and some related cost increases which, after a supplementary project appraisal,
were financed by a US$2.4 million extension of the IDA Credit. The expected
project benefits have been largely achieved. Ship-waiting time has been
reduced significantly, although with traffic increasing much faster than
expected, the new facilities and the operational capacity of the Ports
Authority have been severely overtaxed, and port congestion has again become
common.
39.       The Project Performance Audit Report issued in March 1977 acknow-
ledged the benefits from the project, but questioned the need for creation
of an autonomous Ports Authority to manage what was then only a two-berth
facility. However, the existence of GPA as an autonomous body is considered
fully justified in view of the rapid expansion of traffic, the planned major
extensions of port infrastructure, the need to keep up with technological
developments in shipping and cargo-handling, and the financial improvements
achieved by Banjul Port under GPA-s management. Moreover, the Government
prefers to have an autonomous ports authority, and is satisfied with its
operational and financial performance.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Backgro:und
40.       The First Banjul Port Project was based on a feasibility study
prepared for the Government by consultants financed by ODA (UK). The project
had fairly limited objectives of operational, organizational, and financial
reforms of GPA, with emphasis on introduction of adequate control of cargo
movements, improvements in cargo-handling techniques, and establishment of
modern practices for commercial accounting and cost-oriented tariff structures.
Encouraged by the success of these efforts, and recognizing the importance
of continued rehabilitation and expansion of existing port facilities and
improv,ement of overall productivity to help the Banjul Port cope with greatly
increased traffic levels (including containerized traffic), the Government
in September 1978 requested assistance from the Association in preparing a
second project. It was intended that this follow-up operation would provide
for a significant expansion of port infrastructure facilities, andl would
emphasize broader institutional improvements, better operational and manage-
ment performance with specific targets for measuring this performance, and
continuing technical assistance and training for GPA personnel.
41.       The necessary feasibility study and detailed engineering for the
proposed project were financed with funds left over from Credit 187-GM for the
first operation, supplemented with an advance of US$300,000 from the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) approved in August 1979. Once these studies were
satisfactorily completed, an additional PPF advance of US$480,000 was approved
in August 1981 to finance additional consulting services for studies on the
potential for siltation in the port access channel, and to design and prepare
tender documents for some rehabilitation works which were considered to be
urgently needed to allow continuation of port operations. This work has all
been completed, and the siltation studies in particular show no negative
effects to be expected from the proposed civil works construction. However,
following the coup attempt in August 1981 and the Government's resulting
precarious foreign exchange situation, and given the critical importance
in those circumstances of maintaining traffic movements at Banjul Port, the
Association in October 1981 approved an additional PPF advance of US$200,000
on an exceptional basis to finance execution of the emergency rehabllitation
works which are now satisfactorily completed.
42.       Co-financing of the project civil works on a joint basis has been
arranged with the AfDB and the German KfW. Preparation work has also been
closely coordinated with the British ODA which is providing simultaneously,
but outside the project, a supply of cargo-handling equipment and services of
training experts (para. 30).
43.       Negotiations for the proposed Credit were held in Washington on
April 19-21 with a delegation from the Government and the Gambia Ports
Authority led by Mr. John Ndow, Acting Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of
Public Works and Communications. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 3703-GM i's
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Supplementary
project data are in Annex III.



- 12 -
Project Description
44.       The project consists of expansion and improvements at Banjul Port as
follows:
(a) Civil Works, including construction of a deepwater L-head wharf with
an access bridge and two mooring dolphins; reclamation of about
7,800 m2 of land protected against erosion by a new revetment, and
paving of about 5,100 m2 for storage of containers; extension of a
north transit shed at Banjul Wharf for cargo storage; construction
of a steel pipeline from the groundnut oil storage tank to the new
L-head wharf; construction of a repair workshop, a gatehouse and new
fencing, repair of existing fire-fighting equipment, repair of
revetments, and other miscellaneous works; improvements to naviga-
tion lights; procurement and installation of five new mooring buoys
for tying up small vessels;
(b) Floating Craft and Spare Parts: Procurement of a new pilot boat and
a mooring boat, and spare parts for existing cargo-handling equipment;
(c) Technical Assistance (about 146 man-months): Consulting services
for feasibility studies and detailed engineering, siltation studies,
supervision of civil works construction, training assistance to
dockyard personnel, and establishment of a data compilation and
interpretation system.
45.       Total project costs (net of taxes and duties from which the project
is exempt) are estimated at US$19.15 million equivalent, of which about
US$15.61 million (about 82 percent) in foreign costs. Cost estimates for
civil works and floating craft are based on tender opening prices, and costs
of spare parts on manufacturers prices. Estimates are calculated in January
1982 prices, and include contingencies as follows: (a) given the nature of
proposed civil works, especially uncertainties related to offshore piling, 25%
physical contingencies have been applied for piling and 10% for all other
works; and (b) price contingencies have been applied at 8.5 percent in 1982, and
7.5 percent annually in 1983-87.  Consulting services are estimated in 1982
prices at US$12,000 per man-month on average, including per diem, transporta-
tion, and other reimbursable items.
46.       The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 5.9 million (US$6.5 million equiva-
lent) will finance about 34 percent of total project costs, including the
entire foreign exchange element of floating craft and spare parts for existing
cargo-handling equipment, and consulting services, and about 30 percent
(US$4.6 million equivalent) of the cost of the joint-financed package of civil
and related miscellaneous works. The remaining foreign costs of the civil
works component will be financed by a loan to the Government from AfDB in the
amount of US$7.0 million equivalent, and a grant from KfW of US$2.4 million
equivalent. Total external financing will cover about 83 percent of project
costs. GPA will finance the local project costs in the amount of US$3.25
million equivalent (not including about US$290,000 to be financed under the
IDA Credit). 1/
1/   This small local cost element to be financed by IDA is part of the
PPF advance for engineering studies and execution of emergency
rehabilitation works (para. 41).



- 13 -
47.       Proceeds of the IDA Credit will be on-lent by Government to GPA
for a period of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at 11.6 percent per
annum including capitalization of FY83 interest charges. Terms and conditions
of proposed on-lending arrangements for funds provided by all external donors
will be spelled out in subsidiary loan agreements. In the case of the
IDA Credit, a draft subsidiary loan agreement has been reviewed with the
Government and GPA and found acceptable to IDA. Execution of this agreement
will be! a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit. An aLdditional
condition of effectiveness will be the signing of financing agreements between
Government and the co-donors AfDB and KfW (Section 5.01 (a) and (b) of draft
Development Credit Agreement).
Project Implementation
48.       GPA will be responsible for overall project implementation, which is
expected to be completed by end-1985. GPA has determined that the same con-
sultants who carried out the feasibility study and preparation of tender
documents (PORTCONSULT, Denmark) will be contracted to supervise the project
civil works; this arrangement is acceptable to IDA and to the co--donors.
Issues related to land acquisition for project execution, abandonment of the
old ferry terminal, and moving the location of the new river wharf to a more
appropriate site, have been reviewed with the Government and GPA, and accep-
table solutions agreed upon. The Government has also agreed to prepare and
submit to the Association by June 1984 a draft plan of action for acquisition
of land adjacent to Banjul Port which would be needed for future port develop-
ment (Sections 3.04 and 3.05 of draft Development Credit Agreement).
Procuriement and Disbursements
49.       Contractors for the civil works component (US$16 million) were
internationally prequalified in November 1981 in accordance with Bank Group
guidelines, and in consultation with AfDB and KfW. Unit price tenders were
received by GPA in mid-February 1982 and made available to the co-donors;
project cost estimates were adjusted to the lowest tender opening price.
Consultants have assisted GPA in evaluation of the tenders which will be
reviewed by IDA in consultation with the co-donors. Contracts will be signed
by GPA only after review by the co-donors of the draft evaluation report.
Procurement of motors for floating craft and spare parts for cargo-handling
equipment (US$150,000) where standardization is essential, will be directly
from the original manufacturers. Floating craft.(US$380,000) will be procured
internationally on the basis of performance specifications. Contracts for
paving of the reclaimed area after settling of the sub-soil will be offered in
accordance with local competitive bidding following procedures acceptable to
the Association. Selection of technical assistance and consulting services
will be in accordance with Bank Group guidelines (Schedule to draft Project
Agreement).
50.       Disbursements from the proposed IDA Credit will be as follows:
(i) for civil works, 23% of total expenditures - SDR 2.45 million
(US$2.7 million equivalent);



- 14 -
(ii)  for floating craft and spare parts for cargo-handling equipment,
100% of foreign expenditures - SDR 360,000 (US$400,000 equivalent);
(iii)  for consulting services and technical assistance, 100% of foreign
expenditures - SDR 1.1 million (US$1.2 million equivalent); and
(iv)  refinancing of PPF advances - SDR 880,000 (US$980,000 equivalent).
An amount of SDR 1.11 million (US$1.22 million equivalent) will remain un-
allocated. All disbursements will be fully documented.
Environmental Impact
51.       None of the proposed works should affect the existing ecology of the
Port of Banjul. Land reclamation envisaged for containers is small, and
should have no effect on the overall ecology of the area.
Project Benefits and Risks
52.       In 1980, Banjul port traffic consisted of about 224,000 tons of
imports (mainly petroleum, cement, and foodstuffs -- about 20% of these were
later re-exported to neighboring countries), and about 58,000 tons of exports
(mainly groundnut products). It is projected that through 1990 imports will
grow at about 3 percent per annum, and exports at about 7 percent from the
depressed 1980 volume. During 1980, the levels of port traffic have been
causing waiting-time averaging about 48 hours per vessel, and despite improved
productivity expected from new cargo-handling equipment and technical assis-
tance being provided through ODA, waiting-time would still increase sharply as
the old Government Wharf reaches the end of its economic life, and traffic
continues to increase.
53.       Quantified economic benefits of the proposed project are reduced
ship-waiting costs, and avoided overland transport costs for traffic that
might be diverted through the port of Dakar (Senegal) if Banjul port did not
have the required capacity; no traffic has so far been diverted via Dakar
because land transport costs are high. Unquantified project benefits include
reduced inventory costs for goods tied up in waiting ships, increased naviga-
tional safety, higher productivity at the dockyard as a result of training
assistance to be provided, and increased cargo-handling efficiency following
construction of the new wide wharf. On the basis of quantified benefits,
estimated project costs, and an assumed 20-year life of the civil works, the
project would yield an economic return estimated at 29 percent on a regional
basis, and 19 percent nationally if benefits accruing to re-exported traffic
are excluded.
54.       The project civil works have been designed in accordance with
standard engineering principles, and do not involve significant technical
risks. Some uncertainty remains as to the potential economic effects of
closer links between The Gambia and Senegal, following establishment of



- 15 -
the Senegambia Confederation in February 1982. Should exchange rates or
import tariffs be harmonized, this could exert a negative effect on Banjul's
competitive position. It is nonetheless expected that Banjul Port would
retain a competitive edge due to the lower overall transport costs (including
maritime, port, and land transport) with respect to its economic hinterland as
compared with the Port of Dakar.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of The
Gambia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Republic
of The Gambia and the Ports Authority, and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
56.       Special features of the draft Development Credit and Project Agree-
ments are referred to in the text and listed in Section III of Annesx III to
this report. Special conditions of Credit effectiveness are: (a) execution
of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and GPA for onlending
proceeds of the IDA Credit (para. 47); and (b) signing of the AfDB and KfW
financing agreements (para. 47).
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

B.   Projects in Execution*
Cr. No. 602    Infrastructure and Tourism Project; US$4.0 Million Credit of
January 12, 1976; Effective Date: December 16, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982.
The project provides basic infrastructure for tourism development,
expansion of public utilities, and technical assistance to The Gambia
Utilities Corporation (GUC). The project is expected to be fully disbursed
during this year, and a project completion mission is being schedulded.
Cr. No. 644    Rural Development Project: US$4.1 Million Credit of July 19,
1976; Effective Date: November 24, 1976; Closing Date:
March 31, 1982
The project is now completed, but its implementation has been
hampered by managerial problems, resulting in objectives only being partly
met. The project has also been affected by sectoral problems, particularly
the breakdown of the agricultural credit system. To take the experience of
the project into account and to analyze the implications of the sectoral
developments, appraisal of a proposed follow-up project has been delayed until
about end-1982.
Cr. No. 792-GM Gambia Education Project: US$5.5 Million Credit of May 26,
1978; Effectiveness Date: October 26, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
After an initial delay of about one year in project implementation
due to problems in the recruitment of technical assistance for the Project
Unit, implementation has progressed satisfactorily. The first phase of school
construction is completed. Civil works for the second phase of construction,
and procurement of furniture and equipment are under way. Disbursements are
still lagging behind appraisal estimates, but are accelerating with the advance-
ment of civil works. The upgrading programs for secondary school teachers and
for instructors at the Technical Institute have been finalized. Curriculum
development for secondary science and practical subjects and for the nurses'
training program is also completed.
All technical assistance personnel have been recruited, except for
the health planner and the general management specialist. The Canadian
bilateral technical assistance is expected to join the technical institute at
the beginning of the school year 1982/83. The UNDP program for technical
assistance to the Management Training Institute is in preparation, and experts
are expected to join in the 1982/83 school year.
*    These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 814-GM Rural And Urban Enterprises Project: US$3 Million Credit of
May 26, 1978; Effectiveness Date: September 29, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The line of credit to Gambia Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB)
is almost fully committed with 60 subprojects approved since credit effective-
ness. Institution building remains difficult, and US$180,000 have recently
been reallocated for additional technical assistance. GCDB still has to com-
plete the financing plan for its new office building.
Cr. No. 897-GM Highway Maintenance Project: US$5 million Credit of
May 10, 1979; Effectiveness Date: July 20, 1979;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project consists of a four-year maintenance program including
routine and periodic maintenance of selected roads; installation of a weighing
bridge and procurement of equipment; technical assistance to the Public Works
Department; and a mechanical engineering fellowship. The EEC Special Action
Credit (6-GM, US$1.7 million) supplementing the IDA credit has been fully
disbursed. Field implementation of the routine and periodic maintenance
programs is good, but is handicapped at present by a lack of spare parts.
The Government is aware of the problems posed by this situation, but has
so far been unable to propose a workable solution for timely procurement of
equipment spare parts.
Cr. No. 1187-GM Energy Project: US$1.5 million Credit of December 22, 1981;
Effectiveness Date: Not yet Effective; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
The project would assist the Government in developing a strategy
for accelerating hydrocarbon exploration in the country, and in strengthening
the electric power sector. It would also support Government's efforts to make
better use of its forest resources. Although a number of actions have been
taken by the Government to meet the conditions of effectiveness, it is likely
that the terminal date will need to be postponed. Steps have been taken,
however, to start project implementation. Bids for the electric power com-
ponent, which includes distribution facilities, have been received and the
contract is likely to be awarded shortly. A recent supervision mission has
been discussing implementation of the exploration and forestry components.
