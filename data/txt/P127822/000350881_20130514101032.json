Vert\n            Program for Morocco is to increase the agri-food\n            sector's productivity and diversification with the goal\n            of maintaining higher rates of agricultural growth and\n            employment. The Development Policy Loan (DPL) is a key\n            component of the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)\n            (FY10-FY13). It also contributes directly to the three\n            pillars around which the World Bank's program is\n            structured: 1) growth, competitiveness, and employment; 2)\n            service delivery to citizens; and 3) sustainable development\n            in a changing climate. The program supports an ambitious\n            Government initiative in the agriculture sector and builds\n            on extensive dialogue between the World Bank and the\n            Government of Morocco (GoM) and is underpinned by a large\n            body of analytical work and sector operations. The program\n            has benefited from a broad range of analytical work recently\n            completed by the World Bank and others. The program also\n            builds on the outcomes and experience from past and ongoing\n            World Bank operations in water and irrigation, integrated\n            rural development, human development, and public sector\n            administration reform."}, "docdt": "2013-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
