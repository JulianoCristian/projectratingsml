gains in\n            macroeconomic management and to move beyond stabilization to\n            deeper structural reforms and sustained economic growth. The\n            Credit assists the Government in gaining competitiveness; in\n            stimulating resource mobilization, private investment flows,\n            and external trade; and in improving efficiency. This one\n            tranche operation, fully consistent with the new Country\n            Assistance Strategy under preparation, would be the second\n            in a series of such operations to support a reform program\n            aimed at: 1) enhancing the competitiveness of the economy to\n            substantially raise growth rates over the medium term and\n            alleviate poverty; 2) improving public finance management,\n            particularly concerning tax policy and the use of public\n            resources; and 3) completing the third phase of the common\n            external tariff (CET) adopted by the West African Economic\n            and Monetary Union (WAEMU) on January 1, 2000. When fully\n            implemented, the reform program could result in improved\n            allocative efficiency that could raise real growth, and as a\n            result of faster growth and improved social service\n            delivery, bring about a substantial decline in poverty.\n            Also, by focusing on revenue mobilization and the efficient\n            reallocation of public resources towards priority areas, the\n            operation is expected to ensure that these key sectors would\n            not suffer from budgetary cuts during the transition."}, "docdt": "1999-11-09T00:00:00Z"}
