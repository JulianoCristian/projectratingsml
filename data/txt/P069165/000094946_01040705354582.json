"Overall, the outcome of the project is\n            seen as satisfactory, with a sustainable likelihood, and\n            substantial institutional development impacts, where both\n            the Bank, and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory.\n            Key lessons stress the effectiveness of a single-tranche\n            operation in addressing specific issues, and providing\n            limited budget support to the Government (in the context of\n            a difficult policy dialogue), for it allowed time to build\n            consensus on the reform agenda, while avoiding the\n            requirements of conditionality-driven operations. Moreover,\n            the effective timing of the project's financial\n            assistance - tied to the budget cycle - provided\n            compensatory financing for a reform program, as well as the\n            availability of funds, for the Government's fiscal year\n            2000 to be included in budgetary planning. Given the nature\n            of adjustment lending, it is appropriate to focus on the\n            Government's overall use of resources, rather than\n            specific uses of Bank funds, which addresses the need for\n            sound knowledge on the country's public financial\n            management. The project was thus instrumental in preparing\n            the analytical work, and in supporting policy reforms, and\n            institutional changes needed to improve financial\n            accountability, paving the way for the Country Procurement\n            Assessment Report, and upcoming Country Financial\n            Accountability Assessment. The long-term transition process,\n            will benefit from this initial effort, particularly from the\n            project's tax, and trade reform, which created an\n            environment conducive to efficient private sector\n            investment, and growth."}, "docdt": "2000-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
