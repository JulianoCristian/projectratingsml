MEXICO
BAJO RIO BRAVO/BAJO RIO SAN JUAN IRRIGATION REHABILITATION II
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
The Resource Base
1.01      Mexico has a land area of about 200 míllíon ha, with a population of
about 71 million, growing at an annual rate of 2.9%. Out of the total area
of the country, about 30 million ha are considered cultivable, 78 million ha
are classified as range land, 44 million are suitable for forestry and the
remainder (about 50 million ha) is either too dry, too poorly drained, or too
steep for any form of food or fiber production. Of the estimated 30 million
ha of potentially arable land, an average 15 million ha is presently cropped,
includíng approximately 5 million ha under irrigation.
Agricultural Production
1.02      From 1945 to 1965, the value of agricultural production grew more
than 5% per year. After 1965, however, production growth rates of major
cereal crops fell behind the growth in domestic demand.  As a result, agri-
culture's contribution to the GDP declined from 16% in 1960 to about 9% in
1978. Nonetheless, in contrast to the slow growth in crop production, líve-
stock production increased steadily throughout the 1970s at an annual average
rate of about 4%. The volume of agricultural production from 1961 to 1980
is shown ín Annex 2, Table 1.
1.03      The main reasons for the fast growth rate in agricultural production
between 1945 and 1965 were the rapid expansion of irrigated lands and the
effects of successful research on irrigated crops.  After 1965, however, a
drop in agricultural production occurred when the physical complexity and
cost of large-scale irrigation schemes rose sharply and private investments
declined. The latter situation was caused by the uncertainty of many land-
owners in regard to titles to their land.
1.04      Maize is Mexico's most widely grown crop, accounting for about
7 million ha, or about half the country's cultivated area. Most of it is
cultivated in the rainfed areas by small-scale producers. In 1980, imports
of maize and wheat were estimated at 4.5 million tons. Bean, an important
staple crop, is also grown by almost 80% of the low income producers. Some
400,000 tons of beans are presently imported annually. Sugar production
increased from 1.8 million tons in 1970 to 2.7 million tons in 1978, but due
to increased domestic demand, exports have gradually decreased from about
600,000 tons in 1970 and in recent years the country has become a net importer
of about 300,000 tons per annum. Demand for oilseeds has also rapidly accele-
rated; although domestic production increased from 1.7 millaon tons in 1978 to
about 2.2 million tons in 1979, and imports have also grown, reaching about
1 million tons in 1979. Fruits and vegetables account for almost 47% of total
agricultural commodity exports.



- 2 -
1.05      Livestock is also an important component of Mexican agriculture, with
a share of about 45% in the total value of agricultural production. In the
past, most of the commercial output came from the arid and semi-arid range lands
of the north, where extensive cattle breeding took place. Cattlemen earned
relatively high income from the sale of feeder cattle, mainly to United States
markets. Presently, there is considerable transfer of one- to two-year old
steers from the dry tropics to the wet tropics for fattening.
1.06      The cattle population is now estimated at about 31 million
head, and, since 1970, it has been growing at an annual rate of about 2%.
In this same period, carcass meat output increased by about 4% per annum,
due partly to improvement in offtake rates and heavier carcass weights.
1.07      Rapid growth of the urban areas in recent years stimulated increas-
ing demand for livestock products, which substantially contributed to the
rapid increase in supply of milk, pork, and, in the central plateau, poultry.
In fact, since mid-1970, Mexico has been importing substantial quantities of
powdered milk. In response to increasing demand, new cattle producing areas
were developed, mainly along the Gulf Coast where more rainfall and improved
pastures enabled a much higher stocking rate than was possible in the more
arid regions.
1.08      Since 1965, the gross value of crop production has been growing
moderately at approximately 1.3% per annum in real terms, mainly because
of the relatively slow rise in average yields, increased limitations on
agricultural exports, unfavorable market situations, and slow expansion of
irrigated lands. If average yields are used to measure relative performance,
the best results have been obtained in the northern regions where yields,
mainly grains, rose by 36% between 1965 and 1978. Wheat accounted for most of
the growth as its yield doubled from 1.5 tons per ha in 1965 to 3 tons per ha
in 1974. In the Pacific and Central Regions, yields of all crops rose by 20%,
due primarily to a substantial decrease in the area devoted to low value crops
(maize and beans) and an increase in high yielding crops, mainly sorghum in
the Central Region and sugarcane in the Pacific Region. In the Northwest, the
fastest growing region in terms of gross value of production, yields increased
by 7%. Accounting for most of this growth was the introduction of oilseeds
(soybeans) as a second crop in the commercially oriented irrigation districts
of the region. The Gulf Region and the State of Tamaulipas had the lowest
performance ratings. In the Gulf Region, only sugarcane showed an upward
trend, confirming the suitability of the zone for the crop.
Rural Population, Employment, Income and Trade
1.09      Despite increasing urbanization, agriculture employs about 40%
of the labor force in Mexico, providing a livelihood for some 4 million
families, 1.3 million of which are landless. About two-thirds of this labor
force earns less than the minimum wage.
1.10      Between 1970 and 1977, the rural population increased from 20.8 to
23 million, which represents a growth rate of about 1.4% per annum. However,
during that period, GDP of agriculture in constant 1972 prices increased from
Mex$ 52.7 billion to Mex$ 55.7 billion, or only about 0.8% per annum. As a
result, the real per capita GDP in agriculture has decreased from Mex$ 2,533



- 3 -
in 1970 to Mex$ 2,420 in 1977 (in 1972 prices).   Moreover, the income distribu-
tion pattern wíthín the agriculture sector remains skewed, since 50% of the
rural families account for only about 20% of the agricultural output, while
the upper 10% of the agricultural population provides 50%.
1.11      External trade in agricultural products remains favorable.  Agricul-
tural exports in 1979 amounted to about 30% of total merchandise exports
(nearly 35% of non-oil exports), while the share of agricultural imports in
total merchandise imports was about 11%. Rowever, the combined effects of rapid
population growth, íncome increases, changes in consumptíon, and insufficient
growth in agricultural production has resulted in a significant increase in food
imports, particularly of maize, wheat, sorghum and oilseeds.
Government Policies
1.12      In early 1980, the president of Mexico announced a new program, the
Mexican Food System (SAM), which was designed to help the country achieve
self-sufficiency in corn and beans by 1982 and in other basic foods by 1985.
SAM involves 12 program areas in the agriculture sector of the country that
would assist, among other things, producer organizations, inputs, credit and
crop insurance, food and commodity marketing and processing, land tenancy and
colonization. One of the most important aspects of SAM is the shared risk
program, under which the Secretariat of Agriculture guarantees a minimum
income to farmers in rainfed areas who produce the basic foodstuffs programmed
under SAM. A major tool for achieving production increases over the short run
is the present Government's farm price support policy, by means of which
it hopes to encourage especially corn and bean production. Over the longer
term, SAM will concentrate on expanding total crop area in the rainfed areas
and on increasing productivity.
1.13      In late 1980, the Chamber of Deputies of Mexico approved a new
Agricultural Promotion Law (APL). APL took effect in February 1981 and
had as its main objective the encouragement of production and productivity
among the various forms of communal farm operations (ejidos and comunales) and
among these communal groups and small landowners organized into Production
Units; legal associations of ejidos, communities and smallholders were not
recognized under previous agrarian legislation. The Unít's ownershíp ínterest
depends on the capital contribution of each member and the voting power
depends on the amount of land each member devotes to the association's use.
Other features of the law penalize the owners of idle lands, encourage the
production of crops on grazing land, discourage the fractionalization of
properties into units of less than 5 ha, and enable the Mexican Government to
share risks with Production Units established in rainfed areas.
1.14      The SAM and the new APL actually complement long standing Government
strategies, which include:
(a) improving productivity in existing rainfed agriculture by
expanding the area and developing a more effective extension
service (Government in 1977 created "Distritos de Temporal,"
or rainfed districts);



- 4 -
(b) expanding rainfed cultivation in under-utilized lands, mostly
along the Gulf Coast. This will require investments in draín-
age and flood control, but it will also necessitate a strong
effort by its research services to develop adequate crop
technologies and an expansion of extension services in order
to stimulate the farmers to adopt better cultivation techniques;
(c) planning large-scale irrigation projects to develop areas
where a hydraulic potential exists, expanding irrigated lands
through small-scale irrigation systems, improving performance
in presently irrigated areas through rehabilitation of old
conveyance systems, reclaiming saline lands, and making more
efficient use of available water; and
(d) using pricing support programs to induce changes in cropping
patterns favoring increased production of food crops.
1.15      The Bank's lending program to Mexico's agricultural sector, on-going
or under preparation, contains a number of projects that would support the
policies of the Government as outlined above. The proposed project, designed
to rehabilitate irrigated land in an area where a low-cost hydraulic potential
exists, would mesh with the Government's strategy.
Previous Bank Projects
1.16      In the past eight years (FY 1974/81), Bank participation in the
agricultural sector amounted to US$1.8 billion distributed among 15 projects
as follows:
(a) Irrigation (Panuco (969-ME), Sinaloa I (970-ME), Fuerte/
Sinaloa II (1706-ME), Bajo Bravo/Bajo San Juan (1111-ME),
Apatzingan (1858-ME) and Ocoroni (1908-ME)) - US$474 million;
(b) Rural Development (Integrated Program for Rural Development
(PIDER) I (1110-ME) and II (1462-ME) and Papaloapan Basin
(1053-ME)) - US$280 million;
(c) Rainfed Agriculture (1945-ME) - US$280 million;
(d) Credits V (1217-ME), VI (1569-ME) and VII (1891-ME)
Projects - US$650 million;
(e) Area Development (Tropical Agriculture) (1553-ME) -
US$56 million; and
(f) Small-Scale Agricultural Infrastracture Development
(1643-ME) - US$60 million.
1.17      Implementation of the above projects is generally satisfactory,
varying somewhat with the implementation capabilities of the agencies involved.
Especially relevant to this project is the experience gained in its first
stage (Chapter III of this report). The Panuco prolect needed supplementary



- 5 -
financing as a result of cost overruns, which the Bank approved on July 11,
1978 for US$25 million. With this action, implementation of the Panuco
project progressed satisfactorily in terms of construction but agricultural
development continues to be delayed. The Sinaloa project encountered a
substantial cost overrun due mainly to works related to the Bacurato dam.
However, works have progressed according to schedule and the project will be
almost completed in 1981, though some residual works would be continued into
1982. The Sinaloa/Fuerte project has been progressing on schedule as well and
wíll benefit from water provided from the Bacurato dam to carry out leaching
works   in Fuerte.  The Apatzingan and Ocoroni projects are in their initial
stages. The Ocoroni project is likely to be completed ahead of schedule since
all the works have already been contracted, though a cost overrun of more than
40% is envisaged.
1.18      In general, recognized difficulties have been overcome in that
technical services and on-farm investments, which are essential in meeting
project objectives, are now included in the project's implementation program
and in project costs, and sensitivity analyses are being made on construction
delays and effects of price changes and benefits. The Bank has also become
more involved than previously in project preparation and in the determination
of the readiness of projects for preparation and implementation. Finally, the
Bank has endeavored to obtain a just recovery of water charges in the irriga-
tion projects it finances, and it is now becoming involved in a more general
study of operation and maintenance and of levels of water charges in Mexican
irrigation districts.

II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The project area 1s located in the northern coastal plains of the
State of Tamaulipas, along the Grande/Bravo river, the border between Mexico
and the United States. The approximately 280,000 ha of the project area lie
between the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the State of Nuevo Leon to the west,
and the valley of San Fernando to the south (see Maps IBRD 16058 and 16059).
Clímate
2.02      Climatic conditions in the project area are diverse due to the
extensive surface area. The predominant climate in the low lying region
of Rio Bravo, within the triangle Reynosa-Matamoros-Valle Hermoso, is semi-
arid and hot. In the higher region of Lower San Juan, the climate is hot and
dry. Thirty-two weather stations are located in the project area. For the
purposes of this report in regard to climate, precipitation, humidity and
evaporation, records from the Bajo Rio Bravo (BRB) 2-6 station and Bajo Rio
San Juan (BRSJ) 3-58 station were used as models.
2.03      The medium annual  temperature fluctuates between 21.6 and 24.4 0C,
with highs between 38 and 47 C and lows between -3 and -14 C, representing
the extremes of the northeast zone.  Frosts occur on an average of about
five days in December and January. Median annual temperatures were 22.8°C
between 1954 and 1980 (Annex 2, Tables 2 and 3) with median monthly highs
recorded in July and August, in both stations, reaching 29.0°C in the Bajo Rio
Bravo District and 29.3 C in the Bajo Rio San Juan District, and median lows
in January of 14.80C and 14.4 0C, respectively (Annex 2, Tables 4 and 5).
Relative humidity averaged about 78% in Matamoros and decreased to about 63%
in Reynosa.
2.04      Precipitation occurs year round, but mostly in the period between
June and October, accounting for 58 to 62% of the yearly total. Yearly
averages are around 650 mm, but recorded annual lows and highs are 150 mm and
1,900 mm, respectively (Annex 2, Tables 6 and 7). Annual evaporation averages
1,881.2 mm in BRB 2-6 and 2,037.1 mm in SJ 3-58.
Soils
2.05      The soils of the project area are derived mainly from alluvial
deposíts associated with the flood plain of the Rio Bravo originatíng from
the erosion of the Sierra Madre Range, mainly limestone and sandstone. Most
of the soals of the area are clays and clay loams of medium to heavy textures
and vertisols, together with some small areas of lighter sandy clay loams.
The area lies between 10 m and 90 m above sea level, slopíng gently toward the
Gulf of Mexíco. It is generally flat to slíghtly undulating, with natural
slopes varying from less than 0.5% to 5.0%. District 26 is more uneven
than District 25.



2.06      Infiltration rates and water conductivity characteristics are
generally favorable. Permeabilities range from 1.5 to 0.12 m per day, but
are mostly more than 1.0 m per day. A combination of factors, includíng lack
of adequate surface drainage, both at the farm and dístrict level; regular
occurrence of high íntensity rains; and Inefficíent irrigation practíces
associated with inadequate land leveling have resulted in the rise of the
water table throughcut a sígnificant proportion of the area. This has caused
salinization of the surface soil on up to 15% of the area, and the amount of
land affected is increasing in those parts of the districts not yet served by
an adequate surface drainage and, in some areas, also a sub-surface drainage
system.
2.07      Fertility of the soíls is also generally moderate to high, with
organic matter levels ranging up to 2.7% in the surface horizon, averaging
about 1.5% and phosphate levels around 5.0 ppm, ranging from 1.2 to 9.0.
The soils are generally alkaline due to free calcium carbonate in the profile,
with pH averaging about 7.8. The incidence of sodic soíls is very low. To
maintain high crop yields, both phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer is required,
as well as small doses of micro-elements, iron and zinc.
2.08      A detailed soil survey has recently been completed by the agro-
logical department of SARH to U.S. Bureau of Reclamation standards, as a
result of which the land has been classified into four main classes according
to their agricultural use, at present and with the proposed project. Currently,
about 217,000 ha are best suited to maize, sorghum, cotton, beans and vegetables.
With project implementation, this figure is expected to increase to 246,000 ha
in Classes 1 to 3. Taken into consideration were constraints such as texture,
depth of topsoil, topography, cation exchange capacity and permeability.
Soíls in Classes 1 and 2 have the greatest potential for irrigation production,
capable of supporting the highest yields of all crops proposed. Class 3 soils,
being heavier textured and more prone to water logging, have a restricted
potential, whiLe Class 4 soils are of marginal value only. With the proposed
rehabilitation project, 88% of the net irrigable area would be included in
Classes 1 and 2 (Annex 2, Table 8).
Hydrology
2.09      Two sources provide water to the project area:  (a) the Bravo/Grande
River, which forms the boundary between the United States and Mexico and whose
water is shared between them; and (b) the San Juan River, which is a tributary
of the Bravo River at its right bank upstream of the project area. The Bravo
River catchment area is about 472,000 km2, its average annual flow is 11,180
million m3, and water is extracted in different areas along its banks in the
upper reaches of the basin. The Bajo Rio Bravo irrigation district (District
25) derives its water from the international dam at Falcon through the diver-
sion at Anzalduas, both constructed in 1944 after conclusion of the interna-
tional water treaty between Mexico and the USA (Annex 1). The average annual
outflow from the Falcon Dam in the lower basin is 3,100 million m3 (Annex 2,
Table 9), and the outflow to Mexico, at the Anzalduas diversion, averages
1,120 million m3 (Annex 2, Table 10). The Alamo River, a tributary of the
Bravo River located between the Falcon Dam and Anzalduas on the Mexican side,



adds an annual average of 162.8 million m3 to the water released from Falcon
(Annex 2, Table 11). The Bajo Rio San Juan district (District 26) which derives
its water from the San Juan River, with a catchment area of 32,524 km, and is
regulated by the Marte R. Gomez Dam, completed in 1946. The average annual
flow to the Marte R. Gomez Dam is 1,076.3 million m3 (Annex 2, Table 12).
Many calibrated gauging stations are located along the rivers and at the
outlets of the dams, and pertinent data are regularly collected and published
by the International Boundary and Water Commission (CILA) in charge of the Rio
Bravo/Rio Grande water distribution between Mexico and the USA.
Present Irrigation Systems
2.10      In District 26, two main canals, the San Pedro/Rancheras on the
left bank and the Rode on the right bank, distribute water for irrigation
to approximately 71,000 ha of net gravity-fed irrigable land. In addition,
within the district, but outside the scope of the project, there is an area
of land between the river and the channel-fed areas which is serviced by
licensed pumped water direct from the river. In District 25, one main
canal, the Anzalduas, carries water diverted at the international Anzalduas
Diversion Dam to serve approximately 208,000 ha. Pumping rights have also
been allocated in a narrow strip of land adjacent to the river but again
outside the project area.
Land Tenure
2.11      About 12,000 families live in District 25 and 3,360 in District
26 (Annex 2, Tables 13, 14 and 15). About 73% of the farrs in District 25
have an average size of between 10 and 20 ha per family, while about 19% are
larger than 20 ha and 8% are smaller than 10 ha. In District 26, about 48% of
the farms are larger than 20 ha, 43% are between 10 and 20 ha, and 9% are
smaller than 10 ha.
2.12      About 37% of the farmers (4,500) in District 25 are ejidatarios,
while in District 26 only about 22% (750) are ejidatarios. Almost all the
ejidatarios in District 25 (about 90%) possess between 10 and 20 ha, with the
rest evenly distributed between farms with less than 10 ha and those larger
than 20 ha. In District 26, however, 64% of the ejidatarios possess between
10 and 20 ha and most of the remainder have more than 20 ha.
2.13      About 63% of the private farmers in District 25 possess between
10 and 20 ha per family, 27% have more than 20 ha and 10% have less than
10 ha. Some 44% of the private farms in District 26 are between 20 and 50 ha,
37% are between 10 and 20, 8% are larger than 50 ha, and 11% are smaller than
10 ha.
Population and Employment
2.14      About 700,000 people líve in the project area.  Some 130,000 are
rural and the rest are urban, concentrated mainly in the cities of Reynosa and
Matamoros, each with populations of approximately 300,000. Average family
size is about 5.4 persons, increasing at a rate of 3% per annum.



2.15      About 26% of the population, or about 1.4 persons per family,
are part of the active labor force. Unemployment is low compared with other
parts of Mexico, mainly because of job opportunities in Texas. However,
among the rural population, unemployment and under-employment run more than
30%.  Seasonal unemployment is also high, especially between June and December.
2.16      Among the families possessing land, employment on the farm occupies
about 44% of the available labor force. Current annual earnings per family
are estimated to vary between about Mex$ 34,000 (US$1,500) and about
Mex$ 103,000 (US$4,500) per annum, including off-farm income.  It is estimated
that, in the project area, off-farm employment generally reflects the general
employment situation in Mexico, and, therefore, only about 50% of the active
labor force can find year-round employment off the farm.
Present Production
2.17      At present, some 200,000 ha are cultivated in District 25 during
the winter season and some 51,000 during the summer season, making a cropping
intensity of about 120%. In District 26, about 65,000 ha are cultivated
during the winter and 12,000 ha during the summer, making a cropping intensity
of about 115%. The cropping pattern is quite different in the two districts.
sorghum and corn are both important crops in District 25, occupying about
134,000 ha and 103,000 ha, respectively, while corn is the main crop in
District 26, occupying about 46,000 ha, with sorghum occupying only 19,000 ha.
Other crops are of far less importance: beans occupy about 20,000 ha during
the summer season; vegetables cover about 5,000 ha, cotton some 3,000 ha, and
okra about 1,400 ha.
2.18      Altogether, the two districts produce on average per year about
450,000 tons of sorghum; about 350,000 tons of corn; about 6,000 tons of
beans; about 7,000 tons of okra; and about 26,000 tons of other vegetables,
mainly tomatoes.
Agricultural Support Services
2.19      Extension.  Agricultural extension services are provided under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH) and are administered
directly withiLn the project structure. Complementary extension support is
provided by private banks and the National Bank for Rural Credit (BNCR).
2.20      During the first phase of the development program, the extension
service was built up into a well organized and effective group, with a
farmer-to-agent ratio of close to 150 to 1. Each district has its own exten-
sion network and administration, with centralized specialist support and
monitoring services. Personnel employed during the first stage totaled 199,
63 of whom are agronomists and 136 are technícians, but staffing is still 20%
short of the target proposed under the first-phase project.
2.21      Staff training and methodology have been emphasized during the
first stage of the project as has farmer assessment aimed at identifying
the priority extension needs.



- 10 -
2.22      Each district is divided into units and sections (para 5.05).  Each
extension section includes about 5,000 ha, comprising about 300 farmers served
by one to three agents. Farmers are visited regularly and given advice about
the operation of the farm. Data are also collected at the time of the visits
for use in monitoring and evaluation purposes. Regular training and informa-
tion days are held to assist with development of the less experienced agents.
2.23      Relations with the Center for Agricultural Research of the North
East Region (CIAGON) and with the research and extension groups on the Texas
side of the border are generally good. Regular contact is maintained with the
latter.
2.24      Research.  Agricultural research in the area is the responsibility
of the CIAGON station located at Rio Bravo. CIAGON is affiliated with the
National Institute of Agriculture Research (INIA). The group of research
people at Rio Bravo carry out a wide range of irrigation crop trials on the
station's own farm as well as on farmers' fields throughout the districts.
Research into suitable crop varieties, fertilizer needs, irrigation methods,
crop rotation and disease control trials are currently in progress.
2.25      Credit.  Of the 64 branch banks in the project area, BNCR is the most
important, granting about 55% of the credit; the rest comes from private banks.
Approximately 90% of the loans are extended for short terms and the rest for
medium and long terms. There is a notable difference in the credit situation
prevailing in the two districts: while almost all of the farmers in District
26 have been borrowing to finance their works or inputs, only 60% of those in
Distriet 25 have been thus assisted. At present, there is no shortage of credit
and none is expected. Loan repayments have been generally without signíficant
problems, with loan overdues amounting to less than 5% of the balances.
2.26      Crop Insurance.  The National Crop and Livestock Insurance Agency
Inc. (ANAGSA) provides crop insurance services that cover the cost of inputs
to about 70% of the farmers in the project area, involving about 200,000 ha of
farm land. Four branches of ANAGSA operate in collaboration with the banks
that provide credit, as insurance is required before credit is granted.
2.27      Marketing.  Most of the agricultural production in the project area
is destined for the Mexican domestic market and only small quantities of
produce are exported to the United States. About 90% of the maize, about 60%
of the sorghum, and almost the entire bean crop is marketed through the
National Marketing Commission (CONASUPO), which was established by the Govern-
ment to regulate the price and supply of basic food items. Since maize and
sorghum have been in relatively short supply in Mexico, Government support
prices are appreciably above world market prices. On the other hand, prices
of fertilizers, also controlled and marketed by Government through the National
Fertilizer Company (FERTIMEX), are significantly below world market price.
Prices of seeds are, by and large, non-regulated since the National Seed
Production Company (PRONASE) accounts for only about 16% of the market in the
project area and the rest is marketed through many private traders. Though
PRONASE sells its seeds at a significant discount compared to private traders,
farmers nevertheless believe that the quality of seeds offered by the private
sector, many imported from Texas, is superior.



- 11 -
2.28      Storage.  Storage is provided in the project area mainly by CONASUPO.
Altogether, there are about 65 warehouses for grain in Bajo Rio Bravo area
(District 25), with a storage capacity of about 900,000 tons, and about
16 warehouses in the Bajo Rio San Juan area (District 26), with a storage
capacity of about 115,000 tons.
Transportation
2.29       The project area is well served by roads and railways that allow
efficient access to both local and national marketing centers. The main fede-
ral highways connecting the project area with national markets are the Matamoros-
Nuevo Laredo, the Matamoros-Cd. Victoria, and the Reynosa-Monterrey. A federal
highway also connects Reynosa with the Matamoros-Cd. Victoria highway.  In
addition, there are several complementary secondary roads connecting the
villages of Irrigation Districts 25 and 26 with the main cities of the project
area such as Reynosa, Valle Hermoso, Rio Bravo and Matamoros. A railway
system, which connects Matamoros and Monterrey, also serves the project
area and transports a large portion of the agricultural goods produced in the
two districts as well as the inputs needed by the farmers. Some products
shipped to the hinterland are also transported to the port of Brownsville
In Texas just across the border from Matamoros, and from there to Tampico.
Two airports that serve the project area are located near Matamoros and
Reynosa; in addition, there are many landing strips, mainly for agricultural
purposes.
Social Services and Infrastructure
2.30      All towns in the project area are served by postal, telephone and
telegraph systems. Medical facilities are also available throughout the
project area, and the Department of Social Services has provided clinics and
hospitals in various locations. The area is also supplied with electricity
generated by hydroelectric power from the Falcon dam and with thermoelectric
power generated in a plant located in the municipality of Rio Bravo. All the
large cities and main towns are equipped with sewage systems and road services.
Educational facilities include 76 pre-primary and 490 primary schools, as well
as 18 centers for technical training. There are also about 80 secondary
schools and 14 schools for higher education, including the Institute for
Technology in Matamoros, the University of Valle del Bravo, and medical
schools in both Reynosa and Matamoros.

III. STAGE I OF THE PROJECT
Background
3.01      In April 1963, a first Bank loan (336-ME) was made to Mexico for
rehabilitation and improvement of the irrigation and drainage system of the
two districts. Works included 806 km of new drains; rehabilitation of
1,392 km of existing drains; 48 km of new irrigation canals; rehabilitation of
205 km of existing canals; and canal lining for 191 km. Work was completed in
1971. However, only about US$25 million was spent on project works under this
loan, covering only a small part of the irrigated 279,000 ha and solving only
a few of the problems involved (high water tables, salinity problems, inaccess-
ibility of the unpaved roads during the rainy summer season, and lack of
agrotechnical knowledge by the farmers).
The Original Project
3.02      In May 1975, the Bank approved a second loan of US$150 million for
the Bajo Rio Bravo/Bajo Rio San Juan Irrigation Project (Loan 1111-ME),
supported by additional local financing of US$235 million. The project called
for lining of most of the conveyance and distribution canals (3,215 km);
building of about 8,700 hydraulic structures along the canals to better
control water distribution and measurement; improving roads and the drainage
network; building of houses for canal riders; land leveling of about 200,000
ha; and provision of technical assistance to the farmers. The project covered
the entire area of Districts 25 and 26, or a total area of 278,602 ha (see
Maps IBRD 16058 and 16059).
3.03      Toward the end of 1977, two years after becoming effective, the
project was at a standstill, without any rehabilitation works or agricultural
development having been started. The two main reasons for the delay were:
(a)  insufficient budget allocations by the Government for the
project because of a fiscal crisis during the 1975-77 period;
and
(b)  the necessity to redefine project scope, which appeared to be
too large and too complicated to be implemented in one stage,
and to shift rehabilitation priorities from lining and control
structures to other rehabilitation works, i.e., drainage, roads
and technical assístance to the farmers.
3.04      When the project was prepared in 1974/75, the main obstacle to future
development of the region seemed to be the lack of water for irrigation, and
more than 70% of the proposed investment was therefore allocated for canal
lining and control structures along the systems. Reevaluation of the project
during 1976/77, however, indicated that the water provided to the project from
the Rio Bravo and Rio San Juan diversions was more than enough to meet all the
requirements of the farmers. Farmers' water demands were much lower than
consumptive use, but factors such as high water tables caused by poor drainage,



- 13 -
salinity, inaccessibility of the rural roads in the rainy season, poor agricul-
tural practices and low crop intensities (only small areas are cultivated
during the late rainy season) were impeding optimal utilization of water.
3.05      Negotiations between the Government and the Bank during 1977/78
resulted in a redefinition of the project, and a Master Plan prepared by
SARH's Sub-Secretariat of Planning (SP) and presented to the Bank in July 1978
proposed that the original project be "sliced" into four stages.
3.06      According to the modified program, the first two stages would
concentrate on solving the drainage and communication problems that adversely
affect agricultural production and on providing massive technical assistance
to the farmers backed up by agricultural research, while the third and fourth
stages would deal mainly with augmenting water supplies from local and adjacent
resources to the extent found economically viable. In the first stage, only
about US$130 million, out of which Bank financing amounts to US$50 million,
would be spent mainly for correcting acute problems of drainage through
rehabilitation of the surface drainage systems that served about 40% of the
area, building roads, carrying out on-farm development (mainly land leveling)
and providing technical assistance.  Some US$100 million was deferred from the
original loan (1111-ME) to future stages. The first stage was then reappraised
and approved by the Board in August 1978 and is now in its final stages of
implementation.
Profect Execution 1977-81
3.07      Project execution of the Stage I project started in the fall of 1977
and included six components (Annex 2, Table 16 and Map IBRD 16058):
(a) rehabilitation and amplification of the main and lateral
drainage systems over an area that covered three of the seven
units of the project -- the second and fourth units of BRB and
the first unit of BRSJ, totaling 102,882 ha (or 37%) out of the
278,602 ha of the project;
(b) rehabilitation of the irrigation systems of the first unit of
BRSJ (6,260 ha);
(c)  construction and pavement of about 300 km of rural roads all
over the project area;
(d) land leveling of about 80,000 ha in the above-mentioned three
units;
(e)  acquisition of equipment for O&M; and
(f)  provision of technical assistance to all the farmers living in
the seven units of the project, supported by applied agricul-
tural research provided by CIAGON (the regional governmental
research agency).



- 14 -
3.08      All parts of the first-stage program as redefined in 1978 were satis-
factorily carried out, with the major exception of the land leveling program,
of which only some 16% (13,000 ha) has been executed. A national program for
land leveling undertaken by the Government during 1978-80 removed the program
from the project and transferred responsibility for it to the Irrigation
Districts. Unfortunately, the program failed nationwide to fulfill its
objectives, mainly because of managerial mistakes and the lack of cooperation
by the farmers. Furthermore, in the project area, climatological factors,
allowing only a short working period of about 90 days in the off-season,
hampered implementation. As a result, the benefits actually realized for the
first stage were somewhat lower than those anticipated at appraisal. The
investment deferred from land leveling was used to amplify road construction
(by about an additional 250 km) and to strengthen the technical assistance
program which is extremely successful and used as a model for other irrigation
projects in Mexico.
3.09      During the implementation period of the drainage system program,
which was then confined to only three units, farmers living in adjacent areas
brought pressure to bear on the Government and influenced it to broaden the
scope of the works and add two more units in the rehabilitation program. The
Government itself financed these works on an area of 27,958 ha--21,158 ha in
the first unit of BRB and 6,800 ha in the third unit of BRSJ. The Bank,
however, preferring in-depth development of smaller areas instead of super-
ficial development of larger ones, convinced the Government that it should
stop the additional works and concentrate on the original plan. Nevertheless,
the Mex$ 750,012,000 (about US$32.6 million) invested by the Government in the
incremental works and the incremental benefits expected from the additional
rehabilitated area are now included in the fírst stage instead of the second
stage. The total updated first-stage investment program is presented in
Annex 2, Table 17.
Agricultural Development
3.10      Results of the agriculture development program of Stage I are
preliminary, since the project is only in its fourth year of implementation.
Nevertheless, some signs of success are clearly evident. Significant success
was reflected mainly in control of insect infestation and a more efficient use
of water in the irrigation system. The cropping intensity, however, would not
increase in Stage I, as more land leveling and irrigation infrastructure
development both of which would increase the water availability would be
needed first. The main parameters to measure improvement of farm income under
Stage I are, therefore, yield of crops per hectare and the prevention of soil
deterioration due to salinity.
3.11      The cropping pattern in Stage I is based on the actual production
pattern, which farmers are not likely to change because they would continue
to operate under the same constraints related to water, soil, labor, cost,
market opportunities and such as they did in the past before the project
was implemented (Annex 2, Table 18).



- 15 -
3.12      Yíeld projections are based on estimates that the technical assist-
ance program would continue to have substantial impact on farmers and that,
ln the areas ln which the project has been implemented, increased water
efficiency and expanded drainage would continue to provide conditions for
increasing yields (Annex 2, Tables 19 and 20). Yields of beans and vegetables
are likely to expand by about 39 and 50%, respectívely, between with and with-
out project situation; corn and sorghum would expand by about 33% and 35%,
respectívely; while okra productíon would increase only moderately at about 10%.
3.13      At full development, annual production would be expected to Increase
quite significantly. Cotton production would increase from about 2,100 tons
to about 2,600; corn from 330,000 tons to 440,000; okra from 7,000 tons to
about 7,700; sorghum from about 405,000 tons to about 552,000; beans from
about 5,600 tons to 7,800; and vegetables from about 24,000 tons to about
36,000. More corn would be produced in District 26 than in District 25,
which, in turn, would be the maln provider of sorghum (Annex 2, Tables 21,
22, and 23).
Preliminary Assessment of Results
3.14      As a result of the agricultural development program, the net value of
production of the entire project area would more than double, rising from
about Mex$ 964 millíon per annum (about US$42 millíon) to Mex$ 2,170 million
(about US$94 million). Net value of production in District 25 would increase
from Mex$ 703 million per annum (about US$31 million) to about Mex$ 1,555
(about US$68 million), and in District 26 from Mex$ 261 million (US$11 million)
to Mex$ 615 million (US$27 million). Annex 2, Tables 24 to 28 provide details.
3.15      The first stage works will have a significant impact on averting
salinity. Estimates are that, without the project, between 0.5% to 1.0% of
the project area would come out of production annually. In calculating the
project benefits, a conservative estimate has been used, implying that the net
value of production without the project would decrease gradually until the
l4th year, when 7% of the net value of production would be reached and remain
stationary henceforth.
3.16      The economic rate of return for the project has been estimated at
14% (Annex 2, Table 29), with calculations that were based on the following
assumptions: (a) benefits would accrue from averting salinity (para 3.15);
(b) agricultural production figures were derived from the increase in yields
that would reach their full potentials in about 14 years from the begínning of
project implementation; (c) production costs were priced at local 1980 constant
market prices (para 7.03); (d) economic prices for cotton and grains were
derived from border príces and Bank projections, but adjusted to farmgate
level, while prevailing farmgate príces were used for other products; (e) all
project works, equipment, technlcal servíces and physícal contíngencíes were
included in investment costs; (f) shadow wages for unskilled labor as percen-
tage of market wages were assumed at 50% in investment and the cost of produc-
tion (applíed both to hired and family labor); and (g) the life of the project
was assumed to be 50 years.

IV. THE PROJECT
Introduction
4.01      The Government of Mexico has requested Bank assistance to continue
in financing the second stage of the Bajo Rio Bravo/Bajo Rio San Juan Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project, which was prepared by three directorates of the SARH
Sub-Secretariat in Mexico City (para 5.01). A feasibility study was submitted
on April 20, 1981 and an appraisal mission visited Mexico between April 27 and
May 25, 1981 (Map IBRD 16059).  The project was officially introduced by SARH
to CILA on August 13, 1981, and approved accordingly (Annex 1, page 4).
Project Oblective
4.02      The principal objective of the second stage of the Bajo Rio Bravo/
Bajo Rio San Juan Project is to tackle the next phase of the rehabilitation
program; i.e., to complete the rehabilitation of the surface drainage systems,
to improve the efficiency of the irrigation systems through selective lining
and rectification of canals and structures, and to provide land leveling to
all the undulated lands that need it, so as to increase agricultural production
and farm income in the project area. As a result, the area cultivated in the
summer would increase, yields of existing winter crops would be improved and
a shift would occur toward crops more profitable than those now planted.
Project Description
4.03      The project would provide for:
(a) construction of about 820 km of new drainage canals, rehabili-
tation of about 1,160 km of existing drains, and construction and/or
rehabilitation of about 5,000 related structures in the first
and third units of Irrigation District 25 and in the second and
third units of Irrigation District 26;
(b) land leveling of about 105,000 ha (42% of the overall program)
of which about 71% (75,000 ha) are in Irrigation District 25 and
the balance, 29% (30,000 ha), Sn Irrigation District 26, with an
average land movement of 600 m /ha;
(c) construction of on-farm subsoil drainage on about 13,700 ha,
most of which (80%) would be in Irrigation District 25 (BRB);
(d) rectification of canal banks (about 480 km), selective
lining of canals where excessive seepage of water has, been
identified (about 440 km), and completion of about 850
structures for control and measurement devices along the
irrigation systems;
(e) completion of about 1,750 km of service roads along irrigation
and drainage canals, 290 km of farm (official) roads, and 870
related structures;



- 17 -
(f) acquisition and installation of a communication network
(telephone and radio) and additional equipment for 0 & M
in the two districts;
(g) strengthening of the technical assistance program for the
entire 280,000 ha in order to promote land leveling and
summer crops by increasing staff, constructing demonstration
centers and houses for the extension agents, and procuríng
equipment for the existing organization;
(h)  reinforcement of applied agricultural research and studies
for future stages; and
(i) indemnization of farmers affected by the works.
The breakdown of work by districts and by units in each district is presented
in Annex 2, Table 30.
Design Criteria
4.04      The dimensions of the irrigation systems are based on the maximum
monthly demand occurring in May. The water delivery system would supply
quantities, changing from 3.02 l/sec/ha for small canals to 0.89 l/sec/ha for
main lined canals. Water requirements for each crop are presented in Annex 2,
Table 31 and total demand in each district is presented in Annex 2, Tables 32
and 33. The Manníng formula was used for the design of open channels and
water control and measuring structures have been desígned accordingly. The
conveyance efficiencies of 66% and 67% for Districts 25 and 26, respectively,
have been assumed when works are completed (see also paras 6.07 to 6.10).
4.05      Water losses in the canals due to ínfiltration are rather high -
more than 45% of the total flow - and are changing substantially from one
location to another along the irrigation systems. Infiltration tests carried
out by project authorities correlated the amount of the losses to soil classes,
dimension of the canals, amounts of flows and such. A relationship between
the cost of lining and the benefits in terms of increasing production has been
analyzed by means of linear programing and has resulted in the quantities
recommended to be lined, as shown in the project description (para 4.03(d)).
4.06      Investigation of surface drainage included topography, soil surveys,
land use, precipitation and runoff. The runoff has been determined for each
watershed area, for a 48-hour storm, and for a rainfall of five-year frequency.
The rate of flow selected for design is 6.33 l/sec/ha for 250-ha watersheds
and 2.94 l/sec/ha for 25,000-ha watersheds. This open drain capacity would
permit water to be drained within 48 hours, disposing also of groundwater
drainage. The minimum depth of the open drains is 2.0 m.
4.07      The roads parallel to drains would be 5.5 m in width with gravel
layers of 0.20 m, while roads parallel to canals would be 3.55 m in width with
gravel layers of 0.15 m.



- 18 -
Water Quality
4.08      Water quality of both Rio Bravo and of Rio San Juan (Annex 2,
Table 34) is fair for irrigation purposes, although in some heavy, undrainable
soils, it may be detrimental to certain sensitive crops. However, provisions
have been made by CILA for preventing the flow of saline drainage water into
the Bravo River (an example is the El Morillo drainage canal, which runs
parallel to the Bravo River and diverts saline water from the San Juan area
to the Mexican Gulf), and the combined surface and sub-soil drainage that would
be constructed in the most affected areas would also help to prevent salinity.
Implementation Schedule
4.09      Project implementation is planned to commence in 1982, with comple-
tion in 1987. All civil works of the second stage would be completed in
four years, while 105,000 ha would be leveled over a six-year period, during
which time technical assistance would also be provided. The implementation
schedule, presented in Annex 2, Table 35 shows what percentage of each activity
is expected to be completed annually for each system, as well as for the
second-stage project as a whole.
Cost Estimates
4.10      The proposed second-stage project is estimated to cost about US$525.3
million 1/ over a six-year implementation period.  This figure, based on 1981
prices, includes price contingencies, calculated at approximately US$162 million,
or about 48% of the base costs. The physical contingencies are approximately
US$36 million (11% of the base cost). The foreign exchange component is
estimated at about US$180 million 1/, or 34% of total project cost. All
identifiable taxes and import duties are excluded, as SARH is exempted
from paying them. Physical contingencies were calculated at 15% of civil
works costs. Price contingencies for foreign costs are based on the Bank's
revised guidelines, starting at 12.5% in 1980 and dropping to 9% for 1981, 8%
for 1982, 7.5% for 1983 to 1985 and 6% thereafter. Price contingencies for
the local component were estimated at 30% for 1980, 20% for 1981, 15% for
1982, and 10% for 1983 and are the same as the rates applied to the foreign
component from 1984 onwards. The contingency element in the project is
relatively high, because of high inflation in Mexico and the relatively long
implementation period. Inflation rates in Mexico have been and are expected
to continue to be high - above 20% per annum - in the interval between 1980
and 1982, with a possible gradual decrease thereafter. Project costs are
summarized below and details are presented in Annex 2, Tables 36, 37 and 38.

Financing
4.11      The Bank loan of US$180 million would be made to the National
Finance, Inc. (NAFINSA) and would cover approximately 34% of the total project
cost (Annex 2, Table 39). The Government would finance the remaining cost,
US$345.3 million, or 66% of the total project cost. The Bank loan includes a
capitalized front-end fee of 1.5% (US$2.7 million)and would be for a period of
15 years, with a grace period of three years.
4.12      All the contracts for the first stage were awarded at the beginning
of 1981, utilizing all the resources available under Loan 1111-ME. In order
to guarantee the continuation of the works, the Mexican Government asked
permission to begin contracting new work packages before the completion of the
feasibility/appraisal studies. Three contracts for the second stage, amount-
ing to about US$10 million, were thus sent to the Bank for review at the
beginning of 1981, and the Bank agreed to advance contracting, in accordance
with Bank Guidelines for Procurement, and retroactive financing of an amount
not exceeding 5% of the loan amount.
Procurement
4.13      About 80% of the contracts for the principal surface drainage systems,
irrigation canals,,and roads, amounting to about US$230.0 million, including
contingencies, would be procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works would, insofar
as possible, be grouped into about 30 contracts, ranging in value from a minimum
of US$2.0 million to a maximum of US$12 million. Small jobs (telecommunications,
buildings, small structures and complementary works), which, because of the
timing or nature of the work, could be better handled if not included in major
contracts, would be procured after Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) or as
negotiated contracts following ordinary Government procedures, which are
satisfactory to the Bank. The maximum value per contract would be US$0. 65
million, with the total of all such contracts not to exceed US$55.0 million.
4.14      Contracts for on-farm development works (including land leveling and
subsoil drainage), valued at about US$90 million, would be procured under LCB,
or through negotiations following Government procedures, which are satisfactory
to the Bank. About 30% of land leveling cost, US$25 million would be contributed
by the farmers through credits provided by the Government. In the project
region, farmers frequently organize themselves into partnerships to contract
for land leveling on small tracts up to 250 ha, using their own machinery.
This work provides income to the farmers, but, more importantly, it trains
them in proper leveling procedures and prepares them to maintain their fields
in good condition for irrigation in the future. SARH provides engineering
services and supervises such contracts and occasionally rents heavy equipment
to these groups of farmers (see also para 7.09).
4.15      The estimated cost of vehicles, farm machinery, and operation
and maintenance equipment is about US$15 million, including contingencies,
of which about US$12.0 million would be subject to ICB, according to Bank
Guidelines for Procurement (March 1977). For bid evaluation, a 15% margin
of preference or the prevailing custom duties, if lower, would be allowed
for equipment and vehicles produced in Mexico. About US$3.0 million worth



- 21 -
of minor equipment not suitable for ICB would be purchased through normal
local procurement procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank. Consult-
ing services, if necessary, would be contracted in consultation with the
Bank. Assurances were obtaíned at negotiations that procurement would be
as outlíned in this and preceding paragraphs.
Disbursement
4.16      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed, with normal documentation,
against categories presented below. A summary schedule of expenditures for
each district and for the entire project is present in Annex 2, Tables 36, 37
and 38. A disbursement schedule, based on the project cost, commencing in the
latter part of 1983, is presented in Annex 2, Table 40. The table below sets
forth the categories of items to be financed from loan proceeds, the amounts
of the loan allocated to each category, and the percentage of expenditures for
items to be financed in each category:

4.17      The disbursement profile of six years for this project, was deter-
mined on the basis of the investment program and analysis of the local
administration of the project management to carry out the scheduled invest-
ment program. Similar projects in Latin America would require about 7 years
to be disbursed but Mexico is relatively more advanced in regard to its
organization and administration and therefore a shorter period appears
feasible. Since the administrative infrastructure already exists, and
because this project is a second stage to a project that started in 1977,
the implementation capability is a known variable and the disbursement
profile is judged as realistic.  Disbursement profiles of similar projects
in Mexico, such as Sinaloa I, also lasted over an equívalent period as
contemplated for this project.
Accounts and Auditing
4.18      Prior to submission to the Bank, all documentation for which reim-
bursement would be claimed from the Bank loan would be subject to the indepen-
dent review and approval by the Secretariat of Programming and Budgeting (SPP)
in accordance with SPP's established control procedures. SARH would maintain
separate accounts adequate to reflect the resources, expenditures and the
financial situation of the project. A summary statement of such accounts
would be prepared annually by SARH and submitted to the Bank after verification
in accordance with SARH and SPP's normal verification procedures which are
acceptable to the Bank. Such statements would be confirmed as to their
accuracy and that controls and verification procedures have been properly and
1/   Percentage of total Technical Assistance category, because the separation
of accounts of the continued and incremental technical assistance is
impractical.

consistently applied by SPP, including certidication by an authorized ofificial
of SPP notified   in advance to the Bank.  Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that Government would: (a) maintain or cause to be maintainied
separate project accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with sound
accounting practices, resources and expenditures, in respect of the project,
of the departnent and agencies of the Government responsible for carrying out
the project or any part thereof; (b) within six months of the end of each
fiscal year, furnish to the Bank a summary statement of such accounts verified
in accordance with the Guarantor's ordinary procedures; and (c) furnish to the
Bank such other pertinent information concerning such accounts and the verifi-
cation thereof as the Bank shall reasonably request from time to tíme.
V.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Institutional Framework and Management
5.01      Three sub-secretariats of SARH in Mexico City are responsible for the
formulation and the implementation of the project:
(a) SP - the Sub-secretariat of Planning - for carrying
out the basic studies and preparing the feasibility study
and the preliminary plans of the project;
(b)  SIR - the Sub-secretariat of Hydraulic Infrastructure -
for preparing the detailed designs and bidding documents,
as well as for supervising the implementation of all civil
works included in the project; and
(c)  SAO - the Sub-secretariat of Agriculture and Operation -
for providing technical assistance to the farmers, as well
as operating and maintaining the project.
5.02      SARH maintains offices in each state, administered by a direct
representative of the Secretary of SARH. In the State of Tamaulipas, where the
project is located, the office is in the state capital, Ciudad Victoria, with
a branch in Reynosa City, the project center. The state offices are organized
following Mexico City's main office pattern. Thus, physical works are admin-
istered by the Resident Engineer, who reports to the General Directorate GD of
large-scale irrigation of SIH in Mexico City and to the SARH state representa-
tive in Ciudad Victoria. Similarly, the chiefs of the two irrigation distrlcts
involved in the project (BRB and BRSJ) are responsible for administering project
operations (such as technical assistance, land leveling, water distribution and
charges, and operation and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage systems
and    of the rural roads) and report to the GD of irrigation districts and
units of SAO in Mexico City and to the SARH state representative in Ciudad
Victoria (Annex 2, Chart 1).
Prolect Execution
5.03      The resident engineer of the project is located with his staff
at the project's headquarters in Reynosa City. He is an experienced and
competent professional, who heads a team of chief engineers responsible for
design, field planning, specifications, cost estimates, supervision of
construction, land expropriation, and the preparation of annual budgets.
While annual budgets are approved by the SARH state representative, the
approval of the engineering planning, design and specifications is the



- 23 -
responsibility of SIH in Mexico City. These arrangements have proven to be
-satisfactory in the first stage of the project, and no difficulties are
foreseen for their application in the second stage (Annex 2, Chart 2).
Proiect Operation
5.04      The BRB/BRSJ Irrigation District organizations each include four
departments: (a) Operations and Development; (b) Conservation and Maintenance;
(c) Administrative Services; and (d) the recently established Land Leveling and
Reclamation (Annex 2, Chart 3). The district has a Steering Committee consist-
ing of representatives of the farmers and other organizations involved in
research, inputs supply, production, marketing and financing, such as CIAGON,
BNCR, and CONASUPO. The Steering Committee advises and assists the chief of
each Irrigation Distriet in developing the distríct's annual agricultural
program, which is then submitted to the GD of Irrigation Districts in Mexico
City and the State Representative for approval. The review at this level is
only to assure that the program is within Government guidelines and policy.
5.05      The Operations and Development Department of each Irrigation District
is divided into four groups: one supports technical units that deal with
hydrological measurement, users census, and statistics; the second provides
irrigation and drainage engineering for the "on-farm level"; the third provides
agricultural services and support, including organization of the farmers,
training, agricultural machinery, and agricultural know-how promotion; and the
fourth manages operational units in the fíeld. The operational field units --
each of which is managed by a unit chief with headquarters located in the
central town of the area served by the unit -- control areas of between 10,000
and 50,000 ha, each dominated by a centrally controlled irrigation system.
The seven project units (four in District 25 and three in District 26) are
again divided into sections, each of whích covers an area of about 3,000 to
5,000 ha, managed by an agronomist, eventually supported by one or two
auxiliaries, who provide technical assistance to the farmers. The project
comprises 57 sectíons (41 in District 25 and 16 in District 26).
5.06      The Conservation and Maintenance Department of each Irrigation
District provides services that include major repairs and works pertaining
to operation and maintenance of the district's infrastructure. Under the
project, the annual operation and maintenance costs would be about US$44
per ha in District 25 and US$72 in Distrct 26. Details are shown in Annex 2,
Tables 41 and 42. Additional maintenance equipment amounting to about US$15.0
million would also be purchased. The equípment list with costs is shown in
Annex 2, Tables 43 and 44. Each Irrigation District prepares a maintenance
program that is updated annually and ensures that all irrigation, roads and
drainage works and facílities are properly kept up.
5.07      The Administrative Services Department of each Irrigation District
is responsible for water charges collection, accounting, and personnel and
other administrative business of the district.
5.08      The Land Leveling and Reclamation Department of each Irrigation
District would be responsible for: (a) preparing surveys (topography and
soils), detaíled plans, and bidding documents for land leveling; (b) inducing
farmers to participate in the program and helping to provide them with credit;
and (c) scheduling, coordinating, and supervising land leveling works.
Because of the large dimension of the program, the technical staff of the
resident engineer of the project, which usually does not deal with land
leveling works, would be incorporated into the programs of each district.



- 24 -
Technical Assistance
5.09      The technical assistance program (Annex 2, Tables 45, 46 and 47),
started in the first stage, would be increased substantially during the second
stage when it is planned to place greater emphasis on late season (July-December)
land use to increase the area of beans and maize during a period whaen the land
is currently underutilized. With the completion of the drainage works and the
rural roads, a special effort would be made as well to improve early season
crops by: (a) enhancing higher yields of the traditional maize and sorghum by
using new varieties and agricultural practices, and (b) introducing more
profitable aud labor-intensive crops such as cotton and some vegetables.  In
addition, land leveling throughout the districts and some sub-surface drainage
in pockets of land now affected by salinity would be major endeavors. The
promotion of these programs, all of which are at the farm level and to be
carried out in agreement with and by the farmers, would necessitate massive
support and the participation of the extension service staffs of each distríct.
5.10      CIAGON, the agricultural research center, would also increase
its activities during the period of project implementation by promoting
applied research for: (a) improving the principal crops: maize, sorghum,
beans, cotton; and (b) introducing new crops: summer crops such as sunflover
and soybeans and crops which can grow on heavy, undrainable soils such aLs
pastures and special varieties of cotton. There is a recognized need for an
agricultural machinery specialist and a farm management economist on the
research team to spearhead development of more efficient tillage  programs and
also to assist with investigations of the soclo-economic problems among
farmers in the area.
5.11      Three kinds of studies are contemplated as part of the agricultural
program:  (a) studies to review the possibilities of overcoming water shortages
in the future, including consideration of more storage capacity for summer
flows on the San Juan and Alamo Rivers; utilization of underground water
resources; reuse of drainage water; increase of the efficiency of the convey-
ance and distribution systems; and introduction of new irrigation methods;
(b) studies to review the effect of the subsurface drainage which would be
carried out during Stage II on a modest scale but would be extended in the
future if it was determined that such drainage would have a positive effect
on production and be economically justified; and (c) studíes to monitor the
impact of the principal works - namely: drainage, land levelíng, improved
irrigation and technical assistance -- on farmers' production.
5.12      The program includes the construction of 225 houses for extension
service officers, 150 in District 25 and 75 in District 26, all of which would
be built in small rural towns that are dominant in the operational units. In
the past, extension agents have quit the service in large numbers to take
advantage of better conditions offered to them by the private sector, hampering
the creation of a big enough competent technical cadre. Since direct incentives
cannot be given to Government employees under Mexican law, indirect benefits,
including training, promotions, and housing facilities would be provided to
reduce the erosion of staff in the future.



- 25 -
5.13      Financing of staff salaries and their fíeld and office support
requirements, including vehicles and equipment, has been divided into two
categories: (a) the on-going program, which is the continuation of the first-
stage program; and (b) the additional program, aimed mainly at supporting
the second-stage provisional incremental activities (promotion of land leveling
and summer erops). The overall ínvestment in the five-year program, including
the on-going and the incremental technical assistance, the agricultural
research of CIAGON, the future studies of the project, and the construction of
houses for the extension staff would reach US$65 million, or an average of
US$13 míllion per year (without price contingencies) of which US$9.0 million
would be for District 25 and US$4.0 million for Distriet 26. After the
project has been executed, technical assistance would continue on a smaller
seale and would cost about US$6.8 million per annum - US$4.6 million for
District 25 and US$2.2 million for Distriet 26--and would be financed by the
Mexican Government.
5.14      The organization proposed for the technical assistance component
conforms to the one already established in the two Irrigation Districts. The
extension service activities in each district are coordinated by the Chief,
Technical Assistance, working from the office of the Irrigation District. Each
of the seven irrigation units of the project has a technical assistance and water
distribution office and each of the sections within the unit is served by an
Agricultural Extension officer supported by one or two intermediate technicians.
Each officer is responsíble for about 300 farm families.
5.15      Field extension staff are certified agronomists, but all get one
month of training at the irrigation center of SARH in "El Carrizo," Sinaloa,
and periodic training at the CIAGON Research Station where they gain experience
ín extension operatíonal procedures and become familiar wíth the recommended
agronomie practices for crops to be grown and knowledgeable in the procedures
for the laying out of trial and demonstration plots. Altogether, there would
be a need, within the ineremental program, to recruit an additional 38 exten-
sion offícer agronomists and subject matter specialísts (27 for Distriet 25
and 11 for District 26), and a staff of 95 intermediate technicians (67 for
District 25 and 28 for District 26), two serving under each agronomist. The
overall staff for technical assistance (on-going plus incremental) would
include 332 technicians of all levels (224 in District 25 and 108 in
District 26).
Credit
5.16      Although credit is currently provided to most of the farmers, the
need for addítional credit would be particularly important because of the
on-farm development programs contemplated at this stage. About US$17 míllion
of long- and medium-term credit per annum would be needed for on-farm develop-
ment and about US$73 million of working capital per annum would be needed to
buy the essential inputs. The Government would guarantee the provision of
short-, medium- and long-term credit as and when required to utilize adequately
the facilities included in the project. Assurances to thís effect were obtained
during negotiations.



- 26 -
MonitorínR and Evaluation
5.17      Monítoring and evaluation of the proposed second stage would be
amplified during and after the development period. During the development
períod, the Resldent Engineer of the project, located in Reynosa, would
monitor the construction works and provide written reports. Progress would be
based on percentage of completion of each task or job (Annex 2, Table 35),
together with the percentage of expenditures exhausted.
5.18      Monitoring and evaluation of operation and management would continue
to be handled by the offices of the Chiefs in each Irrigation District. These
offices have staff at the field level in each unit who are able to prepare
suitable reports on activities.
5.19      The technical assistance program would be monitored and evaluated
prímarily through monthly reports prepared by the Extension Service. The
reports would be concerned with the extension agents, the progress of the
farmers, and the effect of the project on the environment. Staffing of the
extension program, training the agents, and receipt of supplies and equipment
would be topícs regularly reported upon. For the farmers, changes in yield,
cropping íntensity, croppíng patterns, applicatíons for credit, loan repayments,
and the spread and use of improved ínputs would also be monitored, with
emphasis on the progress of the summer crops program. In addition, extension
agents would monitor effects of chemicals on the fauna, flora and water in the
project area.  Special attention would be paid to the monitoring of the effects
of drainage work (surface and subsurface) and of land levelíng.
5.20      As standard operation procedures at SARH require, semestral reports
would be made on the progress of construction, operation and maintenance,
agricultural development and the technical assistance program. These reports
would be available to the Bank for review and comments. Also, no later than a
year after the final Bank loan disbursement, a project completion report would
be sent to the Bank. Assurances on the above were obtained at negotiations.

VI. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND FARM INCOME
Cropping Pattern, Yield, Production, and Income
6.01      At full development, the cropped area of District 25 would increase
from 250,000 to 305,000 ha, and in District 26 from 77,000 to 110,000 ha
(Annex 2, Tables 48 and 49 ). Full development of the cropped area is esti-
mated to be reached in about seven years from the begínning of project imple-
mentation, mainly because conditions would allow the implementation of the
agricultural program almost immediately after completion of the project
infrastructure. All this implies that at full development the cropping
intensity of District 25 would increase from 120% to 145% and in District 26
from about 115% to 155%.
6.02      A wide range of cereals, pulses and vegetables can be grown in the
project area. Class 1 and 2 soils provide no significant limitation on
cropping alternatives, provided nitrogen and phosphate are applied. With
Class 3, cropping alternatives are somewhat more limited than for Classes 1
and 2 and the most suitable crops would be cotton, sorghum, beans and vegetables.
6.03     The cropping pattern projected for the two districts of the project
area under Stage II is based on three important considerations: (a) crops
that are traditionally grown successfully in the areas; (b) maximization of
farmer's return, subject to the constraints of water, soil, labor, cost and
market opportunities; and (e) crops that have been grown successfully across
the border in Texas or that have shown significant success in small-scale
production and at the experiment station. Such typical crops that are
grown successfully in the area, or that have shown significant potential
are: sorghum, corn, beans, okra and vegetables. The largest part of the
cultivated area in the main season would be devoted to sorghum and corn and,
to a lesser extent, to cotton and okra. During the second season, the area
would be utilized mainly for the cultivation of beans and corn and, to a
lesser extent, for vegetables.
6.04     Yields of crops per hectare would not reach their full potential
for about 10 years, a rather slow pace, mainly because results would be depen-
dent on land leveling works. By and large, the projected yield increases to
full development were determined on the basis of observation and by comparing
them with records in other areas in which similar climatic and ecological
conditions exist. The yield projections reflect two main assumptions:
(a) that the technical assistance program would sígníficantly increase the
use of efficient cultivation methods; and (b) that project implementation
would yield an overall irrigation water efficiency of about 50%, which would
be achieved through canal lining, land leveling and an efficient on-farm
delivery system. Yield projections are presented in Annex 2, Tables 50
and 51. In District 25, projections of yield of the main crops at full
development are as follows: cotton, 2.0 tons/ha; corn, 3.9 tons/ha; okra, 6
tons/ha; sorghum, 4.4 tons/ha; beans, 1.1 tons/ha; corn in second season, 2
tons/ha; and tomatoes, 9 tons/ha. In District 26 projections of yield of the
main crops are cotton, 2 tons/ha; corn, 5.2 tons/ha; sorghum, 4.4 tons/ha;
beans, 1.4 tons/ha; late season corn, 2.25 tons/ha; and tomatoes, 9 tons/ha.



- 28 -
6.05     At  full development, annual production in the project area would
be quite substantial (Annex 2, Tables 52 to 60). Production of cotton would
yield about 54,000 tons; corn, 460,000 tons; sorghum, 630,000 tons; beans,
140,000 tons; okra, 8,000 tons; and other vegetables, 69,000 tons (Annex 2,
Table 52). Cotton, sorghum and vegetables would come mainly from District 25
while corn would come mainly from District 26 (Annex 2, Tables 53 and 54).
Among grains, sorghum would be the main crop of District 25, producing about
550,000 tons compared to corn production of 220,000 tons, while corn would be
the main crop of District 26, producing about 230,000 tons compared to 78,000
tons of sorghum. Okra would be produced only in District 25. Other vegetables
would be produced in both districts, though 70% would come from District 25.
6.06     Net value of production of the project area at full development
would be about Mex$ 3,100 million (about US$135 million) per annum (Annex 2,
Tables 57 and 60) while the incremental value of production would reach about
Mex$ 2,100 million (about US$92 million).  The largest income contributor
crop would be corn, with about 32%, then sorghum, 28%; beans, 23%; cotton,
10%; vegetables, 6%; and okra, 1%. In District 25, net value of production
would reach Mex$ 2,040 million (about US$89 million) as compared with
Mex$ 1,065 million from District 26 (about US$46 million) (Annex 2, Tables 55,
56, 58, and 59).
Water Reguirement
6.07     Water requirements for each crop were determined by the modified
Blaney Criddle method. The proposed cropping patterns were analyzed, consí-
dering constraints of available water in each system (para 2.09), and water
requirements of each crop (Annex 2, Tables 31 to 33).
6.08     At full development of the second stage, if the full consumptive
use is met, water shortages would occur mainly in the Bajo Rio Bravo system
(District 25). To study the water balance, SARH undertook a simulation
analysis for operation of the overall Rio Bravo/Rio San Juan hydrological
system with historical series for a period of 37 years (1944 to 1980). The
simulation took into account the water rights of each of the two users (Mexico
and USA).
6.09     The program provides reasonable assurance that the contemplated
water demand for District 25 would be fully satisfied in 21 of the 32 years
(65.6% of the time), with shortfalls of a total of 8.82% over the other
11 years (34.4% of the time). The supply for District 26 would be satisfied
in 23 of the 32 years (71.9% of the time), with shortfalls of 5.16% over the
other nine years (28.1% of the time).
6.10     According to the economic analysis carried out by SARH, it would be
more beneficial to irrigate the winter sorghum and corn crops with water
quantities below their consumptive use - as in fact already done - thereby
lowering their potential yields by 5 to 15% - rather than to meet the full
consumptive use, thereby attaining maximum yields but lowering the crop
intensity. Effective rainfall supplies about 40% of the consumptive use of
these crops in the winter, and timely supplementary irrigation can secure the
yields contemplated. The selected cropping patterns (Annex 2, Tables 48 and



- 29 -
49) are compatible with the water constraints of each district at full develop-
ment. It would be necessary, however, to find ways to increase the water
supply to the project in the future to further enhance its production.
Farm Models
6.11      Most of the farmers, both in District 25 and District 26, are
typically concentrated in three groups of land holders, namely, those with
holdings up to 10 ha, those with holdings between 10 and 20 ha, and those with
holdings between 20 and 50 ha. The two districts, however, are significantly
different in regard to their soil class distribution, water avaílability,
drainage problems, and human resources, all of which are more favorable in
District 26 than in District 25. Consequently, three farm models were con-
structed for each district (Annex 2, Tables 61 to 92). The two districts are
also subject to different ecological conditions. As a result, sorghum has
been more succesfully grown in District 25 than in Dístrict 26, while corn
has been more successfully grown in District 26 than in District 25. In
regard to common features of the two districts, it has been assumed that
cotton would fit into the agricultural program of medium and larger size farms
but not in the small ones, while vegetables would fit into the agricultural
program of the smaller and medium size farms but not into the larger ones.
6.12     A 7.6-ha Farm, District 25.  In this model, production of sorghum
would comprise about 43% (5.3 ha) of the cropped area, beans, 32%; corn, 19%;
and vegetables, including okra, about 6% (Annex 2, Table 61). Vegetables
would contribute about 19% to the net value of production; sorghum 38%; beans,
23%; and corn, 19% (Annex 2, Tables 62 and 63). Family net income originating
from the farm is expected to reach about Mex$ 76,000 (about US$3,300) per
annum, and income from off-farm work is estimated to reach Mex$ 11,400 (about
US$490) compared to an estimated total of Mex$ 33,900 (about US$1,500) per
annum without the project (Annex 2, Table 64). With the project, about 53%
of the available family labor force would be utilized on the farm, while the
rest would have to seek employment elsewhere, compared to 33% utilization of
the available labor force without the project (Annex 2, Table 65).
6.13     A 13.25-ha Farm, District 25.  This model mainly differs from that of
the small-scale farms because cotton would be cultivated, occupying 5.4% of
the cropped area (Annex 2, Table 66). Sorghum would comprise 42% of the
cropped area; beans, 28%; corn, 11%; and vegetables, about 4%. Sorghum would
contribute 37% of the farm's net income; beans, 20%; corn, 21%; cotton, 9%;
and vegetables, about 5% (Annex 2, Tables 67 and 68). Average family income
would increase from Mex$ 40,100 (about US$1,740) per annum without the project
to Mex$ 133,600 (about US$5,800) per annum with the project, with the farm
income component increasing from 70% to about 95% (Annex 2, Table 69).
On-farm employment would occupy about 76% of the available family labor force
as compared to about 52% without the project (Annex 2, Table 70). In addition,
there would be a family labor shortage in the first fíve months of the year
during which hired labor would be used.
6.14     A 36.42-ha Farm, District 25.  In this model, vegetables would not be
a significant crop but cotton would be expected to comprise about 9% of the
cropped area; corn, 21%; sorghum, 40%; and beans, 30% (Annex 2, Table 71).



- 30 -
The share of cotton in the net value of production would amount to about 16%;
corn, 23%; sorghum, 37%; beans, 23%; and okra, 1% (Annex 2, Tables 72 and 73).
Average family income would increase from Mex$ 42,000 (about US$1,800) per
annum without the project to Mex$ 263,000 (about US$11,450) per annum with the
project, with the farm income component increasing from 80% to 99% (Annex 2,
Table 74). On-farm employment would occupy 94% of the available family labor
force as compared to 50% without the project (Annex 2, Table 75). In addition,
there would be a need to hire outside labor in 11 out of the 12 months during
the year.
6.15      A 6.90-ha Farm, District 26.  As in District 25, cotton would not be
grown on small-scale farms. Otherwise, the cropping pattern would include:
corn, 42% of the cropped area; beans, 31%; sorghum, 22%; and vegetables, 6%
(Annex 2, Table 77). The share of corn in the gross value of production would
be 50%; sorghum, 12%; beans, 23%; and vegetables, 15% (Annex 2, Tables 78 and
79). Average family income would increase from Mex$ 52,000 (about US$2,260)
per annum without the project to Mex$ 114,000 (about US$4,950) per annum with
the project, with the farm income component increasing from about 70% to about
90% (Annex 2, Table 80). On-farm employment would occupy 57% of the available
family labor force as compared to 35% without the project (Annex 2, Table 81).
6.16      A 13.20-ha Farm, District 26.  This farm model would call for
cotton, which would occupy 5% the total cropped area; corn, 44%; sorghum, 17%;
and vegetables, 7% (Annex 2, Table 82). Cotton would yield about 6% the net
value of production; corn, 49%; and sorghum, 9% (Annex 2, Tables 83 and 84).
Average family income would increase from about Mex$ 68,000 (about US$2,950)
per annum without the project to Mex$ 213,000 (about US$8,260) per annum with
the project, with the farm income component increasing from 85% to 99% (Annex
2, Table 85). On-farm employment would occupy about 91% of the available
family labor force as compared to 58% without the project (Annex 2, Table 86).
6.17     A 30.70-ha Farm, District 26.  As in District 25, vegetables would
not be grown on large-size farms. Otherwise, the cropping pattern would
comprise cotton, occupying 7% of the cropped area; corn, 43%; sorghum, 15%;
and beans, 34% (Annex 2, Table 87). Cotton would yield 9% of the net value of
production; corn, 55%; sorghum, 9%; and beans, 27% (Annex 2, Tables 88 and 89).
Average family income would increase from Mex$ 103,000 (about US$4,500) per
annum without the project to Mex$ 379,000 per annum (about US$16,500) with the
project, with the farm income component increasing from about 91% to almost
100% (Annex 2, Table 90). On-farm employment would occupy 94% of the available
family labor force, as compared to 64% without the project (Annex 2, Table 91).
6.18     Summary.  The farm models indicate that only the family income on
large-sized farms in District 26 would exceed the average GDP per family in
Mexico in 1980 of about US$12,900, in spite of the fact that the project would
yield more than a 150% increase in the income of small-scale farms in District
25; more than 230% in that of the medium-sized farms in District 25; and more
than 500% in that of the large-scale farms in District 25. In District 26,
small-scale farm income would increase by more than 110%; medium scale by more
than 210%; and large scale by more than 260%. It is also noted that the
project would have a more pronounced impact on District 25 farmers, mainly
because present conditions are more adverse to agriculture in District 25 than
in District 26.



- 31 -
Cost Recovery
6.19      Water charges were raised in the two districts at the beginning
of 1976 to Mex$ 375 per ha, which covered at that time 100% of the operations,
maintenance and administration cost of irrigation water supply. SARH prepared
a new program to be implemented from January 1982 onward, calling for a
gradual rise of the water charges over a five-year period until they cover
the full cost of O&M and administration, while keeping pace with inflation
(Annex 3). As a first stage, the Mexican authorities have increased the water
charges by 73% as of January 1982, reaching about Mex$ 650.0 per ha. An agree-
ment to this effect was reached with the state authorities and with the farmers.
A document confirming this government decision has been presented to the Bank.
After the proposed five-year implementation period, an annual adjustment for
inflation would be made automatically.
6.20      After the completion of Stage II, the Government would have to
readjust water charges to be paid by the producers to a level adequate to
cover the established operation, maintenance and administrative costs and as
much as practicable of the investment cost. To this effect, the Government
would complete, as soon as possible, but by no later than December 31, 1987,
a socio-economic study in the project area 1/ which would be used as a basis
for the readjustment of water charges levels in accordance with the farmers'
ability to pay. The new water charges would be implemented promptly after
completion of the study in accordance with the provisions of Article 71 of
the Mexican Federal Water Law dated January 1972 and other applicable laws
and regulations. It is also expected that the rates would be reviewed
periodically to ensure their continuing applicability. Assurances on the
above were obtained during negotiations.
6.21     Analysis of the cost recovery index indicates that it would reach
about 37% for project beneficiaries in District 25 and about 48% for those
in District 26. Correspondingly, the rent recovery in District 25 would be
about 32%, while ín District 26 about 26% (Annex 2, Tables 76 and 92). The
analysis is based on the assumption that beneficiaries would pay the full
cost of operation, maintenance and administration of the irrigation and drain-
age works through irrigation water charges and that farmers' contribution to
investment would amount to 30% over 25 years, which is the maximum as estab-
lished by Mexican law. The water charges payable (direct charges) in District
25 represent about 12% of the small-scale farm family income; about 13% of the
family income in medium-size farms; and about 16% of the family income in the
largest farms. In District 26, water charges payable represent about 13% of
the small-scale farmer's income; about 13% of the medium-sized farmer's income,
and about 15% of the large-scale farmer's income. These percentages are
considered acceptable and in line with their capacity to pay.
Marketing and Storage
6.22     The increase in exportable commodities would include cotton. The
increase in the exportable production of fiber cotton would amount to less
than 16,000 m tons per annum and would not have significant impact on the
1/   A socio-economic study is now underway for the Stage I project.



- 32 -
world market supply or even total Mexican exports, which amount to more than
180,000 tons per annum. In addition, according to the Commodities Division
projections, the long-term outlook for world fiber demand is quite favorable,
with growth expected to be at a rate of more than 2% per annum compared to a
1.6% per annum increase in world cotton production. Production of vegetables,
and tomatoes among them, is geared completely to local markets, which are
growing due to population increases. Production of grains, including corn and
sorghum, counterbalance the growing imports of these products and are in line
with Government policy to reach higher levels of self-sufficiency from domestic
production. Production of beans would also be developed in response to domestic
demand and would be easily disposed of on the domestic markets. Since transpor-
tation from the project area is excellent, the bulk of production should be
marketed easily. Existing storage facilities in the region and nearby big
cities such as Reynosa, Matamoros or Monterrey can accommodate the anticipated
increase in production as a result of the project.



- 33 -
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Benefits and Justification
7.01     Direct economic benefits from the project realized by the beneficiary
farmers would come from: (a) increased production and, as a result, substan-
tially increased income compared to the without the project situation;
(b) increased employment and job security as works on the farm would absorb
about 7.6 million mandays per annum with the project, compared to about 4.5
millaon mandays per annum without the project (Annex 2, Table 93 to 98). New
jobs would also be created as a result of family labor shortages, which
would increase by about 1 million mandays at full development as compared
to without the project situation. The main indirect benefits would include
development of access roads and improvement 1n nutrition. The project would
also provide an increase in employment opportunities for auxiliary services,
such as technical assistance and activities of agro-industries such as cotton
gins and grain storage. The activities of commerce and banking would also be
increased as more produce and crops would be marketed and more financial
resources would be demanded.
7.02     From a national point of view, the project would support the Govern-
ment's rural development policies because it would raise the income of the
rural poor; it would contribute to increasing self-sufficiency in grains as
well as to increasing foreign exchange revenues of about US$13.0 million from
exports of cotton. Additionally, it would help decrease income disparities
between rural and urban areas, thereby reducing rural urban migration.
Economic Rates of Return
7.03     The economic rate of return for the Stage II project as a whole is
estimated at 22.1%, for District 25: 20.5%; and for District 26, 26.9%. In
addition, an integrated analysis for the combined Stage I and Stage II projects
yields an economic rate of return of 17% (Annex 2, Tables 99, to 102). Calcula-
tíons are based on the followíng assumptíons: (a) agricultural production
figures are derived from development of the rehabilitated area over six years,
followed by four more years of land leveling in areas where this type of work
would be necessary and from development of yield projections for crops that
would reach their full potentials in about 10 years (Annex 2, Tables 50 and
51); (b) production costs are priced at local 1980 constant market prices
(Annex 2, Tables 103 to 109); (c) economic prices for cotton, corn, and
sorghum are derived from estimates of border prices and Bank projections,
adjusted to farmgate level, while prevailing farmgate prices were used for
other products (non-tradables) (Annex 2, Table 110); (d) all project works,
equipment, technical services and physical contingencies are included in
investment costs; (e) shadow wages for unskilled labor as a percentage of
market wages were assumed at 50% in investment and the cost of production
(this was applied to both hired and family labor); (f) capital cost per
hectare, including replacement charges, is based on the need for additional
machínery and equípment, which is assumed to be depreciated over eight years;
and (g) the life of the project is assumed to be 50 years.



- 34 -
Sensitivity Analysis
7.04     The results of a sensitivity analysis to test the effects on the
economic rate of return of cost overruns and delays or shortfall in benefits
for Stage II are presented in Annex 2, Table 111. In the case in which
benefits were down by 10% and cost up by 10% simultaneously, the economic rate
of return is still about 18% for the project and about 17% for District 25 and
22% for District 26. Likewise, if benefits were down by 20% and cost up by
20%, the economie rate of return would be 14.8% for the project and about
13.6% for District 25 and 15% for District 26. A delay of two years in
project implementation would reduce the economic rate of return from 22% to
16% for the project and 15% for District 25 and 19% for District 26. A switch-
ing value test indicates that if total project costs increased by about
82%, the project economic rate of return would be 12% (the opportunity cost of
capital in the country), or, conversely, the benefits could decrease by 45% to
yield an economic rate of return equal to 12%. In regard to District 25, cost
could rise by 68% or benefits could go down 40%, but the project would still
reach a 12% rate of return. In District 26, cost could rise by 132% or
benefits could go down by 57% and a 12% economic rate of return would still
be achieved. Annex 2, Table 112, presents details on the crop sensitivity
analysis.
7.05      A combined Stage I and Stage II sensitivity analysis is shown in
Annex 2, Table 113.
Environmental Impact
7.06     The project, whose main concern is rehabilitation of the deteriorat-
ing drainage and irrigation systems, would not have any deleterious effect: on
the environment, but, rather, would improve the use of the land and water
resources of the region. With improved control of water distribution and
disposal, with leveled land, and with better agricultural cultivation prac-
tices, the high water tables, the gradual progress of salinity, and the
progressive soil deterioration would be prevented.
7.07     Chemicals used to control pests and diseases are applied follow-
ing prescribed procedures, and their application is closely monitored by
extension agents who also train farmers in their safe use. The extension
agent would, in addition, monitor possible bycycle resistance problems in
crops and possible aquatic weed problems in canals and drains. Social workers
attached to the technical assistance unit would assist in the improvement of
general health and nutritional standards.
Project Risks
7.08      Successful implementation of the project can be impeded by (a) lack
of willingness on the part of farmers to carry out on-farm development works,
especially land leveling on the scale contemplated; (b) improper maintenance
of the drainage and irrigation system; and (c) failure to maintain a balance
between growing demand for and limited supply of water.



- 35 -
7.09      In the Stage 1 project, land leveling fell short of project goals
because farmers were not convinced that it was necessary and authorities
failed to put enough emphasis on the program (para 3.08). Therefore, special
emphasis has been given to the land leveling portion of the proposed project
and the Government has agreed to (a) provide enough credit to the farmers to
pay their share, and (b) compensate farmers for crop losses when work is carried
out in their plots during the cultivation season. The Mexican delegation
during negotiations provided the Bank with a detaíled schedule for the six-
year implementation period of this component as well as detailed design for the
first two years, which were agreed to by the farmers involved. These documents
were reviewed by the Bank and were found to be satisfactory. With the above
provisions, the program has a good chance of succeeding.
7.10      Although water available to each district is presently more than
enough to cover farmers' demand, demand would surpass available supplies once
all rehabilitation works are completed. This situation can be dealt with
through prudent use of water that can be encouraged by higher water charges
and careful maintenance. Higher water charges would be introduced under the
project in the near future and provisions have been made for the purchase of
maintenance equipment under the project, with firm plans to conduct adequate
maintenance in both districts.
7.11      While there is still scope to prevent water waste, notably in the
upper reaches of the system - and many control structures have already been
or will be installed - it is believed that, eventually, new sources of water
supply would have to be developed [para 5.11(a)]. Meanwhile, project yields
at full development have been calculated well below their potential yields,
taking into account future water scarcities.

VIII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01     During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Government
would:
(a) comply with the procurement procedures as outlined in paragraphs
4.13 to 4.15;
(b) maintain separate project accounts through SARH to reflect the
financial situation of the project in accordance with sound accoun-
ting practices; within six months of the end of each fiscal year
send to the Bank a summary statement of such accounts verified in
accordance with the Guarantor's ordinary procedures; and furnish
to the Bank such other pertinent information concerning such
accounts as the Bank shall reasonably request from time to time
(para 4.17);
(c) ensure that the beneficiaries of the project would be provided with
such short-, medium- and long-term credit as and when required to
utilize adequately the facilities included in the project (para 5.16);
(d)  ensure that SARH makes available to the Bank for review semestral
reports on the progress of construction, operation and maintenance,
agricultural development and technical assistance. Also, no later
than a year after the final Bank loan disbursement, a project comple-
tion report would be submitted to the Bank (para 5.20); and
(e) readjust water charges to be paid by producers at a level adequate
to cover operation, maintenance, and administrative costs of irriga-
tion, drainage works, and rural roads plus as much as practicable of
investment costs, and carry out by December 31, 1987, at the latest,
a socio-economic study to be used as the basis for readjusting water
charges levels, which would be implemented promptly (para 6.20).
8.02      With agreement on the above assurances, the proposed project would
be suitable for a Bank loan of US$180 million to the Government of Mexico
for a period of 15 years, including three years of grace, on standard terms
and conditions.

BAJO RIO BRAVO/BAJO RIO SAN JUAN IRRIGATION REHABILITATION II
The International Water Treaty of 1944
1.        The project water supply comes from the Rio Bravo and its tributaries.
The Rio Bravo is an international stream which demarcates the boundary between
the United States and Mexico from Ciudad Juarez to its mouth. To avoid con-
troversy over use of its waters and other streams of common interest to the
two countries, a treaty governing such use was entered into in 1944 by Mexico
and the United States. The provisions as they concern the Rio Bravo specified
that:
(a) The International Boundary Commission established in 1889 would
become the International Boundary and Water Commission, with
reaffirmed powers and additional responsibilities granted to
study and construct dams and other works to ensure continuance
of present uses and the development of the greatest number of
feasible projects within the limits of water allotments specified.
(b) The channel of the Rio Bravo can be used by either country to
convey water belonging to it.
(c) Either country could divert water belonging to it and construct
the necessary works for such diversion at any point on the main
channel from Fort Quitman, Texas, to the Gulf of Mexico.
(d)  The Commission shall keep a record of the waters belonging to
each country.
(e) The waters of the Rio Bravo are allotted as follows:
(i) To Mexico
(1) All waters reaching the main channel of the Rio Bravo
from the San Juan and Alamo Rivers;
(2) One-half of the flow in the main channel below the lowest
major international storage dam so far as the flow is not
specifically allocated to either country;
(3) Two-thirds of the flow reaching the main channel of the
Rio Bravo from the Conchos, San Diego, San Rodrigo,
Escondido and Salado Rivers and the Las Vacas Arroyo,
subject to the rights of the United States as defined
below; and

ANNEX 1
Page 2
(4) One-half of all other flows not specifically allotted
under the treaty occurring between Forth Quitman, Texas,
and the lowest international storage dam.
(ii) To the United States
(1) All waters reaching the main channel of the Rio Bravo
from the Pecos and Devils River, Goodenough Spring and
Alamito, Terlingua, San Felipe and Pinto creeks;
(2) One-half of the flow in the main channel of the Rio
Bravo below the lowest major international storage dam
so far as the flow is not allocated to either country;
(3) One-third of the flow reaching the main channel of the
Rio Bravo from the Conchos, San Diego, San Rodrigo,
Escondido and Salado Rivers and the Las Vacas Arroyo,
provided that this third shall not be less than
431,721 M m3 annually as an average in cycles of five
consecutive years; and
(4) One-half of all other flows not specifically allocated
occurring in the main channel between Quitman and the
lowest international storage dam.
2.        The treaty thus gives a basis for accounting for all water flows.
Inflows to the international reservoirs can be credited on a daily or other
time period basis. Releases from storage are charged to the country request-
ing the release, and losses incurred in conveyance or evaporation from reser-
voirs are charged to either country in proportion to the water conveyed or
in storage.
3.        The Bajo Rio San Juan District 26 derives its supply from the wholly
Mexican San Juan River tributary. Therefore, Mexico is entitled to all flow
of this stream, including reuse of return flows from irrigation. On the other
hand the Bajo Rio Bravo District 25 utilizes water stored in the international
storage dams of Amistad and Falcon, as accounted for under the treaty, plus
flows of the Rio Alamo, any residual flow of the San Juan River, plus one-half
of the gains or losses in the river reach from Falcon to Anzalduas. Nor is
Mexico's share of the international stream all available for use on Bajo Rio
Bravo as there are three small irrigation districts which take part of the
country's allotment.  Their portion is reflected in the accounting of inflows
to the storage reservoir. Additionally, the areas served by river pumps in
both Bajo Rio San Juan and Bajo Rio Bravo Districts use some of the Mexican
allocation.

ANNEX 1

4.        For purposes of cost-sharing of joint facilities constructed in the
two international storage reservoirs, a divísion was made of the available
share according to each country's expected use. The shares allotted as as
follows:
Amistad     Falcon
Mexico                   43.5%        41.4%
USA                      56.5%        58.6%
Each country, however, has the right to use the storage space belonging to
the other country if such space cannot be used by the owning country. The
above allocations are also used in the event of reservoir spills to determine
water remaining to each country's credit.
