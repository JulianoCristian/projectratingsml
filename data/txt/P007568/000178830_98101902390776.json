The Mexican share of the international\n            waters would be utilized for promoting intensive agriculture\n            through improved drainage, water management, land leveling\n            and extension programs. The proposed project would improve\n            drainage in 60 percent of the project area and water\n            management over the entire areas covered by the two\n            irrigation districts. The project would directly benefit\n            15,459 farm families, of which 14,770 have holdings between\n            5 and 50 ha each. On full development, annual family incomes\n            are expected to increase between 110 and 500 percent."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
