PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

BAJO RIO BRAVOIRIO SAN JUAN IRRIGATION REHABILITATION II
(LOAN 2100-ME)
PREFACE
1.       This is the Projeet Completion Report (PCR) for the Bajo Rio
BravolRio San Juan Irrigation Rehabilitation II Project (Loan 2100-ME).
The loan was approved in March 1982, in the amount of US$180.0 million,
reduced to US$65.0 million in January 1985, and closed in September 1986
after cancellation of US$56.0 milli'n. The project and Bank-financed
participation has a long and repetitive history.  In 1963, a first Bank
Loan (336-ME) was made for the two districts (Bajo Rio Bravo Irrigation
District 25 and Bajo Rio San Juan Irrigation District 26). A follow-on
project, the Bajo Rio BravolRio San Juan Irrigation Rehabilitation I was
approved in 1975 in the amount of US$150.0 million and closed in 1983 after
cancellation of US$100.0 million.
2.       The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean
Regional Office based on a PCR prepared by the Borrower, on the President's
Report (No. P-3215-ME, dated February 25, 1982), the Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 3663-ME, dated February 19, 1982), internal Bank memoranda and other
correspondence as contained in the official Bank files and on discussions
with people in the Bank who were involved with the project during its
implementation. No further evaluation was undertaken by OED of the
project, as the PCR covers adequately the main reasons why the project did
not meet its objectives. The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on October
5, 1988 for their comments.
3.       Comments from the Borrower were received on December 2, 1988 and
are attached as Annex 6 to this report.

PROJECT w*MPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
BAJO RIO BRAVO/RIO SAN JUAN IRRIGATION REILBILITATION II
(LOAN 2100-ME)
_'ALUATION STIMMARY
1.       The project was the third Bank loan to support the development
of the Bajo Rio Bravo/Rio San Juan Region. When completed in 1971 with
an investment of about US$25 million, the first loan (336-ME) only
benefitted a small part of the two Districts. This was followed in 1975
by the Bajo Rio BravolBajo Rio San Juan Irrigation Rehabilitation
Project (Loan 1111-ME) and now referred to as Phase I. The Phase I
Project with an estimated total cost of US$384.6 million and a Bank loan
of US$150 million was approved by the Board in May 1975. Execution got
off to a slow start due to the subsequent economic crisis in 1976
resulting in reformulation and restructuring of the project in 1978;
assuming that completion of the project as originally envisaged would
require several phases over a period of about 15 years. In March 1979,
the Phase I project was reformulated with a total cost of US$130.9
million and a Bank loan of US$50 million (US$100 million of Loan 1111-ME
approved in 1975 was cancelled).
2.       The first phase project, as reformulated, was designed to deal
maiuly with improvement of the drainage and access road networks;
revised targets for execution of these two components were exceeded by
loan closing September 1983. However, it was already evident that land
levelling and changing of the cropping patterns from predominantly maize
and sorghum to higher value crops and increased cropping intensity, the
principal sources of benefits, was not being achieved. Preparation of
the second phase project, Rajo Rio Bravo/Bajo San Juan Irrigation
Rehabilitation II (Loan 2100-ME), the subject of this PCR, commenced in
1979 shortly after Board approval of the reformulated Phase I project.
Phase II estimated to cost US$525 million with a Bank loan of US$180
million was appraised in May 1981, approved by the Board in March 1982,
and became effective in March 1983. Meanwhile, Phase I closed September
1983, costing US$174.5 million, of which the Bank financed US$43.4
million. US$6.6 million of the reduced Phase I loan amount of US$50
million was cancelled.
3.       Following on the heels of the economic crisis at the end of
1982, the Phase II project got off to an austere start, with the first
supervision mission in April 1983 (one month following effectiveness)
reporting the p 3ject was faced with a serious shortage of counterpart
funds, reminiscent of experience under the yet to be concluded Phase I
project, and recommended that the percentage of Bank financing be
increased under the proposed Special Action Program (SAP). By March
1984, one year after the loan became effective, the Government suggested
reducing the scope of the project, and the cost from US$525 million to
US$130 million with the Bank to finance 502 of project cost, US$65



i-  v -
million, and to cancel US$115 million of the loan.  One hundred and
fifteen million dollars was cancelled September 7, 1984 and the loan
agreement was amended January 14, 1985 to increase the Bank financing to
702 under the SAP. By April 1985 it was obvious that the reduced Phase
II project was still considered a low priority by the Borrower as the
budget allocation for 1985 was less than 252 of that required for the
project as revised in 1984, and substantially lower than that for other
Bank-financed irrigation projects in Mexico. A supervision mission in
May 1985 recommended that the Bank terminate its association with the
project at an appropriate time. The Borrower requested cancellation of
an additional US$50 million on March 19, 1986. Allowing time to
disburse for commitments made and reconcile the Special Account, the
balance, US$56 million of the already reduced loan of US$65 million, was
cancelled September 25, 1986.
4.       Physical achievements only included a small part of the planned
drainage network, 52 of the land levelling program, 42 of the road
component, and virtually 02 of the planned irrigation works. The rate
of return on the above investments is estimated at 1.82. The borrower
estimates that expenditures under the project from 1982 through 1986
were US$29.4 million, 5.62 of the original project cost estimated of
US$525 million; while disbursements were US$8.7 million (4.82 of the
original amount of US$180 million) including a US$2.7 million front-end
fee. Obviously the Phase II project did not meet its objectives.
Evaluation of Phase II of itself is meaningless; thus PCR summarizes the
achievements and failure of Phase I, beginning in 1975 until the
termination of Phase II, at the end of 1986.
5.       The following lessons are highlighted:
- In series type projects, previous experience must be thoroughly
considered and taken into account in formulation and design of
subsequent projects;
- caution is required when embarking on projects that are far
larger in scope and investment than previous projects, avoid
being overly ambitious (Phase I actual was US$174 million and
Phase II proposed was US$525 million--a three-fold increase);
- one should not assume that dramatic changes in cropping
patterns and intensity can be achieved unless there are
corresponding dramatic changes in technology or other factors,
i.e., markets and prices (addition of new irrigation is one
thing, but rehabilitation is another)--irrigation existed in
the project area since 1946;
- irrigation apparently had less to do with doublecropping than
climatic risks, low yields, and low benefits;
- in considering a key component, in this case land leveling,
financed by private individuals, the benefits, risks, and
incentives must be carefully evaluated;



-v-
- government policies also affect the cropping pattern such as
incentives to grow basic crops (maize-sorghum, etc.) credit
more readily available for basic crops, guaranteed maize prices
higher than border prices, etc.;
-  long distance from consumption areas in Mexico and seasonal
competition for horticultural crops from areas closer to the
markets reduced the incentives to produce high-value cash
crops;
- the Borrower and the Bank rightly concluded in 1978 that the
irrigation rehabilitation program would take up to 15 years to
complete, therefore there was little justification or need to
be overly ambitious in the design of the Phase II project
expecting that there would also be a Phase III;
given the competition for labor and markets across the border
and the tendency for farmers in the project area to continue
essentially with traditional agricultural practices that
resulted in modest yields, it is questionable whether full
rehabilitation would ever be justified;
- a better means must be found to establish and maintain the
priority of projects in the local budget process;
- the SAP had little effect on disbursements--in this case
disbursements declined even with an increase in the percent the
Bank financed under the SAP;
- improved production supporting services (research, extension
and credit) can have an impact on production even without
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure; and
- provision ot adequate O&M budget and arrengements satisfactory
to the Bank need to be resolved under all Bank-financed
projects in Mexico.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Fince the adoption of Government policy in 1946 to promote
irrigation, about 5 million of the 22 million ha of cultivated land is now
irrigated and accounts for about 50% of the total agricultural production.
Nevertheless in the 1970s the Government began to shift emphasis from
irrigated to rainfed agriculture recognizing the potential for increased
production with a lower investment per unit of area and family, and the
*        need to assist the majority of farmers who had not and would not benefit
from irrigation.
1.02     Mexico's CjLobal Development Plan and Mexican Food System (SAM),
while emphasizing the importance of Improved rainfed agricultural
production, called for continued stimulation of the irrigation sub-sector
focusing on several aspects: (i) increased efficiency of irrigation. (ii)
improvement of water conveyance and distribution systems; (iii)
rehabilitation of irrigation systems, and (iv) improved soil and water
management.
1.03     The BRB/BRSJ Phase I and II Projects were designed to improve the
water distribution network and provide more efficient water distribution,
iprove the drainage systems and thus reduce production losses due to
oalinity and water-logging, promote land leveling to facilitate more
effective on-farm water distribution thus increasing yields, and
strengthening yield increasing production supporting services.
1.04     The Phase I Project (Loan 1111-ME), as reformulated in 1978,
focused on improvement of the drainage system on about 130,000 ha,
improvement and construction of selected roads, leveling of 77,000 ha, and
improvement of production supporting services in the entire project area
(280,000 ha).  In physical terms, apart from land leveling and purchase of
O&M equipment, performance was considered satisfactory. As Phase I was a
time-slice of a much larger program with investments fully completed in
only a small part (5,600 ha) of the total area, the economic analysis was
performed on the integrated program of Phase I and Phase II. A more
conservative assumption (as compared to the SAR for Phase II) was used
regarding the cropping pattern and intensity based on the continued
dominance of maize and sorghum; but also allowing for a substantial
increase in the cultivation of cotton and beans which has subsequently been
*        proven wrong.  This integrated analysis reduced the ERR from about 22% for
Stage II alone to 12.5X for the combined Stages.
1.05     The Second Phase Project (Loan 2100-ME) provided for continuing
the rehabilitation of the two Irrigation Districts 25 (BRB) and 26 (BRSJ)
covering an area of 140,000 ha benefitting about 15,500 farm families. The
project aimed to improve the water distribution through selective
realignment and lining of canals, and rehabilitation and expansion of the
drainage system to reduce water logging and salinity, leveling 105,000 ha
to provide for more efficient on-farm water distribution so as to increase



-2-
production and income, and strengthen yield increasing :-roduction
supporting services. It was envisaged that a third phase would still be
required to fully complete the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage in
the project area.
1.06     Principal responsibility for administration and execution of the
projects rested with the Sub-secretariat for Hydraulic Infrastructure (SIH)
in Mexico City with daily work operations conducted by the chiefs of the
two Irrigation Districts 25 and 26, under the direction of the SARH
Reprecentative fcr the State of Tamaulipas. The first phase project
(Loan 1111-ME) estimated to cost US$384 million and a Bank loan of
US$150 million was approved by the Board May 1975 and was completed
September 1983 at a cost of US$174.5 million with Bank finance of
US$43.4 million; US$106.6 million of the first phase loan was cancelled.
The second phase project (Loan 2100-ME) estimated to cost US$525 million
and a Bank loan of US$180 m'llion was approved by the Board March 1982, and
became effective March 1983.
1.07     In terms of the original scope, design, and objectives, the Phase
I and IT projects, having achieved only a relatively small part of the
original goals, must be considered a failure (a comparative basic data
summary of the two projects is contained in Annexes 1 and 2).  This is in
no way meant to criticize the agencies or individuals responsible for
administration and execution of the projects. The physical works, though
far less than envisaged, were implemented satisfactorily and thus water
distribution, drainage, and communications were satisfactorily improved in
part of the total project area while yield increasing production supporting
services were improved in the entire project area.
1.08     The most striking thing about the projects is their similarity in
design, lack of priority, budgetary constraints, failure to achieve
original targets and objectives, and low economic and productive impact.
It would appear that the projects were overly ambitious in terms of
priorities and targets for development in Mexico during a period of
austerity. This was not recognized, either by Government authorities or
the Bank appraisal mission, even though it should have been more obvious
during preparation and appraisal of the second phase project, based on the
experience of the first phase project. It is now clear that the projects
as originally conceived were not econe-mically-viable. Benefit expectations
have not been achieved because the cropping pattern continues to be
dominated by basic crops--sorghuv. and maize, thus lacking the change to
higher value crops and higher cropping intensity envisaged by the appraisal
that would be required to obtain a satisfactory economic rate of return.
Also, land leveling which was essential to improve the efficiency of water
use and increase yields was one of the least successful operations under
the projects. Land leveling was considered a low priority by individual
farmers, and probably was a poor investment. There is no evidence that a
financial analysis of land leveling was ever undertaken by the Borrower or
the Bank to determine financial benefits, although such a study was
suggested in the PCR for Phase I, and recommended by supervision missions
in 1985. It would appear that the viability of the project was not
adequately questioned until budgetary constraints became so severe that
continuation of Bank finance was in jeopardy.

1.09     Finally in 1985, both the Borrower and the Bank agreed that the
project was no longer viable, and of sufficient priority to obtain
acceptable budgetary allocation, thus the balance of the Bank loan should
be cancelled. The Borrower and the Bank also concluded that
rehabilitation, improvement, and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage
systems in the two districts should continue on a priority basis, but
investments would be small and scattered, not justifying future Bank
financial support.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     BRB/BRSJ Rehabilitation II Project was prepared by the Government
of Mexico's Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources (SARH), Sub-
secretariat for Hydraulic Infrastructure (SIH) and Sub-secretariat for
Planning and Studies (SEP).  A Bank mission in April 1981 determined that
the project was ready for appraisal.
2.02     The project was appraised in May 1981.  The June 1981
issues/decision process focused on retroactive financing, cost recovery and
land leveling; no mention was made of experience under Phase I (Loan
1111-ME) or counterpart financing. CPS did question the investment of
US$34,000 per family under the project, the feasibility of achieving the
proposed changes in the cropping pattern and intensity, and experience
under Phase I, but no record of discussion of these points was found during
the file search. The SVOP suggested that the Borrower was already in
default of the cost recovery covenant of Loan 1111-ME; however, it was
explained that the Borrower was not in default because cost recovery had
been a condition of effectiveness.
2.03     A post ^ppraisal mission visi-ed Mexico in December 1981 to
clarify issues regarding: (i) water charges, (ii) land leveling, and (iii)
budget allocations for the project. SARH advised that water charges would
be increased in 1982, with annual adjustments thereafter. The mission
discussed the SARH plan for land leveling and were satisfied with what was
being proposed; details were to be provided at negotiations. It was agreed
to reduce the target for land leveling from 135,000 ha to 105,000 ha and
postpone the remainder to Phase III, scheduled to begin in 1989. The
December mission was advised that the 1982 project budget had already been
reduced from Mex$l,600 million (US$64 million) to Mex$500 million (US$20
million) and it was agreed that the budget problem would again be reviewed
at negotiations.
Nestotiations and Board Approval
2.04     Negotiations took place in January 1982.  All issues discussed,
except water charges, were resolved at negotiations. In a subsequent memo
from the RVP to the SVOP, it was explained that water charges had already
been revised to cover 702 of O&M costs and that GOM had agreed, by letter,



-4-
to attain full cost recovery by 1986. Furthermore, GOM again agreed to
complete a socio-economic study (a study was to be completed under Phase I
by the end of 1982) to determine the farmers' ability to pay. The study
now was to be completed by the end of December 1987. The SVOP approved
these arrangements and negotiations were declared completed. Details,
satisfactory to the Bank, regarding the land leveling program were provided
at negotiations and related assurances were deleted from the legal
documents. There is no evidence on file that counterpart finance or budget
allocations were discussed during negotiatio7is as had been indicated by the
December 1981 post-appraisal mission (para 2.03).
2.05     EDs raised appropriate questions segarding: (i) water charges,
(ii) what had occurred to expect better performance under phase II knowing
that Phase I had been reformulated in 1978, three years after the original
appraisal and two-thirds of the loan had been cancelled. and (iii)
contingencies that were 502 of project base costs. Bank staff explained
that water charges would take into account the ability to pay as well as
actual O&M cost and thus a socio-economic study (para 2.04) would be
conducted under the project. In reference to performance under the first
project, it was ir.dicated that this experience had been built into the
design of the second project and that Bank staff had confidence in Mexico's
management of itrigation districts. It was stated that contingencies had
beer. calculatel according to Bank guidelines and were a function of price
increases and the construction period. The loar. of US$180 million was
approved by the Board March 16, 1982, signed in May, and became effective
March 1983.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
General
3.01     BRB/BRSJ Phase II Project became effective March 1983, six
months prior to the termination of Phase I (Loan 1111-ME). The most
revealing factor about the projects is their overly ambitious design and
similar slow implementation and budgetary allocation constraints. While
Phase I was coming to an end at a slow pace due to a shortage of
counterpart funds, Phase II was struggling to get started with a budget
allocation of less than 10 of that estimated at appraisal for the first
year.
3.02     The first supervision in April 1983, one month after
effectiveness, reported that project implementation was slow because of the
limited budget allocation. It was also reported that some works suspended
under Phase I would be financed and completed under Phase II. The next
supervision was in December 1983 as part of the Special Action Program
(SAP) and it was again proposed that Phase II be divided into an
additional stage to be completed in 1993. In April 1984 it was suggested
that US$114.5 million of the loan be cancelled and that the Bank increase
disbur3ements under all categories to 702 during the period 1984/85.
3.03     The Borrower officially requested cancellation of US$115 million
September 5, 1984, and that amount was cancelled September 7, 1984. It was



- 5 -
estimated that the revised project cost would be US$131 million (down from
US$525 estimated at appraisal) and the remaining Bank loan of US$65 million
would finance 50 of total project cost (Annex 4). January 14, 1985 the
loan agreement was amended, under the SAP, to provide for 702 Bank finance
of categories 1 (civil works). 2 (land leveling) and 4 (technical
assistance) during the period July 1, 1984 through June 30, 1986. Finally,
a supervision mission in May 1985, finding that the budget allocation for
1985 was less than 252 of the amount agreed upon when the project was
restructured in 1984 (Annex 4), concluded that the project was no longer
viable and that the Bank should termiuate its association with the project.
Recognizing the urgent need for improved maintenance, the mission suggested
that the Bank would finance t1v purchase of O&M equipment to be purchased
as a matter of urgency prior to loan cancellation.  The isaue of
cancellation vas again discussed and agreed upon in principle during the
July 1985 CPIR. The Borrower requested cancellation of an additional
US$55 million of the remaining US$65 million in March 1986. Ultimately
US$8.9 million was disbursed and the balance of US$56.1 million was
cancelled September 25, 1986.
3.04     Physical achievements under the project were minimal and an
undetermined part of vorks financed under Phase II were actually completion
of commitments made under Phase I. Details of project achievements and
expenditures are summarized in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 below and discussed in

Civil Works
3.05     Civil works, irrigation and drainage systems, roads, and land
leveling were the largest and most important components of the BRB/BRSJ
Projects.  After reformulation of Phase I in 1978 (Annex 1), progress,
except for land leveling and purchase of O&M equipment, was satisfactory.
The second phase project focused on drainage and irrigation components that
accounted for more than 702 of the estimated costs.  Land leveling was
again seen as the key to more efficient soil and water management and
increased production. Physical achievement summarized (Table 3.1) were as
follows: (i) 917 km of irrigation canals were programmed and 18 km were
completed; (ii) 1.890 km of drains were programmed and 294 km (including
rehabilitation and new construction) were completed; (iii) of the 1,750 km
of roads programmed, only 65 km were completed; (iv) of the 5,882 units of
auxiliary civil works structures programmed, none were completed; and tv)
of the 105,000 ha of land leveling programmed only 5,000 ha was completed.
Once again the experience with land leveling was disappointing and
apparently the incentives in terms of cost and benefits were not sufficient
to encourage farmers to Invest. Engineering design and supervision carried
out by the irrigation district staff were satisfactory in spite of severe
budgetary constraints, reflecting the high calibre of professional staff in
the SARH system.



-7-
Oneration and Maintenance
3.06     O&M has long been a contentious issue within Mexico and between
the Borrower and the Bank. O&M has traditionally received inadequate
budgetary allocations and as a result the lack of conservation and
maintenance of the principal canals and deterioration of infrastructure has
reduced considerably the carrying capacity of the canal systems in the
project area. Bank supervision missions, supported by district engineers,
have persistently pressed for purchase of O&M equipment and increases in
the OEM budget. At the time that it was decided to discontinue Bank
association with the project, the supervision mission made a final plea for
some loan funds to be used for purchase of O&M equipment.  Of the US$10
million of Bank finance earmarked for equipment under Phase II, none was
disbursed (Annex 1). Furthermore, as indicated in Tables 3.1 and 3.2,
there were no expenditures either local or Bank financed for equipment.
Three and one-half million dollars of local funds (Annex 2) was spent for
purchase of OEM equipment under Phase I.
Technical Assistance
3.07     Technical assistance (extension and research) continued to provide
services to the entire project areas, although constrained by budgetary
allocations. Given the austerity program "-ider which technicians had to
work, performance was considered satisfactory.
Credit
3.08     The project did not include a credit component although it was
assumed that existing credit resources would be available and adequate.
Credit experience was mixed both in terms of timely and adequate
availability, and farmer demand.
Disbursement
3.09     After payment of the US$2.7 million commitment fee in FY1983,
lisbursements were only US$0.1 million in the first year of implementation
FY1984, US$4.8 million in FY1985, and a final US$1.3 million in FY1986.
Not including the commitment fee, the Bank disbursed only US$6.2 million
(Table 3.3) of the total estimated cost of US$29.4 million (Table 3.2) or
21? of total project cost in spite of the 70? eligibility for disbursement
under the SAP for FY1985 and 1986.

Procurement
3.10     The legal documents provided that, so far as practical, civil
works would be packaged into contracts of US$2.0 million or more and
procured under ICB. The executing agency followed the usual practice of
fragmentation of contracts and all civil works procurement was by LCB.
Supervision missions reminded the executing agency of the need for
packaging; however, budgetary constraints in this case made packaging
impractical.
Reports and Auditing
3.11     Reports were submitted with some delay in an acceptable format.  A
draft PCR prepared by SARH, SEP, was presented to a Bank mission that
visited Mexico in October 1987. Information from the SARH PCR has been
used in preparing this r;port.  Separate accounts for the project were
maintained and auditing was not considered a problem.
Compliance with Covenants
3.12     The borrower failed to provide the funds and other resources to
implement the project, an issue that hampereft compliance with other
covenants.
IV. AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
Agricultural Impact
4.01     For all practical purposes the Phase II Project was not
implemented and no measurable impact was made. However, this report
briefly reviews the expected benefits and actual benefits of Phase I and
Phase II during the period 1978 through 1986. At the time that both
projects were first appraised, in 1975 and 1981, the cropping intensity



-9 -
ranged from 1.10 to 1.20 and the cropping pattern was dominated by maize
and sorghum (Annex 5). It was expected that improving the irrigation and
drainage system and land leveling would increase the efficiency of the
Irrigation system and through better soil and water management, make it
possible to increase cropping intensity and the area under cultivation
(Table 4.1) as well as to facilitate diversification to higher value crops.

Intensity
1/ Total project area - 140,000 ha.
21 Actual cropping pattern and intensity when the project was terminated 9/86
was still essentially the same as in 1981 (para 4.02).
4.02     The most significant production impact was to come from a 28%
increase in the area cropped; an increase in cropping intensity from 1.16
to 1.48 and crop diversification. The area under maize and sorghum would
decrease 341 while beans would increase from 10,000 ha to 122,000 ha and
cotton would increase from 1,500 ha to 27,000 ha (Annex 5). Estimated
yield increases were feasible with known technology and based on experience
wcth other irrigation projects in Mexico.1   A 61 increase in the area
cultivated during the first cycle (summer season) was also feasible;
however, a 2301 increase of the areas cultivated in the second cycle with
771 of the area (122,000 ha) planted to beans was not supported by
experience (para 2.02). The Borrower's PCR has indicated that the cropping
pattern and intensity were still unchanged in 1986 with about 98% of the
area still used for production of maize and sorghum.
4.03     A cropping intensity of 1.50 and higher under irrigation in Mexico
is feasible with adequate water management, water availability and climatic
conditions; but none of these conditions are favorable in BRB/BRSJ and, in
particular, the climatic conditions will not change. The availability of
adequate water for intensive cultivation and high yields in the project
area has been questioned by some Mexican and Bank staff and the 'ssue has
1/ Yields of sorghum in Districts 25 and 26 ranged from 3.0 to 3.6 tons/ha
during the period 1981-1986 while national yields were 4.9 to
5.3 tons/ha. Source: SARH SEP PCR, September 1987.

yet to be resolved. Different views regarding availability of water have
been expressed including the 1975 and 1981 appraisals and in separate
studies by SARH cited in the Phase I- PCR.
4.04     The fact that farmers crop about 15Z of the area during the second
cycle is indicative of the climatic risk involved and the low return from
the second cycle crops. Yields of maize for example, during the second
cycle are less than one half those obtained in the first cycle. Yields of
beans, the second most important off-season crop are low, ranging from 0.5
to 0.7 tons per ha. Even the appraisal forecast bean yields at full
development of less than one ton per ha is hardly an attractive alternative
considering labor requirements and climatic risks.
4.05     Cotton was an important crop in the region in the 1960s and into
the 1970s but its importance has been declining for several reasons: (i)
high cost labor requirement, (ii) although cotton can be mechanized, it
requires a specialized (and more costly) mix of equipment compared to maize
and sorghum that can be mechanized with the same basic machines, (iii)
increasing incidence of pest and cost of control, and (iv) increasing world
market competition and declining prices. Furthermore, the project area
must compete with identical soil and climatic conditions, as well as
markets for products (particularly high value cash crops), and for labor,
across the border in the US. Also, the area is a long distance from Mexico
City and other principal internal markets for fruits and vegetables.
4.06     The Borrower's PCR indicates that it has not been possible to
reach the production potential of the District 25 and 26 because works have
not been completed in all areas, drainage is still inefficient, ponding and
salinity have not been controlled, and there are water deficits in some
areas due to inadequate conservation and maintenance of the distribution
system. Many of the farmers still use traditional production practices
(except for mechanization); and farmers resist crop diversification, land
leveling, and in some cases even credit. Yields of maize and sorghum have
ranged from 3.0 to 3.6 tons/ha during the project period while national
levels are 4.0 to 5.3 tons/ha. Even more difficult to explain is that
average yields are equal to or even higher in the adjacent San Fernando
Project (Loan 2191-ME) area under rainfed conditions.
4.07     The farmers may well be right, the viability of land leveling and
crop diversification have not been proven. The SAR indicates an average
cost of more than US$620 per ha for land leveling; a large sum to expect to
recover from incremental production.2 In 1981 pesos and prices. US$620 is
equivalent to the value of 4 tons of maize. The net value per ton to the
farmer (farmgate price less cost of production) is about 0.2 tons. This
simplistic calculation indicates that the farmer would have to obtain
incremental production of 20 tons of maize before he starts to receive
benefits from the land leveling investment--a period of 12 years with the
estimated 1.7 ton/ha increase in yield at full development. Obviously a
detailed financial analysis is required to determine whether land leveling
is a viable investment from the individual farmers point of view. The
Loan 1111-HE PCR and subsequent supervision mission suggested a financial
analysis of land leveling be carried out; there is no evidence that an
analysis was ever done.
2/ Yields can actually be depressed in the initial years following land
leveling.

Economic Impact
4.08     The economic rates of return on Loans 1111-ME (Phase I) and
2100-ME (Phase II) have been calculated several times for each of the
individual projects and in recent years for the combination of the two
projects, and the only consistent fact is that interim and final economic
analyses have always been lower than the original appraisal culminating
with a fir ,l ERR close to 0. The ERR analysis carried out by the Bank in
1985 is still considered valid (Annex 3) and is consistent with the PCR ERR
analysis of the Borrower (September 1987). Investments in 1986 (Table 3.2)
were too small to affect the ERR.

cl Combined Phase I and Phase II.
4.09     The projects as originally designed and at the level of
expenditures proposed were not viable. However, the Government needs to
carefully consider continuing investment that will provide at least for
conservation and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage system, and
make priority investments for improvement of the systems. Failure to do
this could result in continuing stagnation and even possible decline of
agricultural production in the area.
V. BANK PERFORMANCE
5.01     Given the uncertainty about the availability of adequate water and
losses in the distribution system the Bank performed a useful service
(during the appraisal of Loan 1111-ME in 1975) by insisting that a study be
carried out before proceeding with the lining of 3,200 km of canals as was
proposed under the first phase project. In hindsight, the Bank perhaps
should have required that the study and at least part of the infrastructure
design be completed, if not before appraisal, at least prior to loan
effectiveness which could have reduced the delay in execution and possibly
eliminated the reformulation of Phase I in 1978.

5.02     Both, the Phase I and II Projects wete overly ambitious (Annex 2-
US$385 million under Phase I and US$525 million under Phase II) in the
context of the prevailing economic conditions that existed in Mexico when
the projects were being formulated and processed. Under the second phase
project, the Bank failed to adequately take into account the experience
under the first phase project in spite of warnings from within the Bank
itself (paras 2.02-2.05) during loan processing. Although the Phase II
Project was overly ambitious and failed to adequately take into account the
experiences under Phase I (budgetary constraints, reformulation, and
cancell-ation of loan funds), it should be pointed out that the Phase II
Project was prepared and appraised under the 1977-1982 administration which
apparently attributed a somewhat higher priority to the BRS/BRSJ area and
irrigation rehabilitation than the 1983-1988 administration. Significant
changes were introduced in the GOM agricultural sector institutional system
as well as development strategy and policy beginning in 1983 that may have
contributed to the low budgetary priority of the project.
5.03     Once past the formulation stage, Bank supervision performance was
good. The budgetary constraints were recognized immediately and scaling
down the size and scope of the project was being discussed within the first
few months following loan effectiveness. The project was reformulated in
1984 and an attempt was made to salvage the remainder of the operations by
increasing the percentage of Bank finance under the SAP. In retrospect,
the GOM budget process is independent of sources of finance, thus
increasing Bank finance had little or no effect on decisions regarding
budget allocations for the project. Supervision missions were frequent
(eight in four years) and intense (80 days in the field). By mid-1985 the
Borrower and Bank supervision missions agreed that the project should be
terminated as quickly and painlessly as possible.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions
6.01     The project was not a success because only a fractional part of
its objectives were achieved; the agricultural production impact was
minimal, and the ERR was far below the opportunity cost of capital. The
project failed because it did not learn from the experience of the first
phase and the scope and design were overly ambitious in context of the area
to be served and the enormous investment required during a period of
economic austerity in Mexico. The viability of the project was based on
questionable assumptions regarding changes in the cropping pattern and
cropping intensity, and the acceptability of land leveling; all of which
depend on the decisions of individual farmers. There is no evidence that
the farmers, views or opinions were sought or adequately taken into
consideration with respect to on-farm operations; particularly land
leveling.
6.02     The project did not take into account sufficiently the economic
influence of the adjacent US border areas that have the same soil and
climatic conditions, produce the same crops at the same time, and also



- 13 -
compete directly for labor that can often obtain at least seasonal
employment across the border. Family ties extend across the border
providing mutual economic support. The US market is not readily
accessible, except for some very specialized crops, and accecs is next to
impossible when confronted with identical seasonal and agronomic conditions
that virtually rules out prospects for export of common fruits and
vegetables from the project area.
6.03     Also the project area, 575 km (by air) from Mexico City, is not
well located to compete for the internal fruit and vegetable market in the
main population and consumption centers. Furthermore, the northern border
regions have a disadvantage in competing with other regions that have a
more favorable climate for year-round fruit and vegetable production.
6.04     Taking into account the market and labor constraints for
production of high value cash crops, it should not be surprising that
farmers opt for producing basic crops (maize and sorghum) that are
encouraged by Government policy, and have a secure market at guaranteed
prices (often higher than world market prices). Furthermore, these two
crops can be mechanized using the same equipment and at a relatively low
cost compared to production of cotton or vegetables that would require more
complex technology, a higher level of management, and greater risks.
Lessons Learned
6.05     - In series type projects, previous experience must be thoroughly
considered and taken into account in formulation and design of
subsequent projects;
- caution is required when embarking on projects that are far
larger in scope and investment than previous projects, avoid
being overly ambitious (Phase I actual was US$174 million and
phase II proposed was US$525 million - a three-fold increase);
- one should not assume that dramatic changes in cropping patterns
and intensity can be achieved unless there are corresponding
dramatic changes in technology or other factors, i.e. markets
and prices (addition of new irrigation is one thing, but
rehabilitation is another) - irrigation existed in the project
area since 1946;
- irrigation apparently had less to do with double cropping than
climatic risks, low yields, and low benefits;
- in considering a key component, in this case land leveling,
financed by private individuals, the benefits, risks, and
incentives must be carefully evaluated;
- Goverrment policies also affect the cropping pattern such as
incentives to grow basic crops (maize-sorghum etc), credit more
readily available for basic crops, guaranteed maize prices
higher than border prices, etc.;



- 14 -
- long distance from consumption areas in Mexico and seasonal
competition for horticultural crops from areas closer to the
markets reduced the incentives to produce high value cash crops;
- the Borrower and the Bank rightly concluded in 1978 that the
irrigation rehabilitation program would take up to 15 years to
complete therefore there was little justification or need to be
overly ambitious in the design of the Phase II project expecting
that tnere would also be a Phase III;
- given the competition for labor and markets across the border and
the tendency for farmers in the project area to continue
essentially with traditional agricultural practices that resulted
In modest yields, it is questionable whether full rehabilitation
would ever be Justified;
- a better means must be found to establish and maintain the
priority of projects in the local budget process;
- the SAP had little effect on disbursement--in this case
disbursements declined even with an increase in the percent Bank
finance under the SAP;
-  improved production supporting services (reseurch, extension and
credit) can have an impact on production even without
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure; and
- provision of adequate O&M budget and arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank need to be resolved under all Bank financed projects in
Mexico.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ERR  The program as originally conceived           1.82
Under the present conditions, the project is not economically
viable.  The scenario suggest that the level of expenditure for the project
as envisioned at appraisal in 1981 or as modified in 1984 would be
economically justified. The estimated ERR at appraisal was estimated to be
172.
The following additional assumptions were used in the 1985
analyses: (a) prices for corn and sorghum are as quoted at Laredo, Texas,
for June 1985 contract-; (b) the economic price for beans is as given by
SARE for 1985; (c) production costs reflect SARH estimates for the 1985
growing season, less taxes, interest and insurance and plus an estimated
30? increase for the subsidy on fertilizer; and (d) the life of the project
is assumed to be 50 years. Intangible benefits, auch as increased commerce
and banking, and improved nutrition, were not included in the economic
analysis.
Sensitivity Analysis
The impact of various changes to assumptions was tested as
indicated in the tables below. There are no reasonable assumptions under
which continuation with the project as originally conceived could be
justified. However, a full maintenance program, to sustain and improve the
functioning of existing infrastructure, especially drains, and continuation
of the extension program, are fully justified.

Page 2 of 8
Comments on Proiect Completion Report:
Baio Rio Bravo/Baio Rio San Juan Irrigation Rehabilitation Project,
Phase I1 (World Bank Loan 2100-ME)
The PCR lists thirteen lessons learned from the Project. While we
do not disagree with them, we believe it worthwhile to offer the following
considerations:
-    The significance of these irrigation areas is made clear in the
Northern Border Region Development Program, which states in
Section 4, "Lines of Action, by Municipal Zone," that support for
agricultural production in Matamoros and Valle Hermoso is to be
provided through conservation and rehabilitation works in Bajo Rio
Bravo Irrigation District 25, and in Rio Bravo Municipal Zone
through rehabilitation of Bajo Rio San Juan Irrigation District 26.
The importance of these irrigation districts lies in the fact that
two thirds of the irrigated area in the northern border region and
one third of all irrigated land in Mexico are concentrated in
Tamaulipas and Sonora, and in the further fact that the three
Tamaulipas districts, located on the border itself, combine with the
Rio Colorado district to make up 83 percent of the total irrigated
area existing in the nine strictly "border" irrigation districts.
-    Prior to rehabilitation of the two districts in question, there had
been the experience in the Mexicali Valley, where the instability of
cotton prices and demand for this commodity on the international
market during the 1970s led to a change in the thinking of many
farmers, who became reluctant not to plant other crops. This
explains why the cultivation of rye grass, alfalfa and forage
sorghum -- an objective of the Livestock Program introduced in 1972
- shot up so markedly. The creation of artificial pasture ranges
on the Mexicali Valley saltlands had the twofold goal of correcting
their salinity and providing forage for livestock moved in from the
interior of the country for fattening prior to export on the hoof to
the United States.
-    Since the arable land lying in irrigation districts 25 and 26 is of
the best type, it is a waste to use them exclusively for growing
staple grains. The advisability of a changeover to vegetables, more
labor-intensive, should be seriously considered.
-    As to the points where the project has failed, thorough examination
of the causes should lead to frequent, regular monitoring to ensure
better-quality results. One necessary question is whether the
degree of soil salinity can be rectified or not.
-    Regarding official incentive policies, it would be advisable to
consider cutting back or eliminating incentives on staple grains
like sorghum and maize in the north (e.g. by doing away with credits
for these crops) and instead introducing incentives on such
high-value cash crops as oilseeds (safflower, sesame) and citrus
fruits, which require less water and involve lower costs.



- 23 -                           ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 8
As far as the impact of adjacent U.S. zones is concerned, due
account should be taken of comparative advantages on the Mexican
side (wage levels, low input and labor costs), and possible
climatological and ecological disadvantages on the U.S. side.
It should not be forgotten that the Tamaulipas border zone is less
advanced technologically (agriculture is less diversified and less
capital-intensive) than the rest of Mexico's northern border
region. Accordingly, if its irrigated areas are to achieve a higher
output, training will be needed to change farmer attitudes and
ensure satisfactory results in the medium and longer term.
In terms of national sovereignty, the border region is highly
strategic. This makes it essential to raise both technological
development and productivity levels so that Mexico can compete on
and capture a larger share of the U.S. market, thereby improving its
foreign-exchange earning capability enough to offset part of the
loss it has suffered in this regard as a result of lower oil
prices. Application of the principle of regional complementarity,
under which Mexico's central agricultural regions would supply the
northern border region with staple grains, would allow the latter to
concentrate more forcifully on utilizing its agroecological
potential and comparative advantages to produce export crops.
The priorities established in Mexico's development plans and
programs need to be clearly identified and given proper weight in
projects designed to be executed in conjunction with the World Bank,
and the Bank in its turn should require this as a condition for
funding commitments to such projects.

Dear Mr. Donaldson:
Receipt is acknowledged of your letter of October 5 last, which
asked us. to forward you our cosments on the accompanying Completion Report on
the Bajo Rio Bravo/Bajo Rio San Juan Irrigation Rehabilitation Project II
(Loan 2100-ME), for inclusion in the final version of the document due to be
submitted to the Executive Directors of the Bank.
The executing, borrowing and guaranteeing agencies involved have ncw
examined the Report. The series of comments incorporating their observations
and opinions, which is set out in the attached annex, will, I trust, contri-
bute to a better understanding of the Project execution process.
In this regard, ; should like to note that any evaluation of the
results of this Project -ust take full account of .Mexico's economic situation
and its effects on domestic investment programs. It is important to remember
that the Project was originally designed by the Government and the World Bank
at a time when economic conditions were comparatively favorable, but
thatsubsequently the economic crisis made it necessary to adjust Project goal,
to severe, new fiscal constraints.   Despite such restrictions, however,

Coments on Project Completion Report:
Baio Rio Bravo/Balo Rio San Juan Irrixation Rehabilitation Pro1ect. Phase 11
(Loan 2100-ME)
GENERAL
1.        This document in fact evaluates both the first and second phases of
the Project. although Phase I was the subject of its own earlier Government
/World Bank PCR.
2.        At various points, this new PCR refers to both the first and second
phases of the Project as failures. without taking into account any of the
successes achieved in both instances. In fact, there Is a tendency throughout
the document to deal only with negatives; although these were certainly
present, some indication of successes would give a broader view of the Project.
3.        The Project is actually not completed, but on the c=ntrary continues
to have priority status and is therefore going ahead (despite the lack of
external funding) as allowed by Federal Government financial capacity. Since
ex-post evaluation is a procedure properly applicable only to completed pro-
Jects, the word "failure" should accordingly be eliminated from this document.
4.        Clarification is needed of the fact that the fundamental obstacle in
the execution process was solely financial in nature, a consequ nen of the
budget restrictions the Federal Government imposed as part of its general
economic policy.
5.        It should be indicated explicitly that the World Bank itself Is
equally responsible for the fact that the Project was, as the PCR states,
designed on a very ambitious scale.
6.        It is appropriate to emphasize the singular importance for the
success of any project, but particularly those calling for rehabilitation of
Irrigation areas, of exhaustive work in determining the phases into which they
can best be divided.  Each phase should be a self-sufficient module capable cr
accomplishing objectives and goals independently. In this regard, detailed
technical and financial studies are an essential requirement for reliable
pre-project diagnosis of ,revailing socio-economic conditions and existing
production resources.

necessary, with much more
iMportance being given to
drainage, water distribution,

less to relining of canals.

lack of resources for main-

destruction of facilities.
However, prevailing economic
conditions in Mexico have
made it impossible to allo-

purchasing machinery and
equipment.

technical studies to justify
their inclusion, being part
of a 1978 master plan that
called for work in Units II
and IV of District 25 and I
of District 26.  It was
finally decided to rehabili-
tate Unit I so as to have a
pilot zone where results
could be observed with a view
to upgrading 103,000 ha in
the two districts.
In addition, the
reformlation was modified
significantly during the
course of project execution.
During Phase I, plans for
rehabilitating and improving
the drainage systems were
expanded to cover a consider-
able segment of Unit I in
District 25 and a smaller seg-
ment of Unit III iu District
26, the former being occupied
predominantly by saallholders.

Accordingly, there is no
basis for this assertion.
The benefits obtained in

and communications with Bank
funding (US$49.7 million in
the two phases) are quite
satisfactory, although they
affect only a part of the
total project area.
