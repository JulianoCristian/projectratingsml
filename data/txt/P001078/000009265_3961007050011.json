The\n            operation's objectives are: 1) strengthen the monetary,\n            regulatory, supervisory, and judicial environment; 2)\n            develop a bridge between the informal and formal sectors to\n            increase the reach of the financial sector; and 3) build\n            upon the human resource base and improve institutional\n            capacity. The Government will contribute to the development\n            of indirect instruments of monetary management such as open\n            market operations, disengage from the capital and management\n            of financial institutions, adopt regulation for all\n            categories of financial institutions, reinforce supervision\n            mechanisms, and take measures to improve the judicial system\n            in its enforcement of financial contracts and the recovery\n            of bad debt. To build a bridge between the formal and\n            informal sectors, the system of mutualistic savings and loan\n            institutions will be extended in rural areas, and a new\n            system will be introduced in Conakry. Institution building\n            will focus on: 1) improving the capacity of the Central Bank\n            to conduct monetary policy and supervise and restructure\n            financial institutions; 2) building the capacity within the\n            Ministry of Finance to monitor and analyze financial sector\n            developments; 3) strengthening the Ministry of Justice and\n            the court system; and 4) training commerical bank and\n            insurance company staff, as well as members of the legal profession."}, "docdt": "1994-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
