Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project: a) to ensure successful implementation, a\n            project has to be kept simple, well focused and have well\n            identified priorities; b) the capacity of the borrower to\n            implement a project should be correctly assessed and\n            measures to reinforce it, if needed, taken well before\n            project effectiveness; c) a thorough participatory approach\n            in project preparation is paramount to ensure project\n            ownership, understanding of its objectives, and proper\n            identification of potential implementation problems; d)\n            reform of the judicial system alone will not achieve any\n            significant results, without proof of government enforcment\n            the laws and elimination of corruption; e) an adjustment\n            operation, due to its short duration, is not a suitable\n            vehicle to address judicial system reforms; and f)\n            restructuring and recapitilizing troubled banks without\n            changing their ownership is a bad idea because it does not\n            deal with the cause of the problems."}, "docdt": "1999-07-27T00:00:00Z"}
