The proposed studies would include the feasibility\n            of restructuring the existing sector institutions; the\n            manpower and long-term training needs; review of accounting\n            systems, and procedures with subsequent follow up in\n            implementation; and the preparation of technical feasibility\n            work. Training and technical assistance would develop and\n            strengthen the planning, operating and construction\n            supervision activities of the sector entities. The priority\n            investment measures would provide supplies and equipment\n            needed to improve water supply operations and for minor\n            water production and distribution extensions to two major\n            urban systems."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
