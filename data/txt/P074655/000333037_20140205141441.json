approved by the Board on May 16,\n            2003 and closed on December 19, 2005. The operation had two\n            objectives. The first was to support the liquidation of\n            Banrural, a financial institution that for several decades\n            had provided subsidized credit for agriculture, accumulating\n            very large losses caused by extreme inefficiencies, low\n            collection efforts and excessive administrative costs. The\n            institution had been able to remain liquid in spite of its\n            huge losses by attracting deposits through unsustainably\n            high interest rates (which will not have allowed it to repay\n            the loans in the future). The second was to help the\n            Government put in its place Financiera Rural, which would\n            not receive deposits or issue any debt, was to be totally\n            financed with an endowment created by the government, should\n            maintain the value of its capital endowment in real terms,\n            report periodically to Congress, lend only to low and middle\n            income rural producers, and move, over time, fully to\n            second-tier lending. The Financial Sector Assessment Program\n            (FSAP) mission that visited Mexico in 2001 had recommended\n            these two actions in view of the negative effects of the\n            large losses in the delivery of credit to the rural areas\n            and in the macroeconomic situation of the country. In\n            addition, the Project was designed to buttress several key\n            development objectives of the Government of Mexico, namely:\n            (a) reducing the fiscal drain of loss-making banks, (b)\n            providing access to financial markets to groups not served\n            by commercial banks, (c) providing prudent lending to the\n            rural sector thereby stimulating output growth and\n            employment generation, and (d) improving the financial\n            performance of Financiera Rural as compared to Banrural in\n            terms of outreach and market coverage, portfolio quality,\n            yields, and financial efficiency."}, "docdt": "2014-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
