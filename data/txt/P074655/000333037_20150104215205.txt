 synopsis

   A decade ago, Mexico’s development banks accounted for one-fifth of the total credit provided by the
   banking sector, yet their operations were often inefficient, ineffective, and blighted by high costs and
   undue risks. The IBRD worked with the Mexican government to slim down the number of development
   banks and to make them more effective and accountable—thereby ensuring public funds were being
   well-targeted and efficiently-used.

Counter-cyclical role. DFIs played an important counter-
cyclical role during the global financial crisis expanding fi-
nancing activities to prevent a sharp credit crunch in light
of deleveraging and increased risk aversion by private finan-
cial agents. From September 2008 through March 2009,
the credit portfolio supported (directly or indirectly) by de-
velopment banks increased by 35 percent. The bulk of the
increase took place during the fourth quarter of 2008 when
the turbulence in financial markets peaked and some credit
markets nearly dried up. Total financing by development
banks contracted by 5 percent during the second quarter of
2009 as markets began to recover, and some DFIs started
to retrench special counter-cyclical programs allowing the
market to take its place.


Approach
The Bank is using its broad range of instruments to engage
with Mexico on a continuous basis in the transformation of
a very complex financial sector segment, due to the associ-
ated political implications and resistance to transform the
“status-quo”.                                                    Banrural, an institution that was introducing huge distor-

A new Non-Lending Technical Assistance (NTLA) project
was agreed with the authorities to support some of the ele-
ments of the new agenda, for example, development of in-

and subsidy programs.

Given this ongoing relationship on the area of DFIs, the
Bank was also able to quickly, effectively, and efficiently
react to the crisis supporting SHF that was particularly
hard-hit given its reliance on the securitization markets as
an important source of funding. The Bank Board approved
