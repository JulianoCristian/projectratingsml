            IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in
                                         independent evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexi bility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://ieg.worldbankgroup.org).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This PPAR assesses the Mexico Rural Finance Development Structural Adjustment
Loan, approved by the Board on May 16, 2003 and closed on December 19, 2005. It is
part of a larger exercise that assesses the performance of several Bank operations aimed
at helping in the provision of financial services to underserved sectors—primarily
microenterprises but also, as in this case, rural enterprises. As part of this larger exercise,
the document includes some considerations and assessments that normally are not
contained in PPARS, mostly the evaluation of the performance of the project after the
end of the Bank’s involvement as well as the inclusion of evaluation criteria within a
broader, more global perspective, than those normally used to assess specific projects.

The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) prepared the report. It is based on the project
completion and appraisal reports, the Development Credit and Loan Agreements, a
review of Bank files, and discussions with beneficiaries, Bank staff, government officials,
non-governmental organizations, institutions, banks, donors, and private sector managers.
The cooperation and assistance of all stakeholders as well as the support of the World
Bank Country Office in Mexico is gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft Project Performance Assessment
Report (PPAR) was sent to the Borrower for comments. No comments received from the
Borrower.

Summary
This PPAR assesses the Mexico Rural Finance Development Structural Adjustment
Loan, approved by the Board on May 16, 2003 and closed on December 19, 2005. The
operation had two objectives. The first was to support the liquidation of Banrural, a
financial institution that for several decades had provided subsidized credit for
agriculture, accumulating very large losses caused by extreme inefficiencies, low
collection efforts and excessive administrative costs. The institution had been able to
remain liquid in spite of its huge losses by attracting deposits through unsustainably high
interest rates (which would not have allowed it to repay the loans in the future). The
second was to help the Government put in its place Financiera Rural, which would not
receive deposits or issue any debt, was to be totally financed with an endowment created
by the government, should maintain the value of its capital endowment in real terms,
report periodically to Congress, lend only to low and middle income rural producers, and
move, over time, fully to second-tier lending. The Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) mission that visited Mexico in 2001 had recommended these two actions in view
of the negative effects of the large losses in the delivery of credit to the rural areas and in
the macroeconomic situation of the country. In addition, the Project was designed to
buttress several key development objectives of the Government of Mexico, namely: (a)
reducing the fiscal drain of loss-making banks, (b) providing access to financial markets
to groups not served by commercial banks, (c) providing prudent lending to the rural
sector thereby stimulating output growth and employment generation, and (d) improving
the financial performance of Financiera Rural as compared to Banrural in terms of
outreach and market coverage, portfolio quality, yields, and financial efficiency.

The outcome of the project is rated highly satisfactory. The relevance of the objectives to
Mexico’s rural finance development as well as to its macroeconomic stabilization efforts
was substantial. The project was implemented as designed. Financiera Rural evolved into
a solid financial institution, with accounts that transparently show the true costs of its
operations. It has also accumulated substantial capital in terms of knowledge of the rural
sector and a philosophy of development. While, through the years, it modified some of
the features of its original design, these changes resulted in a performance more aligned
with the broad objectives of the project.

The Bank’s performance is rated satisfactory. The quality at entry was highly satisfactory
as the design drew from high levels of Analytical and Advisory Assistance and the FSAP
report as well as lessons from previous operations. Bank supervision was also
satisfactory; in addition to its implementation missions and candid reporting, the team
maintained a proactive relation with the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit and
Financiera Rural during the supervision phase of the project.

Borrower performance is rated highly satisfactory. The Government showed a high
degree of stakeholder commitment and ownership to the Project and met all
implementation-related conditions in the Matrix Policy Actions in a timely fashion.
Financiera Rural—the implementing agency—also fulfilled the expectations it raised at
the time of its creation.

The assessment draws four lessons

      High quality analytical work as well as strong borrower commitment is essential
       for the success of an adjustment operation involving policy and institutional
       reforms. Part of the success of this project can be attributed to long-standing
       analytical work done by the Bank on Mexico’s financial sector including rural
       finance. Also, the financial sector assessment done jointly by the Bank and the
       IMF in 2001 had a decisive impact on the government’s approach to the
       development bank reform in Mexico and the selection of the business model for
       Financiera Rural.

      The development agency model is a good option for transforming a state-owned
       financial institution, when full privatization is not feasible and there is a need to
       expand credit to underserved groups in a cost-efficient manner. Many countries
       face the need to find a permanent solution to the inefficiency and recurrent losses
       caused by development banks, which require frequent and costly recapitalizations
       by the governments. The creation of development banks without a social mandate
       is not a solution because they would not be much different from a commercial
       bank. This operation presents a better solution i.e. to transform these banks into
       finance-oriented development agencies, such as Financiera Rural. The
       development agency promotes financial access for underserved sectors and
       market development through market-friendly instruments that do not distort
       market prices, nor discourage private sector activities, such as matching grants
       and subsidies that are financed by the government’s budget. Their lending tends
       to be second-tier and funded out of their initial capital endowment or targeted
       budgetary appropriations, and not from deposits or other liabilities.

       The strength of institutions depends on the quality of management and the
       adoption of appropriate procedures and practices. In the case of Financiera
       Rural, the project showed that institutions, their business plans and management
       do matter, and that the effort spent on defining a Strategic Plan, establishing the
       appropriate procedures and practices, and in building up a management
       information system was worthwhile. Moreover, flexibility in institutional
       management is crucial to make changes in procedures and practices in response to
       changing circumstances and objectives.

      Keeping the operation simple and concentrated on easily verifiable actions
       contributes to the success of adjustment operations. The sharp focus of this
       operation on institutional building and financial discipline for Financiera Rural
       proved to be one of the operation’s best aspects and contributed to the positive
       project outcome

1. Background and Context
Introduction
1.1    This PPAR assesses the Mexico Rural Finance Development Structural Adjustment
Loan, approved by the Board on May 16, 2003 and closed on December 19, 2005.

1.2      According to the Program Document, (Program Summary, pp. iv), the operation had
two objectives. The first was to support the liquidation of Banrural, a financial institution that
for several decades had provided subsidized credit for agriculture, accumulating very large
losses. The second was to help the Government to put in its place Financiera Rural, a
nonbanking decentralized institution aimed at promoting the development of rural financial
markets while lending to small and medium sized rural producers, directly or via rural
financial intermediaries. Financiera Rural was to be totally financed with an endowment
created by the government, and was required to maintain the value of its capital endowment
in real terms, report periodically to Congress, lend only to low and middle income rural
producers, and move, over time, fully to second-tier lending. The Joint World Bank –
International Monetary Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission that
visited Mexico in 2001 had recommended these two actions.

1.3     In addition, the Project was designed to buttress several key development objectives
of the Government of Mexico, namely: (a) reducing the fiscal drain of loss-making banks, (b)
providing access to financial markets to groups not served by commercial banks, (c)
providing prudent lending to the rural sector thereby stimulating output growth and
employment generation, and (d) improving the financial performance of Financiera Rural as
compared to Banrural in terms of outreach and market coverage, portfolio quality, yields, and
financial efficiency

1.4      The operation was approved under the 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
which was organized around five strategic objectives: (a) consolidating a stable
macroeconomic framework; (b) accelerating growth through competitiveness; (c) human
capital development; (d) balancing growth and poverty reduction with environmental
protection; and (e) building an efficient, transparent, and accountable government. By ending
the operation of a loss-making institution, the Loan was fully consistent with consolidating a
stable macroeconomic framework and by replacing it with an efficient institution that would
develop a market for rural credit that was expected to accelerate growth through
competitiveness.

The Economic Context
1.5    The economic context of Mexico at the time of the approval of the loan was largely
framed by: (a) the stabilization of the economy after the 1994 Tequila Crisis1; (b) the
growing interaction with the United States economy under the framework of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) treaty; and (c) a process of domestic reforms that
1
 The 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, widely known as the Mexican peso crisis or the Tequila crisis, was caused by the
sudden devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994.
                                                    2


the Government launched to absorb the losses left by the crisis, to ensure that it would not be
repeated and to accelerate growth, reduce poverty and strengthen the country's institutions.

1.6      Monetary and financial indiscipline had been a long-standing problem. The country
experienced three serious macroeconomic crises between 1982 and 1994. As shown in the
left-hand panel of Figure 1.1, the first two took place while Mexico was running very high
fiscal deficits. However, at the time of the 1994-95 Tequila Crisis Mexico was fiscally
balanced and had run fiscal surpluses in the previous three years. Thus, the common factor
in the three crises was not high fiscal deficits but high average rates of credit growth, shown
in the right-hand panel of the same figure.

1.7     After the 1994 crisis, the Government made a firm commitment to prevent its
repetition. As shown in the right-hand panel of Figure 1.1, in the subsequent years the rate of
growth of credit fell substantially. With one exception, 1997, credit grew at the lowest rates
since the late 1970s while the fiscal deficit was held quite small relative to those of the
previous twenty years.

1.8     Monetary stability benefited the financial markets. Interest rates, which had increased
in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, went down as the economy stabilized (Figure 1.2).
By the time of the appraisal, nominal lending rates had gone below 10 percent while they
were below 5 percent in real terms.

1.9      As shown in the left-hand panel of Figure 1.3, the rate of inflation, which had shot up
in the midst of the crisis, went down to single digits by 2000. Growth also improved. After a
sharp contraction in 1995, the economy grew strongly, largely propelled by the increasing
integration with the then booming United States economy and the increased macroeconomic
stability. Yet, by 2000, the rate of growth contracted sharply in the midst of the 2000-01
United States recession. By 2003, Mexico was sluggishly recovering from that recession (see
the right-hand panel of Figure 1.3).

1.10 In spite of the increasing macroeconomic stability, unprecedented for at least two or
three decades, the legacy of the crisis was still negatively affecting growth at the time of
appraisal. The financial system generated a substantial fiscal burden through two main
mechanisms: first, the large losses that the public sector banks had experienced before,
                                                 4


during and after the Tequila Crisis, and, second, the losses incurred by the failed private
banks as a result of the crisis itself. This seriously constrained the fiscal policies that the
Government could apply.

1.11 At the same time, credit to the private sector went down from 40 percent of GDP in
1994 to 15 percent in 2002 (see the left hand panel of Figure 1.4) as a result of a reduction in
total deposits as well as a rapid increase in credit to the public sector, which took place
largely at the expense of credit to the private sector. This credit was needed to finance the
losses that the financial sector was transferring to the Government.

1.12 The Government tried to compensate for the declining credit to the private sector by
increasing the credit issued by the public sector banks. The share of these banks as a source
of new credit to the private sector increased from 14.3 percent as of December 2000 to 20
percent as of December 2002. At the same time, as shown in the right hand panel of Figure
1.4, non-bank financial intermediaries were increasing their share of the market from one to 5
percent at the end of the decade. Yet, in spite of these developments, total credit to the
private sector was still declining in 2002.

1.13 The low volume of credit negatively affected all sectors but with different intensities.
Large corporations found financing in the United States, particularly those exporting to that
country. Small and medium sized enterprises, however, found it extremely difficult to get
credit and access to other financial services. The problem seemed to be worsening at the time
of appraisal because the increasing losses of the public sector banks had become
unsustainable, and their potential closure could further reduce access to credit.

The Financial System
THE POST-CRISIS CONDITION

1.14 Mexican financial institutions emerged from the Tequila Crisis in a very weak
condition. Non-performing loans (NPLs) remained high in their portfolios and their financial
results reflected the major provisioning effort that they were forced to undertake. The
Government-owned institutions were among the worst. While the profitability of private
banks was low in 1997-2001, it was negative for public sector development banks. Among
private domestic and foreign banks, net interest margins as a percentage of administrative
expenses averaged above 100 percent, while among development banks they ranged between
22.8 percent in the worst of them (Banrural) to 69.8 percent in the best one (Bancomext).

1.15 Moreover, loan quality was improving in private banks but deteriorating in
development banks. The ratio of NPLs to total loans in private banks fell from 11.3 percent at
end-1997 to 4.3 percent at end-2001, while the coverage ratio of NPLs by loan-loss
provisions rose from 109 percent to 213 percent. Banrural was the extreme case of
deterioration, with 40 percent of its loan portfolio classified as non-performing by December
2001, while the coverage of reserves was a paltry 50 percent. Despite some restructuring
efforts, Development banks remained far behind the private banks in all efficiency indicators.
The poor performance of the development banks was attributable to bad pricing policies, to
the free provision of non-financial services (e.g., training, technical assistance), and to sheer
inefficiency.

1.16   Development banks’ weaknesses posed two serious problems:

      First, their losses were putting unsustainable pressures on the country’s fiscal
       situation, crowding out necessary social spending.
      Second, the Government feared that closing or restructuring development banks
       could complicate further the problem of lack of access to financial services. In
       addition to representing about a quarter of the total credit in the country, development
       banks were major providers of credit to some sectors, particularly to the agricultural
       sector and to underprivileged borrowers.
      Thus, at the time of appraisal, the government faced several pending tasks in the
       financial system: (a) to fully absorb the losses of the crisis; (b) to modernize the
       regulatory framework applicable to all banks, including prominently prudential
       regulations; (c) to reform the public sector financial institutions to improve their
       efficiency and their financial performance; and (d) to improve the access of the less
       privileged sectors, including agriculture and other rural activities, to credit and other
       financial services.

REFORMING THE BANKING SECTOR

1.17 In late 1999, the Government initiated a program of banking sector reforms to
strengthen prudential regulations and address legal obstacles for the resolution of troubled
banks.
                                               6


1.18 The Government program involved actions in four dimensions: (i) legal reforms to
improve incentives in the banking sector, including the phasing out of the universal deposit
guarantee, the introduction of a limited coverage deposit guarantee, a new bankruptcy law
and new secured transactions legislation; (ii) regulatory reforms to improve bank
capitalization and financial soundness; (iii) creation in January 1999 of the Instituto para la
Protección al Ahorro Bancario" (IPAB or in English, Institute for the Protection of Banking
Savings, to assist with the recapitalization and resolution of insolvent banks affected by the
1994-1995 crisis; and (iv) allocation of budgetary resources to fund such recapitalization.

1.19 The Government program succeeded in enabling the return to solvency of major
players in the banking sector, as well as in attracting foreign investors to buy them.

1.20 A consolidation process, which occurred through private mergers and acquisitions, as
well as bank interventions by the National Commission of Banks and Securities and
resolutions by IPAB, led to a reduction of the number of domestic-owned commercial banks
from 33 in June 1994 to 11 in December 2001. All the largest banks under IPAB's purview
had been sold, liquidated or merged by the time of appraisal. \

1.21   However, the problem concerning development banks was still pending.

REFORMING THE DEVELOPMENT BANKS

1.22 Most development banks were established in the late 1920s to promote foreign trade,
the development of agriculture, and Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs). Development
Trust Funds , called ‘fideicomisos’ in Spanish, appeared in the 1950s to complement
development banks’ activities as the public sector took a central role in funding key rural,
industrial and infrastructure projects. Their share in the total assets of the banking system
remained fairly constant around 30 percent at the turn of the 21st century, but their share of
deposits increased from 13 to nearly 20 percent.

1.23 The National Program to Finance Development (PRONAFIDE) for 2002-2006 called
for the modernization of development banks to help achieve the social and economic goals
presented in the National Development Plan. These efforts focused on four areas:

      Legal and institutional reforms to promote and strengthen non-bank financial
       intermediaries and popular banking;
      Legal and regulatory reforms to improve the governance and accountability of
       development banks and subject them to the same regulation and supervision as
       commercial banks; and
      Promoting the operational efficiency and cost effectiveness of development banks and
       limiting the losses that they may cause to the Treasury.

1.24 The World Bank’s strategy aimed at supporting the government’s Bank Restructuring
Program with a series of three transactional loans. The Bank Restructuring Facility
Adjustment Loan (Ln 7004-ME) approved in December 1999 and the Second Bank
Restructuring Facility Loan (Ln 7060-ME), approved in June 2001, supported the legal and
                                                7


regulatory reforms and the resolution of all the failed commercial banks that were in
Government hands since the crisis of 1994/1995.

1.25 The Loan under review supported the liquidation of Banrural and the creation, in its
place, of a Rural Finance Institution (RFI) that would operate more transparently and
minimize potential fiscal costs. This was considered a very urgent task due to the large losses
that Banrural generated to the nation in spite of numerous and costly recapitalizations.

Rural Credit
LIQUIDATING BANRURAL

1.26 Banrural was the main source of agricultural bank lending in Mexico, providing 41
percent of total bank lending to the sector in December 2001. It was created in 1975 through
the merger of three development banks—Banco Nacional de Credito Agricola, Banco
Nacional de Credito Ejidal, and Banco Nacional Agropecuario—of which two were
financially weak. The Government structured the new institution as a system of 12 regional
banks and one national bank. Each bank operated independently with its own management
and Board. This structure was one of the sources of the institution’s governance and financial
problems.

1.27 The institution operated as a first-tier lender and took deposits from the general
public, other banks, and trust funds. It got most of its funding from three second-tier public
financial institutions: the Agriculture Related Trust Fund (FIRA), Banco Nacional de
Comercio Exterior (Bancomext) and Nacional Financiera (Nafin). The relationship was
closer with the Agriculture Related Trust Fund (FIRA). FIRA financed about one third of
Banrural’s loans, and allowed a 6 percent spread between the funds it lent to Banrural and
Banrural’s loans to other banks. On average during 1999-2002, twenty-five percent of
FIRA’s rediscounts were channeled through Banrural while the rest was channeled through
commercial banks.

1.28 Approximately 40 percent of Banrural’s loan portfolio was invested in loans to low-
income farms and agribusinesses with gross revenues of up to 1,000 times the minimum
wage. Eighty-eight percent of its customers were moderate to low income. As of May 2002,
53 percent of its loans in terms of amounts were to organizations of producers and the rest to
individuals.

1.29 Banrural’s record as a lender to agriculture was very poor. It was plagued with
administrative inefficiency and political interference. Moreover, by providing subsidized
loans and failing to recover them, Banrural had precluded the entry and active participation
of private banks in agricultural finance. The fiscal cost of its operations was very high.
Altogether, it received M$25.7 billion in fiscal assistance from 1995 to 2000. Nevertheless, it
continued losing money at about M$200 million a month, ending 2002 with a capital
deficiency of M$20.4 billion.

1.30 The weak financial situation of this institution was attributable to four recurrent
problems: (i) the low quality of its credit portfolio, which had at least 40 percent in NPLs; (ii)
                                                 8


the high costs of its staff pension and medical plans; (iii) its high operating costs; and (iv) the
high costs of its deposits in both absolute terms (as a result of high branch administrative
costs) and relative to loan rates. Banrural’s management reckoned that only one dollar out of
every four devoted to the recapitalizations ended up as a loan to the rural sector; that 34
percent of all non-interest expenses of Banrural were accounted for by payments to
pensioners and retirees; and that 6 dollars in resources were needed to generate 1dollar in
lending.

1.31 Given Banrural’s extremely weak position, the 2001 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) recommended its closing. It also recommended replacing it with a new
institution to be established under the model of development agency.

THE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY MODEL

1.32 Following the FSAP recommendation, the Government defined development
agencies as institutions that would be funded directly through the budget, would not take
deposits from, or issue debt to, the public. Their lending activities would be limited (over
time in some cases) to second-tier lending through banks and non-bank financial institutions.
Their capacity to provide subsidies was limited as well, making those that they did provide
more targeted and transparent.

1.33 The FSAP devised this solution noting that development banks suffer from an
inherent tension between their social policy mandate (i.e., to foster access to financial
services for households and firms that are costlier and riskier to serve) and the objective of
avoiding losses in their bank-like activities. The FSAP argued that the development agency
model would overcome this tension by setting a strict limit to the funds that the public sector
would be putting at risk, and by forcing, through the second-tier structure, the participation of
third parties in credit decisions—preferably private institutions that would put their own
capital at risk.

1.34   The government decided to act on this advice in the case of rural credit.

THE CREATION OF FINANCIERA RURAL

1.35 To replace Banrural, the Government would create Financiera Rural, as a non-
banking decentralized institution in charge of promoting the development of rural financial
markets while ensuring the efficient use of public resources. The new institution would report
to the Secretariat for Public Credit of the Ministry of Finance.

1.36   Financiera Rural would have two main tasks:

      It would provide credit to low and middle income rural producers, for agriculture as
       well as rural off-farm activities, for working capital and equipment purchase, with
       different forms of guarantees, including signature loans, lines of credit and loans with
       mortgage and movable guarantees. It could also do factoring, leasing, open letters of
       credit and discount credit documents. Most of the Financiera Rural loans would be up
                                                       9


         to 700,000 Unidades de Inversión 2 , equivalent to about US$2.2 million. The Board
         could approve higher credit ceilings. Financiera Rural could participate as co-
         financier in loans which principal amount exceeds these limits.
        It would help in developing rural financial markets through several channels: (a) it
         would promote the creation and development of a system of first-tier private
         intermediaries; (b) it would stimulate the creation of instruments to reduce the risks to
         producers and intermediaries; (c) it would provide advice and training to rural
         financial intermediaries; (d) it would provide advice and training to producers to
         make them subject of institutional credit and of the new financial instruments,
         particularly rural; and (e) it would act as fiduciary in trusts funds linked to rural
         activities.

1.37 Financiera Rural’s initial capital endowment would comprise the good assets of
Banrural plus a one-time budgetary allocation for lending and initial set-up costs. The new
institution would have to preserve this capital. This meant that to sustain its lending
operations, Financiera Rural would have to adequately collect on the loans, or ask for
additional budgetary appropriations to restore its initial capital endowment in real terms. This
should create strong incentives for its management to maintain sound lending policies. Its
developmental activities (subsidies, guarantees, technical assistance, etc.) to develop rural
financial markets, would be funded directly through the budget. Under this system Financiera
Rural would have total transparency and accountability to Congress in the use of its
resources.

1.38 Not having a deposit base would permit the new Financiera Rural to reduce its
branch network and reduce administrative expenses. Even more important, not having access
to the deposit market would make the operations of the Financiera Rural much more
transparent, because it would not be able to use deposits to get liquidity while making losses,
as Banrural had done for many years. Banrural’s deposit accounts would be transferred to the
National Financial Services Bank (BANSEFI), which would administer them through its
branch network, which was well distributed geographically.

1.39 Financiera Rural was relieved of Banrural’s “legacy costs”, the generous retirement
and medical expenses promised to former and then current employees that would be laid-off
as a result of the closure of the institution. The Government would assume these financial
obligations and compensate all the laid-off workers. The workers that would remain in
Financiera Rural would have access to the retirement and medical plans available to the rest
of the public employees. This would allow the institution to further reduce administrative
expenses.

1.40 According to the Program Document, Financiera Rural management estimated that
the shift from first-tier to second-tier lending would take about 5 or 6 years, and that it would
be solely a second-tier lender by its eight year of operations. Also, by remaining too long as a
first-tier lender, the institution could displace market development or private sector lenders in
the rural areas. However, at the time there were very few private sector lenders in these areas

and Financiera Rural was obliged by law to promote the development of such rural financial
intermediaries

2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
Project Objectives
2.1      The Project had two explicit objectives3 : (i) to support the liquidation of Banrural,
and in its place, (ii) to create the Financiera Rural, a non-bank decentralized financial
institution charged with promoting the development of rural financial markets, and with
lending to small and medium-sized rural producers directly or via rural financial
intermediaries. These objectives were defined after intensive consultations on the best way to
introduce financial discipline in the public sector financial institutions and on how to set the
stage for developing a rural financial system dominated by private primary lenders to which
small and medium-sized rural producers—not only farms but also other rural enterprises—
would have easier access, at a reasonable cost. In such a system, government participation
was expected to migrate over time to promotional, market making and second-tier funding
activities, limiting the government presence to those areas where market solutions had
limited success or simply failed.

2.2     In addition, the Project was designed to buttress several key development objectives
of the Government of Mexico, namely: (a) reducing the fiscal drain of loss-making banks, (b)
providing access to financial markets to groups not served by commercial banks, (c)
providing prudent lending to the rural sector thereby stimulating output growth and
employment generation, and (d) improving the financial performance of Financiera Rural as
compared to Banrural in terms of outreach and market coverage, portfolio quality, yields, and
financial efficiency.

The Design of the Operation
KEY CONDITIONS

2.3     There was one general condition—to maintain a sound macroeconomic framework
consistent with the policy objectives contained in the Letter of Sectoral Development
Policy—and three sets of tranche release conditions. The first set dealt with the liquidation of
Banrural; the second with the creation of Financiera Rural; and the third with the
maintenance of satisfactory operations at Financiera Rural .

CONDITIONS OF EFFECTIVENESS

2.4        The loan would become effective when the following conditions had been met:

2.5    The Borrower and Nacional Financiera (Nafin) would have entered into a Contract
(Contrato de Mandato) whereby Nacional Financiera agreed to act as financial agent of the
Borrower with regard to the loan; and (b) the Financiera Rural has provided to the Bank a

policy document, approved by its Board, establishing interest rate guidelines. This policy
would lead to: (i) financial sustainability and (ii) encourage the development of private
financial intermediaries. Financial sustainability was defined as maintenance of net income
levels in real terms equal to or higher than zero.

FIRST TRANCHE ACTIONS

2.6    A first tranche of US$200 million was to be disbursed upon loan effectiveness, in
support of upfront reform measures taken by the Mexican authorities in the following areas:

      Congress approved (on December 13, 2002) the Organic Law for the National Rural
       Finance Institution.
      Congress approved (on December 13, 2002) a modification to the Income Law of the
       Federation for the Fiscal Year 2002, to include a budgetary allocation of M$49.9
       billion to liquidate Banrural and to provide an initial equity and budget to the
       Financiera Rural.
      The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) approved, on April 1, 2003,
       procedures for the liquidation of the Banrural System as a banking institution.
      Financiera Rural provided to the Bank a Strategic Statement (Programa Institucional)
       approved by its Board, outlining mission and objectives, target markets and clients,
       instruments for providing credit, promoting investment and providing technical
       assistance, and a policy of limited credit expansion (no more than 10 percent) in the
       first year of operations with respect to the level of lending provided by Banrural in
       2002.
      Financiera Rural submitted to the Bank a financial projections model of its
       operations, agreed to with the Bank. The model would include pro-forma balance
       sheets and income statements.
      Financiera Rural provided to the Bank a Regional Organization Plan approved by its
       Board establishing the number of branches (no more than 100), their geographic
       distribution, and branch staffing levels based on projected size of branches.
      The management structure of Financiera Rural was established, including: the
       nomination of the Board of Directors (Consejo Directivo), composed of
       representatives from the Federal Government, the social sector and an independent
       counsel.
      The General Manager was appointed, as well as the heads of the following
       departments: Programs and Operations; Administration; Promotion; Legal; Credit
       Policies and Risks; Policies and Norms; and Internal Controls.
      The heads of the regional centers were appointed.


SECOND TRANCHE ACTIONS

2.7    A second tranche of US$150 million was to be disbursed once the following
conditions had been met:
                                               12


      The lending target for year end 2003 equaled Banrural's lending for the first half of
       2003 (M$ 3.8 billion) plus an additional M$5 billion to be lent by Financiera Rural.
       This target was below the lending of Banrural in 2002.
      The institutions comprising the Banrural System would have ceased to operate as
       banking institutions, the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit would have revoked
       their licenses to operate as banking institutions and their remaining assets would have
       been transferred to Financiera Rural or to a liquidating agency, and their deposit
       accounts would have been closed or transferred to qualified financial institutions.
      Financiera Rural had provided to the Bank a Strategic Plan approved by its Board
       that:
            included an empirical analysis identifying target markets, clients, including
                their risk profile, and distribution systems and products to reach these clients.
            designed its second-tier lending activities including: (i) a time frame for
                building a second-tier lending business, (ii) the organizational structure for
                conducting second-tier operation, (iii) the eligibility criteria for potential
                financial intermediaries, and (iv) the basis for a technical assistance program

                financial control system to monitor the activities of the Financiera Rural
      Financiera Rural had submitted to the Bank satisfactory manuals, approved by its
       Board, including: (i) norms, policies, and procedures for issuing credit and (ii)
       recovery procedures for bad credits; and (iii) has tested and implemented credit
       scoring models.
      The external financial auditors had certified that Financiera Rural complied with the
       National Banking and Securities Commission’s prudential regulations, including
       norms for risk classification and provisioning of the loan portfolio.
      The subsidies and transfers received by Financiera Rural under any concept had been
       clearly declared and identified in each report submitted to the Borrower’s Congress
       up to six weeks before the Second Tranche Release.

THIRD TRANCHE ACTIONS CONDITIONS:

2.8    A third tranche of US$l50 million would be disbursed once the Financiera Rural had
met the following conditions:

      An audit report by external financial auditors had certified that for a six month period
       Financiera Rural had met the zero net income standard in real terms as defined in the
       financial projections, including additional budgetary transfers.

      Financiera Rural had submitted detailed cost accounting figures showing the actual
       cost of its lending and non-lending operations.
      The management information system had been in the process of implementation in
       accordance with the Strategic Plan approved by Finaciera Rural’s Board.

M&E Design: Benchmarks and Performance Indicators.
2.9     To monitor progress over time and judge its success, Financiera Rural would provide
information about a series of benchmarks every six months. While all these benchmarks were
numerical, the Program Document did not establish target numbers for them—the reason
being that the creation and development of Financiera Rural would be a novel operation for
which no previous experience existed. Under these circumstances, targets would be arbitrary.
Thus, the benchmark indicators were expected to measure progress, not compare it with a
certain standard. The indicators were the following:

2.10   Outreach indicators:

      Average loan size and distribution of loan size
      Number of municipalities or localities being served
      Number of active clients in first tier and second tier
      Percentage of clients that are women
      Percentage of clients by income level
      Percentage of clients in export crops

2.11   Portfolio quality/portfolio yield indicators:

      Portfolio-at-risk 30 days: outstanding balance of loans with arrears more than 30 days
       / outstanding loan portfolio
      Annual loan losses: write-offs /average loan portfolio
      Percentage of restructured loans
      Percentage of loans with subsidized interest rates
      Portfolio yield: interest income (including fees ) / average loan portfolio.
      To monitor progress over time and judge its success.

2.12   Efficiency indicators:

      Total operating costs / average loan portfolio (this is indicated in the Financiera Rural
       Charter)
      SDI (subsidy-dependence index): amount of explicit and implicit subsidies / interest
       income.

2.13 Parallel to the Bank loan, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved in
October 2003 a US$300 million policy based loan—the Rural Financial System
Consolidation Program, Loan ME0243—which included similar conditionality to the Bank
Structural Adjustment Loan with respect to the closure of Banrural and the establishment of
Financiera Rural, but covered other areas related to rural finance by other agencies, not
                                                       14


included in the Bank loan. As of March 2006, only half of the IDB loan had been disbursed,
because of pending actions in those additional policy areas.

Relevance of Objectives: Substantial
THE OBJECTIVES

2.14 As already discussed, according to the Program Document, the operation had two
objectives: to liquidate Banrural and to create Financiera Rural as a development agency.

2.15 The first objective, the liquidation of Banrural, was highly relevant. The weak
financial condition of public sector development banks had become a serious problem,
negatively affecting the country’s fiscal stance and the allocation of financial resources.
Banrural was particularly problematic. Its subsidized loans were preventing the entry of
private financial institutions by the financing of agriculture and it had an inordinately high
level of non-performing loans. The bad quality of the portfolio plus its excessive operational
costs and its huge burden of excessively generous pension and health care programs turned
its operation into something that was fiscally unsustainable. Its closure was amply justified
and important.

2.16 The second objective, Banrural’s substitution by Financiera Rural was in line with the
2001 FSAP recommendations, which promoted the development agency model as the
preferred vehicle to channel public financing in support of the rural sector. The two
objectives were consistent with the 2003 CAS. They were consistent with the conditions of
rural financing and macroeconomic stability at closure and today, as well. Financing the rural
sectors with solid institutions like Financiera Rural and its associated intermediaries has
contributed to the macroeconomic stability that is one of the country’s accomplishments of
the last two decades.

2.17 There are two main issues that must be discussed before rating the relevance of
objectives, however. First, the possibility that other solutions could have been better than the
creation of Financiera Rural; and, second, the narrowness of the loan objectives, which
centered on what is normally considered as an output rather than as an outcome of the
operation.

2.18 These two issues arise from the fact that the objectives of the operation were defined
in terms of liquidating an institution and creating another one—that is, in terms of changes in
the means to attain certain objectives, not in terms of the effects that such changes would
have in the availability of credit, the operation of the economy and the reduction of poverty.
This observation could be purely semantic in the case of the closing of Banrural because,
even if the reduction of waste was not an explicit objective of the operation, it is implicitly
understood in the entire rationale of the operation. This, however, is not true in the case of
the creation of Financiera Rural, in at least two respects. First, since the creation of
Financiera Rural was not a first-best solution,4 its proposal required a detailed justification.

4
  A first-best solution would be one in which the resources were fully allocated by demand and supply in perfect
market conditions. The first best is unattainable in the presence of substantial imperfections. According to the
theory of the second best, just adopting the form of market allocation in this situation (say, by eliminating the
                                                       15


Second, once it was decided that Financiera Rural should be created, the operation’s
objective in this respect was defined without reference to the results that would be expected
from Financiera Rural in terms of meeting the needs of the rural economy.

WAS IT THE BEST SOLUTION AVAILABLE?

2.19 The ICR Review noted that the creation of a development institution for specialized
credit to replace the liquidated one was not a first best solution. It recognized that the case
was not straightforward because the possibility of market failure caused by defective or
inexistent institutional support could not be discarded without further investigation. Legally
unenforceable collections, problems in the registry, or similar potential deficiencies could
make it impossible for the markets to provide rural financing. Moreover, markets may have
refrained from providing rural credit for valid reasons different from market failure,
including an unfavorable balance of risks and profitability, or the existence of distortions,
some of which could have been caused by the presence of directed and subsidized credit
itself.

2.20 Introducing a private market solution would have taken time even if all the
institutional conditions for the functioning of the market had been in place. Removing
potential distortions introduced by the directed credit system could have taken even more
time and political capital. More importantly, the negative consequences that would have
accrued to Mexico if it assumed that a market solution would work and this proved wrong
would have been much worse than those that would have accrued to it if it assumed that it
needed Financiera Rural and this was not true.

2.21 The project could also have used the opportunity to address the rationalization of the
public sector financial system, eliminating unnecessary duplications and arbitrary differences
in services offered and their costs. For example, many observers believe that the Agriculture
Related Trust Fund, the funds provided by Secretariat of Agriculture and Financiera Rural
could have been merged into a single, larger institution serving the rural areas. This,
however, would have entailed a long and complicated process, involving politically powerful
bureaucracies accustomed to administrative independence and to living under different work
cultures—in this case, some belonging to the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit, others
to the Secretariat of Agriculture and yet others to the Central Bank. Merging those
institutions could have proven to be politically impossible. Yet, no critical issues were left
out because they were politically inconvenient.

2.22 According to the Program Document (pp. 65) at the time of the appraisal the
government had already decided that taking Financiera Rural out of the first-tier rural credit
markets was not politically feasible or necessarily desirable—implying that the Government
had to fill in the vacuum left by the liquidation of Banrural, at least in the short term. Also,
merging it with other institutions was not seen as a politically viable option.



government’s intervention in rural financing) would not necessarily approach the first -best allocation of
resources. Finding the second best requires a detailed study of the situation. See R. G. Lipsey and Kelvin
Lancaster “The General Theory of Second Best.” The Review of Economic Studies, 24 (1), pp. 11-32.
                                               16


2.23 Given this constraint, the Government opted for a dynamic process that would
gradually turn the allocation of resource allocation from a government-driven mechanism to
a market-driven one. Finaciera Rural’s intended movement toward market interest rates and
from being a first- to a second-tier institution would help in the gradual creation of a private
market solution.

2.24 Given that decision, the creation of Financiera Rural was a reasonable second-best
strategy for several reasons. First, it avoided shocking the rural sectors with a sudden
suspension of credit. Second, the movement toward second-tier operations pushed Financiera
Rural in the direction of involving private institutions in the provision of agricultural credit.
Thus, the solution did not negate the first best solution. It only made its introduction gradual,
giving time to carry out the institutional changes that could be needed to ensure the working
of the market. Third, Financiera Rural’s budgetary funding established strong incentives to
manage it prudently and efficiently and revealed the extent of the Government’s commitment
to support rural credit.

LINKING OBJECTIVES TO OUTPUTS, NOT OUTCOMES

2.25 Once the decision to establish Financiera Rural had been made, the objectives of the
operation could have been defined in terms of the expected benefits that the Mexican
population would obtain from such action. Instead, the objective was defined in terms of the
establishment of the institution. Following this logic, the key indicators were defined in terms
of the financial performance of Financiera Rural exclusively. This could be justified by
arguing that the operation was based on the recommendations of the 2001 Financial Sector
Assessment Project. Also, narrowing the objectives to sharply defined actions had some
beneficial effects. It kept the operation simple and concentrated on easily measured
indicators. Moreover, the sharp focus on institutional building and financial discipline proved
to be one of the operations’ best aspects. On the negative side, however, it did not include
indicators that would measure the impact on the population and validate, or invalidate, the
assumption that having an institution like Financiera Rural would be beneficial. This limited
the lessons that could have been learned from the operation.

THE RATING OF THE RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.26 The rating is a judgment call: whether to concentrate on an operation that would
produce sharp, easily measurable results, or design a broader operation to ascertain the
beneficial outcomes expected from the creation of Financiera Rural, based on the existence
or otherwise of market failures in the rural markets in Mexico—a task better carried out by
Analytical and Advisory Assistance. This report leans to the positive side. However, it rates
the relevance of objectives Substantial rather than High in view of the fact that the objectives
as stated limited the lessons that could have been learned from the operation.

Relevance of Design: High
2.27 The design was appropriate for the solution of the problem at hand in terms of the
connection of the objectives with intermediate and final outcomes, and the type of lending
instrument and the anticipation of risks.
                                               17


2.28 As discussed in the section IV on efficacy, the objectives were linked to intermediate
and final outcomes and to the policy measures supported by the project in a causal chain that
was clear and convincing. Given the way the objectives were defined, their causal chain was
straightforward. The actions taken for each of the tranche disbursements were defined in
terms of the objectives—closing Banrural and establishing a solid financial institution—in
such a way that the first was fulfilled by carrying out the second.

2.29 The Program Document justified the use of a quick disbursing operation based on
budgetary needs. The liquidation of Banrural and the creation of the Financiera Rural
entailed a significant fiscal cost, mainly comprising: (a) the high “legacy cost’’ of Banrural
and (b) the capitalization of the new Financiera Rural. Moreover, since the new institution
would not receive deposits, its entire portfolio had to be financed with Government funds.
While these costs had been fully reflected in the 2002 fiscal accounts, largely on an accrual
accounting basis, cash had not been provided as yet. Disbursements under the proposed
operation would help the Government to fund some of these expenses.

2.30   In summary, relevance of design is rated High.


3. Implementation
3.1    The operation was implemented in accordance with the objectives, as shown in the
next chapter. There were no implementation issues. Coordination with the government and
with Financiera Rural’s staff was highly satisfactory. The loan was fully disbursed on time.

4. Achievement of the Objectives
4.1    The May 2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program Update noted that substantial
progress had been achieved in reforming the system of development banks and trust funds in
Mexico along the lines recommended in the 2001 report. It mentioned that the greatest
progress in integrating objectives, mandates, functions, and instruments had been registered
in Financiera Rural, the Agricultural Related Trust Fund FIRA, the National Finance
Services Bank and the Federal Mortgage Bank.

4.2    As discussed in the following subsections, Financiera Rural met or was in the process
of meeting its developmental objectives at the closing of the loan and beyond.

Objective 1: The closing and liquidation of Banrural: High
4.3    This entailed two different steps: first, closing Banrural; and, second, liquidating it.

4.4     The closing of the Banrural system to banking business took place as scheduled in
mid-2003. The subsequent process of liquidation was long, arduous and complex. It was still
continuing at the time of the PPAR mission (March 2012). The long delay is not attributable
to any negligence in the implementation of the loan but, instead, to the legal complexities of
the Mexican liquidation processes.
                                                  18


4.5     In mid-2003 it was not possible to put a specific value to the final cash cost of
liquidating Banrural—something that had to wait until the current process of liquidation was
completed. The ICR expected that the final amount would surpass the allocated budget figure
approved by Congress in December 2002 (US$3.08 billion equivalent), mainly because of
higher expenditures in terms of staff separations, pensions and medical expenses, and the
actual liquidation process itself. It is important to note that these cash expenditures did not
represent a cost of the operation because they are settlements of liabilities incurred in the
previous operations of Banrural. They were there in the form of the losses it had accumulated
and the labor and social liabilities it had acquired. These cash expenditures actually stopped
the accumulation of losses and liabilities.

Objective 2: The creation and operation of Financiera Rural : High
 4.6    The Organic Law that established Financiera Rural provided it with an initial capital
endowment (including performing loans and other assets of Banrural) of M$17.515 billion
(equivalent to some US$1.72 billion at the time) through a Federal budget allocation. The
Charter included all the features that were included in the design of the operation.

4.7     Financiera Rural started operating immediately after its creation, managing the
portfolio of first-tier performing loans it inherited from Banrural and lending to new
customers in both first and second-tier operations. The following sub-sections summarize its
performance.

4.8     Table 4.1 highlights Financiera Rural’s performance indicators, showing that in this
respect the new institution performed better than expected.

                                                  Also, FR easily met the end-of-project target
                                                  value of having a positive net income for any
                                                  six-month period, during the project execution
                                                  and until today. At the end of 2011, capital
                                                  stood at US$1.9 billion equivalent. FR has not
                                                  required additional budgetary allocations since
                                                  its inception.

projected target value of keeping non-            performing credit portfolio equivalent to 48
performing loans (NPLs) below 4 percent of        percent of gross lending when FR started
the loan portfolio.                               operations (January 2003). NPLs were 2.5
                                                  percent of the loan portfolio at the end of 2005.
                                                  Loan-loss provisions were equivalent to 269
                                                  percent of the portfolio in arrears. By the end
                                                  of 2011 NPLs were 4.7% of the loan portfolio
                                                  and provisions covered 129% of loans.

                                                 Management is implementing a plan to reduce
                                                 the NPLs well below 4%, as targeted in the
                                                 original performance indicators. However, the
                                                 NPLs have continued to be above 4%. After
                                                 declining from 4.7% in June 2012 with a
                                                 provision coverage of 136% to 4.4% in
                                                 December 2012 with a provision coverage of
                                                 85%, the NPLs have again risen to 4.7% in
                                                 June 2013 with a provision coverage of 104%.
3. FR is moving towards second-tier lending      3. The Program Document estimated that FR
through rural financial intermediaries (RFIs):   would be a fully second-tier institution in 8
                                                 years. By the time of the project’s closing, they
                                                 represented 12.4 percent of FR’s credit
                                                 portfolio at the end-2005. By 2011 they
                                                 represented close to 50%. However, as
                                                 explained in the text, FR has decided to keep in
                                                 place the first-tier operations because their
                                                 customers became the prime material for the
                                                 creation of intermediaries.

4.9     By the time of the loan’s closure Financiera Rural was a solid financial institution. Its
conversion into a second-tier intermediary was, though, behind schedule. This, however, was
the result of a conscious and reasonable decision made by Financiera Rural’s management. In
the ensuing years, Financiera Rural consolidated its achievements in this respect. There were
some deviations in terms of non-performing loans in the last two or three years, mostly as a
result of the 2008 global crisis and its lingering effects. The institution’s management is
working to reduce them.

4.10 Lending Activity: Financiera Rural has intermediated significantly larger credit
volumes than Banrural and at a lower cost. In 2001/2002, Banrural provided an average of
US$800 million equivalent in loans with a staff of 3,459, while Financiera Rural provided
US$1.19 billion equivalent in loans in 2005 with staff of 1,061. By 2012 loans had increased
to US$1.4 billion equivalent, while the staff had increased to 1,200. Thus, Financiera Rural
multiplied the ratio of loans per person by 4.8 from 2001-02 to 2005. The ratio went down to
4.1 in 2011 as a result of the increased work carried out by the promoters to upgrade the
abilities of the potential borrowers. The improvement is much higher (on the order of 8
times) if the comparison is made in terms of collected loans (net of non-performing loans).

PROMOTIONAL AND ADVISORY ACTIVITIES

4.11 In its role of development agency, Financiera Rural carries out promotional activities
funded with budgetary allocations from the Federal Government. Their delivery is
outsourced to experts in different fields and clearly accounted for in the financial statements.

4.12 Financiera Rural conveys subsidies to its customers in four ways. First, potential
customers are trained in basic business concepts, accounting, and organizational methods.
This training is essential in the formation of intermediary producers’ organizations. Second,
                                                20


contributions to liquid guarantees are made to facilitate access to credit. Third, subsidies are
aimed at reducing the cost of credit. Fourth, Credit Promoting Units have been created,
which in turn train the prospective customers, and help in organizing them into producers’
intermediaries and in the design of credit operations. A full 50 percent of these resources go
to train and support promoters.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

4.13 Table 4.2 shows three different types of financial indicators and their evolution over
time. These confirm the strength of Financiera Rural as a financial agency. In particular, they
show that efficiency and profitability have been improving over time. Returns on capital as
well as lending by employee has increased, turning Financiera Rural into a profitable
financial intermediary.

4.14 Financiera Rural still has significant space to grow since it had a large portion of its
equity endowment invested in negotiable fixed-income securities at lower interest rates than
its loan portfolio.

INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPACT

4.15 The new institutional arrangement introduced by the Federal Government to support
rural financing under the Project had a substantial positive impact on the use of fiscal
resources. The bleeding of substantial resources was contained with the closure of Banrural
and the appropriations made in December 2002, while the creation of Financiera Rural has
resulted in a much more effective and efficient way of supplying financial resources to rural
producers. Moreover, the moral hazard caused by Banrural’s poor lending practices has been
reversed and a larger flow of credit is now reaching small/mid-sized rural producers and
businesses. All this has led to a much improved and effective use of public financial
resources by private rural producers.
                                               21


4.16 The operation has also had an important institutional development impact through the
promotional and advisory activities carried out by Financiera Rural to help small rural
financial entities such as credit unions and financial cooperatives to become rural financial
intermediaries.

THE COUNTERFACTUALS

4.17 If the operation had not taken place, Banrural would have kept on lending money to
the rural sector, most likely having a negative developmental impact through at least two
channels: (a) the institution would have kept on making large losses, negatively affecting the
government’s ability to allocate its resources efficiently; and (b) Banrural would have kept
on distorting the rural financial markets by lending with large subsidies. Thus, the project
stopped a costly process of loss generation.

5. Ratings
Outcome

5.1     Outcome is rated Highly Satisfactory based on the relevance of objective rated as
Substantial, relevance of design as Highly Satisfactory and the achievement of objectives
rated as High, along with the maintenance of a stable macro-economy.

Risk to Development Outcome
5.2    This report rates the risk to development outcome Moderate. The dimensions of risks
and their features are listed below.

5.3     Economic. In the economic dimension, it would take a crisis such as that of 1994 to
negate the benefits of the project. This is unlikely to happen, given the commitment to
macroeconomic stability and prudent regulation and supervision of financial institutions that
several governments of different political orientation have shown since that crisis. The
project itself was aimed at reducing this risk. Regarding international crises, the global
recession that started in 2008 tested the resilience of the macroeconomic and prudent
financial practices and found them strong enough to avoid a domestic crisis.

5.4     Financial. Banrural experienced serious financial difficulties as a result of two main
problems. First, the reduction of the institution’s intermediation margin that resulted from
political pressures aimed at increasing the subsidies conveyed to the beneficiaries of the
loans. Second, a constant inflation of costs that resulted from the use of the institution as a
mechanism of employment patronage. The financial problems ballooned before they were
detected by the Government because Banrural compensated for its losses by increasing the
deposits it received, in such a way that it did not become illiquid even if it was insolvent. The
risks of this happening have been drastically reduced by Financiera Rural’s institutional
design, which restricted the volume of funds available to the institution to the initial
endowment and, after the 2008 crisis, to this and some controlled financing from other
financial institutions.
                                               22


5.5    Political. Mexico has remained politically stable while going through quite
fundamental political transformations, which are consolidating the country’s democracy.
The risk of a reversal in this trend is rated negligible to low.

5.6    Government ownership and commitment. Mexico’s institutional development seems
to have outgrown a possible reversal in the maintenance of financial discipline in the
provision of credit to the rural economy. This has been the experience during and after the
implementation of the project. The risk of a reversal in this trend is rated negligible to low.

5.7      Institutional support. The project requires limited special support from other
institutions to operate. According to its by-laws, it has to operate with its initial endowment
plus, lately, limited financing from other institutions. It does not require subsidies or
privileges. It competes with and finances private financial intermediaries. This risk is rated
as negligible to low.

5.8     Social. This dimension of risk would emerge if some of the stakeholders in the
operation of Financiera Rural—the Government, the first-tier financial intermediaries
working with Financiera Rural, and the direct credit customers of Financiera Rural—would
withdraw their support for the project. This is very unlikely to happen. As already pointed
out, the Government has shown interest in this subject for decades and Financiera Rural’s
customers—both first-and second-tier—depend on the institution for a large share of their
credit. Thus, this risk is also negligible to low.

5.9     Governance. This is the most important risk: the possibility that Financiera Rural’s
management becomes relaxed, eroding the project’s institutional integrity. This is the risk
that, when materialized, has been responsible for most of the failures of government-owned
financial institutions. It was the cause of Banrural’s failure. Financiera Rural was designed to
mitigate this risk, mainly by restricting the sources of funds available to the institution. The
risk, therefore, is that of a gradual change in such design that would relax the restrictions.
During the 2008-2010 recessions the Government decided to allow Financiera Rural to get
financing from other financial institutions. Until now this measure has not resulted in any
dilution of the institution’s financial discipline because its culture has been created around
responsibility, and many internal controls have been established to avoid profligacy.
However, it is noteworthy that risks normally evolve in a gradual way. This risk is regarded
negligible to low.

5.10 Recent Developments. Overall, the above considerations point to a low risk scenario
for the operations development objectives, However, high non- performing loans above 4
percent (4.7 percent in June 2013) as well the financial sector policy announced by the
Government in July 2013 which calls for development banks to play a more proactive role in
providing (directed) credit at lower interest rates potentially increases the risk to development
outcome in light of possible reintroduction of business practices of a decade ago (para. 1.14)
undermined the viability of development banks. This report thus rates the risk to
development outcomes as Moderate.

Bank Performance
5.11   Bank performance is rated Satisfactory.

Quality at entry

5.12 Given its objectives, the quality at entry of this Project was Highly Satisfactory for
five main reasons.

      First, as discussed in the previous section, the operation was fully consistent with the
       borrower’s and the Bank’s objectives as expressed in the 2003 CAS. It competently
       implemented a recommendation of the 2001 Financial Sector Assessment Program.
      Second, the project design benefited greatly from work done by the Bank in support
       of Mexico’s financial reform and from a pro-active dialogue and exchange of views
       with the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit during the preparation stage. Senior
       Bank experts participated from very early on in discussions with the government on
       what to do with Banrural. At that stage, the Bank’s contributions included the
       following:
            The Bank prepared a financial model that simulated the situation of Banrural
                that showed that no “good bank” could be rescued from the remains of
                Banrural and that it was better to close it.
            The financial agency model that puts access to debt and deposits off-limits
                was a concept articulated and promoted by the Bank.
            In collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank, the Bank
                worked in the preparation of the pro-forma financial statements and projection
                model used to assess whether Financiera Rural could meet the “zero net-
                income” test by the end of the Project.
            The Project design also included a well-sequenced and comprehensive Matrix
                of Policy Actions and a realistic timetable for implementation.
      Third, the Government of Mexico owned the project, which was defined in an intense
       dialogue with high-power Bank missions on the strategic course to take. The
       Government proceeded to implement its strategy with respect to Banrural with solid
       knowledge of the shortcomings of this development bank and the high fiscal costs
       involved in its liquidation. It secured the necessary budgetary appropriations.
      Fourth, the design of the operation benefitted from the lessons learned from three
       previous operations, the Financial Sector Restructuring Loan approved in June 1995,
       and the First and Second Bank Restructuring Loans approved in December 1999 and
       June 2001, respectively. These lessons were:
        Set limited objectives.
        Use tranches to support reforms that will be implemented in stages.
        Disburse against specific completed actions.

5.13 All these lessons were applied in the design of the loan. The objectives of the loan
were limited and sharply defined; it had three tranches to support, in sequence, the
liquidation of Banrural, the creation of Financiera Rural and the institutional consolidation of
the latter. The loan was disbursed against specific completed actions in each of the three
                                               24


tranches. The simplicity of the loan’s objectives and design helped to facilitate its
implementation and evaluation:

   First, the design of the operation also took into account the risks that could arise during
    its implementation. The Program Document listed several risks associated with this
    operation and made explicit the measures that were designed to minimize them:

          First, there was the risk that political pressure may lead to too rapid expansion of
           credit by Financiera Rural. Political pressures could oblige the institution to use
           the budgetary allocation recently approved by Congress to rapidly expand lending
           to agriculture, before it had been able to fully understand the characteristics of its
           customer base and the cost of serving these customers. To limit this risk, the
           Board of the Financiera Rural approved a Strategic Statement that, among other
           things, limited credit expansion in the first year of operation to no more than 10%
           over the credit given by Banrural during the second half of 2002. This risk has not
           materialized in the decade-long life of the institution.
          Second, there was the risk that with the closure of Banrural, credit to lower
           income rural producers would fall. Banrural used to lend to a wide range of rural
           producers, from the very small to the very large. Financiera Rural would lend
           primarily to low and middle-income rural producers (most of the Financiera Rural
           loans would not exceed US$2.2 million). Banrural’s higher income clients (who
           were among the worst payers) would have to borrow from commercial banks or
           other financial intermediaries. The average size of loans substantially increased
           since the end of the project. This, however, was the result of the termination of the
           Programa de Apoyos Directos al Campo (PROCAMPO), a special program
           funded by the Federal Government. The average size of Financiera Rural’s own
           operations has remained roughly the same in real terms.
          Third, lending through rural financial intermediaries could be highly risky
           because these intermediaries may be inexperienced, lack good governance
           systems and escape regulatory oversight. To reduce these risks, Financiera Rural
           presented a plan to develop second-tier lending that would include strict eligibility
           criteria and lending conditions, as well as a technical assistance program to
           strengthen their governance and financial management. In the longer term,
           Financiera Rural realized that the lack of traditional financial intermediaries
           would become a bottleneck for its own operation, and decided to create a new
           kind of intermediary (called “credit intermediaries”) as well as keeping a
           substantial presence in the first-tier market to organize these. These changes in the
           original model did not have any negative impact on the solidity of the institution.
           Fourth, there was a risk that the government policy of providing interest rate
           subsidies may limit Financiera Rural’s ability to charge lending rates that
           guaranteed financial viability and thus deter the entry of private intermediaries.
           To mitigate this risk, the authorities committed, in the Letter of Development
           Policy to make the interest rates of the Financiera Rural congruent with the
           objective of maintaining its capital endowment in real terms (ensuring that they
           covered its funding costs and the risk of the operation) and to adjust the interest
           rates of other government programs in the rural sector to avoid interest rate
                                               25


           arbitrage, while avoiding the creation of market distortions and allowing for
           competitiveness from private lenders. This risk materialized as Financiera Rural
           has been forced to compete with cheaper funds from the Federal and State
           Governments. This risk has been further highlighted by the financial sector policy
           announced in July 2013 which calls for development banks to play a more
           proactive role in providing (directed) credit at lower interest rate (para 5.10).

5.14 Thus, the design linked objectives to intermediate and final outcomes in a causal
chain that was clear and convincing; was consistent with the reduction of poverty and took
into consideration the risks that could derail the operation. It was highly relevant.

Quality of Supervision

5.15 Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. There were two Bank supervision
missions during Project implementation—one of them done jointly with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) team—which was adequate since the Bank team and Financiera
Rural management kept in close contact via email, video and telephone conferences, and on
occasions by visits of Financiera Rural to the Bank’s headquarters in Washington. Thus, the
Bank team managed to actually file three Project Status Reports and two Implementation
Status and Reports updating progress made during implementation of the Project.

5.16 The Bank team kept a pro-active relation with the Secretariat of Finance and Public
Credit and Financiera Rural during the supervision phase of the project. Its reporting in the
Project Status Reports and Implementation Status Reports was realistic and its ratings of
progress adequate and justified. The Aide Memoires associated with supervision missions
and the memorandums sent to the Bank Board for tranche release were informative and
clearly reviewed compliance of the Borrower with the agreed conditionality.

5.17 While reporting on the progress made by Financiera Rural was adequate, the Bank
team did not track routinely all of the 12 benchmark indicators (for outreach, portfolio
quality and efficiency) included in the Matrix Policy Actions. Because of this drawback, this
report rates supervision satisfactory rather than highly so.

Borrower Performance
5.18   Borrower Performance is rated Highly Satisfactory

Government’s Performance
5.19 Government performance is rated Highly Satisfactory. The Administration that took
office in December of 2001 had a well thought-out plan for an in-depth reform of the
development banking system. The 2002 decision to close Banrural and create Financiera
Rural in its place was part of this process of reforms. This was not politically easy because it
required terminating thousands of public workers, allocating a very large budget to the
process, and passing the solution the required legislation through Congress. The Government
did all this. By the time the Bank prepared the PD in May 2003, the Borrower had already
                                                           26


taken many of the crucial actions and set solid foundations for the success of the Project. All
along, the Government showed a high degree of stakeholder commitment to the Project.

5.20 The Government met all implementation-related conditions in the Matrix Policy
Actions (MPA) in a timely fashion.

        Macroeconomic conditions during the two and half years of implementation were
         consistent with the objective of establishing a successful Financiera Rural.
        The Government put in place an adequate scheme to implement the project and
         appointed an experienced team to deal with the final resolution of Banrural’s
         liquidation process though the judicial system.
        The Government reduced the gap that existed between rural lending interest rates
         under Banrural and the free market rates. Today, Financiera Rural interest rate
         structure is reasonably close to market values for the level of credit risk it is taking.
        The Government put the right management structure for Financiera Rural in place,
         approved its Strategic Plan and put a professionally competent and experienced
         management team in charge, which has been a crucial factor behind the institution’s
         success. This report rates government performance highly satisfactory.
Implementing Agency Performance
5.21 Implementing agency performance is rated Highly Satisfactory. Financiera Rural
fulfilled the expectations it raised at the time of its creation.

        It focused its lending on its defined market niche.
        It has been effective in reversing the culture of no-debt payment existing among
         small/mid-sized rural borrowers when Banrural was their main source of financing.
        It has been able to provide technical assistance to the sector as a separate and
         accountable activity, which has been an integral part of its business plan.
        It has accomplished its task with a much leaner network system and personnel
         structure.

Monitoring and Evaluation
5.22     This report rates Monitoring and Evaluation quality as Substantial.

5.23 The responsibility for the design and implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) was entrusted to Financiera Rural. Its quality was substantial.5 While not best
practice because there were no baseline data and some indicators originally designed were
not collected, the system provided a practical flow of information that allowed Financiera
Rural‘s management to make timely decisions regarding the course that the institution should
take. Rather than just implementing a M&E system designed to monitor a project, Financiera
Rural developed with time a system that keeps track of the development of the institution. In
line with the original impulse given to the institution by the project, most of the information

5
  A comprehensive and realistic Strategic Plan implemented (para 2.6) through its four management committees as well the
timely supply of accurate information from its MIS were some of the key feature s of FR’s M&E system that facilitated
meeting the business goals set out for FR.
                                              27


refers to financial performance. There is room for improvement in terms of evaluating the
institution’s impact on the overall rural financial markets and on the reduction of poverty.

5.24 Design: The indicators measured the extent to which Financiera Rural met the
operation’s objectives. Given the nature of the latter—they were defined in terms of the
efficiency of the operations of Financiera Rural—they mainly consisted of the data needed to
evaluate financial performance. These indicators were measurable in terms of numbers,
timing and location. The M&E design, being mainly based on Financiera Rural’s financial
accounts, was embedded institutionally and had full stakeholder ownership.

5.25 Yet, there was no planned baseline data collection and the beneficiaries were not
involved in defining target indicators and assessing their achievement. The explanation for
these deficiencies was that, given the urgency that existed to initiate the project and the
disorder that prevailed in the accounts of Banrural, there was no way to estimate the baseline
reality from which the new institution would start its operations. Establishing the baseline
data in those circumstances would have been arbitrary.

5.26 M&E design was outcome-oriented when focusing on the objectives of closing
Banrural and establishing Financiera Rural, particularly in financial terms. Yet, it was output-
oriented when focusing on poverty reduction.

5.27 M&E Implementation: Not all the indicators enumerated in the Program Document
were actually measured. This deficiency was not addressed during implementation. However,
data collected is reliable and of good quality, and the system is sustainable.

5.28 Use of M&E: Financiera Rural is a large, well-managed and mature institution that
enjoys investment grade in the classifications of several recognized rating agencies. The
M&E system, as evolved over time, in a process driven by the institution’s administration
rather than by the Bank, has helped management to guide the progress of the institution,
reorienting its operation as needed to better accomplish its objectives.

6. Lessons
The assessment draws four lessons:

6.1      High quality analytical work as well as strong borrower’s commitment is essential
for the success of an adjustment operation involving policy and institutional reforms. Part of
the success of this project can be attributed to the long-standing analytical work done by the
Bank on Mexico’s financial sector including rural finance. Also, the financial sector
assessment done jointly by the Bank and the IMF in 2001 had a decisive impact on the
government’s approach to the development bank reform in Mexico and the selection of the
business model for Financiera Rural.

6.2     The development agency model is a good option for transforming a state-owned
financial institution, when full privatization is not feasible and there is a need to expand
credit to underserved groups in a cost-efficient manner. Many countries face the need to find
a permanent solution to the inefficiency and recurrent losses caused by development banks,
                                              28


which require frequent and costly recapitalizations by the governments. The creation of
development banks without a social mandate is not a solution because they would not be
much different from a commercial bank. This operation presents a better solution i.e. to
transform these banks into finance-oriented development agencies, such as Financier Rural.
The development agency promotes financial access for underserved sectors and market
development through market-friendly instruments that do not distort market prices, nor
discourage private sector activities, such as matching grants and subsidies that are financed
by the government’s budget. Their lending tends to be second-tier and funded out of their
initial capital endowment or targeted budgetary appropriations, and not from deposits or
other liabilities.

6.4      The strength of institutions depends on the quality of management and the adoption of
appropriate procedures and practices. In the case of Financiera Rural, the project showed
that institutions, their business plans and management do matter, and that the effort spent on
defining a Strategic Plan, establishing the appropriate procedures and practices, and in
building up a management information system was worthwhile. Moreover, flexibility in the
institutional management is crucial to make changes in procedures and practices in response
to changing circumstances and objectives.

6.5     Keeping the operation simple and concentrated on easily verifiable actions contribute
to the success of adjustment operations. The sharp focus of this operation on institutional
building and financial discipline for Financiera Rural proved to be one of the operation’s best
aspects and contributed to the positive project outcome.
