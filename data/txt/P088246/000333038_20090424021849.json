DISBURSING SUB-ACCOUNT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Cyclone Emergency\n            Recovery Project for Samoa were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: i) whilst rapid recovery activities are\n            fundamentally needed in the aftermath of an emergency, there\n            is often a preference by communities and Government agencies\n            for familiar hard structural solutions. These should be\n            well-designed, taking account local topography and wave\n            conditions, if they are not to result in further loss of\n            natural features such as beaches and if they are to be\n            durable against future hazards. Furthermore, soft protection\n            measures (such as beach nourishment, vegetation replanting\n            and inland drainage) should be implemented in parallel with\n            construction of seawalls and similar structures in order to\n            strengthen the ability of the natural ecosystems themselves\n            to withstand future hazards. The value of soft protection\n            measures needs to be thoroughly and carefully introduced to\n            communities (and some agencies) to be acceptable and\n            thereafter maintained; ii)  the depreciation of the US\n            dollar against the local currency towards the end of the\n            project, exacerbated by long periods between actual\n            expenditure on the ground by the Government and submission\n            of withdrawal applications to International Development\n            Association (IDA), was not foreseen at the start of the\n            project and so not fully appreciated by the implementing\n            agencies. As a result, although the final costs of the\n            project in local currency (comprising the bulk of\n            procurement) were consistent with the appraisal estimates,\n            the rate of drawdown from the foreign currency denominated\n            grant and credit were not fully factored in when additional\n            works were approved in the last year of the project (late\n            2007). In this case, the Government was willing and able to\n            absorb the additional cost; however, there is need to ensure\n            that for future projects, the Government's system is\n            geared to careful monitoring of foreign exchange\n            fluctuations so as to avoid such information gaps; and iii)\n            in small countries with a relatively small construction\n            sector, the methodology for calculating contracts'\n            estimates needs careful consideration. In some\n            circumstances, where estimates could be out by a significant\n            factor, bids may need to be repackaged (in accordance with\n            the available budget) and re-advertised, resulting in\n            implementation delays. In such operating circumstances,\n            project engineers need to carefully consider local variables\n            when developing their estimates and also make better use of\n            'slice and package' approaches."}, "docdt": "2009-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
