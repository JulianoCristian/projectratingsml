and to reduce unaccounted-for water.\n            The project would improve and expand water supply facilities\n            in the Mare-aux-Vacoas, Triolet and Mt. Blanc areas and in\n            62 housing estates scattered over the island. It would also\n            include a training component and supply of spare parts and\n            equipment for the CWA. The project would satisfy the water\n            supply demand in the project areas. Combined with the\n            project financed by the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Funds in the\n            Mare-aux-Vacoas area, it would provide safe water\n            improvement of service to about 446,000 consumers."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
