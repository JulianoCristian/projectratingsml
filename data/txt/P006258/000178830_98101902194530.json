the transmission\n            capacity will be increased by converting the east portion of\n            the 230 kV ring to 345 kV, and by building 345 kV\n            transmission lines. Transformer stations will be built and\n            the capacity at the existing substations will be increased.\n            The transmission system will be extended and reinforced by\n            constructing overhead lines, rebuilding existing lines and\n            installing of underground cables. Distribution substation\n            capacity will be increased almost 50 percent by building 33\n            new substations and by increasing capacities at 101 existing\n            substations. The distribution systems will require the\n            installation of 63,500 km of overhead conductor and 843 km\n            of underground cable and an increase of 35 percent in the\n            installed distribution transformer capacity. One underground\n            network will be added in the Sao Paulo area. Supervisory\n            control equipment will be provided to control some\n            distribution substations from area centers. Static\n            capacitors will be installed for power factor correction."}, "docdt": "1973-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
