Employment, and Private Sector Development\n            Programmatic Policy Loan Project for Poland were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Development Policy Loans (DPLs) should be based on previous\n            technical assistance successes and salient cross country\n            experience. DPLs should be grounded in prior strong\n            analytical groundwork, which can provide the necessary\n            rationale for selection of policy and program reform areas.\n            Creditworthy middle income-countries benefit most from\n            programs that permit adequate flexibility to account for\n            rapid responses to changing circumstances, especially during\n            times of crisis. Bank-Borrower partnership rooted in a\n            country-specific reform agenda must be in place before a DPL\n            series is undertaken. The concentration of critically\n            important reform steps facilitate political ownership of the\n            program, and make the process easier for the authorities to\n            initiate and implement. Development policy lending proved to\n            be an instrument that served well Poland in the times of the\n            global financial crisis and economic slowdown."}, "docdt": "2011-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
