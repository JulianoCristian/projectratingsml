of the\n            Programmatic Bank and Corporate Restructuring Program\n            Adjustment Loan/Credit is to support the Government's\n            Bank and Corporate Restructuring Program (BCRP), aimed at\n            strengthening the financial and corporate sectors, lowering\n            systemic risks, and reducing the probability o f crises.\n            This will provide an enabling environment to restart prudent\n            lending, ultimately boosting economic growth. The\n            Bank/Association's (hereinafter called the Bank)\n            strategy for Bolivia's financial and corporate sectors\n            calls for operations in a programmatic context, each\n            focusing on distinct policy measures and actions that, taken\n            as a whole, would contribute to the strengthening of the\n            financial and corporate sectors and support the\n            Government's BCRP. The Government's program,\n            supported by this operation, involves seven main components:\n            (a) organizational arrangements to manage systemic bank and\n            corporate restructuring, (b) legal clarity on appropriate\n            distribution of  regulatory powers, (c) bank and corporate\n            diagnosis; (d) prudential strengthening and prompt\n            corrective action for banks; (d) bank resolution framework;\n            (e) legal and institutional framework for corporate\n            restructuring; and (f) anti-money laundering. Such\n            comprehensive and cohesive program is essential to realign\n            incentives and set in motion a process where: (i) viable\n            banks participate in the restructuring of troubled but\n            viable corporations that make the needed efforts to restore\n            their financial health, (ii) troubled but viable banks\n            restructure and regain medium-term profitability, and (iii)\n            unviable banks and corporations exit the system in an\n            orderly manner. While the first Loan/Credit would have\n            conditionality largely based on actions in the banking\n            sector, the second loan would follow a similar design, but\n            with flexibility to include conditionality on the corporate\n            sector if sufficient progress is achieved and/or further\n            advances on the banking sector take place. The first\n            Loan/Credit would be disbursed in two tranches. Several\n            benefits will flow from the project: It will support reforms\n            that contribute to the strengthening of the financial and\n            corporate sectors, lowering systemic risks and reducing the\n            probability of crises in the future; enhancing the\n            supervisory, regulatory and prompt corrective environment in\n            the banking sector;  consolidating and reducing systemic\n            risks in financial markets should further shield from\n            crises--increasing competition that could promote broader\n            access to financial services, and lowering potential drains\n            on the public budget to enable effective use for social\n            purposes. Enabling corporate restructuring should produce a\n            healthier corporate sector that attracts higher levels of\n            capital and enables increased production, a stricter\n            anti-money laundering environment could potentially increase\n            foreign investment in the financial sector, and  boost\n            private sector's confidence in the Government's\n            commitment to resolve financial and corporate sector\n            weaknesses. The main risks facing the operation arise from:\n            macro-financial risks, political and social uncertainty,\n            limited implementation capacity, inadequate framework for\n            corporate restructuring, and the legal framework."}, "docdt": "2004-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
