Project (EDP II) for Tunisia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was negligible to low, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            The main lesson to retain is striving to find a balance\n            between the need to improve synergies among project\n            components and coordination particularly with regards to the\n            flow of information and administrative duties between\n            project components and the coordination unit. Implementing\n            units reported a lack of integration with other project\n            components, noting they often had limited contact with other\n            project components despite the significant cross-over in the\n            work being pursued. The revolution coupled with economic\n            deterioration due to the global economic recession had a\n            profound impact on this project. Consultants and independent\n            entities may be recruited by Government to help achieve\n            outcomes more efficiently, however, without building public\n            sector capacity, long term sustainability may be sacrificed\n            if Government is unable to implement activities once the\n            project is closes. At the time of writing, a third EDP\n            project is being prepared that will seek to achieve greater\n            sustainability by integrating matching grant activities\n            within Center for Export Promotion (CEPEX) structures."}, "docdt": "2013-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
