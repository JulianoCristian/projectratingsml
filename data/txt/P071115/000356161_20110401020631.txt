Original/Current Project Development Ob.jectives/Outcomes
The Project builds upon and anchors more deeply the institutional reforms started under the first Export
Development project with the objective of creating an enabling export environment encouraging trade. Its
development objectives are to improve access to export markets and finance, and enhance the efficiency
trade logistics. The Project is expected to create linkages between domestic and offshore sectors, enhance
competitiveness of private enterprises, and strengthen public-private interface to administer and promote
internal and external trade.

                              TUNISIA - SECOND EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                                                       (Ln. No. 7239-TUN & 7487-TUN)

                                                                   Restructuring Paper

          1.       The closing dates of the Export Development II Project (Ln. 7239-TUN, and its
          Additional Financing Loan, Ln. 7487-TUN) will be extended for a period of 12 months, from
          March 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012. This will be the second extension of the Closing Date for this
          Project.

          2.      Project Implementation Progress. The Export Development II Project is build upon and
          anchors more deeply institutional refonns stat1ed under a first WBG financed EXp011
          Development Project (EDP I: 1999-2003) with the intention of creating an enabling export
          environment and encouraging trade in Tunisia. Development objectives of EDP II are i) to
          improve access to exp011 markets and finance, and ii) enhance the efficiency and perfonnance of
          trade clearance processes (customs operations and technical controls). The project main
          components are:
          II   Component 1. Second Export Market Access Fund (EMAF II);
          II   Component 2. Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantees (PEFG) Facility;
          II   Component 3. WTO Technical Ba11'iers to Trade Enquiry Point;
          II   Component 4. Trade Logistics:
                       Enhanced integration of technical control procedures and strengthened risk
                         management protocols;
                       Trade Logistics - Streamlining and Strengthening of Customs Procedures;
                       Trade Logistics Performance Indicators.

          3.      Overall, EDP II has been successful in tenns of outcomes as envisioned within the
          framework of the loan agreements 7239-TUN and 7487-TUN. Good progress has been achieved
          towards the project's development objectives. Components targets are left unchanged for this
          extension; some are already reached (and are at best practice level) or need this extension to be
          reached as shown below.
  .                               ..                                                                      ..
Component                                                               Tareets                                          Outcomes IDEC. 2010)
1. Second Export Market Access Fund.
                        1.1. Support to finns   1000 finns with completed plans                          1186 firms enrolled and 851 plans completed
                 1.2. Support to associations   40 associations with completed plans                     77 associations enrolled and 42 plans completed
2. PEFG Facility                                Additional exports generated USD 259.3 mil.              Additional exports generated USD III mil.
                                                Amount working capital loan guaranteed USD 210 mil.      Amount working capital loan guaranteed USD 38 mil.
3. WTO TBT Enquiry Point                        Notification time of 2 months to WTO for new technical   2 months
                                                regulations
4. Trade Logistics
4.1 - Enhanced integration of technical         Technical control requests processed immediately         AMC: 3 hours and APE: 2.8 hours (Min. Commerce)
      control procedures
4.2 - Customs                                   Processing time of Customs declaration: 15 mns           Processing time of CustOlns declaration: 14-15 mns
                                                Import declarations assigned to the Green Channel: 80%   Green Channel: 50-55 %


          However, implementation of one component (Component 4: Trade Logistics - Enhanced
          integration of technical control procedures) has been slower than expected in 2010 and is
          considered as moderately satisfactory. Overall disbursement is at 82 percent; depending on
          individual components, it ranges between 80 percent (Import Technical Controls) and 95 percent

                                                                                   1
(Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantees Facility). The project           IS   expected to achieve its
development objectives.

4.         Justification for extension. The rationale for the proposed extension stems from the
key elements that follow and funded through both loans (Loan No. 7239-TUN and Loan No.
7487-TUN):

    e      The Sub-component "Enhanced integration of technical control procedures" under the
           Component 4: Trade Logistics - cannot be completed within the cunent timeframe
         . despite progress in 2010. This is due to technical constraints related to the time required
          to install IT equipment and train staff in several Ministries. Completing this task will
           aJlow reaching a key project target;

    e    Project activities have slowed down since mid-December 2010 - due to events in Tunisia
         - which has triggered delays in completing some remaining tasks, including some training
         and the procurement of remaining items;

    It   The cunent highly successful parts of the project, the Export Market Access Fund II and
         the Preshipment Export Finance Guarantee Facility need to be given more time to
         complete remaining activities (completion of export plans and awareness campaigns) and
         can be used creatively to support the Tunisian economy in the cunent difficult period by
         facilitating exports by SMEs and contributing to maintain (eventually expand)
         employment. This will allow completing project targets (EMAF II) and coming closer to
         project outcomes (PEFG).

5.      The Tunisian Govemment has requested on February 8, 2011 a 6-month extension of this
project. However, discussions held in early March 2011 with the Director of Multilateral
Cooperation from the Ministry of Planning and Intemational Cooperation and the technical
constraints related to the component on Enhanced integration of technical control (Component 4:
Trade Logistics) suggest that a 6-month extension is not enough. A 12-month extension of the
closing date was therefore agreed upon and is hence being sought.

6.     Development objectives of the project remain unchanged as are the design and
implementation anangements of the project.
