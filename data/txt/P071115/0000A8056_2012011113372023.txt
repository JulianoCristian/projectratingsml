                         - Customs may need a bit more time to install their remaining equipment and the EMAF II fund will need to process the closure and payment of its last batch of export plans. This
                         imply that a short (3 months) extension of the project's closing date, currently March 31, 2012, is justified. The Government has to reach a decision on this and if it is willing, has to
                         inform the WBG so as it can be processed.
