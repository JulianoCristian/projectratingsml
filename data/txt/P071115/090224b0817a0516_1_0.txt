                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The government has requested that an evaluation of EDP II be conducted, along with adequate analytical works for the preparation of the new Competitiveness and Export
                         Development project. The Gov intends to request a PPA to finance the preparatory studies for the new project and help keep the current PIU for its preparation and implementation.
