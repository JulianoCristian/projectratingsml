The rationale\n            for the extension is that: a) specific activities cannot be\n            completed within the initial timeframe and b) the current\n            successful parts of the project need to be reinforced and\n            given more time to consolidate. Overall, good progress has\n            been achieved towards the project's development\n            objectives and many targets of each individual component\n            have been reached. Overall disbursement is at 76 percent;\n            depending on individual components, it ranges between 57\n            percent (import technical controls) and 95 percent\n            (pre-shipment export finance guarantees facility). The\n            project is expected to create linkages between domestic and\n            offshore sectors, enhance competitiveness of private\n            enterprises, and strengthen public-private interface to\n            administer and promote internal and external trade. The\n            extension will cover the period from March 2010 to March\n            2011, or a one year extension."}, "docdt": "2010-01-07T00:00:00Z"}
