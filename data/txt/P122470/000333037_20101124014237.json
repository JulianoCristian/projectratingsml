{"cdata!": "The Seventh Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit (PRSC) Operation Program for Mozambique focuses on\n            strengthening economic governance systems and growth agenda\n            to accelerate private sector development in order to achieve\n            broad based growth for poverty reduction. Mozambique's\n            economic performance for the past decade has been very\n            strong and the government has been implementing an active\n            program of structural reforms. Following political\n            stabilization and market-oriented reforms, and steady\n            improvements in infrastructure, the economy has registered\n            an average annual growth rate of 8 percent between 1993 and\n            2009, and incomes have risen considerably. There is a very\n            strong momentum for continuing the reforms program and\n            striving to reach even higher growth rates. However,\n            economic growth has also been negatively affected by the\n            financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, and there are now fewer\n            public and private financial resources available to finance\n            investments. The economic policies that have served well\n            Mozambique in the past and have contributed to strong\n            economic growth have started to show some signs of fatigue.\n            The PRSC series is an important component of the Country\n            Partnership Strategy (CPS) approved by the Board in 2007,\n            and closely aligned to the government program."}, "docdt": "2010-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
