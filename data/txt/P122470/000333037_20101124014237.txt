Agency
Financing data    IDA Credit Amount: SDR54.1 million (USD85 million equivalent)
                  Terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period.

Operation type    Programmatic (second operation in a series of three). Single tranche to be disbursed from
                  the Credit upon effectiveness.

Main Policy       The proposed PRSC series is designed to assist the Government of Mozambique (GoM) to
Areas             implement key policy actions outlined in its 2006-2010 Second Action Plan for the
                  Reduction of Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA II). The PRSC series supports a subset
                  of objectives from the PARPA II results matrix focusing on improving public financial
                  management systems and adopting growth enhancing reforms. The PRSC-7 is expected to
                  help the GoM in: (a) the consolidation and deepening of reforms in the area of the tax
                  policy and administration, the public financial management systems, the State
                  procurement system, the capacity of the internal audit, and the coverage and effectiveness
                  of external audit; and (b) removing constraints to growth, notably by reducing constraints
                  to financial intermediation and simplifying procedures for import and export operations.

Key Outcome       Public financial management systems:
Indicators        Average difference over the past 3 years between primary expenditure outturn compared
                  to originally budgeted primary expenditures: Baseline 2007: 4.5 percent; Target 2011: 3
                  percent
                  Percentage of public sector contracts reported to UFSA subject to public tender: Baseline
                  2007: 85 percent; Target 2011: 95 percent

                  Growth enhancing reforms to increase private investment:
                  Number of individual and collective taxpayers: Baseline 2007: 550 thousand; Target
                  2011: 1,400 thousand
                  Number of procedures and working days to start a business: Baseline 2007: 13 procedures
                  and 113 working days; Target 2011: 9 procedures and 23 working days.

Program           In line with the government PARPA-II and the FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy
Development       (CPS), the program supported by the PRSC series focuses on strengthening economic
Objectives and    governance systems and growth agenda to accelerate private sector development in order
Contribution to   to achieve broad based growth for poverty reduction. Specifically the PRSC series will
CAS               support achievement of the following CPS outcomes: (#1) improved budget planning at
                  central, district and municipal level; (#2) improved government fiduciary systems; (#10)
                  simplify procedures to start a business; (#11) increased access to finance and support for
                  SMEs.

Risks and Risk   There are three main areas of risk: (i) macro, (ii) political, and (iii) capacity.
Mitigation
                 The first set is concerned with the potential for macroeconomic shocks. The highest risk
                 would come through changes in the world economy leading to deteriorating terms of
                 trade, absence of FDI, or unpredictable reductions in donor disbursements. As mitigation
                 measures the government maintains high level of reserves, a flexible exchange rate
                 regime, and low external debt. Additionally, Mozambique has a PSI with the IMF, which
                 contributes to solid macroeconomic monitoring. The maintenance of a very active
                 communication between the government and development partners can partially mitigate
                 the risk of unpredictable lower donor support. The elaboration of the new PARP will help
                 to deepen this communication. All together we consider this risk to be low.

                 On the political side, high poverty levels and unemployment especially among the urban
                 youth can trigger unrest as the recent riots on the aftermath of price increases on bread,
                 water, and electricity showed. Measures adopted by government after the riots included a
                 more progressive scale of utility price increases and a freeze in bread prices compensating
                 producers through a subsidy scheme. These measures will be reviewed by the end of
                 2010. The government's interest in developing a comprehensive social protection program
                 and in implementing a more inclusive, labor intensive, growth agenda resulting in faster
                 job creation would help to mitigate these risks. A second area of political risk is the
                 absence of consensus on some reforms in the growth agenda. The PRSC supports reforms
                 promoting more efficient land utilization, including discouraging speculative practices,
                 through changes to the land tax regime. This will require strong political will. Reforms to
                 improve the business environment will also impact vested interests across many
                 Ministries. To mitigate these risks the government is taking action to create consensus. On
                 land tax, a National Land Policy Forum involving all stakeholders regarding the
                 implementation of the Land Law is being considered. On improving business regulations
                 the government is working with the assistance of the Bank in a detailed action plan to
                 implement the reforms. Perhaps most importantly is government's resolve to rebalance its
                 growth strategy towards more inclusive and job-creating growth. The authorities
                 approached the Bank seeking support in developing such strategy indicating that areas
                 supported by the PRSC series would be important parts of it. Depending on the area, this
                 risk is moderate to high.

                 A third set of risks concerns possible delays in implemention as a result of weak capacity.
                 Limited institutional capacity can limit the scope and speed of reforms in all the areas
                 supported by the PRSC. In order to mitigate this risk, the Bank intends to increase its
                 engagement at the technical level. There are specific projects and technical assistance
                 targeting areas of reforms as listed in Annex V. The development partners have also
                 agreed on a common fund to finance the implementation of the program that is expected
                 to deliver capacity building and oversight more effectively. IDA is the main contributor to
                 this fund, through its Planning and Decentralized Finances Project approved by the Board
                 in early 2010. The risk is moderate.

        INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
                   PROGRAM DOCUMENT
                 FOR A PROPOSED CREDIT
             TO THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
    FOR A SEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                   I. INTRODUCTION
1.      This Program Document proposes a Seventh Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC-7) to the Republic of Mozambique for a Credit in the amount of
SDR54.1 million (USD85 million equivalent). The proposed Credit is an integral part
of the Bank's strategy to support the implementation of Mozambique's "Second Action
Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty" 1 (known as PARPA II by its Portuguese
acronym), aided by the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the
government and the nineteen external partners (the G19) 2 providing general budget
support (GBS). While the PRSC operations will provide financial support for
implementing the whole PARPA, they are to be disbursed against the upfront completion
of a number of specific reform measures identified in the PAF. The proposed operation
is the second in a PRSC series of three annual single-tranche operations to be delivered
over FY10-12. A detailed description of the PRSC series was provided in the PRSC-6
Program Document, the first operation of this PRSC series (Republic of Mozambique,
Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit, Report No. 50921-MZ, approved November 12,
2009). Consistent with the programmatic approach of the PRSC series, this document
will cross-reference the earlier program document.

2.      Mozambique's economic performance for the past decade has been very
strong and the government has been implementing an active program of structural
reforms. Following political stabilization and market-oriented reforms, and steady
improvements in infrastructure, the economy has registered an average annual growth
rate of 8 percent between 1993 and 2009, and incomes have risen considerably. There is
a very strong momentum for continuing the reforms program and striving to reach even
higher growth rates. However, economic growth has also been negatively affected by the
financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, and there are now fewer public and private financial
resources available to finance investments. In this context, the PRSC series focuses on
the top two priorities for the Government of Mozambique, namely improving the
efficiency in the use of its scarce resources and boosting private sector investment and
economic growth.

  Secundo Plano de Acção para Redução da Pobreza Absoluta (PARPA-II). The PARPA II originally
covered the period 2006-2009, but was subsequently extended to include 2010 in order to avoid a gap
before the new government is able to prepare the next document (PARP-III), originally expected in
October, 2010 but delayed for several reasons for at least one month or two. The new instrument (PARP-
III) dropped the "Absolute" and is now titled Plano de Acção para Redução da Pobreza.

  The 19 donors are: African Development Bank, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, EU, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the
World Bank. Two associate members, the USA and United Nations, participate in the G19 policy dialogue,
although they do not provide budget support. In addition, the IMF is an ex-officio member of the G19.

3.      The economic policies that have served well Mozambique in the past and
have contributed to strong economic growth have started to show some signs of
fatigue. One significant sign comes from the Third National Poverty Assessment, using
data from the 2008/09 nationally representative household budget survey, which reports
mixed results. Although there was significant progress on many non-monetary poverty
indicators such as access to education and health services, increase in asset ownership by
households and improvements in housing quality, measures of poverty headcount
suggests that the strong decline in consumption poverty has leveled out and the poverty
rate increased slightly from 54.1 percent in 2002/03 to 54.7 percent in 2008/09. While the
food and fuel crisis played a role in this outcome, the stagnation on poverty reduction
while the economy continued to growth at substantially high rates suggests that growth
has become less inclusive in the last years.

4.      The PRSC series is an important component of the Country Partnership
Strategy approved by the Board in 2007, and closely aligned to the government
program. The FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS; Report No. 39395-Moz)
supports the implementation of the PARPA II. As government policies and budget are
the main instruments for implementing the PARPA, the Bank is committed to supporting
and aligning with the budget process. The indicative lending scenario of the CPS
envisages programmatic support through consecutive PRSCs to support Mozambique's
efforts in increasing accountability and public voice and fostering sustainable and broad-
based growth. In line with the government program, and as reflected in the CPS, the
program supported by the PRSC series recognizes the centrality of a broad-based growth
agenda and the importance of enhanced public financial management reforms.

                              II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
                                A. COUNTRY OVERVIEW

5.      Mozambique has been
a very strong economic              Figure 1:Mozambique Growth Record 1993-2009
performer in Africa since the
end of the Civil war in 1992.
Looking back at the last fifteen
years, the growth record has
been remarkable, averaging
above 8 percent from 1993 to
2009, making Mozambique the
fastest     growing     non-oil
economy       in   Sub-Saharan
Africa. This performance has
been made possible by good
macroeconomic management,
and was driven by a few
significant foreign investment




                                          -2-
projects ("mega-projects"), strong donor support, healthy agricultural growth, and foreign
direct investment in the services sector.

6.      Mozambique's rapid economic growth was accompanied by significant
strides in reducing poverty up to 2003. Household survey data indicate that the national
poverty headcount fell from roughly 69 to 54 percent from 1996 to 2003. Reduction in
rural poverty was even more pronounced, declining from 71 to 55 percent during the
same period. The preliminary results of the 2008/09 household survey suggest poverty
reduction may have stagnated at a level around roughly 55 percent of the population.
Additionally, the results indicate that urban poverty continued to decline, although at a
much slower rate, reaching 50 percent, while rural poverty increased to 57 percent. 3

7.     Social indicators have shown significant improvements since the mid-1990s
(Table 1):

    ·    In primary education (grades 1­7), the number of children more than tripled from
         approximately 1.3 million in 1992 to 4.2 million in 2008. Net enrollment rate at
         primary education doubled from 45 percent in 1998 to over 96 percent in 2008.
    ·    Net enrollment of girls rose from 40 percent to 93 percent in the same period.
    ·    Primary school teachers increased from 30,000 in 1992 to 73,900 in 2008.
    ·    The gross enrolment rate in lower secondary education (ES1) increased from 4.8
         percent in 1998 to 28 percent in 2008. Net enrollment rate grew from 1 percent to
         9 percent during the same period. The gross enrolment rate for upper secondary
         school (ES2) increased from 1.3 percent in 2008 to reach 8 percent in 2008.
    ·    Under-5 mortality rates decreased from 212 per 1,000 live births in 1996, to 178
         in 2003, and reached 138 in 2008.
    ·    Infant mortality decreased from 145 per 1,000 live births in 1996, to 122 in 2003,
         and further down to 93 in 2008.
    ·    Maternal mortality was reduced from an estimated 1,000 per 100,000 live births
         in the early 1990s to 408 per 100,000 live births in 2003, and to 340 in 2007.
    ·    The share of the population with access to an improved water source increased
         from 39 percent in 1995 to 48 percent in 2008.
    ·    The capacity of the health system was expanded to start providing free ARV
         treatment for HIV infection.

8.      Mozambique has made substantial progress towards achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Given the results of the recent household
survey discussed in paragraph 3, Mozambique needs to accelerate poverty reduction to
halve the population living in absolute poverty by 2015 (additional 15 percent decline in
poverty in six years). As mentioned, reducing hunger and child malnutrition remains a

3
  It should be noted that there are substantial concerns related to under-reporting of food consumption in the
2008/09 household survey data which could affect both the poverty levels and their trend over time. In fact
the data problem also affects the previous two household surveys (in 1996/97 and 2002/03), although to a
different extent. Additional analytical work is required to test the robustness of the preliminary results by
correcting for the data problems.


                                                    -3-
challenge. The MDG for sustainable coverage for water supply could also be met, given
the rapid improvements in the provision of urban water supply, although significant
progress is needed to increase access to water in rural areas. There has also been
substantial progress toward other MDG targets, specifically on improving universal
primary education, gender equality and women's empowerment, reducing child mortality,
and improving maternal health. Nevertheless, more progress will be required to meet
these MDGs, while combating Human Immunodeficiency Virus/ Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), malaria and other diseases remains a serious
challenge. A detailed discussion of progress towards each MDG is included in Box 1.

9.      Despite the promising progress, significant challenges remain. The country
remains poor (USD440 per capita income in 2009, using the Atlas methodology), social
indicators are low, infrastructure is inadequate, and the business environment remains
unfriendly. Adult literacy rates are low (approximately 47 percent), and life expectancy at
birth remains very low (42 years). Despite economic growth, malnutrition worsened
from 2003 to 2008 with the percentage of chronically malnourished children (stunted)
increasing from 44 percent to 48 percent. The country also relies heavily on foreign aid,
which makes up about half of its overall budget. Additionally, malaria alone accounts for
35 percent of deaths among children below five years of age, 60 percent of admissions in
pediatric wards, and 40 percent of overall outpatient consultations. It has been found that
in Sub-Saharan Africa, malaria reduces GDP growth by an estimated average of 1.3
percent per year. As for HIV/AIDS, current projections indicate that in 2010 the
Mozambican economy will be 14-20 percent smaller than it would otherwise be due to
the impact of HIV/AIDS. 4

  It should be noted that supporting the government in the elusive goal of more effective HIV prevention
remains a central part of the Bank's agenda in Mozambique (notably through the HIV/AIDS response
project) even if not in this series of budget support operations.


                                                    -4-
10.     Constraints to private sector development and trade remain substantial, and
much more progress is required to improve the business environment. Mozambique
ranked 135th out of 183 countries in the 2010 Ease of Doing Business, improving five
positions from the 140th place in 2009 report. However, the country ranking in the Trade
Logistics Performance Index worsened, from 110th out of 150 countries in the 2007
report to 136th out of 155 countries in the 2010 report. 5 Mozambique is 130th (out of
180) on the 2009 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. In the 2009
Worldwide Governance Indicators Mozambique performed better than Sub-sharan Africa
(SSA) and low income group averages on all six aspects of the index (voice and
accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of
law, and control of corruption).

  On core dimensions Mozambique ranks close to bottom on "Frequency with which shipments reach the
consignee within the scheduled or expected time" (150th) and on "Efficiency of the customs clearance
process" (145th). It ranked 130th on "Logistic quality and competence"; 124th on "Quality of trade and
transport-related infrastructure; and 87th, best rank, on "Easy to arrange competitively price shipments."

           Box 1: P ROGRESS TOWARDS THE M ILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT G OALS
Mozambique is likely to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 (Goal 1). The poverty headcount
ratio declined from 69 percent in 1996/97 to 54 percent 2002/03. However, the most recent household survey
points to stagnation on poverty reduction at around 55 percent. Mozambique needs to further decrease
poverty rate by 15 percentage points in six years to achieve the goal of 40 percent of the population below
the poverty line by 2015.
Mozambique should be able to achieve universal primary education by 2015 (Goal 2). Good progress has
been made in the last few years; the enrolment rate in 1st grade increased to 95 percent in 2007 from 69
percent in 2003 (net enrolment in all grades of EP1 more than doubled from 45 to 96 during 1998 to 2008)
and the completion rate increased from 39 percent in 2003 to 73 percent in 2007. A major achievement is the
increase in the net enrollment rate at 6 years of age which was 19 percent in 1998 and reached 73 percent in
2008. Nevertheless, efforts have to continue to increase enrolment and completion rates, as well as removing
gender disparities, and increasing the quality of primary education.
Mozambique remains stable with respect to gender equality and empowering women (Goal 3). Gender
indicators at all levels of education have improved, particularly in EP1 and the gender difference in net
enrollment ratio was reduced to only 4 percentage points. Net enrollment of girls rose from 40 percent to 93
percent during 1998 to 2008.as a result the girls to boys ratio in EP1 increased from 86 percent in 2003 to 90
percent in 2007. Nevertheless, significant gender gaps remain at the upper of primary education (EP2) and
secondary education. More progress remains to be made also in women's involvement in the productive
sectors and in positions of authority.
Substantial progress has been made towards reducing child mortality and good progress has been made in
increasing immunization rates (Goal 4). Both infant mortality and the under-five mortality rates have
declined substantially since the turn of the century and immunization rates have had a steady increase over
the past years. Under-5 mortality rate decreed from 178 per thousand in 2000 to 138 per thousand in 2008.
Nevertheless Mozambique is very unlikely to meet this MDG goal by 2015.
Good progress has been made in improving maternal health (Goal 5), nevertheless Mozambique is unlikely
to meet this MDG goal by 2015. Maternal mortality has decreased from an estimated 1,000 to 408 per
100,000 live births from early 1990s to 2003 and further to 340 in 2007. The number of attended births has
increased slightly, however Mozambique continues to have one of the worst performances in the region for
these targets.
There has been little progress in combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (Goal 6). The 2007
epidemiological data suggest that the HIV/AIDS prevalence rates remain very high, particularly among
young girls, affecting 16 percent of the population and of which universe, 58 percent are women. Although
following a previous period of increasing prevalence rates the average adult prevalence rates may have
remained stable at around 16 percent since 2003, some provinces have reached very high levels, with up to
38 percent of pregnant women being seropositive in some districts. Despite improvements in setting up the
infrastructure needed for outreach and treatment, and in securing financial resources, only limited progress
has been made in reducing risky behaviors. There has been some progress in increasing the proportion of
population using effective malaria prevention. Mozambique will almost certainly not meet this MDG by
2015.
Finally, the MDG for water is expected to be met in urban areas, although little progress has been made in
increasing access to clean water in rural areas, and in ensuring environmental sustainability (Goal 7).
The share of people with access to safe drinking water in urban areas has increased significantly and the
MDG for sustainable coverage is expected to be met for urban water supply (to reach 70 percent). However
little progress has been made in increasing access to clean water in rural areas, In environmental
management, however, more remains to be done as government actions are ad-hoc and not well coordinated
among different actors.

11.     Economic growth continues to be strong, but the structure of the economy
remains narrow. Rapid economic growth continues to be made possible by overall
macroeconomic stability, continuing strong donor support, and mega-project investments.
Nevertheless, the productive base of the economy remains narrow, and is focused on
subsistence agriculture and a few isolated mega-projects. 6 Agriculture, which employs
about 78 percent of the economically active population, accounted for 24 percent of GDP
in 2009; followed by manufacturing at 13 percent (mostly accounted for by one large
aluminum smelter), trade and retail services at 14 percent; transport and communications
at 9 percent; financial services at 5 percent; and extractive industries at one percent.

driven by exports from
mega-projects.    Excluding
mega-projects, exports grew
by 10 percent on average
during 2000-2008. In fact, more than half of Mozambique's exports remain concentrated
in an enclave aluminum smeltering (Figure 2).

13.     Progress in public sector governance has been mixed. Significant progress has
been made in improving transparency and accountability by strengthening Public
Financial Management systems, including the areas of procurement and internal and
external audit. Also there has been progress towards improving the management of
natural resources, notably by strengthening the legal framework regulating the fiscal
regimes for mining and petroleum in 2007. In addition, in May 2009 Mozambique was
accepted as a candidate to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and has
since appointed the EITI permanent national coordinator, hired staff for the national EITI
secretariat, and convened the first EITI multistakeholder meeting. Progress however
remains limited in other areas. For example, improvements in the efficiency and
transparency of the justice system remain a challenge, and corruption and conflict-of-
interest remain central issues. Also, despite some recent progress, implementation of the
public sector reforms program remains slow.

 Megaprojects in Mozambique are mainly non-ferrous metal factories, which is highly capital intensive.
For example, it represented 62 percent of the production value of the whole manufacturing sector in 2005
and just 3.3 percent of the sector's employment, slightly more than 1,000 jobs.


                                                                  -7-
14.     Political and governance concerns led to a delay in the disbursement of
budget support by several development partners in early 2010. Parliamentary and
Presidential elections were held peacefully in October 2009 following municipal
elections in 2008. The incumbent President was reelected with 75 percent of the votes,
and the ruling party obtained a very large majority. International observers indicated that
elections were free and fair, although they highlighted problems with the electoral laws.
The lack of inclusiveness in the democratic process exacerbated concerns of development
partners on matters of political and economic governance leading to a delay in the
disbursement of budget support by most development partners in the first quarter of 2010.
Following a period of intense dialogue, the government committed to measures to
address those concerns, 7 and disbursements resumed in April 2010. Development
partners are closely monitoring implementation of the measures.

15.     Mozambique ranks third amongst the African countries most exposed to
risks from multiple weather-related hazards, suffering from periodic floods,
cyclones and droughts. As much as 58 percent of the population and more than 37
percent of GDP are at risk from two or more hazards. Floods, epidemics and cyclones are
the most frequent disasters, although drought affects by far the largest number of people.
Climate change will increase extreme weather patterns, based on observed trends and
future scenarios. Hence, critical sectors that will be at increasing risk include agriculture,
infrastructure, power, water and sanitation, and health and nutrition.

                            B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

16.     Economic growth in Mozambique was not seriously affected by the global
financial crisis as the authorities' response helped mitigate the impacts. Real GDP
growth rate declined slightly from 6.7 percent in 2008 to 6.4 in 2009 (Table 2). 8 The
government loosened the fiscal and monetary stance during 2009, introduced a fuel
subsidy at the pump in mid-2009, arguably to avoid civil unrest during the crisis and in
the run up to the elections, while approving approved measures to rationalize
expenditures for non-priority sectors and limit the cost of internal and external travel. The
Central Bank eased somewhat monetary policy in order to limit the contractionary impact
of the higher public debt on credit to the private sector. To support the fiscal accounts and
the balance of payments, the government asked the Bank to increase the size of PRSC-6

  Donors' political concerns were addressed through government commitments to reform the electoral law
and strengthen the role of opposition parties in Parliament. Economic governance concerns centered on the
need to improve procurement, strengthen the legal framework for anti-corruption and conflict of interests,
increase the transparency and accountability of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), improve the management
of natural resources and concessions, and enhancing the business environment. The government already
had reform initiatives ongoing in most of these areas, and has committed to accelerate them. These
commitments were summarized in the "Political and Economic Governance Reforms Matrix." In line with
IDA's Articles of Agreement, the Bank team did not participate in discussions related to political and
electoral reform issues, but actively contributed to the discussions on economic governance issues.
8 Although economic growth remained high, the country has suffered in general and some specific sectors
in particular; especially those dependent on external financing. For example, tax revenues from mega-
projects declined by 43 percent from 2008 to 2009; only 68 percent of the expected external grants was
effectively received, and even less for grants for projects (52 percent of expected total).

from USD85 million to USD110 million and to move disbursement from the first quarter
of 2010 to the last quarter of 2009; and also requested access to 100 percent of its IMF
quota (approximately equivalent to USD170 million) under the IMF's Exogenous Shock
Facility (ESF), which was approved by the Board in June 2009.

17.     The Balance of Payments in 2009 performed better than previously
envisaged, as stronger than anticipated capital inflows more than offset the
deterioration in the current account. Trade deficit increased from 8.4 percent of GDP
in 2007 to 10 percent in 2008 (mainly as a result of the increase in the price of oil and
grains), and to 14.1 percent in 2009, as a result of the drop in exports associated with the
international financial crisis and the slump in the price of aluminum (Table 3). While the
financial crisis led to the postponement and/or cancellation of some foreign direct
investment, the impact was mitigated by the start of the construction of two large coal
mines in the Tete region. 9

18.      Inflation has picked up speed recently due partially to strong nominal
devaluation of the Metical. Average annual inflation increased to 10.3 percent in 2008
on account of the rising international food and oil prices, but decreased to 3.3 percent in
2009 (due to both the drop in commodity prices and the introduction of fuel subsidies).
Inflation increased rapidly in recent months, with year-on-year inflation reaching 17.1
percent in August 2010, as a result of increases in international food and fuel prices, the

  In 2009 the Brazilian Vale mining company (formerly CVRD) started the construction of its mine in
Moatize, expected to produce 26 million tons of export quality thermal and coking coal, for 25 years,
starting in 2011. The Australian Riversdale Mining also received permission to operate a mine in Moatize,
also expected to open in 2011, with estimated production of 20 million tons of export quality thermal and
coking coal annually for 25 years. The combined investment by the two companies is expected to be over
$2 billion during 2009-2010, although a large share will be for imports of capital goods.

gradual abolition of the fuel subsidies, the increase in aggregate demand, and the sharp
nominal devaluation of the Metical, especially against the US Dollar and the South
African Rand. Aiming to achieve target average inflation of 9.3 percent, the Bank of
Mozambique (BM) has tightened monetary policy this year. 10

19.    The metical depreciated substantially during 2009 and early 2010, offsetting
the previous overvaluation. The exchange rate depreciated in 2009 and the trend
continued in 2010, as a result of weak exports, a loose monetary policy stance, higher
than expected demand for fuel at higher international prices, and uncertain aid inflows.
The interbank exchange rate moved from 25.2 MT per USD in January 2009, to 30.5 in
end-December 2009, and 36.8 at end-August 2010.

20.     Fiscal performance has been conducive to economic growth and the medium-
term fiscal strategy objective is to make room for private sector credit by limiting
recourse to domestic financing. Fiscal performance remained strong in 2009 (Table 4).
Revenue collections in 2009 were substantially higher than in 2008 (1.74 percent of
GDP), partially as a result of the reintroduction of fuel taxes that had been temporarily
suspended in mid-2008. Total expenditures and net lending also increased substantially in
2009 (5 percent of GDP), driven by higher externally financed capital expenditures (1.6
percent of GDP), some increase in wages and salaries and net lending. The share of
expenditures to priority sectors was 61.9 percent in 2009, in line with the 2009 budget
(estimated 63 percent to priority sectors). The discrepancy is due to lower than
anticipated externally financed investment in priority sectors. The domestic current
primary surplus was 0.9 percent of GDP higher than programmed in 2009 (under the IMF
PSI).

21.     There are, however, growing fiscal pressures due to high costs of fuel
subsidies and fast increasing expenditures on the publish sector wages bill in the last
three years. The IMF and the Bank's teams concur that the authorities maintain a firm
commitment to macroeconomic stability in general, and to fiscal sustainability in
particular and that the current macroeconomic framework is satisfactory for continuing
with budget support. The government started phasing out fuel subsidies through price
increases for gasoline. However, diesel subsidies, which represents the larger share of
fuel subsidies remain in place, although, the government has maintained its intension to
phase it out even after the social unrest of September. With respect to the higher wage
and salary bills resulting from the adoption of a new salary policy and its initial
implementation, there is a need to continuously assess the fiscal impact of the new wage
policy and take, if needed, the necessary measures to contain it.

   Interest rates on its lending standing facility currently stands at 15.5 percent compared to 11.5 percent in
2009. Additionally, required reserves coefficient increased from 8 percent in 2009 to 8.75 percent so far in
2010.

22.     There are improvements in the soundness, depth and profitability of the
Mozambique financial system, while credit to the private sector has been growing
faster than GDP. The Financial Sector Assessment (FSA) in February 2009 found that
the soundness of the banking sector has improved substantially in recent years. The
financial system has deepened since the banking system was restructured. Sound
financial policies and cleaned-up balance sheets have restored confidence in the banking

sector. 11 Greater confidence in the banking system has also led to a significant decrease
in liability dollarization and thus less financial vulnerability. 12 Credit to the private sector
has been growing rapidly, at 33 percent in 2006, 17 percent in 2007, 46 percent in 2008,
and 59 percent in 2009, and is projected to continue to expand at 59 percent in 2010.

23.   Public and private investments continue to grow. Public investment increased
from 11.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 13.1 percent in 2009, while private investment

11
   The share of non-performing loans fell from 14.4 percent in 2003 to 1.95 and 1.8 percent in 2008 and
2009, respectively. The banking sector's average capital adequacy ratio improved to 14.0 percent in 2008
and 16.6 percent in 2009, and the sector remains very liquid, with liquid assets to total assets at 54.5
percent in 2008. Additionally, credit in foreign currency declined from 56 percent of total credit in 2003 to
31 percent in 2008 and 32 percent in 2009.
12
   Prudential measures led to a sharp decline in foreign currency-denominated loans from 71 percent of
total loans in 2003 to 32 percent in 2008.


                                                      - 12 -
almost doubled from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.9 percent in 2009. Foreign
investments accelerated substantially in the last years: USD153 million in 2006; USD428
million in 2007; USD587 in 2008; and USD878 million in 2009 (approximately 50
percent in extractive industries, 15 percent in transport and communications, 15 percent
in agriculture, and 15 percent in manufacturing).

24.     The government has started the gradual removal of the fuel subsidy, which
was introduced in mid 2009. In mid-2009 the government decided against the pass-
through of higher fuel prices to domestic consumers but to directly compensate fuel
retailers for the related losses. At the time, authorities indicated that the measure was a
short term precaution to prevent social unrest, and would be reviewed at end 2009 to
gradually resume the use of the automatic price-transmission formula in 2010. In fact the
pump price of gasoline has increased, in three steps in 2010, by approximately 50
percent, and is believed to be in line with costs. Recently the government announced the
phasing out of the diesel subsidy, which is likely to pressure inflation even more than the
increases in price of gasoline since diesel is the base of transportation of goods and
energy for some sectors such as fishery and agriculture.

25.     The announcement of price increases for bread, water and electricity
sparked in the first week of September a wave of popular protests in Mozambique
resulting in life losses and hundreds injured. Inflation in general and not only the
recent announced increase in prices of water, electricity and bread, played a major role in
recent events as it has been eroding purchasing power of the population. Additionally,
high poverty levels and unemployment especially among the urban youth has had an
important role in the recent events.

                        C. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 2010-2012

26.     The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is positive. Real GDP growth is
expected to reach 6.5 percent in 2010 and increase back to the 7-8 percent range by 2011
and beyond (Table 2). The sixth review of the PSI program concluded in June 2010 that
the prospects for 2010-2012 remained favorable, including for continuous growth, single
digit inflation, and the maintenance of a sustainable external and fiscal situation, as the
government is committed to take the necessary fiscal measures and pursue a monetary
program consistent with single-digit inflation. The government intends to continue to
strengthen public financial management and public debt management, foster private
sector development, and move forward the public sector reform. The macroeconomic
framework is adequate for the purpose of the proposed operation.

27.    The Balance of Payments (BoP) is projected to gradually improve over the
next few years, as exports recover, foreign direct investment expands, and foreign
borrowing by the government increases. Export receipts are expected to increase by
about 30 percent (USD1 billion) over the next three years, reflecting a recovery in




                                          - 13 -
aluminum exports. 13 In 2010, strong import demand (especially capital good) will delay
the narrowing of the trade deficit to subsequent years. Foreign direct investment and
foreign borrowing, including non-concessional resources, are anticipated to increase by
USD600 million over the next few years while foreign grants increase moderately by
about USD 200 million and projected dividend payments by megaprojects increase by
about USD350 million over the next two years.

28.    On the fiscal side, total expenditures are expected to increase rapidly, as the
government embarks in expanding infrastructure investments. As Table 4 shows,
from 2009 to 2012, total revenues are anticipated to increase at approximately 0.5 percent
of GDP per year while grants decline marginally by 0.3 percent of GDP. Total
expenditures are estimated to rise by 2.3 percent of GDP with current expenditures
remaining just below 18 percent, whereas capital expenditures increase by 1.5 percent of
GDP, in line with the government strategy to expand infrastructure investments.

29.     The Central Bank plans to continue tightening monetary policy to keep
inflation under control, while limiting the adverse impact on credit to the economy.
Specifically, the monetary framework makes room for broad money to expand at around
20 percent per year, allowing for private sector credit growth of around 15 percent over
the next few years. The CB expects average 2010 inflation to be around 9.5 percent
before stabilizing around the 5-6 percent range in subsequent years.

30.    Looking at the medium term, the authorities wish to further accelerate the
country's economic development, while reshaping its patterns to benefit larger
segments of the population. The Government of Mozambique understands the benefits
of a solid underlying macroeconomic framework and has been implementing an active
program of structural reforms. Following the recent social unrest and the results from the
Third Poverty Assessment Report, the government has indicated the desire to design a
more inclusive, labor intensive, transformative growth agenda to accelerate poverty
reduction and to improve living standards of the population. Mega projects and improved
and expanded infrastructure alone will not achieve these objectives.

31.     There is momentum for continuing the reforms program and striving to
reach even higher growth rates as businesses' interest to expand and initiate
operations in Mozambique is clear. As articulated in the 2009 CEM, Mozambique has
a vast, diversified economic potential, including mining, energy, agribusiness, fishing,
forestry, tourism, light manufacturing, and transport and logistics services. 14 However,
there are many constraints that prevent a more dynamic business growth and employment
creation and the structure of the economy remains narrowly focused around subsistence


13
   International prices of most important commodities exported have increased significantly compared to
the average prices in 2009 (aluminum by 40 percent; cotton by 40 percent; natural gas by 6 percent;
although sugar and shrimps have decreased by 10 and 8 percent respectively).
14
   Mozambique has a largely untapped potential in electricity production and in mining in general. These
projects, although important for the country, create relatively few jobs. The government wants to maximize
the economic, social and environmental benefits from these projects to be able to finance poverty reduction
programs and reduce aid-dependency.


                                                  - 14 -
agriculture and megaprojects. 15 The challenge for Mozambique is how to sustain high
growth and redesign its pattern to generate more employment. 16

32.     Mozambique's economic challenges and policy options were discussed in-
depth during a high-level conference organized jointly by the authorities, the Bank,
and the Fund, in March 2010.17 There was agreement that to sustain higher and more
inclusive growth, the government would need to encourage activity driven by the private
sector to expand and diversify the country's productive and export base. Various
strategies were discussed, including boosting public investment in infrastructure,
enhancing productivity in key sectors such as agriculture, creating a more enabling
business environment, developing key sectors in the economy, enhancing regional
integration, and better tapping Mozambique's comparative advantages.

33.     The authorities want to expand the transportation and electricity networks to
allow private sector activity to emerge. Mozambique's physical capital stock and
investment rates are very low. Scaling up investment in infrastructure could partially be
financed by nonconcessional external resources in case additional concessional funds and
higher revenue collections proved insufficient. This requires an investment strategy to
prioritize projects based on feasibility studies and cost-benefit analyses to ensure
adequate growth dividend and the ability to repay any additional borrowing. Crowding in
of private investment appears to be a promising venue to create jobs and reduce poverty.

34.     In order to maintain macroeconomic stability, it will be important to follow a
cautious approach in accessing external non-concessional borrowing. Bank and Fund
simulations carried out as part of the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) prepared in
2010 show that a permanent increase in public investment over the next two decades
financed exclusively at market terms, would noticeably worsen Mozambique's debt
indicators and impact macroeconomic stability. Hence, the authorities have agreed to
adopt a limited and time-bound scaling up of their investment. 18
15
   Major constraints include complex trade and tax regime; still inadequate and inefficient transport
logistics; lack of articulation, standards, and facilitated technology diffusion; rigidity in the land tenure
system; and shortage of skilled labor force. Over-regulation and arbitrary interpretation of rules add a
significant burden to business start-up and operation, particularly among foreign investors.
16
   The government has also to continue investing in health and education. While productivity might benefit
from greater efficiency in spending and improvements in the private sector's regulatory environment, it
can't happen without gains in labor productivity resulting from a healthier and more skilled labor force.
17
   It was attended by 140 participants, including current and former members of government, senior
managers of line ministries, and representatives of the private sector, academia, civil society, and
development partners. The conference's conclusions were presented by Bank and Fund staff in a special
meeting of the Council of Ministers. The last day of the conference was devoted to alternative borrowing
decisions at commercial terms. Bank and Fund experts explained the advantages and pitfalls of various
financing instruments, including sovereign bonds, (syndicated) loans, guarantees from IFIs, financing from
bilateral development banks, and Public-Private Partnerships (PPP). Presentations are available at:
http://www.worldbank.org/mozambique.
18
    The process for selecting the best set of projects is not yet well developed in Mozambique. Currently, the
line ministries carry most of the responsibility; the MPD has mainly a consultative role, while the MoF
often involved in the financing at a late stage. Large projects are handled on a case by case basis. An
assessment at an aggregate level of the portfolio of potential projects and a comparison of alternative sets of
projects within the portfolio seems to be lacking. Many projects in the pipeline lack an explicit cost benefit


                                                    - 15 -
35.     The new IMF PSI program embeds the expansion of the authorities' public
investment program over the next three years in a prudent macroeconomic policy
mix. The authorities committed to a policy stance that would keep the domestic primary
balance broadly stable during the program period and tighten monetary policy to ward off
inflationary pressures while supporting a continued financial deepening. Should the
investment program overextend the capacity of the economy, they stand ready to adjust
macroeconomic policies accordingly.

36.     In September 2006, the government formally adopted the Second Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PARPA II), a broad and ambitious agenda of reforms. PARPA
II, the operational plan for the governments' Five-Year Program 2005-2009, was
prepared by the government through broad-based consultations with major stakeholders
and civil society in a more participatory approach than PARPA I, involving four national
and ten provincial Development Observatories. 19 In 2008 the government announced the
extension of PARPA II to include 2010, strengthening sustainability and continuity with
the next strategic document. The PARPA II structure and priorities were discussed in the
Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) presented to the Board on December 19, 2006.




and financial analysis or the analysis is not presented in a way from which the impact on the repayment
capacity can be established. A joint mission Bank-Fund visited Maputo in June to provide technical
assistance in debt management strategy, debt sustainability analysis, project selection and debt market
development. On project selection the mission recommended to formalize both the process of generating a
project pipeline as well as sound project selection procedures within the portfolio of potential projects, and
to identify the functions of various Ministries involved need to perform in the process of project selection
and financing. As such it was suggested that the MoF gets a central role in the project prioritization, the
MPD gets a central role in ensuring an adequate pipeline, with an adequate choice of alternatives, and in
assessing the economic synergies across projects. The sector Ministries have the responsibilities of
identifying the cost of projects, their cost effectiveness in terms of alternatives within the sector, their
overall position within sectoral strategies, the social and environmental impact, and their execution and
implementation. Two protocols were recommended to address the project selection analysis. The first
protocol applies to publicly financed projects; while the second applies to other projects (e.g. PPPs and
megaprojects) where the government contributes by means of fiscal concessions. In the latter projects the
role of the MoF is more central given that these projects are often initiated by the private sector.
19
  Mozambique has established `Development Observatories' (DO) as a consultative forum for discussion
of poverty reduction issues, which includes representatives from government, civil society, and
international partners. The DO is tasked with collecting and analyzing data on poverty, and monitoring the
implementation of the PARPA. Provincial DOs are intended to facilitate dialogue and consultation at the
decentralized level.

                        Box 2: MOZAMBIQUE'S DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

     A DSA was carried out by the Bank and the Fund in 2010. Mozambique's nominal external public and
     publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt stock at end-2009 was US$3.5 billion (US$1.6 billion in Present Value ­
     PV - terms), around 29 percent of GDP (67 percent owed to multilateral and 33 percent to bilateral
     creditors). Mozambique received assistance in 2006 under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
     (MDRI), reducing debt stock by US$1.9 billion in nominal terms. The central government's domestic
     debt, low by regional standard, amounted to 3 percent of GDP at end-2009.
     Under the baseline scenario, all debt indicators remain well below their respective thresholds, including
     in the longer term. However, the debt indicators rise significantly towards their respective thresholds
     over the next five years, as the authorities make use of the already contracted Portuguese credit lines and
     step up their borrowing on nonconcessional terms. Mozambique's total public debt, as percentage of
     GDP, is expected to rise from 29 percent of at end-2009 to 48 percent in 2015 and then decline towards
     42 percent by 2030. The PV of public sector debt-to GDP ratio shows a similar pattern, as do the
     evolution of the PV of debt and of debt service relative to total revenues.




               III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM: PARPA II
37.    The PARPA II includes a strategic matrix of key indicators, a joint effort by
the government, donors and civil society. These indicators are integrated into and
monitored through the Economic and Social Plan (PES in Portuguese) and the BdPES
(Ex-post Assessment of Implementation of the PES), which is submitted annually to
Parliament. The monitoring of the PARPA II is open to participation from the public and
representatives of Civil Society Organizations, through the Development Observatories.

38.     While maintaining its commitment to improve quality and access to social
services, PARPA II recognizes that "rapid, sustainable and broad-based growth"
warrants more emphasis on the growth of the productive and private sectors. The
strategy envisages small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as the engine of employment
generation. Rural development has a central place in the strategy. An essential role is
attributed to districts as the focus of development. There is also a clear recognition of the
challenges related to HIV/AIDS, with a credible strategy for accelerating the national
response to the AIDS pandemic. The priority areas for public policy are arranged under
three pillars: 20 (i) governance; (ii) human capital; and (iii) economic development.

39.     The new government has recently finalized its Five-Year Program (2010-
2014), which sets out a broad and ambitious agenda of reforms, with a focus on
infrastructure investments. The government is now preparing the PARP III, which will
be the operational plan for the new Five-Year Program and should be finalized in the
Fall. The PARP III will effectively outline the detailed government program for the
period 2011-2014, which will be supported by the next PRSC series. The Bank and Fund
staff will prepare a Joint Staff Advisory Note on the PARP III once it has been finalized.


20
  Key reforms in public financial management were treated in the text of PARPA II partly under the pillar
of Governance, and partly under the pillar of Economic Development. The strategic matrix highlighted the
importance of these reforms by creating a fourth domain of Macroeconomic Management.

    IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
                 A. LINKS TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

40.     The PRSC series, closely aligned to the government program, is an important
component of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) approved by the Board in
2007. Bank support to the PARPA II is through the Mozambique FY08-11 CPS (Report
No. 39395-MZ). As government policies and budget are the main instruments for
implementing the PARPA, the Bank is committed to support and align with the
government's budget process. The indicative lending program of the CPS envisages
programmatic support through four consecutive PRSCs. The program supported by the
PRSC series recognizes the importance of strengthening economic governance systems,
and the centrality of the new growth agenda to accelerate private sector development,
reflected in the CPS. Specifically the PRSC series will support achievement of the
following CPS outcomes: (#1) improved budget planning at central, district and
municipal level; (#2) improved government fiduciary systems; (#10) simplify procedures
to start a business; (#11) increased access to finance and support for SMEs. The PRSC
series is also well aligned with the Bank's principles on conditionality, namely (i)
reinforce ownership; (ii) strengthen harmonization; (iii) customize program to country
circumstances; (iv) select only critical actions; and (v) ensure transparency and
predictability of process (Box 5).

41.     Strengthening governance is a key objective of the interventions supported
by the PRSC series. The PRSC series is contributing to this overarching objective
through several channels, including (i) strengthening the capacity, transparency, and
accountability of state institutions, by improving Public Finance Mangement (PFM)
systems both at the central level and at the local level; (ii) fostering a competitive and
responsible private sector through interventions to improve the business environment and
the investment climate; and (iii) contributing to strengthen overall accountability through
joint reviews that monitor progress in implementation of the PARPA II, including raising
the demand for better governance by supporting civil society participation in the joint
reviews, and through the activities associated with the Development Observatories.

42.     Development policy lending is complemented by investment support and
technical assistance. PRSC support continues to coexist with investment lending to
well-articulated sector programs, and with technical assistance to develop government
systems and capacities necessary for an increased reliance on them. IDA's investment
portfolio, with 20 projects, is diverse and supports the three pillars of the CPS. As of
February 2010, total IDA commitments were USD907 million, and the inclusion of two
regional projects brings the total to USD 983M. The share of policy-based lending in
overall IDA disbursements in FY04-07 was below 40 percent, and is projected to stay at
around 40 percent of annual commitments during the CPS FY08-11.

     B. HARMONIZATION WITH DONORS, IMPLEMENTATION OF PARIS DECLARATION
        AND ACCRA AGENDA FOR ACTION, AND COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF

43.      A new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in March 2009
between the government and 19 donors (G19) providing general budget support,
including the World Bank. This MoU builds on the earlier 2004 memorandum, which
constituted a breakthrough in donor harmonization in Mozambique. It is based on a set
of `fundamental principles': (i) predictability and alignment with domestic systems; (ii)
monitoring has to be done jointly and that all policy actions or expected outcomes in the
program have to be based on the common Performance Assessment Framework (PAF);
(iii) no separate reporting to the donors is required; and (iv) mutual accountability. See
www.pap.org.mz for details and a copy of the MoU.

44.      The Bank will continue to work with the other budget support partners to
simplify the coordination process, and enhance the quality of the Performance
Assessment Framework. The G19 system has brought substantial benefits in terms of
streamlining the donor dialogue with the government. However, there are aspects that
still can be improved. Firstly, the process to select and update the PAF indicators would
benefit from more flexibility especially to reflect changing conditions a for example
global crisis of 2008-2009, or new evolving government priorities. 21 Second, there could
be a better balance in the PAF between outcome indicators and policy reform actions.
The PAF is currently heavily skewed towards the former. 22 Thirdly, the G19
coordination process could benefit from streamlining.

45.    The donor harmonization system in Mozambique could be strengthened
further by consolidating the policy dialogue in a smaller number of working groups
which would lead to improved prioritization and efficiency. Implementation of the
PARPA is monitored through Sector Working Groups with indicators included in the
PAF assessed during the Annual Review in April. This work is complemented by the
`Planning Meetings' in September to agree on the indicators and triggers for the
following year. The sector working groups can be good vehicles for policy dialogue,
donor harmonization, and for reaching agreement between the government and all the
donors involved in a specific sector. Today this donor coordination system is organized
around 29 main sector working groups which involve government participation and 43
additional donor-only sub-groups. An unintended consequence of this large number of
groups is that the policy dialogue tends to be excessively fragmented, focusing too
21
   The G19 system works as follows: donors and government agree on a set of triggers for a specific year,
say 2010, in September of 2009. The performance of government is then reviewed in April of 2011, and
determines disbursements in year 2012. Hence, this system entails a 3-year lag between the time indicators
are set and their use for disbursement of budget support. As a result, the PAF may not be up to date and
may not reflect the rich policy reform program undertaken by the government. The government
implementation of the PARPA reform program is carried out and monitored through the annual instruments
of the Economic and Social Plan (Plano Económico e Social, PES) and the Ex-post Assessment of
Implementation of the PES (Balanço do PES), which are submitted annually to Parliament. These
instruments are much more flexible and reflect the emerging priorities and action of the government, but
are not used by G19 as the basis for adapting the PAF.
22
   This is a challenge for the preparation of PRSCs since Bank policy requires that development policy
lending operations should disburse against the completion of policy and institutional actions.


                                                 - 19 -
narrowly on specific issues discussed across a large number of different meetings. This
makes prioritization and dialogue difficult ­ while imposing a heavy burden on the time
commitments of all involved.

46.     Implementation of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action is
monitored by the G19, the UN agencies and other development partners. The big
challenges are to align project aid with the national budget system, integrate it as much as
possible with the government's treasury and reporting system, and reduce the number of
Project Implementation Units. There has been substantial progress to bring project aid
on-budget since 2007, and most of the externally financed projects are now on-budget.
As a result, the budget is increasingly becoming a meaningful instrument for decision-
making on resource allocation, and linking resources to results. The multi-currency
module to the Single Treasury Account (CUT) has been operational since 2007 and the
Government is actively encouraging donors to put all their projects on-CUT. In addition,
the public financial management reforms and procurement reforms supported by the G19
(and also by this PRSC series) are expected to facilitate increased use of country systems
by IDA and other development partners.

47.     The Bank and the IMF cooperate very closely within their respective
mandates in assisting the government to implement the PARPA. Mozambique has a
stable relationship with the IMF, anchored on a 3-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
approved in 2007 and a 1-year Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) approved in 2009. The
Bank actively participates in PSI and Article IV missions. The IMF leads the policy
dialogue on macroeconomic policy (including fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate
policies), the electronic integrated financial management system (e-SISTAFE) and tax
and customs reforms. The Bank leads the policy dialogue on public expenditure
management, sector structural reforms, reforms of the civil service, and poverty and
social impact analysis. Areas of close collaboration include banking supervision,
financial sector, trade, the PARPA, external debt sustainability, and maximising the
benefits from megaprojects and the use of natural resources. The practice of holding
joint IMF-IDA missions has had synergistic benefits, and has reduced the burden on
government of multiple missions. As of March 2009, the IMF has become an ex-officio
member of the G19, and intends to continue the practice to set the timing of its missions
such as to be synchronized with the joint reviews of the G19.

    Box 3:ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THIS PRSC AND G OOD P RACTICE ON C ONDITIONALITY

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The proposed operation supports the implementation of Mozambique's PARPA II and the Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the government and the G19. The previous PRSC series have been
successfully deployed between 2001 and 2008 and overall progress of the reforms has been satisfactory.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
Progress on the reforms is monitored with the aid of the PAF. Improved service delivery in PARPA priority
sectors is monitored through Sector Working Groups, a mechanism for policy dialogue, donor
harmonization, and for reaching agreement between the government and donors involved in a specific
sector. A budget working group meets on a quarterly basis with the government to monitor budget
execution, particularly in the priority sectors.

Principle 3: Customize accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The PRSCs 6 and 7 focused on main constraints such as public financial management and the operation of
the financial sector. The series then evolves to support improvements in the business environment and
shared growth, incorporating triggers related to regulatory reforms and land taxation reforms in PRSC-8.
The Bank carries out all supervision jointly with the other donors, including the `Joint Review' in April to
assess progress of indicators defined in the PAF, resulting in disbursement commitments for the following
year. The `Planning Meetings' in September formalize the agreement on the performance indicators and
targets for the following year. PRSC support coexists with a well-articulated investment program, and with
technical assistance to develop government systems and capacities necessary for an increased reliance on
them.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
As agreed with the development partners and the government, and in line with the Bank move towards
increased harmonization, starting with the previous PRSC series the Bank shifted to use triggers selected
from the common PAF used by all G19 partners. The PRSC prior actions are indicators in the PAF selected
for their criticality in achieving objectives which are consistent with the government's own monitoring
framework and in line with donor harmonization for general budget support.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
The Bank's supervision of the PRSC series is aligned with the supervision of the joint General Budget
Support program of the G19. Both the April Joint Review and the September `Planning Meetings' are a
multi-sector exercises, and Bank staff participates in all relevant sectors. Disbursements are contingent on
satisfactory progress towards a subset of the PARPA's medium-term objectives as set out in the PAF
matrix. In addition, the review process is explicitly designed to allow announcing budget financing amount
early in the year in the budget preparation cycle and to disburse early in the budget year, a principle to
which the Bank adheres.




                                                     - 21 -
 V. THE PROPOSED POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

48.     The proposed PRSC-7 is the second operation in a series of three annual
operations supporting the implementation of the PARPA II. The design and
objectives of the PRSC series were elaborated in the Program Document for the PRSC-6,
and only a brief summary of key aspects is provided in this document.

49.    The PRSC series is harmonized with the joint donor (G19) mechanism for
the provision of general budget support. All the proposed prior actions and triggers for
this PRSC series are drawn from the joint PAF and/or the `Political and Economic
Governance Reforms Matrix' agreed by the government and G19 in March, 2010 (see
Annexes 3 and 4), remaining consistent with the government's own monitoring
framework.

50.     The demand for labor in Mozambique is extremely limited, justifying the
very selective approach of the PRSC, at least initially, on reforms and activities
aimed in removing barriers to private investment and job creation. As business
environment conditions improve and more jobs are created, more efforts will be required
in the Human Development area to improve labor force qualification. That does not
imply that the policy dialogue should not continue in these areas as, for example,
improving access to higher quality education, improving health conditions of agriculture
workers through reduction of malaria incidence and rates of HIV infection. The first
priority, however, is to improve conditions for job creation, and, as jobs are created, the
emphasis would also include improvements of skills and labor force qualification.

51.    The PRSC series supports objectives from the PARPA II results matrix. As
intermediate outcomes the PRSC series supports improvements in:

    (i)     Macroeconomic management: To consolidate and deepen institutional
            reforms to improve the use of public resources through better budget
            formulation, stronger public financial management systems, stronger
            oversight, and civil service wage and pension reform.

    (ii)    Economic development: To continue to support broad-based growth by
            reducing the excessive regulation constraining business activities, improving
            the information basis for access to credit, simplifying the regulatory
            environment for business development and promoting more efficient use and
            better access to land, and strengthening the legal and institutional framework
            for concessions, public private partnerships, and large investment projects,
            including in the exploitation of natural resources.




                                          - 22 -
52.     The PRSC-7 supports specific ongoing reforms which are part of the above
program. The PRSC-7 supports reforms to improve macroeconomic management by
expanding the use of direct budget execution through the e-SISTAFE, increasing the
coverage of internal control, and increasing the coverage and efficiency of external audit.
In terms of economic development, the PRSC-7 supports the government's efforts: to
improve the business climate for the operation of the private sector by introducing
measures to simplify import and exports procedures; to reduce speculation in
undeveloped land by adjusting land tax to account for inflation in the past years; to
achieve membership of the EITI initiative; and to make mandatory the use of
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in large and medium firms.

53.    The program supported by the PRSC series has been extensively discussed
with major stakeholders and civil society. The program of reforms supported by the
PRSC has been fully discussed with Civil Society Organizations since its triggers are
from PARPA-II, which was prepared through broad based consultations with CSOs.
Similarly, the monitoring of the implementation is open to participation from the public
and representatives of Civil Society Organizations, through the work of the Development
Observatories and their participation in the two annual G19 reviews. 23

54.     The policy matrix and results framework for the PRSC series in Annex 2
presents the specific areas supported by the PRSC series. The prior actions have been
selected following two broad principles: (i) The trigger entails a policy or institutional
reform which is critical to remove a key constraint to poverty reduction and growth
(based on the findings of existing analytical work), or is an implementation activity of a
reform initiated earlier; (ii) The trigger is part of the Performance Assessment Framework
(PAF) or the `Political and Economic Governance Reforms Matrix'.

55.     The program supported by the PRSC series has been informed by a
significant amount of analytical work completed over the past few years. A summary
of the main analytical studies which have informed the design of the PRSC series was
discussed in the PRSC-6 document. 24 The policies and reforms supported by the PRSC
focus on the challenges to sustained growth and poverty reduction in Mozambique which
have been identified in the studies.




23
   In addition, the World Bank also carried out two discussion sessions with CSOs in March and September
2009 to discuss the preparation and focus on the new PRSC series, in the context of the G19 system.

              VI. THE REFORM PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY
                         THIS PRSC SERIES
56.      This section highlights the recent progress and future challenges in the
reform areas supported by the PRSC series, with a focus on the proposed prior actions
for PRSC-7, and indicative triggers for PRSC-8. The PRSC-7 prior actions include
triggers as set out in the PRSC-6 document and a new set of prior actions resulting from
proactive discussions between the Bank's team with donors and government. The result
is a more dynamic PRSC series, which expands the coverage of important areas of the
government reform program. The Bank will continue to actively work to ensure that the
critical measures that the government plans to undertake to boost economic growth are
reflected in the PAF indicators for future years. 25 The Program Document, however,
already provides a description of the main measures which have already been taken by
government to boost economic growth. The implementation of the overall program
supported by the PRSC series continues to be satisfactory.

                               A. MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT

57.    Mozambique's good macroeconomic performance contributed to the excellent
growth record in the past decade. Moving ahead there is a need to continue to
consolidate macroeconomic stability, strengthen public financial management, and
improve the allocation and efficiency in the use of public resources. Without
improvements in these areas, the country's economic growth rate and potential poverty
reduction will be jeopardized.

Improve the budget process and the use of public resources

58.     The objective of these reforms is to strengthen the allocation of public funds
through the budget preparation and execution process. The reforms have introduced the
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as an important framework for medium
term financial planning and resource allocations, and the government is now in the
process of adopting a programmatic budget classification to allow better links between
PARPA, MTEF, and budget allocations, and reestablish the importance of the MTEF as a
strategic planning instrument.



25
  The government is currently preparing the new PARP III, with a new strategic monitoring matrix from
which the future PAF (and PRSC) triggers are likely to be drawn. The G19 have started a discussion to
improve the next PAF, recognizing that different donor agencies use the PAF for different purposes (e.g.
monitoring progress versus policy dialogue), and that it will be necessary to strike a balance. The
government has indicated that it welcomes changes in the structure of the PAF. The Bank's team has been
actively participating in the discussions. Notably, the new PAF should aim to include some of the following
features: (i) enable systematic monitoring of results over time when possible; (ii) strive for an appropriate
mix of results-based and policy-related indicators; (iii) allow inclusion of emerging concerns over time
which address impediments for poverty reduction, growth and development; (iv) if needed, allow selection
of (policy) indicators outside of the PARP; (iv) keep a close link and relation between GBS to Sector
results and sector assessment, but not necessarily by overlapping indicators in the PAF; (v) only include
`SMART' indicators possible to measure in an objective way.


                                                   - 24 -
59.    The government goal has been to strengthen the MTEF to use it as the basis
for the sectoral budget allocations, and support programmatic implementation of
PARPA II. The quality of the MTEF has improved since the 2007-09 MTEF went to
Cabinet approval for the first time. 26 However, there are still a number of weaknesses
associated with this instrument, as reflected in the relevant PEFA (Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability indicator). 27 There is also a significant gap between the
scope and quality of data in the MTEF pertaining to the domestic versus the external
component of the budget. 28




26
   Another format of MTEF had been used as an internal planning document since 2001.
27
   Score of C+ for PI-12 ( multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting),
including a D on the dimension related to linkages between investment budget and forward expenditure
estimates.
28
   This matters a great deal for the strategic impact of the budget, because in Mozambique, the actual
composition of spending differs significantly from budget allocations (over 5 percent variance in excess of
aggregate deviations for two out of the three years under review in the PEFA, justifying a C on indicator
PI-2), and most of this variance can be attributed to the external component of the budget. Therefore, in
order to increase the likelihood that the budget as a whole contributes to the PARPA objectives, it would be
important to focus on the appropriation and execution of the external component of the budget as well.

60.     The government is working to improve various aspects of the MTEF and the
budget preparation and execution. The quality of MTEF and budget submissions by
sector ministries has been uneven and, in most cases, they are not the result of costing
and prioritization of programs/activities. 29 In 2009, the program budget pilot was
extended to the full budget, and the MTEF and budget are now presented using a
programmatic format, although they essentially remain prepared and expressed according
to line items, using the traditional classifications. 30 The Budget Division is now focusing
on improving the quality of MTEF through a process of costing and prioritization of
programs/activities at the sectoral level.

61.     The government has also been working to improve the quality of the external
component, making a substantial effort to bring all aid on budget. While projections
on common funds and direct budget support have been fairly accurate, the same does not
apply to projects and vertical funds. The government has established and is making use of
the ODAMoz database (http:\\www.odamoz.org.mz). The quality and realism of the
information in ODAMoz needs to be improved to raise the usefulness of the budget and
the MTEF as planning instruments. 31 In addition, several donors have started to channel
their project funds through the CUT, and the World Bank is at the forefront of this
process, with all new projects going through the CUT. To help bringing more donor
projects on-CUT in the medium to longer term, in 2009 the government prepared an on-
CUT guide, with information on classification and reports.

62.    Going forward, there is a need to further refine and consolidate the
programmatic approach pursued by the authorities. The Bank team, in collaboration
with the IMF and other budget support partners, is providing technical assistance to
support the government efforts towards gradually introducing a form of program
budgeting which can be suitable for Mozambique. A joint Bank-DFID-EU mission
worked with the government in July 2010 on several aspects of program budgeting,
including the costs and benefits of such reform, in order to inform a political decision on
the way forward. 32

29
   Mozambican legislation only envisages the use of economic classifiers in budget preparation and
execution reporting. Programmatic classifiers for line ministries are already available within e-SISTAFE,
but these are currently severely under-utilized.
30
   The weaknesses with the classifiers experienced during the pilot phase (large portion of expenditures was
classified under the category "other expenditures") continues to be a challenge in the implementation of the
program budgeting strategy.
31
   The ODAMoz constitutes an important information source on commitment and disbursement in the
external component of the budget. A challenge in recent years has been to ensure that all donors provide
information to the ODAMoz. Related to quality of data, based on a simple analysis of the under-disbursed
projects in past years, the government and donors are working to develop specific criteria for including
projects in the budget.
32
   The mission found that there is strong interest and demand for building on existing steps to introduce
program budgets in Mozambique, at the political level in Government and Parliament as well as at
managerial and technical levels in central ministries (like Finance and Planning) and in some line
ministries. However, there are still many obstacles in the path of program budgeting reform, including
general limits to capacity, deficient information of the kind required for effective program-type reform and
considerable communication problems between key players in Mozambique's Public Financial
Management. These challenges need to be balanced against the opportunity that the reform provides to

63.     The advent of the financial crisis in 2009 complicated the planning process in
Mozambique. The 2010-12 MTEF was prepared in mid-2009 at a time when government
prudently estimated a substantial fiscal contraction as a result of the global crisis.
However, the budget was only submitted to Parliament in early 2010, by which time it
had become clear that Mozambique was not significantly affected by the financial crisis
and could count on additional fiscal resources. Hence, there were wide differences
between the envelopes envisaged in the first year of the MTEF and the 2010 budget that
was approved by Parliament eight months later, resulting in the drop of the related
indicative trigger as prior action for PRSC-7.

Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public financial management

64.     The objective of this set of reforms is to implement the policies and procedures
embedded in the SISTAFE PFM reform law, resulting in sounder budgeting practices,
tighter internal controls, more efficient cash management, more accurate accounting and
reporting and auditing compliant with international standards. During the past PRSC
series, the government launched the integrated electronic financial management system
(e-SISTAFE) on a pilot basis, and progressively rolled it out to all ministries at central
and provincial level, and to a large number of autonomous agencies. This PRSC series
supports increasing the utilization of e-SISTAFE to manage Mozambique's public
finances, paving the way for substantial improvements in accountability, transparency,
and efficiency.

65.    The government has embarked on a sequenced program of reform, and
Public Financial Management (PFM) systems have shown major improvements in
recent years. Mozambique is one of the few countries with two successive good quality
PEFA assessments. As highlighted in Figure 3, payroll, procurement and internal

address some long-standing issues in the strategic allocation of expenditures, the relationships between
planning and budgeting and the value-for-money of public spending. Thus, there is clearly a trade-off
between the breadth of the reform, i.e. how many sectors are involved, and its depth, i.e. how effectively it
goes deeper into the appropriation, execution, reporting, monitoring, and oversight of all categories of
expenditure in addition to introducing new budget classifiers. The authorities agree that they need to
carefully consider how to strike the right balance between the two dimensions, and have proposed to
address this issue by analyzing the following three scenarios: (i) A baseline scenario, in which program
budgeting would not be scaled-up, but MPD and the Ministry of Finance would work together on resolving
issues with the strategic allocation of resources (setting sector ceilings based on better defined priorities and
procedures and using them for the annual budget), make better use of the existing functional classification
and improve budget execution; (ii) An intermediate scenario, where program budgeting would be deepened
throughout the budget cycle, from appropriations to execution, reporting, joint monitoring of financial and
physical results, internal and external oversight, but only in a very limited number of sectors (between one
and three, to be chosen between health, education, public works, justice and agriculture);and (iii) An
ambitious scenario, where program budgeting would be deepened throughout the budget cycle for a greater
number of sectors (between four and 10). The Government of Mozambique intends to flesh out these
scenarios in terms of the financial, human and technical resources they would require, as well as in terms of
their timelines. The costs and benefits of each scenario will then be compared to inform the political
decision by the Cabinet needed to move forward.

controls, cash management, revenue collection and management and donor practices
showed most progress followed by credibility of the budget and external oversight, and a
slight deterioration on reporting due to the lack of a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey
(PETS) in the last three years. This overall assessment was confirmed by the fiscal
transparency ROSC conducted in 2007 by the IMF.

66.     To guide the next phase of the reforms, the Ministry of Finance has prepared
a medium-term Vision Paper for Public Financial Management reforms, to be
submitted for approval by the Council of Ministers in 2010. 33 The vision paper aims
to provide a prioritized series of short and medium-term activities, as well as long term
structural reforms, in order to sustain the progress made and to consolidate and deepen
the improvements in public finance management system.

67.     The cornerstone of the authorities' action plan to strengthen Public Financial
Management is the consolidation and expansion of the integrated electronic
financial management system (e-SISTAFE). Following an initial pilot in 2005 (prior
action for PRSC-3), the full version of the Direct Budget Execution Module was finalized
and rolled out to all ministries at the central and provincial levels by end-2007, and to the
31 districts which had the prerequisite infrastructure (PRSC-4 and PRSC-5 prior
actions). 34 The roll-out was accompanied by an extensive training program, involving
1850 users, who have acquired good operational skills and are now able to formulate
requests for additional functionality.

68.    The government has started working on complementary reforms designed to
make full use of the benefits that the e-SISTAFE can deliver. Direct budget execution
improves substantially Public Finance Management. 35 The implementation of e-
SISTAFE in all Ministries at central and provincial level has allowed the transition from
the previous system of advance payments towards a modern system of direct budget

33 The vision paper builds on the main results and recommendations of the 2008 PEFA assessment, as well
as the 2007 ROSC on fiscal transparency, and the 2008 Country procurement Assessment Review (CPAR).
It was also informed by the findings of the March 2009 IMF mission on progress with PFM reforms (in
which the Bank also participated) and the G19 PFM Quality Assurance Group mission in March 2009. The
draft PFM vision paper was discussed with donors in July 2009, and the Bank provided technical assistance
to finalize the vision paper.
34
   By early 2008, e-SISTAFE had been rolled-out to: all 25 Ministries and 7 State Organs (out of a total of
32), a total of 544 Budget Execution Units across the country and it was also rolled out to 31 districts.
Additional roll-out as of end-December 2009 led to the inclusion of a total of 50 districts and 29
autonomous institutions at central level.
35
   From September 2007 direct budget execution became obligatory for all State institutions with access to
e-SISTAFE. Direct budget execution involves three steps: the commitment of the expenditure, its
`liquidation' when resources are assigned for payment and the actual payment, when funds are transferred
directly from the Single Treasury Account (CUT) to the bank account of the supplier. When it is adequately
implemented, the direct budget execution modality ensures that the steps are authorized within e-SISTAFE
by three different agents in charge of budget execution (initiates the commitment and liquidation process),
internal control (verifies compliance of the process and supporting documentation with rules and
regulations), and financial execution (authorizes payment at the end of the process). The segregation of
duties between the agents is embedded in the design of e-SISTAFE, as the three user profiles are mutually
incompatible. The direct budget execution modality should also ensure that budget commitments remain
within their respective ceilings, as the system blocks excessive commitments.


                                                  - 31 -
execution. Budget units started to make their payments directly by bank transfer from the
Single Treasury Account at the end of 2007. One year later, over 90 percent of goods and
services and investments transactions of budget execution units were carried out live
through e-SISTAFE (prior action for PRSC-6). The expansion of direct execution is
bringing significant benefits in terms of improved information on public spending and
build-up of arrears, predictability in the availability of funds for expenditures and
commitments by budget holders, and in internal control and transparency.

69.      The e-SISTAFE has increased budget credibility with the reduction of the
deviation in the actual expenditure out-turns compared to the budget (PEFA
indicator PI-1). The difference between the primary expenditure out-turns compared to
the originally budgeted (i.e. excluding debt service charges and externally financed
project expenditure) 36 reduced in recent years (5.2 percent in 2004, 8.0 percent in 2005,
2.4 percent in 2006, 3.0 percent in 2007, and 1.8 percent in 2008), and the distribution of
the budget execution throughout the year has become smother, thereby avoiding the risk
that a large share of the budget is spent in a hurry and therefore has a lower impact.

70.     A second area of improvement has been in the stock and monitoring of
expenditure payment arrears (PEFA indicator PI-4). 37 Using e-SISTAFE, all
commitments, expenditures due for payment resulting from the commitments made up
until the end of the fiscal year and all uncleared advances are recorded by the system of
registering and accounting for expenditures, allowing to know precisely the value of
unpaid expenditure commitments. Further, the way the system is conceived it does not
permit the accumulation of expenditure arrears. 38

71.     A third area of progress relates to the ability of the authorities to obtain
reliable, timely and relevant data on budget execution. The response to the food and
fuel prices crisis provides an illustration of this. The authorities, by a careful analysis of
the data provided by e-SISTAFE, were able to identify USD46 million in savings through
reduced domestic and international travel. This example highlights the potential for
efficiency savings and creation of fiscal space associated with a more systematic
analytical use of the data produced by e-SISTAFE.

72.     A fourth area of improvement relates to the accuracy and quality of the
information in in-year budget-reports. With the live execution in e-SISTAFE,
transactions are now recorded in real time instead of at the time of replenishment of the
advance as was previously the case, resulting in more up-to-date and accurate spending
data. This is reflected in an improvement in the accuracy and quality of the information
in in-year budget-reports (PEFA indicator PI-23 raised from C to B).

36
   It is important to distinguish between expenditures funded by domestic sources and expenditures funded
by Overseas Development Assistance (ODA), since the government has less (if any) control over the timing
of ODA disbursements.
37
   The score against this indicator increased from a "D+" to a "B+" during 2004 and 2006.
38
   The system temporarily suspends or blocks the access of budget execution units with uncleared
commitments, requiring the intervention of a second (more senior) authorized expenditure agent to
undertake the cancellation (in the event that they are found to be erroneous), so as to close the expenditure
process opened by the original agent.


                                                   - 32 -
73.     A fifth area of significant improvement relates to the predictability in the
availability of funds for commitment of expenditures by budget holders (PEFA
indicator PI-16 increased from a "D+" in 2006 to a "C+" in 2008). Predictability in
resource flows is fundamental for budget holders to plan and execute expenditures. A
quarterly system of programming expenditure commitments through the e-SISTAFE
system was introduced in 2006 and since then, budget holders have enhanced the use of
this tool. The increased use of direct execution modalities (rather than execution through
funds advances) has also facilitated good cash flow management by the Treasury
Directorate (DNT).

74.     A sixth area of improvement is in internal controls and reduced risk of
diversion of funds. The direct execution modality also results in the suppression of a
number of commercial bank accounts that were previously used to hold cash advances.
This greatly reduces the risk of misappropriation of funds, and streamlines internal
control procedures by avoiding the need for bank reconciliations to be performed in the
field.




                                                                             - 34 -
75.     The paper-based culture limits the effectiveness of the e-SISTAFE system.
There is evidence that the execution of goods and services often undergoes a dual
process, partly manual and partly automated. Commitments are often entered on the basis
of paper processes and paper accounting books and only after goods or services are
delivered and an invoice is received, the budget execution agent enters the commitment,
liquidate the amount due and request the funds for payment in e- SISTAFE. Expenditure
could in theory be committed over and above the corresponding appropriations. To tackle
this problem internal audit is reviewing a sample of direct execution processes to verify
the effective use of the system. In addition they plan to monitor this phenomenon over
time and identify areas (sectors and geographic location) where the problem is most
prevalent in order to focus efforts to resolve the problem.

76.     Mozambique's fiduciary accountability has improved significantly in recent
years, but challenges remain. The 2008 PEFA report lists remaining weaknesses and
challenges such as the monitoring of aggregate fiscal risk, and the scope of follow-up
actions of external scrutiny and auditing.

77.     The government has started working on the second generation of reforms,
including the integration of the management of payroll and revenue collection in the
e-SISTAFE. Until 2008, the payment of salaries and pensions was executed centrally by
the accounting department of the Ministry of Finance. However, by the end of 2009, there
were 83 state institutions using the direct budget execution module for salary payments
via e-SISTAFE. 39 The government objective is for all salaries (and pensions) to be paid
via e-SISTAFE, which will require the development of an integrated electronic payroll
management system (called e-Folha), to calculate salary entitlements and issue payment
requests automatically. The development of this module has begun in 2009, but is yet to
be finalized. The government is consolidating the use of direct execution of goods and
services and investments transactions of budget execution units through e-SISTAFE.

     PRSC-7 Prior Action: The Government has, through the Ministry of Finance,
     ensured that during FY 2009: (i) 90 percent of the total value of budgetary
     expenditures for goods, services, and investments for the Budget Execution Units
     (Unidades Gestoras Executoras) with access to the integrated electronic financial
     management system(e-SISTAFE), has been incurred through e-SISTAFE under
     Direct Budget Execution; and (ii) at least 10 percent of said Budget Execution
     Units total wage bill has been incurred under Direct Budget Execution.




39
  Mozambique has three different public sector payroll systems serving the Southern, Northern, and
Central zones, respectively. Since April 2008, salaries for 27 institutions, served by the payroll system for
the South Zone, have been paid through e SISTAFE, and a further 59 institutions were included by June
2009. Management of the public sector payroll systems for the other two zones (Central Zone and North
Zone) is not located in Maputo, which prevents the integration with the e-SISTAFE.

Make the State procurement system for goods and services transparent and efficient

78.     Over the past few years the government approved and introduced a new
procurement system that generally meets international standards of efficiency and
accountability: new legislation approved in 2005; creation and operationalization of a
new central procurement institution (UFSA) in 2006 and 2007, and establishment of a
monitoring system. In 2010 a new Procurement Decree has been approved, building on
the experience of the reforms over the past five years. Overall, UFSA has succeeded as
the central public procurement authority through capacity-building programs and
disseminating of bidding documents and manuals. Additionally, UFSA has established a
website that provides information on the legal and regulatory framework, bidding
documents, invitations to bid, and selected statistics on public procurement. This PRSC
series supports the strengthening of the monitoring system to increase transparency and
to measure the effectiveness of the reforms.

79.     Substantial progress was achieved in 2006 and 2007 in the implementation of
the procurement reforms. Most of the activities envisaged as part of second phase of
implementation of the procurement reforms have been completed (PRSC-4 prior action):
Mozambique counts with a modern legal and regulatory framework, generally aligned
with international good practice; there are a manual and a set of (nine) standard bidding
documents and contracts based on international standards; the UFSA was established and
staffed, and became operational in 2006 (PRSC-3 prior action); a director, staff and
consultants have been appointed, and a website is also operational (at
http://www.concursospublicos.gov.mz); and a first set of 472 Units for Execution and
Management of Acquisitions (UGEAs) was established as of end-2007. These reforms
were accompanied by a comprehensive process of capacity building and around 1860
technicians have been trained at central, provincial, district and local municipality levels.
As a result of these reforms, Mozambique has moved into a system based on open
competition as the default setting, transparent and objective evaluation and qualification
criteria are being created, and public advertising is now mandatory. Reflecting these
improvements, development partners increasingly rely on Mozambique's systems for
National Competitive Bidding, with fewer exceptions to the national regulations, and
move to organically integrated project implementation units.

80.     The government and donors carried out an evaluation of the national
procurement systems in February 2008 based on the OECD (Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development)/DAC (Development Assistance
Committee) methodology. This exercise served as the basis for the preparation of a
Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) in late 2008, which gives
recommendations on priorities in future procurement reforms. A summary of the main
findings and recommendations of the CPAR was provided in the PRSC-6 Program
Document. Figure 4 provides a summary chart of progress in procurement reforms over
the past 6 years, using the OECD/DAC methodology.

81.     There are additional areas where more progress is needed. The CPAR update
finds a need for a more robust management information system since there is no system
in place yet to ensure that all UGEAs systematically report procurement information. The

government is working to develop a simple but strengthened M&E system, with a web
interface to allow UFSA to collect data directly from UGEAs through an electronic
submission system, and track the procurement performance of main ministries (proposed
trigger for PRSC-8). The CPAR also highlighted the need for an effective complaint
mechanism to disclose abuse of the systems and allow for effective remedies while
maintaining the efficiency of the process. The CPAR recommends the adoption of a more
strategic/sustainable approach to capacity building including (i) the development of a
strategic plan at national and subnational level to train UGEAs and private sector on
implementing the Procurement legislation; and (ii) the development of a specific
professional career and certification procedure within the public service for procurement
specialists.

82.     Mozambique's public procurement system has improved consistently in the
years. As of end-2008, UFSA had carried out 138 supervision missions and trained 1860
technicians. A total of 779 enterprises providers have been registered in the Single
Registry, and a total of 950 UGEAs units for decentralized procurement have now been
established. The government has started the development of a monitoring system as
UGEAs are mandated to report procurement-related information such as invitations for
public bidding, direct contracting, and justification and information on complaints.
Available data suggest a rapid increase in the use of competitive procurement systems: 71
percent of contracts were carried out through open bidding in 2006, 85 percent in 2007,



                                                 - 37 -
and 88 percent in 2008 (PRSC-5 and PRSC-6 Prior Action). In the short term, the
government will continue to expand the operation of the procurement system.

83.     Competitive bidding has become the default choice of procurement while use
single sourcing has become the exception. The new Procurement Decree and its
dissemination activities clearly emphasizes the exceptional nature of the use of single
sourcing, and limits its scope by articulating the necessary conditions for the use of this
procurement modality. Training on the new decree has started recently for all Permanent
Secretaries and Provincial Directors.

84.     The UFSA has improved substantially the monitoring efforts and data
collection on public procurement in 2009. In fact, the records of both the number and
value of public procurement processes has more than doubled compared to those
recorded in 2008. It is very likely that many of the procurement processes not reported in
the past may have been carried out using single sourcing procedures resulting in biased
indicators with higher percentage of contracts using competitive biddings than they
would be under more complete data reporting. This improvement in data collection is, at
least, partially responsible to the apparent drop in the share of contracts subject to public
tender, from 88 percent in 2008 to 82 percent in 2009 resulting in the drop of the
indicative triggers as prior action for the PRSC-7.

Increase coverage and efficiency of internal audit bodies

85.    The objective of these reforms is to increase efficiency and accountability by
strengthening the internal audit institution (IGF) and its capacity to conduct audits.
Although financial accountability environment in Mozambique is improving, internal
controls, internal audit and external oversight have been identified as weak spots in the
system. This PRSC series support reforms in internal audit and controls to improve both
the coverage and the quality of the internal control system.

86.     The internal audit institution (IGF) has been substantially strengthened in
recent years and follow up of audit recommendations is being monitored.
Mozambique received a B rating on effectiveness of Internal Audit (PI-21) in the 2008
PEFA as the country has an established institutional set-up for internal audit. The General
Finance Inspectorate (IGF) is in charge of overall coordination of all internal oversight
bodies and it has finalized the basic internal auditing manual. In 2006 the government
recruited 54 new technicians, thus improving the inspection capacity for the coming
years. In 2007, the Government reviewed follow-ups on 200 of the most relevant
recommendations by the IGF included in previous audit reports, and found that
approximately 70 percent of these recommendations had been adopted.

87.    The roll-out of internal oversight bodies increased coverage of internal
control, but did not adequately address the quality aspect of internal audit and
control. The objective of transforming IGF and other internal audit bodies into entities
following international Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) standards features in the
government's PFM vision for 2020. However there are strong discrepancies among



                                           - 38 -
internal audit bodies. For example, IGF has drafted an audit manual that is consistent
with good practices, and is starting to implement risk-based audit techniques; although
less progress has been achieved by sectoral internal oversight bodies, which have not
really started to focus on risk-based auditing. The Bank has been supporting the
Government to provide training on the application of a risk-based audit approach and
advising on necessary tools and institutional IA reforms, including a forum for high-level
managers focused on benefits of risk-based auditing and an interactive training course
with audit staff. This will be accompanied by a pilot risk-based audit in three ministries
or departments to apply the new techniques learned by staff and an assessment of the
lessons learned from this pilot.

88.     The number of audits completed by the IGF almost doubled in relation to
2005 and IGF carried out almost all planned audit activities. Audits have been carried
out in 32 percent of all districts and municipalities (PRSC-4 prior action). As of end-
2007, approximately 25 percent of central and provincial level bodies had operational
internal audit units (also referred to as `internal control units') compared to none in 2006
(PRSC-5 Prior Action). By end-2009 there were 26 units of internal control (OCI) in
operation at central level and 36 OCI at provincial level. The government aims to reach
100 percent by end-2010 (proposed PRSC-8 trigger). More recently, the government has
accelerated the full implementation of the Subsystem for Internal Control (SCI),
including the institutionalization of the Internal Control Organs (Órgãos de Controlo
Interno, OCI) in State bodies.

PRSC-7 Prior Action: The Government has established internal control units in
at least 75 percent of its central and provincial level agencies, namely, the
ministries, provincial directorates and autonomous units.


Increase coverage and efficiency of external audit bodies

89.     The objective of these reforms is to increase efficiency and accountability by
strengthening the external audit institution (Tribunal Administrativo, TA). In order to
achieve this objective, this PRSC series supports increased capacity of the TA to conduct
audits and expand audit coverage.

90.     There has been some improvement in the external scrutiny and external
audit function in recent years. The performance of the TA has been improving, and it
is now increasingly respected as an independent and professional watchdog of public
financial management. The TA is involved in a process of continuous improvement with
the technical assistance of AFROSAI-e and other Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) and
the support of a multi-partner common fund. The 2008 PEFA report indicated
improvements on the timeliness of submission of the audit reports to the legislature (PI-
27 raised from C to B), while rates were unchanged for the scope and nature of audits
performed (D) and for the follow-up on audit recommendations (C).

91.     The Report and Opinion on the Annual State Accounts is completed within
the terms stipulated by law and is available on-line. The Report and Opinion on the
Annual State Accounts, including full information on revenue, expenditure, financial
assets and liabilities, at all level of government, is submitted to the Parliament within the
term stipulated by law. 40 A comparison of the most recent audit opinions (2005 to 2008)
with the earlier ones shows a significant improvement in the comprehensiveness and
quality of the analysis, partly due to improvements in the quality of the Conta Geral do
Estado (CGE) itself but also reflects a strengthening of the capabilities of the TA.

92.     Substantial progress has been made over the past few years in improving the
capacity and performance of audit activities. To inform the preparation of the audit of
the Annual State Accounts, the TA has increased substantially the number of verification
audits of the accounts of various public institutions at central and decentralized levels.

93.     The response to the audit findings remains limited. The Mozambican system
empowers the TA to impose fines or to recommend corrective actions as a result of its
audits. In practice, however, the follow up is largely limited to future audits by IGF and
by TA specifically to verify the implementation of such recommendations. In terms of
the audit of the CGE, it is the Parliamentary Committee on Finance and Planning that
recommends follow-up measures and a report on their implementation is included in the
TA's audit report for the following year's CGE. There is thus a formal response and
follow-up to the TA's report and opinion on the CGE. Going forward, the TA needs to
ensure a more in-depth follow-up of audit findings, including detailed statistics on rates
of implementation of the TA's previous recommendations.

94.     Significant additional challenges remain in improving the functioning of
external audit. A growing discrepancy has appeared between the number of audit
reports concluded and the corresponding number of judgments issued, resulting in an
average above 500 days between the initiation of an audit and the issuance of the final
judgment. This discrepancy greatly reduces the accountability of managers of the entities
audited and the impact of the TA's work. Improvements require a careful analysis of the
business processes involved in these timelines and an increase in the number of financial
judges (a recent law has doubled their number to 6 from the initial 3). It is also important
for the TA to use the mechanisms at its disposal to impose sanctions and, when
necessary, to forward to the prosecuting authority those processes that contain indications

40
  Since 2004 the Annual State Accounts has been audited each year by the TA and a report is submitted to
the National Assembly within 6 months of receipt of the financial statement (CGE) from the executive,
totaling 11 months after the end of the corresponding fiscal year, which is compliant with Mozambican
legislation (Article 50, Law 9/2002). This performance is very good in the African context. Following
approval by Parliament, the Annual State Accounts and the relevant audit report by the Supreme Audit
Institution are made available at the following internet address:
http://www.sislog.com/ta/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=5 At present, this website makes available the
reports and opinions from 2003 to 2008.


                                                 - 40 -
of crimes committed. Although some actions are taken as a result of external audits, there
is no systematic follow-up on the implementation of recommendations.

95.     There is a need to improve capacity of TA's staff. While the TA is interested in
moving toward risk-based approach in selecting institutions to be audited and the size of
the verification sample in each given institution, at present the TA's auditors lack
familiarity with risk-based audit techniques. Further, staffs are not qualified as chartered
accountants or accounting technicians, and as a result the TA's financial audits are not
conducted in compliance with international standards on auditing. The TA is working
with development partners to create the capacity necessary to provide its auditors with
international technical and professional qualifications. In particular, the Bank has
recently approved an IDF grant in support of the training and certification to international
standards of the TA's auditors.

96.     The scope of verification audits by the TA remains limited. Building on the
recent progress, in line with the findings of the PEFA assessment, the TA has shifted the
focus from the number to the share of the State Budget covered by the verification audits.
The coverage of the audits of the State Budget has expanded from 26 percent in 2007 to
30 percent in 2008 (PRSC-6 prior action).

  PRSC-7 Prior Action: The Government has, through its Court of Accounts,
  expanded audit coverage of the State Budget from 30 percent in FY 2008 to at
  least 35 percent in FY 2009, according to INTOSAI technical standards and
  according to the laws of the Republic of Mozambique.

Improve human resources management in the public sector

97.     The objective of these reforms is to improve the management of the payroll and
civil service human resources. Under the past PRSC series the government has carried
out a full census of the civil service, integrated payroll management within e-SISTAFE,
and created a single registry of State officials and civil servants (CAF), contributing to
the management of the civil service human resources, and improving the management
and transparency of salary payments. Building on this basis, under this PRSC series, the
government has started a comprehensive review of civil service wages and pensions
system, which will contribute to reshape and improve the quality of the civil service.

98.     There has been important progress in the area of civil service reforms. The
government created the Ministry of Civil Service (MCS) in 2007, responsible for the
policies related to the management of the human resources in the public sector, control
and inspection of the public service, organization of the public administration, as well as
the program of reforms of the public sector. The MCS carried out a detailed census of
civil servants in 2007 (PRSC-4 prior action) resulting in the creation of the CAF (PRSC-5
prior action); an integrated database that allows strategic management of human




                                           - 41 -
resources, including the payroll. 41 As a result, the government is now able, in real time, to
tell how many civil servants there are, by grade and region, and ministry.

99.      More recently the government has started to focus on the reform of the
public sector wages and pensions. Following the Census of Civil Servants, a new
medium term salary policy was approved by the Council of Ministers in 2008 (prior
action for PRSC-6). The guiding principles of the new policy are: (i) to simplify and
rationalize the salary scales across ministries, and to increase transparency and fairness,
integrating the remunerative allowances (notably the `subsidio tecnico') into the base
salary; (ii) to decompress the salary scales to improve the remuneration based on
qualifications, competence, responsibility and experience; (iii) to reform the system of
locality subsidies and develop a new housing policy to incentivize staff mobility and
attract personnel to the local level; and, (iv) to harmonize the salary policy with the
pensions system and ensure the existence of a pension system to facilitate the retention of
personnel and provide an adequate living standard for pensioners.

100. The government has immediately started the implementation of the new
wage policy with a salary decompression in 2009, which is consistent with medium-
term fiscal sustainability. While fiscal sustainability is one of the tenets underpinning
the new wage policy, the government recognizes that there may be risks associated with a
salary decompression, especially at a time of fiscal constraint. To ensure fiscal
sustainability the government indicated a ceiling for the cost of the wage bill as a share of
GDP. However, a detailed cost estimate of the implementation of new pay policy over
the next few years remains to be prepared. The government has started diagnostic work
to prepare a pensions reform, which is expected to be approved in 2010 (proposed trigger
for PRSC-8).

                                 B. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

101. Accelerating shared growth requires improvements in the climate for private
sector development, adequate infrastructure, improved smallholder productivity, and
tackling key challenges such as the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the need to
improve significantly the management of natural resources. This PRSC series focuses on
removing constraints to private sector development, by introducing reforms to deepen the
financial sector and improve access to credit, improving the operation of the land law to
facilitate access to land, and simplifying the excessive regulation constraining business
development.

Improve access to credit for private firms

102. Limited access to credit is a key constraint to business development in
Mozambique. This PRSC series focuses on reducing information constraints for
41
  The government is in process to move towards a fully computerized Human Resources system including
payroll. Such a system would involve several components: (i) the e-CAF; (ii) a human resources
management system (called e-SIP), which is in process of being developed; (iii) payroll system for
calculating salary entitlements and issuing payment requests (called e-folha), which remains to be
developed; and, (iv) a facility for making salary payments, which already exists within e-SISTAFE.


                                               - 42 -
commercial banks by supporting improvements in accounting and reporting standards
through the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the
corporate sector. Improving access to credit will also require additional measures to:
improve the level of competition in the banking sector, diversify the financial services and
products, strengthen the judicial system, enable the pledging of assets, introduce a credit
registry, and strengthen the capacity of SMEs in financial reporting.

103. The 2009 Investment Climate Assessment highlighted that access to finance is
one of the top two constraints to private sector growth. Access to finance was the
second most often cited obstacle to business operations by Mozambican firms and is
confirmed as a important constraint through empirical analysis linking the access to
finance indicators to firm-level productivity in Mozambique. 42 The empirical analysis of
the ICA, taking into consideration demand factors, found that more than two-thirds of the
sample was credit constrained. The 2009 ICA and 2009 FSAP pinpoint a number of
reasons that hold back progress in financial intermediation, including: (i) limited
competition in the banking sector; (ii) lack of basic infrastructure; (iii) unaffordable or
irrelevant financial products; (iv) weak legal and regulatory framework, and (v)
information constraints.

104. Building the capacity of the professional accountancy body will also
contribute to the enhancement of the quality of corporate financial reporting. At
present, all the corporate entities in Mozambique, including investments with foreign
participation, are affected by a serious shortage of qualified accountants and trained
accounting technicians. SMEs are especially affected. The recently concluded
Accounting and Audit ROSC highlights the need to build capacity for the newly
established professional accountancy body (Order of Professional Accountants of
Mozambique), allowing it to function as a modern professional accountancy body,
including launching of a professional qualification examination in Mozambique.

105. To address the `information constraints', there is a need to improve financial
reporting for the private sector. According to commercial banks the absence of reliable
financial statements in the private sector is a major constraint for them to provide credit
to a large number of firms. Banks and financial institutions are compelled to rely on
collateral even when reliable financial statements might have otherwise facilitated cash-
flow based lending. The government prepared in 2008 an action plan for the introduction
of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the corporate sector (Prior
Action for PRSC-6). The required legislation adjusting the Tax Code to be consistent
with the adoption of the IFRS was approved by Parliament in 2009 and the new Plan of
Accounts was approved by Cabinet in the same year. Preparations for implementing
IFRS are extensive and complex. It usually takes companies at least 12 months to
prepare. Given the technical knowledge demanded by IFRS and the limited capacity of
the accounting and audit profession in the country, implementation of the IFRS in the
corporate sector should be dedicated to hands-on training in the first year for the
companies involved. The starting date for the IFRS implementation for small firms is

expected to be after the implementation for medium and large companies as additional
time will be required in adapting the IFRS to suit the reality of small firms. Additionally,
given the additional costs involved, small firms will be required to adopt a less than full
specific IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. 43

 PRSC-7 Prior Action: The Government has, through its Council of Ministers,
 approved the mandatory implementation of international financial reporting
 standards (IFRS) in: (i) large private enterprises (consisting of more than 500
 employees) starting in FY 2010; and (ii) medium private enterprises (consisting
 of 250 to 500 employees) starting in FY 2011.


Strengthen the social security system

106. The objective of these reforms is to ensure the financial sustainability of the social
security system and to adopt the best practices and transparency in the management of
the social security funds, contributing to the deepening of the financial sector in
Mozambique. In recent years the government commissioned an actuarial study and an
investment strategy for the National Institute for Social Security (INSS). The results of
the study highlighted severe shortcomings in the financial and monitoring data available
at the INSS as well as the need for significant reform in the management of INSS and the
social security funds, which the government is in the process of addressing. This PRSC
series therefore supports the reform process at the INSS.

107. The government has undertaken a broad program to strengthen the social
security system in Mozambique. A new Law on Social Security was approved by
Parliament in 2007, but its implementation is facing difficulties, and there are serious
shortcomings in the operation and governance of the sector. There are significant data
gaps at the INSS and the current institutional capacity of the INSS is weak. Records for
the entire system are still manual, although efforts to introduce an IT system are
underway. In addition, until last year, the INSS had not published its financial statements
since 2004. During 2009 substantial progress has been made in this regard, and the
financial accounts for 2005, 2006, and 2007 have now been published, and publication of
the accounts for 2008 and 2009 are expected in 2010. This progress is very important for
the transparency of the institution but also because the lack of reliable financial
statements has precluded an accurate assessment of the financial situation of INSS, and
prevented the full determination of potentially significant fiscal and private liabilities.

108. A comprehensive, structured set of interventions was urgently needed to
improve the situation at the INSS, the backbone of the pension system. Important
priorities were: to introduce an IT system and to create an electronic database of all

43
  Though implementation of IFRS will no doubt facilitate the movement away from collateral-based, and
towards cash-flow based, lending, this is unlikely to be a sufficient measure to achieve this outcome.
Additional measures will no doubt be required, possibly including passage of legislation to enable the
pledging of assets, introduction of a credit registry, and strengthening of the capacity of SMEs in financial
reporting, among other steps, all of which will take time and commitment to implement.

pensioners and contributors (proposed trigger for PRSC-8), to improve administration, to
establish the value of the investment portfolio, and prepare and publish financial
statements. In late 2009 work started with technical assistance from Brazil and,
currently, the INSS has completed a revision of its investment portfolio; an Actuarial
Study and a draft of an Investment Strategy have been developed by a consulting firm,
currently under review by the INSS. Concurrently, steps should be taken to improve
registration of contributors and claimants and strengthen collection of contributions with
cooperation with the tax administration. Once the financial situation of INSS is clarified,
a new accurate actuarial study should be carried out to determining whether parametric
changes to contributions or benefits are required for the long-term viability of the system.
Last but not least, INSS should be subject to independent supervision, and once an
investment strategy is in place, INSS should consider outsourcing its investment
management.

109. The government is also preparing a reform to regulate the private pension
funds, to complement the reform of the Social Security System. There has been good
progress in reviewing the Insurance Legislation and developing the regulations for
pension funds. The Insurance Contract Law was approved by Cabinet and Parliament
approval is expected to take place in 2010. The Decrees on Supplementary Pension Funds
regulations, the Ministerial Diploma on Investment Policy and the Ministerial Diploma
on Chart of Account for supplementary pension funds have been approved by the Cabinet
in 2009. However, the amendments to Insurance Act have not been presented yet to
Cabinet and the enactment by Parliament is expected to occur in 2011 only. The
proposed new regulations state that pension funds can only be managed by authorized
companies operating on the life insurance market and selected on the basis of standard
financial criteria such as minimum capital requirements and solvency ratios. The
government should consider measures to stimulate the development of supplementary
private pension funds.

Improving the operation of the land law and facilitating access to land

110. Mozambique's overall land-related policy and legal framework is sound. There
are, however, some gaps in the implementation of relevant laws and regulations such as
lack of clarity, limited capacity and unclear institutional arrangements as well as low
land tax and associated distorted incentives for land access. These implementation gaps
result in unfavorable consequences such as land speculative activities, ineffective land
use planning; associated difficulties of dealing with large numbers of application for
concessions, and emerging inconsistency between land policies and other initiatives.
Given the overall soundness of the policy and legal framework, the focus of the reforms
supported in this PRSC series is to improve implementation instead of revising laws and
regulations.

111. The acquisition of land lease (administered by the State) has been identified
as a major obstacle to business development, in various enterprise surveys conducted
by the World Bank as well as in sector-specific studies undertaken for the 2009 CEM.
Besides the sheer complexity of navigating through the allocation system of land use



                                           - 45 -
rights (DUAT), investors carries cost of capital while waiting for the necessary approvals
constitutes a constraint to invest in Mozambique. The urban land system is also not
geared to absorb large influxes of rural labor migrating to urban industrial areas. Coastal
land with high potential for organized tourism development remains undeveloped, yet
only about an estimated 10 percent of the coastal areas are available for additional lease.

112. To improve the implementation of the existing land law, the 2009 CEM
recommended that the government should: (a) take measures to facilitate a better
understanding, better dissemination, and more capacity building for improved
implementation of the Land Law; (b) undertake systematic delimitation of all local
community lands in rural areas, starting with priority areas with relatively high land use
value; (c) disseminate, simplify, and further improve guidelines for consultations with
communities; (d) systematically adjudicate and title urban, peri-urban, and high use value
plots in rural areas; (e) enforce collection of existing land tax, raise the rates without
affecting smallholder rural producers, and decentralize collection to the district level; and
(f) conduct comprehensive rural zoning/land use planning for supporting informed
decisions and exploiting Mozambique's development potential.

113. Government is taking steps to achieve better consensus about the
interpretation of the law and implementation issues. For example, the October 2007
revised Article 35 of Land Law suggests that Communities are now subject to the same 3-
tier approval system of development plans as investors. However, the Constitution and
the Land Law clearly state they already have those land use rights and can ask for
formalizing if they wish. There is therefore a need to increase clarity on the
interpretation of the land law. In order to achieve better consensus, with support by the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the government plans to have a National
Land Policy Forum in 2010 involving all stakeholders in a forward-looking policy
dialogue regarding the implementation of the land law.

114. There is a need to take steps to discourage land hoarding and to promote
efficient land use. Concerns about speculative acquisition of large amounts of land led
Mozambique to adopt a regulatory framework that links award of DUATs to specific
conditions on land use and revokes such rights in case the conditions are not honored.
International experiences show that such an approach is administratively difficult and
costly to implement and susceptible to discretion that can undermine investor confidence
and security of land rights. Increasing rural land taxes (possibly differentiated by land
quality/zoning) will be a more incentive-compatible way of encouraging efficient land
use. There is a need to enforce collection of existing land tax, raise the rates, and
decentralize collection to the district level. Rates should be designed to exempt small
land holders and communities and should be adjusted regularly according to inflation. In
addition it is desirable that a share of the tax revenues should remain with the local
authorities or district, which would also incentivize collection.

115. Similarly, urban land is a very valuable asset, but currently only fixtures are
taxed and land itself is exempted. This poses a problem for both idle land and small
constructions located in large plots, missing an opportunity to use land more efficiently;



                                           - 46 -
improving the economic use of land; and increasing revenue yield. Merely improving the
collection rate on issued DUATs is likely to lead to voluntarily return of land to the State.
Enforcing a simple land tax could be the most efficient way to reduce speculation in
undeveloped land, clarify ownership of the land use rights, and make productive land
available to investors.

116. The government has started a process to review land taxes. The Council of
Ministers, in September 2008, gave a mandate to the Ministry of Agriculture to explore a
possible reform of the land taxation system. Once a clear data-base of DUATs is
available, it will be possible to empirically explore the revenue potential of a specific
reform of the land taxation system, as well as implications of measures to facilitate the
transferability of land use rights and to empirically explore the implications of adjusting
the rates to better reflect the economic potential of land use in different areas to
incentivize use of the land, while protecting smallholders. 44 This could then result in the
approval by the Council of Ministers of a reform of the land taxation system (proposed
trigger for PRSC-8) to improve the efficiency of the land markets. A first action has been
taken to adjust tax rates to account for inflation for the first time since 1998.


     PRSC-7 Prior Action: The Government has, through its Minister of Agriculture,
     issued a decree to update tax rates for the use of land to account for inflation.


Improving the business environment by simplifying the regulatory framework

117. A main challenge for Mozambique is to sustain high economic growth and
reshape its pattern to generate more employment by exploiting its vast, diversified export
potential by addressing a number of constraints, including macro environment, factor
markets, trade logistics, institutions supporting exports, and professional services. This
PRSC series focuses on one important aspect of the business environment, namely the
excessive regulatory framework.

118. Facilitating firms to take advantage of existing export opportunities will also
lead to increases in productivity and investment. The ICA 2009 presents estimates of
productivity and wage exporter premiums for (i) Mozambique and its comparator
countries, (ii) the subsample of African countries, and (iii) Mozambique alone, finding
exporters perform "better." 45 In fact, exporters in Mozambique have a labor productivity
that is 135 percent higher than nonexporters, when measured as sales per worker, and 145
percent higher when measured as value added per worker. Using TFP, Mozambican
exporters are 85 percent more productive than nonexporters, and wages paid are also 67
percent higher for exporters. This difference in performance between exporters and

44
   This preparatory work for the reform of land taxation would also allow an analysis of the possible
implications of measures to facilitate the transferability of land use rights.
45
   Research on the relationship between exports and firm growth has firmly established that the two are
highly positively correlated, while the direction of causality between them remains less certain. Some
studies point to evidence that exporting exposes firms to knowledge and competition that pressures them to
become more productive.


                                                  - 47 -
nonexporters seems to be larger in Mozambique than in other comparator countries: the
coefficients for both sets of pooled countries are smaller than for the regression with
Mozambique alone. 46

119. The overall regulatory framework in Mozambique is very unfriendly to small
and medium enterprises: licensing, inspections, red tape are a heavy burden. All the
sectors analyzed in the 2009 CEM have the perception that rather than facilitating and
regulating economic activities, the government has a "control and punish mentality".
Under such a setting, the risk is high for civil servants to cloud efficient decisions by
embarking on rent-seeking behavior.

120. The government wants to accelerate progress in removing red tape, and
simplifying the business environment. Mozambican firms are currently subject to
excessive operational licensing, inspections (labor, health, environment), and red tape. A
new strategy to improve the business climate was approved in 2008, but its
implementation has been slow. For instance, while Mozambique has set the goal to be
best among SADC countries in the Doing Business Indicators by 2015, it actually
dropped one position in the ranking amongst SADC members from 2007 to 2010,
indicating that other countries have improved their business environment faster than
Mozambique. Box 6 shows a series of "Quick Business Reform Areas" identified in
2009, which could be fast tracked. The government has made good progress in
implementing these measures and has approved four of the five reforms originally
planned for 2009.

121.     There is growing consensus in Mozambique that it is time to consider bolder
and more aggressive reforms to reduce the burden of unnecessary regulation. The
government started a comprehensive regulatory reform in 2010, focusing on business-
related licenses and regulations (indicative trigger for PRSC-8). The goal of regulatory
reforms is to reduce the political and administrative costs by eliminating large numbers of
unneeded rules.

122. Authorities have taken actions as part of the reform push. The Council of
Ministers approved the 2009 decree on unified inspections for business activities, paving
the way for the establishment of a new unified inspection agency (for all inspections
except tax and labor inspections). In addition, a new bankruptcy law has been submitted
to Parliament and is expected to be approved in 2010, which will provide a clear and
simplified legal framework for bankruptcy proceedings, helping towards their faster
resolution. 47 This will improve access to credit since delays in bankruptcy proceedings


46
   If we take the hypothesis that more productive firms self-select into exporting, these results may suggest
that costs, taken broadly to mean barriers to reaching foreign markets, may be much higher in Mozambique
than in the other countries. Only highly productive enterprises may be able to overcome these barriers. If
we take the opposite hypothesis, of learning by exporting, these results show the potential benefits that an
export-driven strategy can bring to the Mozambican economy.
47
   Although important, the establishment of a new unified inspection agency and the preparation of the new
bankruptcy law are not prior actions since they are not included either in the PAF or `on the Political and
Economic Governance Reforms Matrix.'


                                                   - 48 -
are one of the constraint in this area. 48 Judicial administrative reform to improve the
functioning of courts and the services courts provide is needed to successfully implement
this type of law. Additionally, since judges currently lack familiarity with bankruptcy
proceedings, creating specialized courts can improve judges' expertise in this area and
improve efficiency.

     · Submit legislation to simplify property registration and transfer fees.
 Dealing with Licenses
     · Submit legislation to simplify business-related licenses, and eliminate unnecessary licenses.



123. There is a need to reduce barriers for exports and imports. As mentioned
before, Mozambique ranking in the 2010 Trade Logistics Performance Index is 136th out
of 155 countries, including a 145th place for "Efficiency of the customs clearance
process". The government has introduced several administrative improvements, leading
to reductions in the average time for import operations to 30 days and 23 days for export
operations in 2009. A pilot of a simplified import / export procedures with approximately
30 "trustworthy traders" is scheduled to start in 2010, based on which a decree would be
prepared for approval in 2011.

   PRSC-7 Prior Action: The Government has, through its Council of Ministers,
   issued a decree regulating complete pre-arrival clearance of goods and creating
48 the figure of the reliable and trustworthy customs agents.
   It takes 5 years on average to solve a bankruptcy case through the court in Mozambique.

Maximizing the benefits from megaprojects, concessions, and Public-Private
Partnership (PPPs)

124. Mozambique has gained strong reputation as investor friendly, and S&P and
Fitch have given a stable outlook on their B+ credit ratings. The country has huge
potential wealth in mineral and other natural resources. Increasing investor interest is
translating in multi-billion dollar investments, and with major investments planned over
the next few years, and the possibility of the discovery of oil, it is likely that these will
start to generate significant revenue streams. This has the potential, over time, to
transform the economy of Mozambique and generate the resources necessary for the
eradication of poverty and ending the country's dependence on foreign aid. International
experience shows that maximizing the benefits and ensuring they are spread as widely as
possible will not happen automatically; it will require good governance of the economy
and a careful balance between maintaining the reputation as investor-friendly destination
with maximizing domestic fiscal, ownership, employment, social and environmental
benefits of mega-projects. This PRSC series supports the government's effort to achieve
membership of the EITI initiative and to strengthen the legal framework for PPPs and
concessions.

125. There has been good progress towards improving the management of natural
resources, notably by strengthening the fiscal regimes for mining and petroleum, and the
decision to apply for membership of the EITI. However, limited transparency and
possible conflict of interest are emerging as important issues related to access to
resources and participation in mega-projects and other large investments. Ensuring
transparent access to economic opportunities and a consistent and predictable application
of legislative/fiscal frameworks will be critical to enhancing domestic and international
confidence and maintaining high levels of investment. There is also a need to improve
the government's planning and negotiating capacity to assess proposed large investment
projects, and to improve the management of concessions and regulations of key sectors,
such as electricity, mining, forestry, biofuels, transport and telecommunications.

126. Mozambique lacks a comprehensive framework law for mega-projects,
concessions and PPPs to provide guidelines for project selection and risk allocation.
To maximize benefits from mega-projects, concessions and PPPs, in the medium term the
Government will need to focus on: (i) improving the legislation for concessions to ensure
that competitive processes are used to identify project developers offering the best deal
for the country; (ii) revising the process of negotiation and approval of megaprojects to
maximizing fiscal benefits for the country; (iii) establishing clear steps / institutions for
negotiating with companies seeking concessions / benefits for large investment projects;
and (iv) establishment of independent authorities for regulating/managing concessions
and PPPs. The government is finalizing the proposal of two new laws, one on PPPs and
another one on concessions (indicative trigger for PRSC-8). A Bank's expert on PPPs has


                                           - 50 -
been supporting the government to improve the quality of the proposed laws providing
them with best international practices in these areas. 49

127. Mozambique has so far avoided the resource curse, reflecting `enclave
nature' of existing megaprojects. Recent studies have found that abundance of natural
resource can have strong negative impact on growth, but more likely in countries with
bad governance. In 2008 the government announced its intention to adhere to the EITI
and Mozambique was admitted as a candidate country in May 2009. The government
started to secure funding for the EITI secretariat (by allocating funds from the 2010 State
budget for the EITI, and also applying for support to the World Bank administered Multi
Donor Trust Fund and AfDB). In order to meet the membership criteria Mozambique will
have to produce its first EITI report by May 2011.


     PRSC-7 Prior Actions: The Government has, through its Ministry of Natural
     Resources: (i) appointed to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
     (EITI) a permanent national coordinator; (ii) adequately staffed its EITI
     secretariat; and (iii) held the first meeting of the EITI multi-stakeholders.



                      VII. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
128. Implementation procedures for the PRSC-7 (in terms of monitoring and
evaluation, fiduciary aspects, and auditing; as well as environmental, poverty and
social aspects) remain the same as for PRSC-6. Reference is made to the PRSC-6
Program Document for all implementation, monitoring and supervision arrangements
(Republic of Mozambique, Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit, Report No. 50921-
MZ, approved November 12, 2009). Only risks (and mitigating measures) to the reform
program are detailed below.

                               A. MONITORING AND SUPERVISION

129. The Bank's supervision of the PRSCs is aligned with the supervision of the
joint General Budget Support program of the G19. In order to reduce the transaction
costs for the government, the Bank carries out all supervision jointly with the other G19
donors. In addition to the two joint annual reviews, the supervision of the PRSC is done
on a continuous basis in harmonization with the other general budget support donors,
through the monthly joint government-donor steering committee meetings. Progress in
each sector is monitored by joint government-donor sector working groups. Bank staff
actively participates in these meetings through its staff in the field offices and

49
  The government has incorporated most comments provided by the Bank's expert. The expert's
assessment of the current draft of the law is very positive as it incorporates many international best
practices and addresses concerns related to benefit and risk sharing under different PPP modalities. The
Bank will continue to support the government in the next steps of implementation of the law as well as in
the establishment and structuring of a new government unit to manage and coordinate PPPs and
Concessions.


                                                  - 51 -
Washington D.C. (through missions or by videoconference). Furthermore, the Bank
participates in joint IMF-Bank missions to monitor progress in the macroeconomic
framework. Monitoring of the PARPA II in the various sectoral working groups is
carried out on the basis of the `Strategic Matrix' prepared in early 2006 and included in
the PARPA II document. Implementation of sector specific matrices is expected to be
carried out by line ministries and sector agencies, while the overall poverty monitoring is
the responsibility of the National Statistics Institute (INE). In 2008 the government
announced that it would extend the PARPA II by one year to include 2010, thereby
strengthening sustainability and continuity with the next strategic document (to be
prepared in 2010).

130. In addition, an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant was approved in
2009 to assist the government in strengthening the overall monitoring and
evaluation framework for the upcoming PARPA III. The objective of the IDF grant is
to strengthen the government's capacity to coordinate the overall M&E framework for
the upcoming third Poverty Reduction Strategy and, particularly, to strengthen the results
orientation at sector level. The Ministry of Planning and Development commissioned a
study by the consulting company USEC in 2008 on the planning cycle and monitoring
and evaluation systems and practices to get a deeper understanding of issues underlying
the impediments of a functioning national M&E system. Activities under this grant will
pick up the analysis of the USEC study and target specific areas. The work would focus
on: (i) improving the results orientation at sector level by strengthening the logical
linkage between different levels of results and relating them to budget and policy actions
as well as provincial plans; and (ii) improving the linkage between M&E and planning,
by strengthening the coordination mechanism and production cycle of the annual PARPA
progress report.

                                 B. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

131. Fiduciary aspects and strengthening of the government's own systems are
key in this operation. As indicated in the PRSC-6 document, the public financial
management system is considered reasonably adequate to support the PRSC series.
Weaknesses are found in internal control systems, the limited coverage of the external
audit, and the high-level of off-budget spending from external project finance. An action
plan on PFM reforms (discussed above), focusing on comprehensiveness and financial
accountability system is being implemented. The PRSC series supports implementation
of key reforms in the action plan, in close coordination with the IMF program. Public
financial management has been improving steadily in line with government commitment
to reform, and the dialogue between the government and the donors has been
constructive. In this context, it is worth noting that the Bank is moving towards
increasing the use of country's financial management system in Mozambique, on the
basis of an assessment that was made in early 2008.

132. The IMF concluded a safeguards assessment of the Mozambique Central
Bank in early 2008, which confirmed that the Mozambique Central Bank's control,
accounting, reporting, and auditing systems are adequate and aligned with
international standards. The assessment made recommendations to further strengthen


                                          - 52 -
the governance structure of Mozambique Central Bank, notably by opening the Central
Board and the Audit Board to independent experts from outside the Central Bank and
Ministry of Finance. It also recommended that the Audit Board should also ensure more
systematic follow-up of audit recommendations and the audit charter be subject of an
external quality assurance review (peer review) in accordance with international
standards. The authorities are in the process of implementing the action plan that was
drawn-up as a result of the safeguards assessment. In the context of the IMF Policy
Support Instrument program, the government has agreed to follow up on the
recommendations of the Safeguards Assessment, and committed to implementing a series
of measure identified as part of the assessment.

                                C. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

133. Disbursement and auditing procedures remain the same as indicated for
PRSC-6. The proposed credit will be disbursed following standard IDA disbursement
procedures. The credit will be disbursed as a single tranche after effectiveness and upon
submission of withdrawal applications from the Ministry of Planning and Development.
IDA will deposit the funds in a dedicated foreign exchange account of the Bank of
Mozambique in Frankfurt. It is the same account which is used by other GBS donors to
transfer their GBS contributions, as specified in the MoU. The funds will not be used for
Excluded Expenditures in accordance with the Credit Agreements. Within two working
days, the Bank of Mozambique will credit the Metical equivalent of the credit funds to
the Transit Account of the Ministry of Finance dedicated to GBS funds. The Metical
equivalent funds will be transferred from the dedicated GBS Transit Account to the
Central Treasury Account in accordance with the treasury plan and will be used as State
budget revenue and recorded in the State accounts as such. Auditing procedures are the
same as defined in Section 9 of the MOU signed in March 2009. A legally registered,
private and independent audit company meeting international standards on auditing and
qualifications of the auditors assigned will perform the annual audit, and in accordance
with the Terms of Reference contained in Annex 8 to the MOU. 50 The audit costs will be
met by government. The annual audit report and the management letter together with
Management response will be submitted annually to government as well as to GBS
donors, including the Bank no later than three months after the year end.

                                   D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

134. The legal framework for the environment is relatively well developed in
Mozambique, but capacity to implement and enforce it remains limited. The
framework for environmental management in Mozambique is defined by the Law of the
Environment (Law n° 20/97), which applies to all public and private activities that may
influence environmental aspects. All activities that may result in a significant effect on
the environment are subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment, which has to
precede any issuing of licenses and investment activity. The Ministry for the Co-

50
  It should be clarified that OP 8.60 does not require such an audit. However, the audit is required as part
of the G19 harmonized institutional arrangements for the provision of budget support, and is included in the
MOU which the World Bank has signed.

ordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA) is the main entity responsible for
conducting Environmental Impact Assessments. The capacity of MICOA, however, is
limited due to financial and technical capacity constraints.

135. The Bank team is working to assess the capacity of the government to carry
out Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA). Starting in FY09 the Bank team has started a Technical Assistance
activity to help the government to develop and implement appropriate policies in the
areas of natural resources, environment and adaptation to climate change. In this context,
the Bank is financing a stocktaking of mega-projects that will map forthcoming
investments and policy reforms with potential negative environmental effects, propose a
typology of possible environmental issues linked to these investments and related policy
reforms. The stocktaking will also identify the future needs for Mozambique in terms of
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment
(SEA), the two tools that are needed to put in place mitigation measures to address
potential adverse environmental effects related to physical investment or policy reforms
in a given sector. The activity is closely coordinated with MICOA and the G19 partners,
in the context of the five joint environment working group.

136. The reforms supported in this PRSC series are not likely to have significant
positive or negative effects on the environment, forest and other natural resources.
The PRSC series supports policy actions that create the enabling environment to support
poverty reduction, and which by themselves do not have effects on the environment. It is
expected, however, that regular private and public investment activities which may result
from such policy actions, could have effects on the environment. For instance increased
land taxation is expected to promote more intensive use of the land currently lying idle.
Environmental aspects of the reform of land taxation will have to be considered during
the preparation of the reform. While the implementation of the reform of land taxation is
expected to lead to an increase in land use, nevertheless it is not expected that there will
be need to introduce special measures since all activities to be carried out on the land are
subject to the Mozambican legal framework for the protection of the environment. As
discussed above the Bank is working to help the government to develop and implement
appropriate policies in the areas of natural resources, environment and adaptation to
climate change. Thus, neither specific environmental studies nor environmental impact
management measures are anticipated for this measure. This also includes the potential
effects from increasing exports ­ which may include mining, energy and forestry.
Increasing exports of any of these sectors could have effects on the environment and
forestry. As mentioned above, the Mozambican legislation requires that such effects
would have to be identified as part of the preparation of the individual business projects,
and evidence provided on how the developer proposes to manage these effects. In this
context it is worth noting that the regulatory simplification envisaged under PRSC-8 will
be carried out with the involvement of MICOA and the Ministry of Health, in order to
preserve the government's regulatory capacity in environmental and health safety issues.

137. Beyond the need to ensure that the environmental effects of reform
supported by the PRSC is mitigated, the sustainable use of Mozambique's natural

resources (land, mining, fisheries, forestry, water) represents a great opportunity
for poverty reduction as well as social and economic development, and needs to be
strengthened. As outlined in the 2005 CEM, public revenues from natural resource rents
could be increased from USD31 million to USD82 million per year under current
economic conditions, mostly by improving transparency and fairness in the issuing of
licenses, quotas and concessions and in the collection and use of revenue. Sustainable
exploitation of natural resources by communities and individuals should be promoted to
contribute directly to poverty reduction and livelihood security. Investments in extractive
and exploitative industries can promote further growth and economic activity through
providing markets for local goods and services as well as inputs for processing industries.
Licensing and taxation of natural resource use can provide significant revenue for
government, which in turn, can support funding development and poverty reduction
programs, especially where (local and global) market demand and prices allow significant
margins. However managing these resources is complex. While GOM legislation and
policies recognize and seek to facilitate the role of different models of resource use for
poverty reduction and development, little attention has been given to the specific
mechanisms for: (i) access, (ii) promoting efficient use and (iii) monitoring and
compliance with existing norms. This has led to a situation where regulations appear to
have produced unnecessarily complex procedures that create opportunities for rent
seeking and corruption, harming both the poor and private commercial interests. Over the
next few years IDA, in collaboration with the IMF and other development partners, will
work closely with government to maximize the benefits from the sustainable exploitation
of natural resource. An important step to enhance the revenue collection efforts was the
approval by the parliament in December 2006 of the new laws on the fiscal regimes for
the mining and oil sectors, which have become effective in mid-2007.

                           E. POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASPECTS

138. The poverty reduction impact of the policies supported by the series is
expected to be positive and with long term impact. The PRSC series contribute for the
improvement of the use of public resources through better budget preparation and
execution, stronger public financial management systems, and stronger oversight. As
PFM improves, public expenditures become more efficient resulting in larger benefits for
the population as more and superior public services become available. Additionally, as
efficiency increases, fiscal space is created and more resources become available to
finance policies targeted on poverty reduction. The public pension reform is needed to
guarantee its long term sustainability. The Bank is supporting the government by
financing a Diagnostic and Actuarial Studies for pension reform. The team will continue
to work very close with the government to monitor potential distributional and social
aspects of the reform.

139. Policies contributing to job creation have important impact on poverty
reduction. The PRSC actions continue to support broad-based growth by reducing the
excessive regulation constraining business activities, improving the information basis for
access to credit, simplifying the regulatory environment for business development and
promoting more efficient use and better access to land, and strengthening the legal and
institutional framework for concessions, public private partnerships, and large investment


                                          - 55 -
projects, including in the exploitation of natural resources. All these actions contribute to
create an environment conducive to business activity and job creation, a necessary
condition to further reduce poverty in Mozambique as close to three quarters of the
working age population is working in agriculture and less than 15 percent have a formal
salaried job.

140. The specific country policies supported by the PRSC series are not expected
to have significant distributional and social impacts, except possibly positive ones
arising from the increased effectiveness of the land tax administration system (as the land
tax system would be designed to be progressive). Nevertheless the team plans to conduct
a PSIA on the land tax reform when a draft of it becomes available.

                                  F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

141. There are the main areas of risk: macro, political and capacity. The first set
of risks is concerned with the potential for macroeconomic shocks and the impact it
could have on the implementation and achievements of the government reform
program. Whilst shocks may come from a variety sources we associate the highest risks
to shocks coming from negative changes in the world economy that would manifest
themselves through deteriorating terms of trade, absence of FDI, or by the impact of
unpredictable reductions in donor disbursements, especially through budget support. As
for mitigation measures, the government has developed a good and well tested model to
dampen the impact of these shocks by building a high level of reserves, maintaining a
flexible exchange rate regime, and keeping low external debt vulnerability. Additionally,
Mozambique has a stable relationship with the IMF, anchored on a Policy Support
Instrument (PSI), which contributes to solid macroeconomic management. As for
measures to avoid potential shocks coming from unpredictable lower levels of donor
support, the maintenance of very active and fluid communications between the
government and development partners can partially mitigate this risk. The elaboration of
the new PARP presents also a good opportunity to deepen the communication and to
address differences of views that could lead to lower support. Over the long run,
government is keen to continue to build its own revenue base to gradually reduce
dependency of foreign aid. All together we consider this risk to be low.

142. The announcement of price increases for bread, water and electricity
sparked in the first week of September a wave of popular protests in Mozambique.
The reasons behind the riots go beyond the announced increases in prices for bread,
electricity, and water. Inflation in general and not only the recent announced increase in
prices of water, electricity and bread, played a major role in recent events as it has been
eroding purchasing power of the poor. Additionally, high poverty levels and
unemployment especially among the urban youth has had an important role in the recent
events. The government reactions to the social unrest moved from a decision to go ahead
with announced price increases to a position to have a more comprehensive set of
policies. 51 These temporary measures will be reviewed by the end of 2010 bringing the

51
  The more comprehensive set of policies adopted by government immediately after the riots includes
among others (i) a more progressive scale of utility price increases with no increase for the very poor,


                                                   - 56 -
possibility of new social unrests depending on how they will be changed and how the
population will perceive the changes. In the medium and long term there are risks of
recurrence of popular unrest if purchasing power of the poor continues to deteriorate and
unemployment remains high.

143. The government has shown an interest in substituting distortionary price
subsidies by increasing coverage of current limited cash transfer programs and
some targeted subsidies. The government has expressed interest in expanding the
coverage of some cash transfer program targeted to support the very old and children
while decreasing price subsidies. Additionally the authorities seem more likely to
embrace the design of a more comprehensive social protection program. Additionally, the
implementation of a more inclusive, labor intensive, growth agenda resulting in faster job
creation would help to mitigate these risks.

144. Growing fiscal pressures resulting from contingent liabilities, SOEs, PPPs,
non-concessional borrowing, fuel subsidies, and the increasing public sector wage
bill, among others could result in potential macroeconomic risks. The government has
indicated its commitment with general macroeconomic stability and with fiscal balance in
particular. Fiscal restraint; improvements on the selection of public sector investment
projects; and implementation of necessary reforms to improve business environment will
be key elements to address both expenditures as well as revenue sides of the fiscal
position and preserve macroeconomic stability.

145. A second area of risk is the absence of consensus to institute some reforms
centered around the growth agenda. The PRSC series supports substantive reforms in
land administration with a view to promote more efficient land utilization, including a
reduction in speculative practices through reforms to the existing land tax regime. Land
tax changes will require very strong political will given the vested interest of current
landholders. Reforms to improve the business environment through deregulation or more
appropriate regulations which would reduce the number of unnecessary or inefficient
licensing inspections (labor, health, environment), and overall red tape will impact the
work and some vested interests across many Ministries. A strategy to improve the
business climate was approved in 2008, but its implementation has been slow. To
mitigate these risks the government, with support from the Bank and other donors, is
taking actions to create consensus to implement reforms on land use and taxation and
business regulations. On land tax reform, the government is planning a National Land
Policy Forum in 2010 that will involve all stakeholders in a forward-looking policy
dialogue regarding the implementation of the Land Law. In the area of improving
business regulations the government is working with the assistance of the Bank (the
Competitiveness and Private Sector Development Project) in the development of a
detailed Action Plan to implement the reforms. Perhaps most importantly, there is a


partial increase for the average consumer and full increase for high level consumers; (ii) keep bread price
unchanged compensating producers through a subsidy scheme; (iii) phasing out diesel subsidies while
subsidizing collective urban transportation; (iv) to create fiscal space to pay for subsidies the government
announce actions such as reduction in traveling, freezing salaries of high level officials, and freezing the
creation of new government agencies.


                                                    - 57 -
heightened realization in government of a need to rebalance its growth strategy towards
more inclusive and job-creating growth. The authorities have approached the Bank
seeking support in developing such strategy indicating that areas supported by the PRSC
series would be important parts of it. This risk at this point is moderate to high.

146. A third set of risks concerns possible delays in implementing areas of the
reforms program across all areas, as a result of the weak capacity. Limited
institutional capacity in many agencies limits the scope and speed of reforms in all the
areas supported by the PRSC. In order to mitigate this risk, the Bank intends to increase
its engagement at the technical level. There are specific projects and technical assistance
targeting areas of reforms as listed in Annex V, including the Competitiveness and
Private Sector Development Project which is financing the hiring of two lawyers and one
economist to work with the Ministry of Industry and Trade on the elaboration of
proposals to simplify or eliminate regulations and licenses identified as too cumbersome
or unnecessary. The development partners have also agreed with government on a
common fund to finance the implementation of the program that is expected to deliver
capacity building and oversight more effectively. IDA is the main contributor to this
fund, through its Planning and Decentralized Finances Project approved by the Board in
early 2010. The risk is moderate.

Subject: Letter of Development Policy for the Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit
          (PRSC-7)


   1. I am writing on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique to request a
      Credit in the amount of USD85 million (PRSC7I) from the International Development
      Association (IDA), to support the continuing reform programme under the proposed
      Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC).

   2. The aforementioned Credit will help to meet the financing requirements that Mozambique
      faces to implement the Action Plan for the Poverty Reduction (PARP2011-2014), through
      the Economic and Social Plan (PES) and the annual budget (OE) for the year 2011.

   3. We would like to commend your commitment to continuous support of the Government's
      program, as we progress with the implementation of the PRSC series which emphasizes
      reforms aiming at improving the business environment for private sector development,
      as a means to foster economic growth, create jobs, and accelerate poverty reduction.
      The PRSC-7 is designed within the context of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
      between the Government of the Republic of Mozambique and international aid partners,
      including the World Bank Group, signed in March 2009. The MoU outlines the participant's
      approach to the provision of budget support, among other related measures.

The Programme

   4. As set out in the 2006-10 PARPA-II, the Governments of Mozambique main objective is the
      reduction of the levels of absolute poverty. To achieve this goal, PARPA-II, adopted in May
      2006, presents a strategy and programme focused on the following key priorities areas:
      human capital development (including education, health and access to potable water);
      governance (good governance, legality and justice including public and legal sector
      reform); economic development (including the promotion of national entrepreneurship
      and infrastructure development); and cross-cutting issues including environment,
      HIV/AIDS and gender.

Overview of Recent Progress

   5. The PARPA-II implementation in 2009 was broadly satisfactory, as noted in the May 2010
      Joint Review, involving the Government and the Programme Aid Partners (PAPs)
      including IDA. The Mozambican economy continued to grow rapidly, achieving a Growth
      Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 6.4 percent in 2009 following a 6.8 percent in
      2008. Inflation declined from 10.3 percent in 2008 to 3.3 percent in 2009. However,
      inflation has increased in recent months, with year-on-year inflation reaching 17.1
      percent in August 2010, as a result of increases in international food and fuel prices, the
      gradual abolition of the gasoline subsidies, the increase in aggregate demand, and the
      sharp nominal devaluation of the Metical. Aiming to achieve target average inflation of
      9.3 percent, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) has tightened monetary policy this year.

   6. Satisfactory progress was made in health, education, and women and social action. In
      health, the Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus (DPT3) and Hepatite B (Hb) coverage rates
      in children between 0-12 months increased to 94 percent; the number of health
      personnel per capita increased, and the number of children and adults benefiting from
      antiretroviral treatment has also increased in 2009. In education, the number of
      students in public schools increased by 3.6 percent in the primary level; 17.2 percent for
      the secondary level; and 20 percent in the technical professional tracks. On Women and
      Social Action, the number of children, the elderly, the disable women heads of households
      benefiting from social protection programs was close to 206 thousand, above the PAF's
      target for 2009.

   7. The integration of the PES, OE and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (CFMP) and the
      strengthening of the Balanço do PES (BdPES) to monitor the PARPA has proved to be a
      useful exercise, although there remain weaknesses in the preparation of the budget and


                                             - 84 -
    programmatic planning. The financial crisis in 2009 further complicated the alignment of
    the budget with the CFMP. The 2010-12 CFMP was prepared in mid-2009 when
    government estimated a strong fiscal contraction as a result of the global crisis, while
    the budget was submitted to Parliament in early 2010, when it was clear that
    Mozambique could count on additional fiscal resources. Therefore, there were extensive
    differences between the envelopes in the first year of the CFMP and the 2010 budget
    approved by Parliament eight months later. The government is committed to further
    improve the budget preparation. On that, the World Bank team, in collaboration with the
    International Monetary Fund and other budget support partners, is providing technical
    assistance to support the government efforts towards gradually introducing a form of
    program budgeting which can be suitable for Mozambique.

8. The Government's commitment to address the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
   remains strong. This is reflected in the PARPA-II, whose key actions are summarized in a
   matrix, along with indicators included in the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)
   agreed with the Government's direct budget support partners, to permit monitoring. The
   Programme defined in these instruments will be implemented through Government
   systems with monitoring and evaluation reported in my Government's annual Economic
   and Social Plan (PES) and the annual State Budget (OE) that are submitted to the
   Parliament for approval.

9. The expenditures in priority sectors were 64.2%, which is below the target of 65% of the
   total Performance against PES/PAF targets in public service delivery was positive.
   Positive progress was made both in PES/PAF and Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
   indicators. Although the 2009 PES/PAF targets were met, HIV/AIDS remains one of the
   greatest threats to Mozambique's development and once again a stronger and better
   coordinated gender sensitive multi-sectoral response is needed.

10. In terms of the environment for private sector development, progress was made in
    2009, including the simplification of company registration procedures and administrative
    improvements in customs, was reflected in the improvement of Mozambique ranking by
    places to position 135 out of 183 economies in the 2010 Doing Business Survey, reflecting
    the Government's commitment. Mozambique slipped one place to 11th within the South
    African Development Community (SADC) region, however, and this highlights the need to
    accelerate our efforts to improve the business environment.

11. The results of household budget survey (IOF) done in 2008-09 provide solid evidence of
    significant progress across a range of non-monetary poverty indicators at both the
    national and regional levels. These include large improvements in access to education (at

    both primary and secondary levels); improved access to health services, particularly in
    rural areas; increases in asset ownership by households; improvement in access to
    electricity and improvements in housing quality. These improved indicators attest to
    important positive long-run development trends as well as success in meeting strategic
    government priorities. At the same time, the 2008/09 measures of poverty based on
    consumption, particularly food consumption, did not decrease as planned. While
    consumption poverty fell significantly from 1996/97 to 2002/03 (69% to 54%), the
    2008/09 IOF shows that consumption poverty (as measured by the headcount rate) at
    the national level was essentially the same as in 2002/03, at slightly less than 55% of
    the population. The advances observed in non-monetary poverty indicators are
    associated in part with the large efforts made by the government in the provision of
    social services. The government has invested massively in education and health, along
    with investments in transport infrastructure, which has resulted in significant
    improvements in school attendance rates and in the average proximity of health posts.
    Alongside these gains in social sectors, improvements in durable goods ownership and
    housing quality were observed. Despite these advances, consumption poverty rates at the
    national level remained stable. Factors behind these results include:

        a) Very slow growth rates in agricultural productivity, especially with respect to
            food crops, observed in the Trabalho de Inquérito de Agrícola (TIA) surveys since
            2002.
        b) Weather shocks that impacted the harvest of 2008, particularly in the Central
            provinces.
        c) Declining terms of trade due to large increases in international food and fuel
            prices. Fuel prices, in particular, rose substantially over the period 2002/03 to
            2008/09.

12. Mozambique experienced severe social unrest in the first week of September, prompted
    by the announced increase in prices of water, electricity and bread. The more
    comprehensive set of policies adopted by government immediately after the riots
    includes among others (i) a more progressive scale of utility price increases with no
    increase for the very poor, partial increase for the average consumer and full increase
    for high level consumers; (ii) keep bread price unchanged compensating producers


                                         - 86 -
       through a subsidy scheme; (iii) phasing out diesel subsidies while subsidizing collective
       urban transportation; (iv) to create fiscal space to pay for subsidies the government
       announce actions such as reduction in traveling, freezing salaries of high level officials
       and freezing the creation of new government agencies. These temporary measures will
       be reviewed by the end of 2010.

   13. However, more structural reasons such as high poverty levels and unemployment
       especially among the urban youth have had an important role in the recent events. The
       government believe that the medium and long term solutions are associated with both
       increasing the coverage and quality of education and strong gains in employment or
       other alternative opportunities to earn income that could result in substantial reduction
       of poverty. The results of the new poverty assessment raise questions whether the
       current development model is the most appropriate in creating jobs and reducing poverty
       levels.

   14. The government has recently asked the support of the World Bank in developing a more
       inclusive, comprehensive labor intensive development strategy. A new strategy focused
       on diversifying the economy into labor intensive sectors and increasing agriculture
       productivity must include the elimination of barriers to private investment, improve
       labor force skills, and increase domestic production competitiveness to compete with
       imports and even diversify exports. A comprehensive, well design deep reform program
       is essential to this new strategy as well as stable and well conducted macroeconomic
       policies (fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies). The government expects to start
       soon this process supported by the World Bank and other development partners.

   15. The Government's programme which is being submitted for support within PRSC-7
       includes two main components that are an integral part of the wider PARPA, PES and PAF
       matrices, namely: macroeconomic management and economic development.

Macroeconomic Management

   16. The Government remains committed to maintain macroeconomic stability improve public
       financial management and enhance governance. The Government is also committed to
       ensure that budget allocation to priority sectors are in line with targets and the overall
       goal of poverty reduction, and to continue to implement measures to strengthen revenue
       mobilization and the transparency and monitoring of the budget execution. The
       Government will also continue implementing the new procurement system, and expanding
       coverage and efficiency of internal and external audit bodies.



                                            - 87 -
a. The Government will maintain macroeconomic stability through adhering to an
   appropriate macroeconomic framework with consistent fiscal and monetary policies.
   It will also continue to improve public financial management through monitoring
   closely and allocating its resources to pro-poor spending.

b. The Government will also continue to increase budgetary efficiency, transparency
   and accountability by expanding coverage and implementing "Sistema de
   Administração Financeira do Estado" (SISTAFE). Specifically, after the successful
   introduction of e-SISTAFE in 2004 in the Ministry of Finance and all its provincial
   directorates, the Government completed the roll-out to all Ministries and other
   Government institutions by the end of the 2007, and started using the direct
   execution modality, such that more than 90 percent of the budget execution of goods
   and services and more than 10 percent of execution of wages are done through e-
   SISTAFE direct budget execution.

c. The Government will also continue to implement the procurement reforms. Following
   the approval of the new Procurement Regulations in 2005, the Government
   established the new central procurement institution, which has been staffed and
   made operational during 2007. We have also started the establishment of a
   monitoring system to increase transparency and measure the effectiveness of the
   reforms, in line with international best practice for the assessment of national
   procurement systems. The government objective was that at least 95 percent of all
   public contracts should occur through competitive bidding in 2009. However,
   preliminary information on public purchases available from Unidade Funcional de
   Surpervisão das Aquisições (UFSA) suggests that during 2009 only 82 percent of
   contracts of the public sector (and 80 percent in terms of value) were subject to
   public tender in accordance with the current Mozambican procurement legislation.

d. This apparent drop in the use of competitive procurement methods may be due at
   least in part to the much better performance of UFSA in strengthening the monitoring
   efforts and collecting data on public procurement in 2009. In fact, both the number
   and value of public procurement processes has more than doubled compared to
   those recorded in 2008. It is very likely that many of the procurement processes not
   reported in the past may have been carried out using single sourcing procedures ­
   and therefore an improvement in data collection also led to a more realistic
   assessment of the situation. At the same time, there may be other reasons behind


                                    - 88 -
          this deterioration and we are taking steps to address possible causes. Notably the
          new Procurement Decree clearly emphasizes the exceptional nature of the use of

          single sourcing, and limits its scope by articulating the necessary conditions for the
          use of this procurement modality. We have recently started procurement training
          for all Permanent Secretaries and Provincial Directors on the new Procurement
          Decree, which includes information on the limitations applicable to the use of single
          sourcing.

      e. The Government is also working to increase efficiency and accountability, by
         strengthening the capacity of the Tribunal Administrativo (TA), which is our Supreme
         Audit institution, to conduct more audits and expand the audit coverage. Building on
         the recent progress, the TA has shifted the focus from the number to the share of
         the State Budget covered by the verification audits. The coverage of the audits of the
         State Budget has expanded from 26 percent in 2007 to 30 percent in 2008 and at
         least 35 percent in 2009.

      f. The Government is also improving its payroll management, and in this context it has
         approved the Medium Term Pay Policy in 2008. While raising the wage bill, the new
         policy aims to simplify and rationalize the salary scales across ministries,
         decompress the scales consistent with qualification and responsibility, reform the
         system of housing and other allowances, and harmonize the salary policy with the
         pension system. We are aware of possible fiscal pressures resulting from a higher
         wage and salary bill, and we are committed to keep fiscal balance and will take the
         necessary measures to accomplish that goal.

Economic Development

   17. Recognizing the main role of the private sector in the economic growth and employment,
       Government policies and reforms have improved the environment for the development of
       private sector activities, and reinforced the role of the market in the economy, as
       described below.

          a) The Government is working to improve access to credit for private sector firms.
              One of the key challenges is to reduce information constraints for commercial
              banks by supporting improvements in accounting and reporting standards
              through the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
              in the corporate sector. Improving access to credit will also require additional


                                           - 89 -
                measures to improve the level of competition in the banking sector, diversify the
                financial services and products, and to strengthen the judicial system.


             b) The Government is working to ensure the financial sustainability of the social
                security system, and to ensure the adoption of best practice and transparency in
                the management of the Social Security funds. The Government plans to build the
                Information Technology (IT) system of the Instituto Nacional de Segurança Social
                (INSS), and this will allow the creation of an electronic database of all pensioners
                and contributors. Also, the elaboration of the investment strategy and the
                preparation of a new actuarial study will be completed shortly, and form the
                basis for the reform of the system.

             c) We are committed with continuously improve the business climate. Thus, the
                Government will continue to implement the measures approved by the Strategy
                for improve the Business Climate. One important decision by the Government in
                2009 was the removal of the minimum capital requirement to start a business,
                reducing significantly the costs for the private sector. The government also
                approved in 2008 the Simplified Licensing and the Small Business Simplified Tax.
                Another approach to reduce the costs of doing business is through the One Stop
                Shops that are already expanded to all the provinces, with positive results. Other
                measures approved include a decree in July 2009, whereby all business
                inspections have been merged under one single authority (except for labor and
                fiscal inspections), which is expected to reduce the burden of inspections on
                private business. The new Bankruptcy Code has also been submitted to the
                Parliament. In face of a new, more inclusive, labor intensive, growth agenda, the
                government is committed to speed up the rate of reforms in this area, especially
                on simplifying business licences and regulations in general.

Conclusion

   18. In sum, the Government's policy framework aims at consolidating macroeconomic
       stability, and is consistent with the medium-term goal of sustaining poverty reduction
