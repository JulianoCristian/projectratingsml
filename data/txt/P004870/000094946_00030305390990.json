bringing the stakeholders in local development\n            to a regional consensus around the theme of biodiversity\n            conservation was largely achieved. Project outcome, on the\n            other hand, was unsatisfactory since numerous planned\n            actions did not go forward. Project sustainability is\n            uncertain. World Bank performance was marginally\n            unsatisfactory, while Borrower performance was mixed.\n            Lessons include: When a country's internal situation\n            makes it impossible to conduct procurement proceedings under\n            optimum competitive conditions, large-scale technical\n            assistance contracts should not be put up for bid. When a\n            country's internal socio-political situation is\n            difficult, appropriate project organization and management\n            methods of supervision should be sought by the Bank. It is\n            essential to do an in-depth evaluation of the administrative\n            and financial management capacity of any executing agency\n            for implementing a Bank-financed project for the first time.\n            The Bank should ensure that the supervisory ministry is\n            committed to supporting the agency, and should limit\n            turnover among the agency's senior staff. Allowances\n            need to be made in project planning and implementation for\n            the possibly slow pace and complex nature of the borrowing\n            country's financial and administrative procedures. Team\n            stability, especially at senior staff levels, and\n            reliability of communications systems are essential for\n            effective technical and project management decisionmaking."}, "docdt": "2000-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
