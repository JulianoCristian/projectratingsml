The project will: 1) prepare and implement\n            a national park and wetlands complex management plan; 2)\n            launch priority surveys and studies to improve the basic\n            knowledge of the immediate actions to stop further\n            degradation of the environment; 3) initiate immediate\n            actions to stop further degradation of the environment; 4)\n            begin studies and adaptative research programs in specific\n            sectors likely to trigger sustainable development from the\n            use of natural resources; 5) develop environmental\n            assessment capabilities; 6) launch environmental education\n            and public awareness programs to muster the\n            population's support; 7) introduce the participatory\n            approach in the local communities and seek the participation\n            of national and local non-governmental organizations; and 8)\n            strengthen government institutions."}, "docdt": "1994-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
