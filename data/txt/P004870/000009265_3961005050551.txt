MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE DIRECTOR
MAGHREB AND IRAN DEPARTMENT
TO THE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT
1.    I submit for your approval the following _. morandum and recommendation
*        on a proposed Global Environment Trust Fund (GET) grant to the Democratic and
Popular Republic of Algeria for SDR 6.7 million, the equivalent of
US$9.2 million, to help finance the El Kala National Park and Wetlands Complex
*        Management Project.  Tne Government of Algeria requested and obtained a
Project Preparation Advance (PPA) of SDR 84,600, the equivalent of about
US$117,700, to finali2i project preparation.
2.    Background:  The El Kala National Park (EKNP) and surrounding region in
the northeast corner of Algeria contain one of the most important wetlands
areas in the Mediterranean, .including a unique mixture of marine, coastal
dune, wetlands, lake, and forest habitats, that are each significant both in
quality and quantity. The EKNP has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere
Reserve; and two of the lakes in the EKNP, Lake Oubeira and Lake Tonga, have
been designated as Ramsar vI Convention sites. This extensive wetlands
complex is a critical winter site for Palaearctic waterfowl, a breeding ground
for several endangered bird species including the white-headed duck Oxyura
leucoceRhala, and the home range of a significant population of the threatened
barbary deer Cervus elaphus ssp barbarus.  The area also has many outstanding
archaeological sites, including megaliths in the mountains and remains of
Carthagenian towns along the coasts.
3.    The El Kala wetlands region stretches in the northeast of the country
from the Tunisian border to the industrial city of Annaba. Presently about
100,000 people live in the EKNP and the wetlands, which are a major source of
water for the 500,000 inhabitants of Annaba, only 50 km away. In the El :ala
area, the pressure of population and development has led to severe degradation
of the environment due to expanding urban areas, pollution, and overuse of
water and land resources.
4.    Should this unique ensemble of natural resources, habitats, and
environment be further degraded or destroyed, the result would be an
irreversible loss of natural resources that are critical not only to Algeria,
but to the entire Mediterranean region. It is therefore imperative that
solutions resulting in ecologically sustainable development be found to
protect this area. In this respect, the GEF project is particularly timely
and appropriate. Moreover, Algeria, with a most recent per capita GDP of
about US$1,721 in 1993, fully qualifies for GEF financing.
5.    Currently, Algeria has no integrated management plan for natural
resource use or enforcement of pollution control measures to protect
ecologically sensitive areas. However, a whole host of laws aimed at
proLecting such areas already exist the implementation of which is conditioned
by the elaboration of a National Environmental Action Plan. Meanwhile, the
country which is a party to the 1972 World Heritage Convention, has signed
I/    Ramsar sites are wetlands areas of international importance afforded
protection under the Ramsar Convention which Algeria signed in 1971, to
which Algeria became a party in 1984.



most of the resolutions and protocols produced since the Barcelona Convention
in 1975 (which led to the adoption of the Mediterranean Action Plan),
including the 1982 protocol on Mediterranean Specially Protected Areas. The
Government is currently carrying out environmental activities with the support
of the Bank. In particular, an Environment Sector Study has been conducted
and will be discussed with the authorities shortly. The status of the
environment has become a top priority, particularly at the local level. In
recognizing the need for both preservation and ecologically sustainable
development of Its natural resources, the Government of Algeria (GOA) has
requested funds from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to design and
Implement a national. park and wetlands complex management plan at El Kala.
6.    Algeria has a substantial body of environmental legislation and a number
of institutions involved in it. Although, the country does not yet have a
comprehensive environmental policy it is committed, through its National
Commission, to elaborate such a polity. Also, some laws and regulations
pertaining to the protection of the environment will need to be revised.
Both the Agence Nationale pour la Conservation de la Nature (ANN) and the El
Kala National Park, which have the necessary authority to enforce
environmental laws and regulations, will need their staff reinforced to be
able to carry out public awareness and enforcement activities and to preserve,
within the region, the national heritage of natural and cultural assets in a
balanced and well-planned fashion. The Government is according high priority
to the project and has indicated its full support to the new visioII as well as
to the project concept and objectives.
7.    Proiect Objectives:  The proposed project would have three main
objectives. The first would be to mitigate the degradation of biodiversity
within EKNP and wetlands complex.  The second would be to establish at the
El Tarf Wilaya level a methodology and procedures for cenducting environmental
impact assessment studies. She third would be for the Project to serve as a
model for the management and rational use of natural resources in populated,
albeit protected, areas.
8.    Proiect Description:  The project would develop and implement a
management plan for the EKNP and wetlands complex in the El Tarf Wilaya over a
3-year period. The project would: (i) prepare and implement a national park
and wetlan 3 complex management plan beginning in the first project year;
(ii) launch priority surveys and studies to improve the basic knowledge of the
area and potentials for better c ntrol and management; (iii) initiate
immediate actions to stop furthe: degradation of the environment while the
management plan is being prepared; (iv) begin studies and adaptative research
programs in specific sectors likely to trigger sustainable development from
the use of natural resources; (v) develop environmental assessment capability
of the ANN and the Wilaya to evaluate, regulate, and monitor the impacts of
development on the area's natural resources; (vi) launch environmental
education and public awareness programs to muster the population's support;
(vii) introduce the participatory approach in the local communities and seek
the narticipation of national and local NGOs; and (viii) strengthen government
institutions, including ANN, the EKNP, and the Wilaya.
9.    Proiect Components: The grant would finance the preparation of a
management plan and commencement of its implementation no later than June 30,



-3-
1995.  More specifically, the three-year project would include the following
components:
A.    NATIONAL PARK AND WETLANDS COMPLEX MANAGEMENT PLAN: The managemetit
plan would update the zoning of the park based on preservation and
development criteria and would assign to each zone: (i) objectives;
(ii) human, financial and technica± resources to meet said objectives;
and (iii) a supervising authority, taking into account applicable
international guidelines under the Ramsar Convention and the UNESCO
Action Plan for Biosphere Reserves. Three types of actions are
envisaged:
i)    Base-Line Studies.  Priority surveys and studies would be launched
the first project year to improve basic knowledge of the area and
its potentials, thus allowing for better control and management of
such concerns as lake hydrology, biological inventories, water
pollution, eco-tourism, and agricultural and forestry systems
(annex 3);
ii)   Protected Area Management.  First, priority investment actions
would be selected to stop further degradation of the environment
while the management plan is being prepared (annex 4). The
following areas would be considered for action: (i) the
uncontrolled clearing of the dune littoral, which constitutes a
natural impluvium; (ii) the deterioration of water quality due to
out-of-service treatment plants; (iii) the continuous expansion of
buildings on fertile soils as towns keep growing unchecked;
(,v) the loss of biodiversity, habitats, and species; (v) the
degradation of the landscape; and (vi) the state of abandonment of
archeological sites.  Second, park infrastructures, vehicles and
equipment will be provided to support the implementation of the
Management Plan (annex 4);
iii)  Natural Resource Use Development.  Specific environmentally
supportive studies that may trigger development in a few initial
sectors would be launched, such as cork-oak, briar, wild olive
groves, and nature-based tourism. This aspect of the project is
highly supported by the local authorities, who sre under constant
pressure to create more jobs and improve the living conditions of
the local population (annex 5).
B.    ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ADAPTIVE RESEARCH:  This component
would have three elements, including (annex 6):
i)    information management, using the geographical information system
(GIS) to allow for proper monitoring and optimal use of data;
ii)   establishment in the El Tarf Wilaya of an environmental impact
assessment unit to carry out environmental impact studies; and
iii)  implementation of an adaptive research program that would seek
alternatives to the farmers' agricultural problems (annex 7).
Environmental monitoring and evaluation would be given much



prominence (annex 11) and would have a particularly strong
interface with the GIS subcomponent.
C.    ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION:  The objective of this component would be
to educate the local population about the environment and secure their
support for the project. In addition to introduction of this
participative approach, environmental education and public awareness
programs would be aimed at the local authorities, senior staff and
agents of the Wilaya, teachers, and students (annex 8). The Project
would also strongly encourage the participation of local NGOs,
associations, and volunteer groups in the above activities and programs.
D.    INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING:  Funds would be provided for
institutional strengthening of ANN, the environmental section of the El
Tarf Wilaya, and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) created in
October 1993 (annex 9). Finally, the Grant would finance the services
of a legal expert to review the present legal and regulatory framework
governing natural resources to identify areas which need to be revised
and updated and to propose reforms to strengthen tne framework.
E.    CONSERVATION FUND:  The project would set aside a conservation
fund of about US$100,000 that would be awarded to NGOs, associations,
and universities (annex 10). Proposals from these groups in relation to
preservation of the environment, promotion of the park, and
communication would thus be evaluated by the National Park Steering
Committee. The proposals would be selected based on merit, and in
accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank.
10.   Pro tecj Imblementation:  ANN would have overall responsibility for the
project. At the national level, it would rely on an existing Irterministerial
Committee for policy decisions. This should ensure a multi-sectoral approach
to environmental preservat'on. The Interminist.rial Committee, created by
Presidential decree on June 18, 1991, includes representatives from the
Ministries of the Economy, of the Interior, of Planning, of Equipment, and of
Research and Technology. The Committee has the flexibility to temporarily
include outside resource persons should the need arise. At the local level,
coordination would be ensured by the EKNP Steering Committee. It would rely
on close cooperation with the Wilaya's technical departments and would get
support from Technical Assistance. A special coordinator has been designated
in October 1993 by the Wilaya to ensure necessary coordination between sectors
and services. Day-to-day management would be the responsibility of a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU). The PIU has been established within ANN, while
remaining separate from EKNP. Some activities would be subcontracted to
universities - e.g. Algiers, Annaba, Constantine - and to NGOs based on e
ealection of their proposals. The latter would be involved in inventories,
public awareness programs, and the implementation of adaptive research.
11.    Methods would be devised to assure popular participation, including
through associations, youth and women's groups, and cooperatives. The project
would also strengthen government institutions, especially the environment
inspectorate at the Wilaya level. A Kid-Term Review would take place
18 months after project inception and would include the Government, the Bank,
and NGOs. By then the Management Plan would have been finalized. The Bank



and GOA would agree on priority actions to be carried out under such plan.
Adoption and implementation of t.ie Management Plan would be subject to prior
consultation with both local populations and NGOs.
12.   Proiect sustainabillty:   The following features are built into the
project design to ensure institutional sustainability: (i) the ANN and EKNP
have be given the legal authority to embark on revenue generating activities
that would ensure the financing of at least part of the project's recurrent
costs. To this effect, a study will be carried out and recommendations on
differer.t cost-recovery alternatives will be made; (ii) the local populations
and organizations would be involved from the very beginning in the design and
implementation of the project management plan to ensure a sense of ownership
on their part; and (iii) appropriate personnel from ANN, EKNP, the Uilaya, and
NGOs wculd undergo training on a regular basis. The Government will
contribute to the financing of the project in addition to GEF financing. The
Government contribution would be in the form of salaries, taxes, and duties as
well as specific studies and interventions. Another encouraging sign is that
the Interministerial Committee is working, making arnd enforcing df-,isions in
favor of the praservation of the environment. The Government's request that
future development projects involve routine environmental impact assessment
studies throughout the country is alao highly indicative of the project's
institutional sustainability.
13.   Rationale for GEF Funding:  Global Environment Benefit - The protection
and conservation of the El Kala wetlands complex is of high international
importance. The area is a key habitat not only for globally threatened
species, but also for migrant waterfowl which maintain vital linkages with
other parts of the Mediterranean and Africa as well as Northetn Europe. This
area also features samples of intact coastal and forest habitats that are
quickly disappearing throughout the Mediterranean. These habitats are home to
a wide variety of flora and fauna and are also critical for ensuring the
maintenance of the hydrologieal system which currently supports over
100,000 people. Without a strong program for effective and integrated water,
forestry, and agriculture manageL__Lt, entire ecosystems will be destroyed.
14.   As current Government funding is insufficient for the operation and
maintenance of the EKNP, it is highly unlikely that sufficient funds would be
available from non-concessional funding to implement the management plan's
recommendations. The project has been discussed with the Government, leaving
no doubt that the availability of grant funds represents a major incentive to
the authorities to implement protection and conservation programs. The
project would also help in times when difficult choices have to be made
between promoting development and nreserving the environment. Tne Government
would most certainly want to continue to finance the main operations,
especially those related to environment assessment studies, once the project
is complete. Higher fees for park entrance and contributions from NGOs would
also be a source of funds. Finally, the project should be able to generate
additional revenues from tourism, environmental development, and various
outdoor activities.
15.   Form of Innovation:  In the context of Algeria, this project includes
two primary innovations: (i) interministerial coordination of a regional
management plan aimed at preserving the environment while allowing controlled



-6-
development of the natural resources, and (ii) projects being evaluated
through Environmental Impact Assessment studies prior to adoption and
implementation. Both local and international NGOs have indicated great
interest in the former aspect of the project during a meeting in Paris in June
1993 and at a Ramsar convention in Tokyo that same month. As one
international NGO put it, the El Kala National Park project is among the first
cases in which preservation and development are tackled simultaneously.
16.   Agreed Astions:   During negotiations, agreement was obtained on the
followin; actions:
i)   Grant Effectiveness.  Effectiveness of the grant is subject to the
Bank receiving satisfactory evidence that: (a) the special account
has been opened at the Central Bank of Algeria for ANN; and
(b) EKNP has increased its staff by 20 forest rangers;
ii)   Accounts.  The project accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank;
iii)  National Park Steering Committee, GOA would invite to the
deliberations of tie National Park Steering Committee at the
El Tarf Wilaya representatives from the NGOs and local
universities, in accordance with the Executive decree No. 83-458
defining the attribution and composition of the Committee;
iv)   Project Management.  The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would
be under the supervision of a Project Manager. The PIU would be
responsible for project accounts, management, and for coordinating
project operations and expenditures;
v)    Management Plan.  A Management Plan would be submitted to the Bank
for its comments and recommendations no later than June 30, 1995.
Procurement of works for upgrading EKNP's infrastructure and
consultant services for training EKNP's staff is conditioned upon
submission to the Bank of a satisfactory management plan;
vi)   Environmental Impact Assessment Unit.          parties reached an
understanding that three (3) persons woula be recruited or
redeployed from other government agencies to strengthen the
Environmental 'Inspectorate" of the El Tarf Wilaya;
vii)  Mid-term Review.  A mid-term review would take place 18 months
after project inception;
viii) Forestry Guides. Fifteen (15) forest guides would be recruited no
later than June 30, 1994;
ix)   Cost-Recovery Study. A study would be carried out and
recommendations of different cost-recovery alternatives would be
submitted no later than October 31, 1995;



- 7 -
x)    Progress Reports.  Such reports would be furnished to the Bank no
later than January 31 and July 31 of each fiscal year until
completion of the project.
17.   Environmental Aspects:  The project has been reviewed by the Regional
Environment Division. Social issues that may be of importance revolve around
community participation in the development of the National Park and Wetlands
Complex Management Plan and actual commitment of the community which the plan
will affect. The participatory approach is important in drawing up the
managsment plan and for adaptive research. Two social scientists (one
Algerian, one foreign) have been contracted to address such issues as people'.
participation, environmental education through the ground-up apprcach, and
consideration of the farming and hunting population. The social scientists'
work would mainly consist of initiating a process of consultation and
participation which would feed into the Management Plan. They would establish
the baseline situation and advise on how to integrate the local culture into
the project.
18.     With regard to environmental aspects, an Environmental Impact
Assessment Unit has been established in Algeria under the Mediterranean
Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP). The ZIA activities within
the project will be carried out in consultation with the national hIA unit.
It should be noted that, as a sign of its commitment, the Government has
requested that any future development projectw in the EKNP and the wetlands
complex undergo an environmental screening process and an ZIA as necessary.
The Interministerial Committee will oversee the development of the management
plan for the EKNP and implementation of the proposals.
19.   Prolect Bonefits:  The Project would generate a series of
multidisciplinary interventions that would ensure that the globally
significant and unique wetlands complex of the E1 Kala region is not destroyed
through unsustainable development. Additional benefits from the project would
includes (i) institutional building of ANN, ERNP, and the Wilaya's
environmental winspectorate"; (ii) increased effectiveness of the ANN and MEMP
and of the environmental assessment capability of the Wilaya, ensuring better
resource use planning and implementation in both the short and the long terms;
(iii) better coordination of multisectoral departments in environmental
conservation and development; (iv) the participation of affected populations
and NGOs at an early stage of project conception and design; and (v) testing
of a model for achieving habitat and species protection through sustainable
development and nature conservation that would be of value to the
Mediterranean reg'.on and to the world. The Government is indeed setting high
expectations for its future ability to better evaluate projects through
systematic testing using Environmental Impact Assessment studies.
20.  kiskst  The primary risk to timely peoject implementation resides in
the delays that could occur caused by difficulties in the recruiting of
technical assistance for defining the management plan. Other risks could
rcsult froms (i) a possible lack of cooperation between the various entities
involved including various ministries and departments, and/or lack of support
from the local populations; (ii) delays in the transfer of the necessary
personnel to the project; and (iii) the present ANN team, which includes
mostly young cadres with little practical experience. To minimize the risks



- 8 -
the following steps have been taken. Proper coordination will be ensured at
the national level Dy the Interministerial Committee (IC) establlihed for that
purpose, and by thP operations committee at the local level. The IC has
already made some hard decisions which have resulted, for instance, in the
Ministry of Equiypment reversing its decision to build a dike through Lake
Tonga (a Ramear site). The project would pay particular attention to
involving local populations and NGOU at the very beginning of project
implementation. Technical assistance and regular training should uarkably
improve project personnel's competence. It is also felt that the ANN's
present weakness would be easily offset by the Wilaya's experienced high-level
staff. Finally, sufficient supervision time has been set aside for Bank
missions (Annex 13).
21.   Recomm:ntlAns  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply
witlh the provisions of Resolution No. IBRD 91-5 of the Executive Directors
relating to the establishment of the Global Environment Facility and recommend
that the Regional Vice President, Middle East and North Africa Region, approve
it.
