The project\n            did not achieve many of its objectives, institutional\n            development was negligible, sustainability is unlikely, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons to be drawn from this project are\n            similar to those derived from many of the other Bank's\n            integrated rural development projects. The establishment of\n            region-specific, specialized project institutions does not\n            compensate, in the long run, for a weak national program of\n            agricultural support services; the aim should be to provide\n            training and technical assistance that will enable the\n            Government to strengthen these services. The project also\n            demonstrated that it is difficult for crop-based rural\n            development agencies to satisfactorily assume the\n            responsibility for promoting food crops. In tackling the\n            deficit of the tree crop development agencies, it will be\n            necessary for food crop promotion to be financed under\n            Government's general program of research and extension,\n            rather than charged to coffee-cocoa producers."}, "docdt": "1993-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
