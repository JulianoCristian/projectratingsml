projects and by\n            plantings in new areas. It will be implemented over five\n            years and will include: (a) provision of inputs and\n            technical advice to farmers for the planting of 7,500 ha of\n            coffee and 2,000 ha of cocoa, maintenance of existing 16,600\n            ha of coffee planted under the first two projects, and\n            development of some 22,000 ha of foodcrops. The Third Cocoa\n            and Coffee Project will also finance the (b) implementation\n            of annual plant protection programs against pest attacks on\n            existing cocoa trees (mirid and blackpod); (c) applied\n            research in coffee, cocoa and foodcrops; as well as (d)\n            construction (250 km) and maintenance of feeder roads. In\n            addition, the project will support (e) establishment of\n            about 250 farmers' groups for marketing, input\n            distribution and saving purposes; (f) support to the\n            National Cocoa and Coffee Development Company (SRCC),\n            including 14 man-years of technical assistance and 12\n            man-months of short-term consultants' services; and (g)\n            studies of land tenure problems in the project area and a\n            future strategy for cocoa-coffee development in Togo."}, "docdt": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
