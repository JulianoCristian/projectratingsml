(a) 
For withdrawals of the Part Z Authorized Allocation, Sri Lanka shall 
furnish to the Association a request or requests for deposit into the Part Z Special 
Account of an amount or amounts which in the aggregate do not exceed the Part Z 
Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of each such request, the Association shall, on 
behalf of Sri Lanka, withdraw from the Financing Account and deposit into the Part Z 
Special Account such amount as Sri Lanka shall have requested.

Authorized Allocation.  Thereafter, withdrawal from the Financing Account of the 
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Financing shall follow such procedures as the 
Association shall specify by notice to Sri Lanka.  Such further withdrawals shall be made 
only after and to the extent that the Association shall have been satisfied that all such
