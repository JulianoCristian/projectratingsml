as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: flexibility of\n            project design, particularly in emergency operations\n            facilitates implementation and provides a greater\n            opportunity for achieving project objectives. Training,\n            continuous social mobilization, and effective strategic\n            communications are critical for the success of projects and\n            consolidation of gains. Development of operational manuals\n            and their official notification by the government and\n            implementing agency clarifies the roles and responsibilities\n            of multiple players and partners involved in the program and\n            facilitate smooth implementation. Effective planning in the\n            areas of logistics and material supply play a vital role in\n            the success of emergency response and reconstruction\n            projects. Third-party technical audits, independent\n            financial audits, and eligibility surveys in addition to\n            existing government mechanisms are good tools for reducing\n            the risks associated with governance issues and increase the\n            transparency and credibility of program. The home owner\n            driven approach with necessary technical assistance allows\n            affected communities to develop ownership of the program and\n            yields results. In the case of emergency operations, the\n            effects of the disaster on government and implementing\n            agencies with respect to their capacities should not be\n            underestimated and project targets and implementation period\n            should be planned and designed accordingly. Joint strategic\n            planning and coordination amongst different donors,\n            especially after disasters, allows for a more effective\n            response through avoiding overlaps and addressing priority\n            areas to the benefit of the country and its affected\n            population. Effective grievance redressal mechanisms and\n            documentation are essential for addressing the concerns and\n            issues of beneficiaries and allowing for smooth\n            implementation of the program. An effective reporting,\n            monitoring and evaluation system is essential for enabling\n            informed decision making at both policy and operational levels."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
