                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The key objective of the proposed PRSC-4 is to support governments owned reforms to improve the regulatory and institutional framework for infrastructure
                         and private investment, strengthen public financial management and improve basic service delivery. Specifically, the PRSC-4 focuses on supporting the
                         government#s efforts to (i) improve the business environment and enhance governance and efficiency in the agriculture, energy and mining sectors; (ii)
                         strengthen and modernize budget reporting, controls and accountability; and (iii) improve education and health outcomes through improved management of
                         health and education human resources, fiscal decentralization and co-financing the contributions of the poor in the mutual insurance schemes.
                          The operation is an integral part of the Bank#s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mali discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on February 5, 2008,
                         and directly contributes to the CAS Strategic Objectives 1 and 2, complementing Specific Investment Lending (SIL) operations that directly support Mali#s
                         growth and education sector reform.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress is being made in the implementation of the reforms supported by the PRSC series and there are no instances of policy reversals. However, implementation of the reform
                         agenda has been marred by delays which could complicate the achievement of the development objectives.
