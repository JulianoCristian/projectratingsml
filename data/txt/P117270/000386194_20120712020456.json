"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third, Fourth and Fifth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits Project for Mali were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was high; Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            the program was complex, ambitious and clearly did not have\n            the full buy-in of the national authorities on key\n            structural reforms. The lesson to take from this is that\n            credibility of the World Bank is diminished when key actions\n            are constantly delayed or watered down to maintain a\n            program, such as, for instance, the adoption of a mechanism\n            for electricity adjustment. Building a consensus is\n            essential for introducing reforms. The decision making\n            process is slow in Mali, as leaders seek to build consensus.\n            As experience has shown, however, this results in constantly\n            postponing much needed reforms. It can also act as a\n            smokescreen for a small rent seeking elite that is likely to\n            resist any reform that would reduce its privileges, even if\n            it would benefit a large part of the population. Technical\n            assistance is critical to help a low capacity administration\n            implement a complex reform program. Rapid population growth\n            (3.6 per cent per annum estimated in the 2009 census) is not\n            conducive to significant poverty reduction in a fragile\n            environment. Economic growth at about five percent per annum\n            is a solid achievement, but not strong enough to make a\n            sufficient dent in poverty. The main obstacle to higher\n            economic growth is the poor investment climate due to weak\n            physical infrastructure, limited access to finance, and\n            corruption. Indicators are signals given to stakeholders on\n            expected outcomes. They have to be carefully selected and\n            monitored. World Bank credibility is diminished when many\n            indicators are dropped/revised/introduced in mid-course.\n            After an unsatisfactory program, it is necessary to take a\n            pause and review in detail with the Government the reasons\n            for poor performance. In the health and education sector, a\n            lesson from the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)\n            series is the clear need to continue strengthening service\n            delivery for education and health in rural and underserved\n            areas for more equitable access. In this perspective, the\n            need to move ahead with the decentralization agenda is\n            clear, as regards strengthening administrative and\n            institutional capacities and financial resources."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
