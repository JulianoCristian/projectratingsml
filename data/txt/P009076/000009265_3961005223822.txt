MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A SECOND HEALTH PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$150.0
million to help finance a Second Health Project. The loan will be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including
a five year grace period.
2.    Country/Sector Background.  Investments in health, education and poverty
alleviation in Turkey have brought with them improvements in economic growth
and human welfare. Conversely, economic growth, manifested in a four-fold
increase in GNP per capita (US$2,130 in 1993) during the past thirty years,
has contributed significantly to improvements in the health of the population.
Although regional and urban/rural disparitiee still exist among the country's
59.9 million people, a better supply of food, clean water, safe sanitation,
decent housing and basic education is now available to many of those who were
previously deprived of these fundamental necessities of life. In the health
sector, the number of doctors, nurses, clinics and hospitals has increased
several fold during this time period. The impact of these factors on health
has been impressive: average life expectancy at birth has increased by over 40
percent to reach 67 years in 1991; infant mortality has dropped by 72 percent
to reach 58 per thousand; and the number of deaths due to infectious diseases
has decreased significantly. As a result, global health indicators in Turkey
have improved to a point where many are now comparable to those of other
countries with a similar per capita income.
3.    Despite these achievements, the burden of disease in turkey remains
high. For example, although the country ranks 69th in the world in terms of
incomL psr capita, it ranks 91st in terms of under-five mortality rates. This
statistic reflects regional disparities in the health and status of the
country'. women, in education of parents, in prevalence of malnutrition, in
availability of clean water and in the overall quality of health services as
well as differences in standards of living. The number of children who die
before the age of five fr_-:. preventable conditions such as improper
deliveries, poor feeding practices, uncomplicated diarrhea, pneumonia and
accidents indicates that the country has not yet maximized the potential
advantages of its economic development, nor benefitted fully from investments
made in the health sector during recent years.
4.    Turkey is among the nations that have signed the Convention on the
Rights of the Child which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United
Nations on November 20, 1989. The Convention calls for action to improve
maternal and child health. Improving the effectiveness, efficiency and equity
of the 4.6 percent of GNP (US$98 per capita per year) currently consumed by
the health sector in Turkey has, therefore, become a very high priority. The
Second Health Project will support the Government in achieving this objective



- 2 -
in the country's most deprived 23 eastern provinces, where the burden of
poverty, disease and disability borne by the population, and especially its
women and children, is the greatest.
5.    Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  The World Bank first
became involved in supporting the Government's health sector strategy during
the mid-1980s. This led to the preparation of the First Health Project (Loan
3057-TU for US$75 million) which became effective in October 1990.1/ The
First Health Project had a slow start-up. This was due primarily to four
factors: (a) lack of familiarity with Bank procedures; (b) frequent changes in
senior management of the MOH; (c) failure to define clearly the role of the
Project Coordination Unit (PCU); and (d) weak institutional capacity to
develop and implement large in-service training programs. Within the past 12
months, considerable progress has been made in addressing all of these
problems. The PCU is now fully operational and all subcomponents of the
Project are being implemented. As of July 31, 1994, about US$16.1 million of
the Bank loan (21.5 percent) have been disbursed and another US$13.3 million
committed.
6.    Rationale for Continued World 3ank Involvement.  Continued World Bank
involvement in the health sector in Turkey is justified for several reasons.
First, it is consistent with the Bank's overall strategy for health and
development which is expressed in the 1993 World Development Report (WDR),
Investina in Health. Like other World Bank reports, the 1993 WDR highlights
the important interplay between poverty relief, basic education, economic
development and health status. Consistent with this strategy, the Bank has
supported a number of projects in Turkey that aim at providing clean water and
an adequate supply of food, both of which are indispensable prerequisites for
good health. Several Bank supported training and education projects increase
the chance that people will lead healthier lifestyles and know when to seek
appropriate health care. Measures to strengthen the social safety net and the
essential role women play in development will have an equally important impact
on improving health. Since poor health has a negative effect on labor
productivity, contributes to unemployment, and prevents children from
attending school, breaking the vicious cycle of poverty, illness and
illiteracy constitutes an essential part of the Bank's strategy to assist
countries undergoing economic development. The proposed Project is,
therefore, consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Turkey
approved by the Executive Directors on March 11, 1993.2/
7.    Second, despite six consecutive Five-Year Plans, Turkey still spends too
little on low-cost, but highly effective, interventions such as maternal and
child care. The construction of unnecessary hospitals, the purchase of
inappropriate technology, and poorly trained health care personnel are
j/ The First Heatth Project (Loan 3057-TU for US$75 mitlion approved in 1990) began to: (a) reorganize and
strengthen provincial health services (in-service training, civil works, and procurement); and
(b) strengthen institutional capacity in policymaking, planning, programing, management, monitoring,
research and evaluation (human resources development, heaLth information systems, finance reforms,
primary health care, hospital decentralization, management reforms, drug management and school of public
health).
Z/ The next Country Assistance Strategy Paper is scheduled for Board presentation in January 1995.



expensive and wasteful of public resources. The importance of appropriate
public policies to obtain better value for money spent on health care,
therefore, cannot be overstated, especially when the public budget is under
severe pressure. The lessons learned from implementation of the First Health
Project, and experience gained elsewhere in the world, give the Bank a good
vantage point to support the MOH in making more appropriate resource
allocation choices.
8.    Finally, many of the current deficiencies in the health sector must be
confronted at a very difficult time. The recent large fiscal deficits in
Turkey precipitated a severe financial crisis in 1993/94. This led the
Government to initiate a program of stabilization and reform measures in April
1994. The centerpiece of the program is fiscal adjustment, requiring a
substantial contraction in public spending. Assistance from the international
financial rcommunity has been sought through: (a) an IMF Standby Arrangement
approved in July 1994 to support the stabilization meas"res; and
(b) discussions with the Bank on a proposed Public Sector Adjustment Loan
which will cover the main structural elements contributing to the fiscal
deficit. Within the context of this fiscal crisis, the Government has
continued to attach a high priority to human capital development. With funds
not otherwise available, the Second Health Project will provide the financial
resources for critically needed investments in the health sector and help
redirect health expenditure towards more cost-effective areas of intervention.
9.    Proiect Obiectives.  The primary goal of the Second Health Project is to
reduce the burden of disease due to avoidable illness and disability in
Turkey. To achieve this goal, the specific objectives of the Project are tot
(a) improve equity of access to essential health services in 23 eastern, low-
income, priority provinces; and (b) improve the quality of health care
management in selected institutions.
10.   Proiect Des'7ription.  The proposed Project (US$200.0 million total cost)
will, over seven and a half years, provide fellowships, training, technical
assistance, studies, health programs, computer hardware and software, medical
and office furniture, equipment, vehicles, teaching materials, civil works and
incremental recurrent costs. The Project, which covers 16 percent of Turkey's
total population (9 million people in 1990) in 23 of the country's most
deprived eastern provinces (29 percent of its surface area), consists of the
following two components:
11.   The Primary Health Care Component (US$155.6 million total cost) will
improve equity in access to essential health rervices by: (a) upgrading the
training of primary health care personnel; (b) expanding basic health care
interventions known to be cost-effective; and (c) strengthening the network of
health care facilities to support the abvve activities. It will strengthen
short-term continuing education programs at the provincial level, emphasizing
cost-effective interventions, practical skills in health promotion and disease
prevention, health education, priority health programs, quality assurance in
primary health care and teamwork approaches.



- 4 -
12.   Under this component, among other inputs, the Project will provide for:
(a) curriculum deveiopment, practice-related learning materials and assistance
in revising program evaluation criteria; (b) training of trainers;
(c) strengthening of in-service training programs; (d) support in developing
follow-up and supervision mechanisms; and (e) opportunities for further
training in primary health care related areas. This subcomponent forms the
centerpiece of the Second Health Project. It sets priorities based on the
leading causes of mortality and morbidity, and it will keep these at the
forefront of debates on reforms in the health care system.
13.   The Health Policy and Management Component (US$44.4 million total cost)
will improve the quality of health care management in selected institutions
by: (a) upgrading the training of staff in policymaking, planning, management,
monitoring and evaluation; (b) decentralizing and restructuring management
responsibility in six pilot hospitals; (c) introducing basic management
support systems in Provincial Health Directorates and selected hospitals in
the project provinces as well as evaluating a more comprehensive management
information system in one urban pilot hospital in western Turkey; and
(d) conducting pre-investment studies to support a broader reform of the
health sector. Activities supported under (b) and (c) are explicitly designed
as trial runs for later countrywide implementation.
14.   A special feature of this component will be to ensure that future
reforms in the health sector focus adequately on reducing the burden of
illness due to preventable and treatable diseases or disability in Turkey. A
National Burden of Disease study will be conducted, applying the methodology
developed for the 1993 WDR. When combined with in-country cost-utility
studies, this study will make it possible to determine affordable cost-
effective packages of health interventions that will address a significant
proportion of preventable and treatable diseases in Turkey.
15.   Project Implementation.  The proposed Project will be carried out by MOH
departments, provincial health directorates, health care units in the project
provinces, pilot hospitals and selected universities over a seven and one half
year period. Total project cost is estimated at US$200.0 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$53.9 million equivalent (27 percent of
total project cost), and taxes and duties estimated at about US$19.7 million
equivalent. The proposed Bank loan of US$150.0 million will finance 100
percent of the foreign exchange cost of the Project (US$53.9 million), and 76
percent of the local cost, excluding taxes (US$96.1 million). At the
Government's request, retroactive financing of up to US$10.0 million will be
included to cover the cost of equipment, specialist services and training
necessary for early project start-up. Retroactive financing will be limited
to expenditures incurred 12 months prior to loan signing. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in the Republic of Turkey are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
12765-TU dated August 25, 1994, is being distributed separately.

16.   Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, assurances were provided that:
a.    The Borrower shall, by June 30, 1998: (i) develop and initiate the
implementation of programs similar to the programs referred to
under Part A(2)(a) of the Project [Basic Health Care
Interventions], to improve the quality and effectiveness of, and
access to, primary health care in the Borrower's provinces other
than the project provinces; and (ii) ensure that disposal of
medical wnaterials and waste and protection of X-ray facilities and
staff are undertaken at all times in conformity with the
Borrower's applicable regulations and in accordance with safety,
health and environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank.
b.    For the purpose of facilitating the efficient carrying out by MOH
of its activities under the Project, the Borrower shall maintain,
with membership, resources and terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank, the units, teams and committees referred to in the Annex
to Schedule 5 of the Loan Agreement.
c.    The Borrower shall: (i) ensure that the Project shall be carried
out in accordance with the requirements, and other details set
forth in an operations manual (the Project operations Manual)
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Bank, as the same may be
amended with the agreement of the Bank; (ii) employ consultants,
with qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank, in order to assist in the carrying out of the Project,
including in the management of the implementation thereof, the
design and construction supervision of the works thereunder and
the procurement of goods, works and services therefor;
(iii) ensure (a) the adequate deployment and continuity of primary
health care personnel in the Project Provinces, and (b) the
adequate equipping and supplying with drugs and other consumables
of the primary health care facilities located in the said
provinces, all in accordance with the requirements set forth in
the Project Operations Manual; and (iv) ensure that the training
activities under the Project shall be carried out in accordance
with programs, including time-schedules for the implementatiorn
thereof and criteria for the selection of candidates thereunder,
satisfactory to the Bank.
17.   Environmental AsDects.  This is a Category C project:  "No appreciable
environmental impact". The Project is expected to have a beneficial
environmental impact through improved sanitation facilities for the disposal
of infectious wastes and other solid wastes in the rehabilitated health
centers and hospitals. Environmental considerations, especially concerning
the materials available locally for health center and hospital construction
and maintenance, will be factored into building quality standards and
procurement of building materials.
18.   Program Obiective Catecories.  The Project supports the Government's
policy of improving health and increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of
the health service delivery system. By targeting 23 of the poorest provinces



in the country, and focussing interventions on women and children, the Project
is expected to contribute indirectly to poverty alleviation and the role of
women in development. The Project falls into one category: Poverty Reduction
and Human Resource Development (100 percent).
19.   Participatorv Aioroach.  Provincial and local health authorities
participated extensively in the project preparation process. The Basic Health
Services component of the Project would support NGOs in implementing some of
the community based action programs.
20.   Benefits.  The Project's major benefit will be to reduce the number of
avoidable deaths and disability in the project provinces, especially among
women and children. Targeted investments in training and facilities will lead
to better staffed and equipped essential health services in these provinces.
Such interventions are well known to be cost-effective and a precondition for
improving maternal and child survival. A second benefit of the Project will
be to obtain better value for money spent on health services. Staff in the
project provinces will be trained in health services management and provided
with management support systems. This will allow them to improve the quality
of services provided and avoid wasting scarce resources.
21.   Risks.  A major risk faced by the Project is that it may become
difficult to implement and supervise activities in a number of the project
provinces which currently have accessibility problems. Contingency plans are
included to allow: (a) out-of-province training where necessary; (b) pre-
selection of only urban facilities for new civil works to ensure the
possibility of an adequate supervision, staffing and supply of equipment;
(c) province-by-province costing to allow flexibility under a phased
implementation plan; and (d) use of a professional engineering firm to oversee
the construction programs. A second risk is the limited institutional
capacity of MOH departments, especially in the area of training. This risk
will be mitigated by: (a) deployment of staff trained through fellowships
financed under the First Health Project; (b) technical assistance, including
management contracts for logistic support in coordinating training activities;
(c) decentralization of training efforts to provincial teams; (d) modular
distance-based education; (e) improved coordination of the different General
Directorates in an integrated approach to training activities; and
(f) collaboration with universities as co-participants in the implementation
of training programs.
22.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with
the Articles of Agreement of Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
