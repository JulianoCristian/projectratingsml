for the Private Sector\n            Adjustment Credit Project for Senegal were as follows:\n            outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory.  Some lessons learned included: the Bank\n            should also sharpen and strengthen its political economy\n            skills and assessment in response to complex programs with\n            tough reforms. Therefore, preparation of the country owned\n            strategies or statements should not be misread as readiness\n            for politically difficult reforms. Consensus by key\n            stakeholders across the political arena is essential and not\n            only by technocrats and a few decision makers. Therefore,\n            continuous local ownership by both political representatives\n            and other stakeholders is a key during implementation. In\n            this regard, the Bank should be prepared to spend more time\n            in building local ownership and coalition for specific\n            reforms through broader dialogue and improve its ability to\n            react faster when signs of reluctance appear. The Bank\n            should move fast and develop a toolkit or guidelines on\n            'stakeholder analysis' how to identify and analyze\n            vested groups as some are not as obvious as others due to\n            cultural divergence within a country. It is important to\n            build adequate incentives to ensure completion of actions to\n            complete reforms. Therefore, sequencing of activities within\n            a sector and a tranche is critical for achieving and\n            sustaining reforms, and disbursements should be released\n            only upon full completion of a tranche condition or explicit\n            waivers for only partly met commitments. The balancing act\n            between making tough decisions and being flexible to\n            encourage tough reforms is difficult. Therefore, the Bank\n            needs to learn to take tough decisions on a difficult reform\n            by taking remedies like cancellation or refusal to extend\n            closing dates and let the project close to minimize losses\n            and negative exposure."}, "docdt": "2009-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
