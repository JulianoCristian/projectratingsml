                                    I.BACKGROUND

1.       Senegal i s located on the West Coast o f Africa and i s part o f the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). With a population estimated at about 10
million, its economy i s dominated by a few strategic sectors, including groundnut,
fisheries, and services. The role of the agricultural sector has declined over time, from
almost 15 percent of GDP in 1960 to 7 percent in 2004. The informal sector accounts for
about 60 percent o f its economy. Its rural economy frequently suffers from drought, and
lacks access to basic services and infrastructure, leading to low productivity, high
emigration and higher poverty rates inrural areas. As a result, it i s estimated that almost
half o f the population lives in cities, including 30 percent in Dakar.        This ratio is
projected to increase up to 60 percent by 2015.

2.      Over the past years, Senegal has enjoyed a stable political climate, and has
remained largely unaffected by regional instability. A peace agreement was signed inthe
Casamance at the end o f 2004, generating donor support for the construction effort,
including from the World Bank. InApril 2000, Mr.Abdoulaye Wade, third President o f
the Republic of Senegal, and a new Government assumed office, representing the first
transition to another politicalparty since independence. A new Constitution, approved in
January 2001, reducedthe lengtho f the presidential term from seven to five years and the
unlimited number of terms to two. Legislative elections were concluded in April 2001,
saw a majority o f seats in Parliament won by the President's Party (Senegalese
Democratic Party). The next eight months will see an increase inpolitical activities with
legislative and presidential elections scheduledto take place inFebruary 2007.

                11.RECENTMACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

3.        Over the past decade, real GDP grew on average by about 5 percent annually,
marking the first sustained increase in average per capita growth in Senegal since
independence.     The authorities continued to implement appropriate macroeconomic
policies in 2004 and 2005, consistent with Senegal's three-year arrangement under the
IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The Government maintained its
focus on enhancing revenue mobilization and a tight control on current expenditure,
while allowing for further increases in capital and pro-poor spending. Supported by a
well-targeted fiscal stimulus and a moderate easing o f monetary conditions by the Central
Bank o f West African States, the economy remained on a solid growth and low inflation
trajectory.

4.         Economic performance was strong in2004 and 2005. Despite rising petroleum
prices and the adverse consequences o f the locust invasion, real GDP growth is estimated
to have exceeded 6 percent, supported by the dynamism o f the telecommunication and
construction sectors. While industrial activity slowed down as oil prices rose, the impact
onthe overall economy was limited. Inflationremained subdued, with the annual average
CPI risingby about 0.5 percent in2004 and 1.8 percent in2005, reflectingthe low weight
o f energy in the CPI basket and limited rise in some food prices owing to abundant
supply.

5.         Although the overall fiscal deficit increased to 3.3 and 3.5 percent of GDP in
2004 and 2005, the fiscal stance remained consistent with the authorities' goal o f
preserving debt sustainability.              Public sector external debt declined by about 12
percentage points, to 42.8 percent o f GDP at end-2005. This good performance reflected
larger than expected revenues and grants, an accumulationo f deposits o f public entities at
the treasury, and a decline in current expenditures.'               It was also the result of a series of
tax reforms aimed at reducing tax rates and broadening the tax base, especially on direct
taxation, paving the way to further tax reforms in 2005 and 2006. These developments
offset a sharp increase in capital expenditures caused by a faster than expected rate o f
project implementation, notably in projects funded by external sources.                             Spending
irregularities o f about 1percent of GDP occurred inmid-2003 (but came to light inJune
2004), requiring the authorities, in consultation with the Bank and the IMF, to adopt a
series of measuresaimed at improving procurement practices, including curtailing the use
o f emergency procedures (without competitive tender).2

6.         The recent economic growthhas been associated with a widening of the current
account deficit from 6.0 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 7.6 percent o f GDP in 2005. This
deterioration was driven by strong domestic demand, mainly from the public sector, and
lackluster export performance. However, substantial private capital inflows, combined
with debt relief, led to an increase of 23 percent in the net international reserves o f the
Central Bank. The gross official reserves reached about 4.7 months o f imports at the end
o f 2005.

7.         The macroeconomic objectives for 2006 include real GDP growth of about 4.5
percent and consumer price inflation of about 2.6 percent, a slight deterioration due to
two shocks (permanent increase in international oil prices and the financial crisis in the
largest industrial company in Senegal).3 The overall fiscal deficit (including grants), i s

Update, June 2006.

PRGF, January 2006.
3 The macroeconomic projections for 2006 are being revised around a GDP growth o f 4.0 percent and
higher fiscal and current account deficits as the result o f several factors that took place during the first
semester o f 2006. While it i s difficult to quantify the expected impact o f higher international oil prices on
domestic economic growth, the Government estimates indicate that a US$5 per barrel increase inoil prices
above the current World Economic Outlook projections would cut average annual GDP growth rate by
about 0.6 percentage points during 2006-2010, and would worsen the external current account deficit by
about 0.6 percent o f GDP per year during the same period. The financial crisis in the chemical company
(ICs) may induce a decline inGDP growth o f about 1percent according to recent government's estimates.

                                               - 3 -


expected to increase to about 4.0-4.3 percent o f GDP, partly because of compensating
measures required to absorb external shocks (oil price and flood) and higher
infrastructure pend ding,^ but it should be almost entirely financed by higher tax revenues
and external resources. The external current account deficit (including official transfers),
i s projected to remain around 7.6 percent o f GDP in 2006, as a result o f the larger than
expected energy imports and the lack o f impetus in exports. As discussed in the next
section, giventhe favorable initial macro-economic conditions, low debt levels, absence
o f central bank financing, and little risk of crowding out the private sector from the credit
market, such a level o f fiscal and external deficits should be accommodated without
underminingmacroeconomic stability.

      111.    MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

8.         The medium-term scenario i s based on real GDP annual growth o f about 5
percent and continued low inflation during 2007-10. This growth rate is about the same
level as the average growth rate since the devaluation o f the CFAF in 1994.                             Its
attainment would require the continuous implementation o f sound macroeconomic
policies, market-oriented structural reforms, and an efficient government investment
program. Private savings should increase moderately, facilitated by rising real per capita
income and financial sector development. Reflecting these trends, the external current
account deficit (including official transfers) would decline marginally from the projected
7.6 percent of GDP in2006, to around 6.3 percent by 2010. While globally positive, the
medium-term outlook is subject to a number o f downside risks. Senegal's economy
remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including higher oil prices, severe droughts,
locust invasion, and severe political strife inthe WAEMU region. The relative fragility
o f the external balance also emphasizes the need to promote private sector development,
especially export-oriented activities. At this stage, the Senegalese export sector lacks
dynamism, as it needs to diversify beyond traditional resources such as vegetable oil and
phosphoric acid.5

9.         With monetary and exchange rate policies determined at the regional level,
fiscal policy will remain the main instrument o f macroeconomic policy in Senegal,
supported by structural reforms. Over the recent years, fiscal policy has been conducted
in a prudent manner, leading to low primary deficits.                    This fiscal stance has been
buttressed by the cautious monetary policy of the BCEAO, which is aimed at
underpinningthe exchange rate anchor, and delivering low inflation. The authorities
have rightly put increasing attention on the needto improvethe allocative and operational
efficiencies o f public spending as a way to maximize the impact of their fiscal policy on
growth and equity. On the structural front, reforms have been implemented in the
groundnut and electricity sectors, sometimes with delays and occasional backtracking on
initial plans, hindering the realization o f the country's growth potential and its poverty
reduction goals. Nevertheless, the Government has privatized many public enterprises,
enhanced the environment for private sector activities, and made some improvements in
the country's infrastructure. Looking forward, the authorities should continue prudent
fiscal policies, and give priority to addressing the structural bottlenecks in order to
enhance the efficiency o f the economy, particularly inthe export sector.

10.        Senegal has exited from the enhanced HIPC Initiative with a good basis for
maintaining sustainable external debt levels over the medium term, especially if
borrowing remains at concessional terms. This positive assessment has been reinforced
by its recent qualification to the Multilateral Debt-Reduction Initiative (MDRI),
equivalent to a savings o f about US$60 million indebt-service per year. The preliminary
result of the Debt-Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted by the IMF and the Bank

5 A clear indication of the concentration of Senegal's exports is that in2002, the top five exports at the 8-
digit Harmonized System levelrepresented over 40 percent oftotal exports (petroleum, crude vegetable oil,
phosphoric acid, lobster and shrimps).

                                                 - 6 -


reveals that the level o f public external debt will be as low as 11 percent o f GDP at the
end of 2006.6 This unprecedented low ratio indicates that Senegal's public debt should
be sustainable over the medium term, even in the case o f negative shocks, such as a
decline ineconomic growth and/or deterioration inthe terms o f trade.

         IV. PROGRESSINIMPLEMENTING THE REFORMPROGRAM

Overview
11.        The Private Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC) is an integral part of the Bank
strategy set forth in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Senegal presented to the
Board on April 17,2003, as well as innew CAS currently under preparationwith Board
submission scheduled for later in FY07. The objective o f the Credit is to support the
Government in the implementation of sector reforms aimed at improving the investment
climate and accelerating private sector growth and employment. The PSAC supports the
government's Poverty Reduction Strategy through improving the investment climate and
implementing key sector reforms by: (i)        restructuring the edible oil sector by improving
the competitive environment in which it operates, through elimination or reduction o f
policy distortions associated with non-tariff barriers and other domestic protection
mechanisms, and o f public interventions; (ii)       supporting the implementation o f a private
enterprise tax regime that stimulates investmentsthrough a level playing field and lower
taxes, and allocates user fees more effectively for private sector purposes; (iii)          reforming
postal services by introducing greater competition into the sector, restructuringthe postal
enterprise so as to enhance its sustainability and to create an autonomous financial
subsidiary that would provide savings and payment and transfer services; and (iv)
bringingchanges to the pensions system to make it financially sustainable and improve
its corporate governance.

12.        To date, an edible oil tranche release was made on January 28, 2005 following
project effectiveness which was confirmed on January 12, 2005. This was followed by a
first floating fiscal tranche release that was released on September 27, 2005. Interms o f
the two outstanding tranche releases - for the postal and pensions sectors - after a period
of delay, there has been considerable progress since the November 2005 IDA supervision
mission when the IDA team formally confirmed that the project would not deliver on its
outstanding project commitments before the December 2005 project closing date.
Following consultation with the key reform stakeholders responsible for the two
outstanding tranche conditions, the Government made a request for a project extension
which, as per IDA advice, was supported with a detailed implementation plan. On this
basis, IDA approved a 14-month first extension until February 28, 2007.The IDA
supervision mission o f February 2005 reviewed and determined that there had been
successful progress to date against actions and milestones set out inthe implementation
plan-inparticular inrespect of the postal reform.

13.        While there has beennotable progress over the past ten months inrespect o f the
outstanding tranche conditions pertainingto the postal and the pensions sectors, there has

                                             - 7 -


also been the need to address some recent policy actions taken by the Government that
impact the PSAC-related reforms undertaken to date inthe edible oil sector. This matter
i s dealt with more fully inthe following section.

Edible OilSector Reform

14.       About 30 percent o f the Senegalesepopulation directly or indirectly derives part
of its livelihood from the groundnut sector. The overall liberalization efforts pursued by
the Government inthe 1990s, and more recently in2001 with the divestiture o f the seeds
distribution subsidiary o f the monopolistic groundnut processing public enterprise
(SONACOS), have encouraged some efficiency gains. A major further step was taken
with the completionofthe SONACOS privatizationprocess inApril 2005.

15.       A sector reform strategy, outlined inthe government's Edible Oil Sector Policy
Letter calls for the following broad actions to be taken: (i) elimination of trade policy,
and other regulatory and financial sector distortions; (ii)divestiture of SONACOS; (iii)
complementary sector reforms, involving diversification o f production in groundnut
producing areas, as well as possible downstream measuresto meet untapped demand; and
(iv) clearance of accumulated liabilities, estimated at under CFAF 10 billion, through a
one-time financial restructuring o f the sector.

16.       The PSAC focuses on eliminating the most serious trade policy and domestic
distortions.   These eliminations are seen as key to the effective development and
diversification of the sector. The following condition o f effectiveness was substantially
met in December 2004, after three extensions, when the President signed the law
eliminating the taxes that provided protection to SONACOS:             "the Borrower has
implemented the agreed action plan for the edible oil sector reform regarding the
elimination or reduction, as the case may be, of the economic distortions in the areas of
trade, domestic market andfinancial sector policy, inter alia, through the elimination of
the TCIand Taxe Spe`cifiqueon edible oils."

 17.       The Government first        suspended the application of the TCI (Taxe
Conjoncturelle d'Importation) benefit to the edible oils through administrative action
carried out at the level o f the Director General of Customs.        This action was then
complemented by the passage, on December 14, 2004 of law No. 2004-34, which
involvedthe abrogation andreplacement of article 360 ofthe General Import Code with a
revision that eliminates the protective tax (Taxe Spe`czfique) imposed on both processed
and unprocessed edible oils. This law was scheduled to go into effect on December 31,
2005, the original closing date o f the PSAC. Due to an upsurge o f palm oil imports in
2004 and 2005, the Government additionally sought further protection to the domestic
edible oil industry and passed, on December 16, 2005, a new protective law that extends
protection against all importededible oils, regardless of their origin. This law, however,
didnot comply with WAEMU rules and WTO provisionsregarding safeguards measures;
and it constituted, in the Bank's view, a potential reversal o f policy commitments made
under the PSAC. Following extensive consultations between the Bank and the
Government and based on in-depth analysis on international and regional trade
regulations, the Government passed a corrective legislation on July 13, 2006 providing

                                            - 8 -


for a transitory protection which conforms with WTO and WAEMU rules. This i s
accepted as consistent with the terms of reform agreedto under the PSAC.

Tax Reform

18.       The government's decision to proceed with a tax reform initiative arose out o f
in-depth diagnostic work undertaken in collaboration with FIAS. Investment in Senegal
was being deterred by excessively high tax rates, further complicated by a multitude o f
taxes, user fees and heavy administrative arrangements. The system was recognized to
lack transparency and encourage rent-seeking.

19.       The tax reform process commenced with the prior Trade Reform and
Competitiveness Credit (Cr. 3419) which assisted in the implementation o f reforms
covering VAT, tariffs and business taxation. The PSAC extends this reform drive further
with a program to reduce a number of taxes, including the Marginal Effective Tax rate
(METR) which decreased from 45 percent to 28 percent. Additionally, the reform
package harmonizes the vocational training tax treatment o f national and foreign workers
and allocates 30 percent ofproceeds, which the Ministry ofthe Economy and Finance has
confirmed amounts to US$1 million for 2006, to a matching grant facility in operation
under the Private Investment Promotion Project (Cr. 3767). Discussions are under way
between the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and the private sector to agree on the
modalities for the deployment of this allocationto the matching grant facility.

20.       The reform also includes the rationalization of investmentcode waivers granted
in regard to the consumption tax and import duties to bring these in line with the
WAEMU Common External Tariff and the Value-Added Tax Scheme. This tax reform
programhas been widely supported by the Government as well as the private sector, with
a further METR reduction to 25 percent, which goes beyond even the original objective
of the PSAC tax reform activities.

Postal ServicesReform

21.       The postal sector reform inthe PSAC is based on the Government o f Senegal's
Letter o f Postal Sector Policy o f April 17, 2003, which includes actions to: (i)improve
overall performance through a progressive sector liberalization and increased private
sector participation; (ii)modernize the legal and regulatory framework and strengthen
sector regulation; (iii)
                       safeguard the right to basic communications for all citizens through
a funding mechanism to support the cost o f universal postal services obligations; (iv)
transform the historicalpostal operator into a modem and performing corporation through
the definition and implementation of a new corporate strategy; and (v) promote the
sustainable development o f postal financial services in order to improve access o f the
population to basic financial and savings services, and channel these savings towards
private investment funds.


22.       The PSAC supports (i)   ongoing reforms aimed at introducing more competition
in postal services, strengthening corporate governance, and restructuring the postal

                                                - 9 -


corporation so as to improve its sustainability and its service quality; and (ii)
implementation o f the required financial restructuring o f the operator. The policy and
institutional reform actions set out in the PSAC postal tranche release conditions are
further supported by a complementary capacity building and capital investment program
financed out of the Private Investment Promotioninvestment credit (PIPP).

23.         After an initial period o f satisfactory progress, the postal services reform was
slowed considerably in late 2004 for about eight months, mainly due to the change o f
managing director and the lack of sustained support from Government. However, since
September 2005, La Poste and its stakeholders have proceeded purposefully and
effectively with the PSAC elements o fthe overall sector reform agenda.

24.         The PSAC conditionalities were initially designed to ensure long-term
sustainability o f the reform impact interms of increased contribution o f the postal system
to the national economy. A new legal and regulatory framework i s now inplace, and La
Poste yielded a small net result in 2005, for the first time in more than a decade.
However, human resources management, including personnel status and indebtedness,
remains an issue that needs to be addressed by the Board o f Managers together with the
recommendations o f the Task Force that was set up earlier this year with the intention to
make proposals to the Board of Managers by August 2006.

25.         While financial sustainability of the Socie`te` Nationale de La Poste (SNP) has
significantly improved over the last three years, the balance remains fragile. SNP i s not
profitable enough to self-fund capacity investments. Without those investments, it will be
difficult to implement the new development objectives in terms o f information and
communication technology. Yet, investment in Information Communication Technology
(ICT) and interconnection of the post offices are an absolute prerequisite for a postal
operator to move into the e-economy. SNP's shareholder will need to continue supporting
the company on a fair andtransparent level.

Pension Reform

26.         World Bank engagement inpensions inSenegal dates back to 1999. By 2001, a
comprehensive report on the various pension schemes was producedby a team o f experts
working closely with the Government o f Senegal.7 Through its analysis of the Fonds
National de Retraite (FNR) scheme, the report contributed to the parametric reform that
was implementedin early 2002. The government's pensionreform strategy i s described
in the sector policy statement dated June 6, 2003. This was followed by the pension
component o f the PSAC, wherein the Government committed to undertake a number o f
policy measures with a view towards incremental pension reform. The implementation
o f these policy changes requires a series o f concrete steps including improvements to the
governance systems; management and fiduciary controls o f key pension schemes,
including changes to existing information systems; professional advice regarding
investment policy; and, fiscal actions to address sustainability issues facing some of the


   "Building a secure, sustainable and modern pension system in Senegal" (2001). The report was also
translated to French.

                                             - 10-

schemes. The implementation requirements o f this reform effort are being supported
under the pension sub-component ofthe PIPP.

27.       To date, two o f the five measures required to satisfy tranche release
conditionality have been met. These include: (i)      creation o f the Conseil de Supervision
et Re'gulation des Institutions de Se'curite'Sociale (COSRISS) and (ii)  clearance o f arrears
between the Government and I' Institution de Pre'voyance Retraite du Se'ne'gal (IPRES).
Further to the June 2006 supervision mission, the Government and IDA have agreed on
the specific steps required to satisfy the three remaining conditions concerning private
pensions, the IPRES investment policy and the actions to be taken on the question o f
integrating IPRES and FNR. Based on milestones established in consultation with the
technical team andthe Minister o f Labor, who ledthe government's team duringthe June
2006 mission, release conditions for the final pensionfloating tranche will have been met
by the end of October 2006. What will be key to successful outcomes inregard to these
remainingtranche condition milestones will be the proactive leadership of the Minister o f
Labor to steer this stage of the reform effort through to its conclusion.

            V. PROGRESS AGAINST TRANCHE RELEASE CRITERIA

28.       The government has maintained a satisfactory niacroeconomic framework, as
agreed with the Bank and the IMF. This has been confirmed by the recent Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) preparation as described in section 111. Further, the Bank i s
satisfied with the progress achieved and maintained by the program. The first tranche
was disbursedupon effectiveness on January 12, 2005. The conditions o f release o f the
floating tranche related to the Tax Reform Plan were met and this tranche was released
September 27,2005.

29.       The conditions ofrelease ofthe floating tranche listedinPart B of Schedule 2 of
the Development Credit Agreement betweenthe Borrower and IDA related to the Postal
Services Reform state that the following conditions mustbe fulfilled:

1.    The effective transfer of responsibility for the regulation of postal services from
      SNP (Socie'te' nationale de La poste) to ART (Agence de rigulation des
      telecommunications) - This condition has been met.

Two laws (No. 2006-01 on postal sector; No. 2006-02 modifying the 2001
telecommunication sector law) were passed and endorsed in early January 2006. In
addition to opening the sector to competition on the letter segment up to 500g, with a
view to progressively lowering this threshold towards international standards (50g and
below), this new legal framework entrusts the postal regulation to Autorite' de Regulation
des Telecommunications (ART), transformed into Autorite' de Regulation. des
Telecommunications et des Postes (ARTP). There i s ongoing technical assistance with
ARTP aimed at supporting the new regulator to get started, notably concerning the postal
universal service obligations and funding mechanisms, and the licensing and
liberalization processes.

                                            - 11-


2.      Performance-based agreement entered into between the Borrower and SNP for
        the operation ofpostal services - This conditionhas beenmet.

The 2005-2007 performance-based agreement was signed between the Borrower and
SNP on November 16, 2005, with retroactive effectiveness as o f January 2005. Annexes
o f the agreement provide with performance indicators for operational, management and
financial performance. Stakeholders have started to assess the first year implementation
o f the agreement, with a view to preparing a thorough monitoring report at its mid-term,
expected to be transmitted to IDA by the end September 2006. This agreement provides
the platform for an improved performance-based monitoring o f the State-owned company
that will allow the enterprise and its shareholder to look at the cost structure and financial
performance from a strict corporate angle.

3.      A subsidiary of SNP is created and is in charge of postal financial services
        previously managed by SNP - This conditionhasbeenmet.

The creation of the postal financial subsidiary (PosteFinances)was effective on February
20, 2006 when the statutes of the company were signed by the shareholders (SNP,
Mutuelle d`kpargne et de cridit des agents du secteur public et parapublic (MECAP),
personnel), completing an institutional process that consisted inter alia o f the decision o f
SNP's Board of Directors (December 2005) to create the subsidiary fully owned by the
Government of the postal savings books (Caisse nationale d'epargne) and the compte-
cheques postaux (CCP). SNP provided for FCFA 250 million o f initial capital by end
March 2006. An increase to FCFA 1 billion i s scheduled by the end o f 2006, to meet
Commission bancaire de 1`Afrique centrale (COBAC) recommendations.

This scheme reflects the compromise reached in the summer of 2005 after a Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) report, prepared by the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank's financial sector department, ruledthat the postal financial services
subsidiary should in a first period strengthen its current operations before harnessing
private sector participation and moving into lending operations. Inthis respect, an ad hoc
specific prudential regime i s also under definition for PosteFinances,which will apply as
long as the firm i s not formally under the Central Bank's regulation.

Duringthis coming transitional period until the new subsidiary can become independent
o f the mother company for working capital and cash flow. a number o f measures are
being taken: (i)new convention for clearing o f the "comptes-chequespostaux" (CCP)
                 a
with the Treasury is being drafted and should be finalized by September 2006; (ii)         an
accounting scheme i s being introduced to track         all cashflows as well as financial
transfers provided byLa Poste.The subsidiary i s to refundits mother company as soon as
its working capital and cash flows are stabilized; (iii) transitional organizational chart
                                                          a
was established and its personnel assigned early in February. In coordination with the
unions, a new personnel status, based on national bank branch models, is being drafted
for the subsidiary employees. The 190 staff currently assigned to PosteFinances will
have until December 2006 to decide whether they want to remain with the subsidiary
(under a new status) or returnto the mother company.

                                   V. CONCLUSION

30.      In view of the overall progress with the implementation of the Postal Sector
Reform Program supported by the Credit and in compliance with the specific conditions
of release described in Section IV, para 19 items 1-3, the Association has informed the
Borrower of the availability of the Postal Services Reform floating tranche inthe amount
of SDR 6 million.
