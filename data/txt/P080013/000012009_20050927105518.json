       The objective of the Project is to support the Government in\n            the implementation of sub-sector reforms aimed at improving\n            the investment climate, and accelerating private sector\n            growth, and employment. The PSAC supports the\n            Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy through\n            improvements within the investment climate, and\n            implementation of key sector reforms. The first tranche was\n            disbursed upon effectiveness. The conditions of release of\n            the floating tranche as listed in the Development Credit\n            Agreement between the Borrower and the International\n            Development Association (IDA) related to the Tax Reform\n            Plan, state the conditions that need to be fulfilled.\n            Therefore, in view of the overall performance and progress\n            with the implementation of the Tax Reform Plan supported by\n            the Credit, and in compliance with the specific conditions\n            of release, the Association has informed the Borrower of the\n            availability of the tax reform floating tranche, in the\n            amount of SDR 4.7 million."}, "docdt": "2005-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
