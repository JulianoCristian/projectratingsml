Water Supply, and Sanitation Project, the\n            environmental assessment explores potential adverse effects\n            on the environment. Although sewage collection systems are\n            in place, waste water treatment is rare, and, industrial,\n            and waste water effluents discharge - untreated - into the\n            area's rivers. Furthermore, Mostar's surrounding\n            areas, have no sewers, but latrines, rarely with any septic\n            tanks. This poses serious bio-diversity threats, due to the\n            potential effluent toxicity, and on the population's\n            health, since the risks of insufficient quantity, and/or\n            quality of drinking water, are high. Measures to mitigate\n            adversity suggest, primarily, that adequate institutional\n            arrangements enforce monitoring of microbiological, and\n            physico-chemical testing, to control health, and sanitary\n            risks. Inspection of industrial, and domestic effluent\n            controls should be conducted to prevent ecological\n            degradation. During construction, it is recommended to\n            phase-out water supply systems, and, although solid waste\n            management is not part of this report - in light of the high\n            costs of waste water treatment plants -, the use of adequate\n            septic tanks is recommended."}, "docdt": "2000-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
