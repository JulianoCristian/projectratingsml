Lesson One: Closely project objectives to\n            country aspirations during project preparation and to the\n            capacity of the government and agency to implement them.\n            Lesson Two: Increase the chances of a satisfactory outcome\n            and of sustainable benefits by having a sustained\n            relationship with a city. The continuous and widespread\n            support of the rebuilding of the city of Mostar built trust\n            in the Bank as a development partner and fostered acceptance\n            of Bank advice and assistance. Lesson Three: Small borrowers\n            pay a relatively large cost to comply with the Bank's\n            fiduciary requirements for Financial Management Systems\n            (FMS). Costs mandated under the Bank's fiduciary FMS\n            requirements should be related to the economic capacity of\n            the Borrower, the size of the project and the value gained.\n            Despite improvements in the Bank's FMS requirements\n            since project preparation, they continue to be both costly\n            and unrelated to client value. Lesson Four: The Project\n            showed the virtues of limiting the externally contracted\n            consultancy to that which the Mostar Water and Sewerage\n            Utility was not able to create with its own staff. The\n            decision to create financial and technical project\n            implementation capacity within the utility itself, with its\n            own staff that stayed on past the project's end, was\n            vindicated by economy and institution building. Lesson Five:\n            The Project demonstrates that a public sector operator can\n            improve service quality and operational efficiency without\n            the help of private sector operators."}, "docdt": "2005-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
