Dear Governor Binh,

Multi-Donor Trust Fund Grant
Notice of Change of Trust Fund Number from TF0131 78 to TF013504

Development / International Development Association (the "World Bank") received the
countersigned Grant Agreement for the above-referenced Grant between the Socialist
Republic of Vietnam and the World Bank, dated October 19, 2012. We have detected a
problem in coding this Trust Fund number in the World Bank's system, therefore we
