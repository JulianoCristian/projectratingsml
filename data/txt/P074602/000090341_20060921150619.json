Rehabilitation Credit for Burundi were as follows: the\n            outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, the Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project: In a\n            delicate political transition process, following years of\n            conflict, it is unrealistic to expect a government to carry\n            out a broad and complex economic reform program. The\n            operation should have been sharply focused on improving\n            public finance management. The private sector development\n            component was not sufficiently prepared. Before launching a\n            privatization program, it is important to liquidate a number\n            of public enterprises, which are technically bankrupt,\n            potentially costly to be restructured, and therefore, are\n            not expected to generate any positive value added under\n            private management. Clearance of government arrears to the\n            private sector is important to help private operators resume\n            their activities in a post-conflict context. The reform of\n            the coffee industry is essential for improving\n            Burundi's exports and the incomes of a large number of\n            small farmers. Improving public finance management was\n            essential for enabling the transition government and its\n            successor to finance critical programs aimed at national\n            reconciliation, enhanced security, and rehabilitation of\n            economic and social infrastructure. The rehabilitation\n            program was implemented on behalf of line ministries by a\n            special unit under streamlined procedures."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
