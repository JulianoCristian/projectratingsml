the Executive\n            Directors approved an Economic Rehabilitation Credit (ERC)\n            of SDR 40.8 million to the Republic of Burundi. The ERC is\n            an integral part of the Bank's Transitional Support\n            Strategy (TSS) discussed by the Board on March 7, 2002, to\n            support the transition process and the implementation of the\n            Government's reform program. The Credit was declared\n            effective on October 23, 2002, and the first tranche, was\n            released upon effectiveness. A second tranche was to be made\n            available for disbursement upon liberalization of the\n            Borrower's foreign exchange system and fulfillment of\n            budget-related conditions for that tranche described in this\n            memorandum, and a third and final tranche, was to be made\n            available for disbursement upon fulfillment of the\n            conditions for that tranche. This memorandum informs\n            Executive Directors that the Second Tranche has been made\n            available for disbursement. This memorandum summarizes these\n            reviews and reports on the actions taken by the Government.\n            It concludes that: (a) the macroeconomic policy framework\n            for growth and poverty reduction is consistent with the\n            objectives of the reform program; (b) satisfactory progress\n            has been achieved in the overall execution of the program;\n            and (c) all specific conditions pertaining to the release of\n            the Second Tranche have been met."}, "docdt": "2003-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
