REPUBLIC 
OF 
BURUNDI 
Economic Rehabilitation Credit 
(Cr. 3710-BU) 
Release 
of 
the Second Tranche 
April 
25,2003 
1. 
On 
August  29,  2002,  the  Executive  Directors  approved 
an 
Economic  Rehabilitation 
Credit 
(ERC) 
of 
SDR 
40.8 
million 
to 
the Republic of Burundi. The ERC 
is 
an integral part 
of 
the 
Bank’s Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) discussed by the Board on March 
7, 
2002, 
to 
support 
the 
transition process and the implementation of 
the 
Government’s reform program. 
The 
Credit 
was declared  effective on October 23, 2002, and the first tranche, of 
SDR 
15.1 
million, 
was 
released upon effectiveness. 
A 
second tranche, 
of 
SDR 
15.1 
million, was 
to 
be 
made available for 
disbursement upon liberalization of 
the 
Borrower’s foreign exchange system and fulfillment 
of 
budget-related conditions for that tranche described in this memorandum, and 
a 
third and final 
tranche, 
of 
SDR 
10.6 
million, was to be made available for disbursement upon fulfillment 
of 
the 
conditions for that tranche. 
2. 
This 
memorandum informs Executive Directors that 
the 
Second Tranche, 
of 
SDR 
15.1 
million, 
has 
been  made  available  for  disbursement.  As  provided 
in 
Section 
3.01 
of 
and 
Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement, staff have reviewed with 
the 
Government the 
progress achieved 
in 
implementing the program. This memorandum summarizes these reviews 
and reports 
on 
the actions taken 
by 
the 
Government. 
It 
concludes that: (a) 
the 
macroeconomic 
policy  framework  for  growth 
and 
poverty  reduction  is  consistent with 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
reform  program; 
(b) 
satisfactory progress  has  been  achieved in  the  overall  execution 
of 
the 
program;  and (c) all specific conditions pertaining 
to 
the release 
of 
the Second Tranche have 
been met.

OVERALL PROGRESS 
OF 
THE PROGRAM 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
1. 
The people  of Burundi 
are 
making efforts 
to 
bring to 
an  end 
a 
crisis  engendered 
by 
recurrent conflicts 
and 
rivalry between the 
two 
main ethnic groups, the Hutu 
and 
Tutsi. 
The 
last 
conflict, which broke out 
in 
1993, resulted in the death 
of a 
large number of civilians 
and 
left 
thousands 
of 
victims. 
It 
is 
believed that 
more 
than 250,000 people were killed 
in 
the eight-year 
civil war, and the number 
of 
internally displaced persons 
and 
refugees 
is 
estimated 
at 
1.2 
million. 
The increasing social 
and 
economic costs of this conflict prompted the international community 
to  help 
Burundi  establish 
a 
framework 
for 
negotiations towards  national  reconciliation  and 
durable peace. Negotiations 
in 
Arusha, Tanzania resulted 
in a 
comprehensive peace agreement 
(Arusha Accord),  signed 
in 
August 2000. 
A 
new 
power-sharing Government, inaugurated 
on 
November 
1, 
2001 
in 
accordance with  this  Accord, 
has 
the  responsibility 
to 
administer the 
country during  the  36-month  transition period  leading to  general  democratic  elections. 
The 
transition period 
has 
two 
phases, 
to 
respect the power-sharing principle. Pierre 
Buyoya, 
a 
Tutsi, 
has 
led 
the  first  18-month  period,  with  Domitien  Ndayizeye, 
a 
Hutu,  as  Vice  President. 
Beginning May 
1 
, 
2003, 
Mr. 
Ndayizeye 
will 
lead 
the Government 
in 
the second 18-month period 
with 
a 
Tutsi, Alphonse Kadege, confirmed by the Senate 
and 
National Assembly 
on 
April 25 as 
the 
new 
Vice President. However, the overall situation 
on 
the ground remains fragile. 
2. 
Burundi  continues  to  face  difficult  development  challenges.  These  include  fostering 
inclusiveness,  peace 
and 
security,  promoting  national  reconciliation 
and 
good  governance, 
resettling 
and 
reintegrating  displaced  persons 
and 
other  victims 
of 
conflict,  rehabilitating 
destroyed economic 
and 
social infrastructure, revitalizing the economy 
and 
strengthening human 
resource capacities. 
3. 
In 
this environment, beginning 
in 
1999 the World 
Bank 
provided emergency assistance 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
an 
Interim Strategy (Report No. 1592-BU dated 
July 
30, 
1999) to 
help 
support the peace process, jump-start the economy, 
and 
rekindle 
the 
reform program. Building 
on 
this, the TSS discussed 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
March 
7, 
2002 
made 
an 
exceptional IDA allocation to 
Burundi 
to 
consolidate 
the 
progress made 
and to 
support economic reforms 
for 
growth and 
poverty reduction. Within the TSS, the Economic Rehabilitation Credit (ERC) 
is 
designed to 
support  the  transition process  in Burundi  through 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
the recovery  of  the 
economy 
by 
helping 
to 
build the foundation 
for 
(a) the improvement of public service delivery 
and basic  social  services, (b) the  Government's efforts to  deepen  institutional 
and 
structural 
reforms 
for 
sustained economic recovery 
and 
poverty reduction, and (c) the establishment 
of a 
track record for early access 
to 
relief under the Enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Country 
(HPC) 
Initiative. The 
ERC 
also builds on the reforms 
and 
analytical work 
on 
the public  expenditure 
management system carried out under the TSS. 
11. 
RECENT 
POLITICAL 
AND 
SECURITY 
DEVELOPMENTS 
4. 
Restoration 
of 
peace. 
The 
political  transition 
is 
proceeding  with  the  handover  from 
President 
Buyoya 
to Vice-president Ndayizeye 
on 
schedule 
for 
May 
1, 2003. While 
two 
rebel 
groups, "Forces Nationales  de Liberation" (FNL) and  "Forces 
de 
Defense 
de 
la 
Democratie'' 
2 
Page  4
(FDD),  did  not 
sign  the 
Peace 
Accord 
and  were  not 
part 
of  the  Transition  Government, 
negotiations that continued under 
the joint 
chairmanship 
of 
President Mkapa of Tanzania and 
Deputy President 
Zuma 
of 
South Africa 
led to 
signing a cease-fire in 2002. The leadership of 
the 
two 
groups 
joined the 
transition Government. Leaders of 
both 
sides of the ethnic divide appear 
determined 
to 
do 
whatever they can 
to keep 
the 
peace process  on track. However, the peace 
process 
is 
fluid 
and 
still unstable. One FNL-PALIPEHUTU faction and a breakaway element of 
the 
CNDD-FDD continue violent opposition despite a ceasefire signed 
with the 
CNDD-FDD 
on 
December 
2, 
2002. 
Much 
of 
the 
country 
is 
safe but  insecurity  continues 
in  some 
regions, 
including  the  district  neighboring  Bujumbura,  Bujumbura  Rurale  province.  International 
observers 
have 
been 
in 
place since March 2003, and an international peace-keeping force, acting 
under 
the 
authority 
of 
the African Union 
and 
initially be 
made 
up of 
1,500 
troops from South 
Africa, 
900 
from 
Ethiopia 
and 
200 
from Mozambique, is being mobilized and will 
be 
in 
place 
by 
May. 
The 
force's 
mandate 
will be to demobilize and disarm 
all 
armed groups 
and to 
set 
up 
an 
integrated national  army 
and 
police  force. A committee to monitor 
the 
cease-fire, comprising 
representatives 
from 
the government, rebel groups and 
the 
international peacekeeping force, 
was 
established 
in 
February 2003. The Government has asked 
the 
World Bank 
to 
lead 
efforts to help 
it 
design  a Burundi  Ex-Combatants  Assistance  Program  and to  provide  financial  assistance, 
within the 
framework 
of 
the Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRP). 
5. 
The peace process in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo 
is on 
track, terminating 
on April 2 
2003 
with 
an 
agreement for a transition government. Nonetheless, 
the 
considerable 
violence that continues 
in 
the Eastern parts 
of 
the DRC has 
a direct implication for Burundi, 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
security as well as 
its 
markets. 
In 
recent bilateral discussions, Burundi agreed to 
withdraw 
its 
forces  from  the 
DRC 
while 
the 
Congolese  government pledged  to  discontinue 
support to  the Burundian  armed groups. 
The 
international  community's  support for both 
the 
Lusaka process (which deals with 
the 
conflict 
in the 
DRC) and 
the 
Arusha process 
is 
essential for 
consolidating peace 
in the 
Great Lakes Region. 
6. 
Within 
the 
transitional 
govemment,  people 
are  collaborating. 
This  collaboration 
continues 
at 
all levels. There are indications of commitment 
of 
most stakeholders to 
peace 
and 
the creation of a viable transition process, characterized 
by 
potentially credible institutions,  a 
strong 
anti-poverty  program  and  the  protection 
of 
human 
rights.  Burundi  has  produced  in 
November 2002 
an 
Interim PRSP (I-PRSP), 
which 
has been submitted to 
the 
Bank and IMF for 
their 
joint 
staff 
appraisal. 
An 
appraisal mission 
is 
planned  for 
June 
2003.  The 
2003 
budget 
reflects priorities identified 
in the 
I-PRSP. 
7. 
As 
peace 
progresses 
and 
takes 
hold, 
Burundi 
faces 
an 
enormous 
problem 
of 
demobilization of combatants, 
the 
resettlement 
of 
a 
million 
persons-nearly 
15 
percent 
of 
the 
population-who 
are refugees or internally displaced, and assistance to 
those have 
suffered from 
conflict internally. 
Social 
and 
economic institutions 
must 
be 
rebuilt and social institutions that 
discourage violence 
as 
a method of resolving conflicts need to be buttressed. 
111. 
MACROECONOMIC 
POLICY 
FRAMEWORK 
8. 
The economy 
has 
recovered significantly during 
2002 
and early 2003, driven 
by 
favorable 
weather for agriculture 
and 
by an increase 
in 
construction 
as 
private confidence has returned and 
as a result 
of 
increased development assistance. 
Real 
GDP growth was about 
4% 
percent in 2002, 
3 
Page  5
more 
than double the 
2001 
increase 
and, 
more important, 
a 
significant reversal from the falling 
real 
GDP 
in 1999 
and 
2000. Nevertheless, 
and 
despite 
a 
coffee 
crop in 2002-3 
that 
was 
more 
than 
twice 
as large as the poor crop of the 2001-2 season, 
export 
revenues have fallen. This 
is 
due 
in 
the 
first place 
to 
price effects 
(an 
adverse shift in terms of trade 
in 
the sector, 
and 
lower quality as 
coffee plantations were poorly attended due 
to 
the continuing conflict), 
and 
in 
the second place to 
the 
reduction 
in 
recent years 
in 
local capability 
to 
transport the increased volume 
of 
coffee to 
market. Nevertheless, because of 
drought 
conditions 
in 
late 
2002 and 
early 2003, 
it 
is expected 
that agricultural output will fall in 2003, 
and 
the 
GDP 
growth might 
not exceed one percent. 
9. 
Donor Response. 
Following the Arusha 
Accord 
in 
August 
2000, 
an 
international donors 
meeting  called 
by 
President Mandela was 
held 
in December 2000 
and 
raised  over US$400 
million. Donors 
met again 
in 
December 2001, 
and 
in April 
2002 
the I-PRSP 
was 
presented 
and 
endorsed by the donor community 
at 
a 
thematic meeting. 
At 
a 
round-table held 
in 
November 
2002, donors pledged US$981 million 
for 
2003-2005. 
10. 
Problems remain concerning the  service 
and 
eventual reduction of Burundi’s external 
debt, 
whose current 
net 
value amounts to  1,061 
per cent 
of 2001 exports 
and 
most of which 
(US$149 million) 
is 
in arrears. 
A 
multi-donor debt service trust 
find 
has been established 
but 
to 
date, the contributions are insufficient to cover 
debt 
service 
in 
the medium term even 
to 
permit 
one 
multilateral lender, the African Development Bank, 
to 
resume lending activity. 
11. 
Fiscal developments. 
Overall fiscal performance 
was 
in 
line with the objectives of the 
revised 
budget 
law approved 
in 
August 2002 with assistance 
from 
the 
IMF. 
Government revenue 
collection was less than projected, mainly due 
to lack 
of 
customs revenue from 
a 
declining level 
of 
imports (next section), but this was more than offset by 
a 
decline 
in 
government expenditure. 
The 
primary budget balance (excluding foreign-financed projects) was more than 
2 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
In 
discussions with the 
IMF 
under the post-conflict assistance program, 
the 
government 
expects in 2003 to maintain 
a 
primary budget  surplus 
of 
1% 
percent 
of 
GDP, while with 
an 
increase 
in 
investment spending the overall deficit excluding grants will increase from 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
to 
10 percent. 
12. 
Fiscal revenues 
are 
expected 
to 
be lower 
in 
2003, with lower excise duties 
on 
beer, likely 
lower domestic transaction tax revenues, 
and 
a 
decrease in selected import duties 
in 
preparation 
for 
the adoption of the COMESA common external tariff. The system of granting exemptions 
from the turnover 
tax has 
been streamlined, but remaining exemptions continue to distort rates 
of 
effective protection while contributing 
to 
loss 
of potential revenue. 
13. 
The 
2003 budget is designed in accordance with the guidance provided by 
the 
I-PRSP. 
It 
has 
increased the share 
of 
health and education spending from 21 percent 
of 
the budget 
in 
2002 
to more 
than 
25 percent in 2003. Military spending has been maintained constant in nominal 
terms, implying 
a 
reduction 
of 
0.2 percent 
of 
GDP 
from 2002 to 2003, although demobilization 
expenditures 
in 
2003 
may lead to 
a 
revision upwards in this budget 
item. 
14. 
On 
the external side, 
the current account deficit narrowed from 
7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
2001 
to 
6 
percent in 2002, despite 
3 
percent  deterioration 
in 
Burundi’s terms 
of 
trade. This 
improvement was driven by slightly higher coffee exports from the greatly increased harvest as 
described above, 
and 
to 
a 
decline 
in 
imports due 
to 
low project aid disbursements and 
a 
scarcity 
4 
Page  6
of 
foreign exchange throughout much of 2002. External debt payments arrears rose 
to 
US$149 
million, nearly 
25 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
the end of 2002. 
15. 
Despite 
the 
stagnation  of  export revenues,  the  government  continued  its  program  of 
economic  liberalization.  The  first  tranche  of  IDA’S ERC  for  US$20  million,  released 
in 
November 
2002 
followed by 
an 
EU program 
grant 
of 
€8 
million in December, permitted the 
amount 
of 
foreign  exchange  sold 
to 
the private  sector through  the  Central Bank  auction 
to 
increase 
to 
a 
scale  where 
the 
weekly  auctions  could 
be 
regularized 
and 
the  amount  sold 
standardized. 
The 
positive list of imports eligible for foreign exchange was abolished in August 
2002.  The  foreign  exchange auction mechanism was  changed from 
a 
first-price auction 
to 
a 
modified 
dutch 
auction  producing 
a 
single, weighted  transaction  rate; 
in 
response  the 
bids 
became 
more 
dispersed. Beginning in January 2003 banks were permitted 
to 
retain 
a 
portion of 
the 
foreign exchange from exports 
(30 
percent 
of 
coffee, tea and cotton sales; 
100 
percent of 
other  exports),  which  increased  greatly  their  ability  to  provide  foreign  exchange 
to 
their 
customers 
outside the 
auction process 
and 
improved the interbank market, while retaining 
a close 
link by the market to rates 
set 
at 
the 
auction. Competitiveness was maintained by 
a 
devaluation of 
the  Burundian  franc  by 
20 
percent 
in 
August  2002,  with 
the 
devaluation  enforced  by 
the 
imposition 
of 
limit prices on the foreign exchange auction. 
IV. 
PROGRESS 
UNDER 
THE 
ERC 
16. 
The ERC 
is 
an integral part 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
Transitional Support Strategy 
to 
support 
the 
transition process and 
the 
implementation 
of 
the transitional government’s reform program. 
The 
government’s program  seeks 
to 
support poverty reduction  efforts,  increases 
the 
efficiency 
of 
resource allocation 
and 
utilization,  and establish transitional institutions. 
A 
series of measures 
already taken  moved 
the 
government budget  from  deficit  to 
surplus, 
reduced  inflation,  and 
reduced indebtedness 
to 
the 
banking system. The strategy outlined 
in the 
I-PRSP emphasizes: (i) 
diversification 
of 
sources 
of 
growth and rural income, (ii) macroeconomic stability and economic 
growth,  (iii)  private 
sector 
development,  (iv)  peace,  security 
and 
good  governance, 
(v) 
rehabilitation and reintegration of victims and internally displaced persons, and (vi) strengthening 
human resources 
and 
combating 
HIV/AIDS. 
17. 
In 
the 
period supported by this ERC the Government seeks to 
lay the basis 
for sustainable 
growth 
and 
poverty  reduction  by  establishing 
an 
environment  favorable 
to 
private 
sector 
development, within 
a stable 
macroeconomic framework. 
The objective 
is 
to 
achieve 
a 
real GDP 
growth rate 
of 
5 
percent 
on 
average over the period 2002-2004,  and at least 
7 
percent for 
the 
period 2004-2010. 
In 
the 
area of human resources, key reforms 
include 
the reduction 
of 
ethnic, 
regional and gender disparities 
and 
promotion 
of 
inclusion and 
the 
local and community levels, 
and in all 
the 
different branches 
of 
the administration, and rehabilitation of social infrastructure 
coupled  with  improved  access 
to 
social  services. 
The 
Government  intends 
to 
pursue 
a 
privatization strategy that will improve management, 
modernize 
production facilities and 
revive 
output, 
and 
to revive 
the 
coffee and tea subsectors. 
Within the 
administration, 
the 
ERC supports 
strengthening and making transparent 
the 
public procurement administration; 
an 
Auditor General 
(Cow 
des 
Comptes) 
position has already been created. 
5 
Page  7
1 
8. 
The 
ERC  supports  broad  reforms  in  national  reconciliation,  economic  stabilization, 
growth and poverty reduction in 
a 
program supported 
by 
a 
number 
of 
donors. Implementation 
is 
generally  satisfactory.  As  described  above,  the  government  has  successfully  maintained 
a 
macroeconomic policy framework for growth 
and 
poverty reduction that 
is 
consistent with 
the 
I- 
PRSP 
and 
the 
objectives of the reform program, one 
of 
the 
requirements for 
the 
tranche release. 
The 
remainder  of the present memorandum concentrates on specific steps and 
the 
associated 
requirements for tranche release. 
v. 
CONDITIONS 
FOR 
RELEASE 
OF 
THE 
SECOND 
TRANCHE 
19. 
The 
Development Credit Agreement states that 
two 
general conditions 
must 
be met at the 
moment 
of 
each 
of 
the ERC tranche releases: that 
(i) 
the implementation 
of 
the 
overall reform 
program as outlined in the Letter 
of 
Development Policy (LDP) (and summarized 
in 
paragraph 
17 
above) 
is 
on 
track, 
and 
(ii)  the  overall  macroeconomic  environment 
is 
conducive 
to 
sustainable growth 
and 
poverty reduction, as measured on the basis of indicators agreed between 
the 
Government with 
the 
Bank. 
In 
addition,  for release of the  second tranche, the  following 
specific actions should have been undertaken: 
0 
Adoption, through 
the 
Council of Ministers, 
of 
a 
strategic privatization plan, acceptable 
to 
IDA, as described in the LDP, including the establishment 
of 
a 
unit to implement 
the 
privatization, identification of enterprises to 
be 
privatized, 
and 
the adoption of 
a 
strategy 
and 
plan 
for privatization of each. 
0 
Furnishing 
to 
IDA  of 
a 
report 
and 
an 
action  plan, 
both 
acceptable  to  IDA,  for 
the 
assessment 
and 
improvement 
of 
public  finance  management  using 
HIPC 
tracking 
benchmarks, 
as 
described in 
the 
LDP; 
0 
Furnishing  to  IDA 
of 
a 
report,  acceptable  to  IDA,  on 
the 
Borrower's 
2003  budget 
allocations 
to 
priority programs identified 
in 
the Interim PRSP 
and 
on 
the 
system for 
monitoring budget releases to said priority programs, as described in 
the 
LDP; and 
0 
Furnishing 
to 
IDA

staff 
to 
its 
Board on the staff report and recommendation to approve the request for 
a 
drawing

is 
satisfactory and timely. Government's commitment remains firm.

Specific 
conditions pertaining 
to the 
second tranche 
21. 
Condition 
1 
- 
Strategic Privatization Plan: 
“Adoption by the Council of Ministers of 
a 
strategic  privatization  plan  acceptable 
to 
IDA,  including  the  establishment 
of 
a 
unit  to 
implement 
the 
privatization, identification of enterprises to be privatized, and the adoption of 
a 
strategy and plan for privatization 
of 
each.” 
22. 
Background: The 
State 
continues 
to 
be extensively involved 
in 
economic activity through 
State-owned enterprises; 
the 
State has shares in 
48 
enterprises covering 
10 
areas of activity. 
In 
general,  these  enterprises  are  inefficient 
and 
heavily  indebted.  The  majority 
of 
enterprises 
involved 
in 
supplying services have benefited from 
a 
de 
jure 
monopoly; 
a 
large number of other 
branches 
and 
sectors 
of 
activity have 
a 
dominant position de facto. 
A 
privatization program was 
initiated in  1991, but 
the 
progress made 
so 
far has been limited, 
to 
a 
large extent 
due 
to the 
conflict in Burundi; 
0.5 
per 
cent 
of 
the State’s holdings have been privatized. The Government 
has  drawn 
up 
a 
program  for 
the 
period 
up 
to  2005  for 
the 
full 
or 
partial  privatization 
or 
restructuring  of  19 state  enterprises,  including  those  operating 
in 
certain  key  areas  such  as 
telecommunications and electricity. 
23. 
Action  taken: 
A 
Ministry 
of 
Good Governance and Privatization  has been  created. 
A 
service charged with public  enterprises (SCEP) has been established 
within the 
Ministry. The 
SCEP has  submitted 
a 
detailed program  for privatisation2 to the Council 
of 
Ministers, which 
approved it 
on 
March 25, 2003.3 
This 
program addresses 
the 
REGIDESO  (potable water and 
electricity), 
ONAPHA 
(pharmaceutical 
manufacture), 
ONATEL 
(telecomm), 
COTEBU 
(textiles), 
OTB 
(tea  marketing), 
SOSUMO 
(sugar),  ALCOVIT  (livestock  feed),  INABU 
(Government printers), OCIBU (coffee marketing), SOGESTAL 
MUMIRWA 
(coffee washing 
station), BRARUDI (brewing), and BCB (banking). 
It 
proposes specific strategic actions for each 
enterprise, along 
with a 
calendar, issues 
to 
be addressed for 
the 
strategy to 
be 
successful, 
and 
an 
estimated cost of the privatisation process recommended. 
The 
staff finds that this condition has 
been satisfactorily met. 
24. 
Condition 
2 
- 
Public finance 
management: 
“Issuance 
of 
a 
report 
and 
an action plan 
satisfactory 
to 
IDA to  assess  and improve public  finance management 
issues 
in  light 
of 
the 
diagnostic assessment using the HIPC tracking benchmarks.” 
25. 
Background: 
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
preparation of 
the 
ERC, 
the 
Government initiated 
a 
diagnostic  assessment 
of 
public  finance  management 
issues 
using 
the 
15  HIPC  tracking 
benchmarks 
to 
improve 
the 
budget processes (formulation, 
execution 
and control) and increase 
poverty  reduction  impact 
of 
resources  from 
the 
HIPC  relief, 
in 
preparation  for  Burundi’s 
qualification for 
the 
enhanced HIPC initiative.

26. 
Action taken: A report4 has been completed 
in 
March 2003. 
It 
covers the priorities 
of 
the 
government expressed in the I-PRSP, the Arusha Accords, 
the 
World Bank’s TSS and the Letter 
of 
Intent given 
to 
the 
IMF. 
It 
specifically covers the HIPC tracking benchmarks. A new budget 
presentation5 
has 
been  developed 
to 
reflect these strategies. The staff, having reviewed these, 
finds 
that this 
condition 
has been satisfactorily met. 
27. 
Condition 
3 
- 
Budget allocation: 
“Agreement with IDA on 
the 
2003 budget allocations 
to 
the 
priority programs identified in the Interim PRSP and on the system for monitoring budget 
releases to 
the 
priority programs.” 
28. 
Background:  The  Government’s  goal,  given 
in  its 
Letter  of  Development  Policy, 
is 
“Public spending will be stabilized 
at 
around 18.5 percent 
of 
GDP 
during the period 2002-2004, 
while budget allocations 
to 
priority sectors 
such 
as health, education, water and sanitation will 
be 
increased.” 
29. 
Action  taken:  The  budget  recommendations  developed  under 
the 
I-PRSP6 propose 
allocations by 
sector 
for the 2002 
and 
2003 budget, together with a detailed breakdown 
of 
the 
pro-poor expenditures budgeted. The Bank staff has reviewed this. Also, the IMF staff report on 
the post-conflict  emergency assistance request (op. cit., 
para 
22.) concludes, “the 
2003 
budget 
provides for significant increases in allocations for 
the social 
sectors, while raising 
civil 
services 
wages substantially. The share 
of 
health and education spending 
in 
current expenditure has been 
raised from 21 percent in 2002 
to 
more than 
25 
percent 
in 
2003. 
An 
additional 
1,700 
teachers 
have  been  hired,  mostly  for  primary  education.  Military  spending  has  been  kept  broadly 
unchanged 
in  nominal 
terms,  which  implies  a  reduction  by 
0.2 
percentage  point  of  GDP 
compared with 2002. 
... 
The strong increase 
in 
public investment in 2003 
is 
expected 
to 
help 
rebuild  and  develop  infrastructures,  as  well  as  support 
the 
economic  recovery  and  poverty 
reduction  through  labor-intensive  projects.”  The  staff  finds  that  this  condition  has  been 
satisfactorily met.

Treasury 
and 
improvements 
in 
Treasury operations.” 
Condition 4 
- 
Treasury Action Plan: 
“Furnishing 
of 
an action plan satisfactory to IDA 
31. 
Background: 
An 
audit 
of 
the 
Treasury was conducted. On 
the basis 
of 
this audit an action 
plan was developed which showed the need for extensive 
capacity 
enhancement and restructuring 
of 
financial  management  systems.  The  plan  identified  extensive  scope  for  improvement  in 
Treasury operations. 
32. 
Action  taken:  A 
project-Burundi 
Economic  Management  Support 
Project-is 
currently 
under  development  with  IDA  for  a  capacity  enhancement  project  that  will  address 
the 
shortcomings. 
It 
is 
the 
staffs 
finding that this condition has been satisfactorily 
met.
