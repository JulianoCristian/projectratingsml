   Project is an integral part of the Bank's Transitional\n            Support Strategy, in the process, and implementation of the\n            Government's reform program. It will help build the\n            foundation for a) the improvement of public service\n            delivery, and basic social services, through promotion of\n            accountability, and transparency in the use of public funds,\n            including external assistance; b) the Government's\n            efforts to deepen institutional, and structural reforms for\n            sustained economic recovery, and poverty reduction; and, c)\n            the establishment of a track record for early access to\n            relief, under the Enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Country\n            (HIPC) Initiative. By focusing on public expenditure\n            management, rural development, private sector development,\n            and pro-poor sectoral policies, it is expected the project\n            will help move the poverty reduction agenda forward.\n            Nonetheless, main risk factors include the internal\n            conflict, the Great Lakes regional conflict, the uncertainty\n            of the transition Government's capacity, and readiness\n            to implement reforms, and fund the transition process, as\n            well as the remaining uncertainty regarding the amounts, and\n            timing of inflows of international assistance. These risks\n            will be mitigated largely by the project design, which\n            emphasizes donor coordination, and policies that support\n            national reconciliation, to facilitate progress towards a cease-fire."}, "docdt": "2002-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
