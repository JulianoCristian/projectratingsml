institutional\n            development impact was high and, the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            during the implementation indicated that the goals and\n            objectives agreed amongst the stakeholders were clearly\n            defined, using a participatory approach of all stakeholders,\n            including the local population. In the project design, the\n            function of the project manager called for international\n            expertise and experience in stat-of-the-art coastal zone\n            management to transfer knowledge to the country. Strong\n            stakeholder commitment and positive economic returns can\n            flow from investment in environmentally sound projects. The\n            project also demonstrated how demand driven interventions\n            based on an effective environmental by-laws framework with\n            stakeholder participation, can bring about effective\n            management on the environment through the active involvement\n            of all stakeholders. On-the-job training and motivational\n            tools contributed to the full integration of the managerial\n            and operational project. Well designed cost recovery\n            mechanisms will help to ensure financial sustainability.\n            Initiating a dialogue with polluters will bring about a\n            consensus and lead to solutions."}, "docdt": "2002-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
