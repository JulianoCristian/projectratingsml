Environmental Action Plan Project is to enable Jordan\n            to take the lead in establishing and implementing a regional\n            collaborative framework for sustainable management and\n            protection of the Gulf of Aqaba and the conservation of its\n            unique coral reefs. Specific project objectives are to: 1)\n            develop regional collaborative mechanisms for environmental\n            management to strengthen capacity for the protection of the\n            coastal zone and marine biodiversity; 2) develop and\n            implement the legal framework and regulations for control of\n            transboundary pollution; 3) provide for safeguards against\n            oil pollution of aquifers and the marine environment; 4)\n            establish and implement guidelines for the sustainable\n            development of the coastal zone; 5) assess the effects of\n            wastewater seepage on the quality and level of the\n            transboundary groundwater table; 6) implement a plan to\n            control transboundary solid waste impacts on the marine and\n            coastal water resource systems; and 7) establish the\n            Jordanian segment of the Red Sea Marine Peace Park. The\n            project consists of the following components: 1) development\n            of regulatory and institutional framework for Gulf of Aqaba\n            environmental protection; 2) emergency assessment of oil\n            pollution hazards and of pollutants contained in Ballast and\n            Bilge water and measures to promote waste oil recovery and\n            reuse; 3) safeguarding transboundary groundwater resources\n            through groundwater monitoring and assessment of the effects\n            of wastewater seepage on the quality and level of the\n            groundwater table in the Gulf of Aqaba region; 4)\n            development of an integral marine and land-based\n            transboundary solid waste management strategy; and 5)\n            protection of globally important coral reefs - development\n            and implementation of the Jordanian Marine Park."}, "docdt": "1996-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
