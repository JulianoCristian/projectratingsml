REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS FOR A SECOND HIGHWJAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Cyprus for the equivalent of US$10 million to help finance a
second highway project. The loan would have a term of fifteen years, including
three years of grace, with interest at 8.7 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The last economic report on Cyprus (1151-CY) was circulated to the
Executive Directors in May 1976. It was based on the findings of an economic
mission which visited Cyprus in November/December 1975 to review the country's
current economic situation and prospects, particularly in view of the events
of July/August 1974. The mission had an opportunity to visit some of the eco-
nomically important areas in the northern part of the island and was able to
hold discussions with several officials. However, because reliable data are
not available for the northern area, it is only possible to review the economic
situation and prospects for the southern part of the island controlled by the
Government.
3.        Cyprus enjoyed a decade of rapid economic growth during the 1960's,
despite the difficult internal political situation and unresolved tension
between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. The average annual
rate of growth of 7 percent for 1960-72 surpassed the Government's targets.
The major factors behind the sustained rapid growth were: a high rate of
investment, especially in the private sector; a rapid increase in agricul-
tural exports; a strong balance of payments; and a flexible fiscal and mone-
t ary policy, which not only helped to stimulate growth but also maintained
domestic price stability.
4.        The unprecedented drought of 1973 caused serious economic difficul-
ties on the island, including a negative impact on the balance of payments.
Combined with the events of July/August 1974, it shattered the growing economy
of Cyprus. The island is now divided into two communal zones, with little
movement of people or goods across the dividing line. The southern part of
the island under the Government's control constitutes 64 percent of the land
mass of the island; the remaining 36 percent in the north is under Turkish
1/   Except for appropriately updated figures, this section is substantially
the same as that contained in the President's Report (P-1853-CY) for the
Second Cyprus Development Bank Project, dated May 11, 1976.

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



Cypriot control.   Some 150,000 Greek Cypriots have moved south and about 45,000
Turkish Cypriots went to the north. About one-third of the total population of
the island was thus displaced and is now being gradually settled with humanitar-
ian assistance provided largely through the UN. The Government-controlled area
now has an estimated population of nearly 500,000, essentially all of whom are
Greek Cypriots; the area under Turkish Cypriot control, has an estimated popu-
lation of about 135,000. A Turkish Federated State of Cyprus was proclaimed in
February 1975, pending an island-wide political solution.
5.        The events of July/August 1974 have resulted in significant struc-
tural changes in the economy, rendering the overall economic outlook quite
difficult. There was a 17 percent drop in GNP per capita which is estimated
at $1,180 in 1975 as compared to $1,460 in 1973. Unemployment is high at 14
percent in the area under the Government's control, and the Government had to
cope with the task of having to reestablish 150,000 people. Although faced
with a lesser number of refugees, the northern part of the island is believed
to have an even more acute unemployment problem.
6.        The balance of payments position also suffered.    Both exports and
imports of the area under Government control fell by about 55 percent in the
second half of 1974. About 47 percent of Cyprus' cultivated land is in the
north, including the areas which in the past produced over half the island's
agricultural exports, but which have only been partially exploited since
1974.
7.        The Government has, through a number of bold measures, succeeded in
arresting the economic decline in the area it controls. In August 1975, it
consolidated initial measures and introduced new ones within the framework of
the Emergency Economic Action Plan (EEAP) for 1975 and 1976. The Plan calls
for a total fixed investment of $275 million, creation of 16 to 20,000 new
jobs, and efforts to reactivate industry and agriculture. The private sector
is expected to undertake nearly two-thirds of the investment. In industry,
the Plan aims at the creation of additional capacity in labor-intensive export-
oriented industries so as to take advantage of the available labor force, and
increased utilization of the existing capital stock through double shift work.
There has recently been some improvement in manufacturing output and employment,
thanks largely to the Government's substantial incentives. These incentives
and the expected revival of private sector confidence as the economic situation
improves, are assisting in a gradual recovery of lost economic ground. Indus-
trial activities, and particularly industrial exports, are picking up. In
agriculture, the Government is promoting quick-yielding small-scale agricul-
tural schemes benefitting some 13,000 farming families. Total output increased
by about 12 percent in 1975, from its very depressed level in the second half
of 1974. The Cypriots have been successful in winning construction contracts in
the Middle East, and as a result have been able to earn foreign exchange and
obtain significant employment opportunities abroad. Employment increased by
an estimated 11 percent in 1975. In addition, with the support of the Bank's



- 3 -
$6 million second loan to the Cyprus Development Bank in May of this year, the
Government is strengthening the bank, to make it a major force in reviving in-
dustrial activity in Cyprus. Despite these encouraging developments, however,
it is conceivable that the modest objectives of the Plan may not be fulfilled,
since public sector resources may be insufficient to finance planned investment.
The Government is now preparing a follow-up plan covering the years 1977 and
1978.
8.        Preliminary Government estimates forecast 6 percent real growth in
1976, on the basis of significant gains in agricultural and industrial produc-
tion. Construction and tourism are also likely to pick up, although their
growth may not reach the pre-July 1974 levels. The 1976 budget, approved in
February, calls for ordinary expenditures of $163 million and development
expenditures of about $77 million. Since total receipts are not expected to
exceed $128 million, a deficit of $112 million (16 percent of GDP) is to be
financed by a $28 million grant from Greece, anticipated foreign and domestic
borrowing and a drawdown of reserves. The large budget deficit should help
boost domestic demand and increase the use of idle equipment and labor. The
balance of payments position will remain tight, however. Bank projections
indicate that even with moderate economic growth in 1976 and 1977, and assuming
rather high annual increases of 19 percent in exports at current prices on the
basis of recent improvements in foreign exchange earnings from goods and ser-
vices and only a 12 percent increase in imports, import requirements will still
be significantly in excess of export earnings. Total imports for January-June
1976 reached US$179 million (US$130.8 million for the same periocd in 1975) and
total exports US$131.3 million (US$65 million for the same period in 1975).
The trade gap dropped to US$48.2 million compared with US$67.5 million in the
same period of last year. The deficit in the current account is nevertheless
expected to increase substantially from the $44 million incurred in 1975.
Since expected capital inflows from all identifiable sources will be rela-
tively small, reserves may have to be drawn down substantially from their
level equivalent to 6 months of imports in 1975.
9.        Over the longer run, Cyprus can count on several favorable factors
to sustain economic growth. These are: a fair amount of unutilized land and
water resources; a tradition of dynamic and responsible entrepreneurship; an
abundant supply of skilled labor; wage levels that are lower than in continen-
tal Europe; and the island's favorable location in relation to the rapidly
growing Middle Eastern markets. The pace and shape of economic development
over the medium-term will, however, depend largely on the political settlement
which might be reached, and for this reason are surrounded by an unsually wide
margin of uncertainty. The economy of the area under the Government's control
is likely to operate under tight balance of payments constraints, considering
the difficulty - because of the political situation - of mobilizing external
capital for development from bilateral sources and the private capital markets.
Under these circumstances, the overall growth rate in the medium-term will
probably have to be kept down to levels well below those recorded in the past.
Despite the promise of continued vigorous expansion of exports, constraints on
the availability of foreign capital may therefore restrict the realization of
the economy's potential.



10.       The external public debt over the past few years has remained at
a low level, both as a result of the Government's limited ability to borrow
abroad, and its past policy of financing economic development largely from
internal sources. As of December 1975, the total public debt outstanding
amounted to about US$99 million of which $76 million was disbursed. Service
on public debt was only 3 percent of exports in 1975. Given the expected
export growth, debt service is expected to remain manageable through the next
decade. Cyprus is creditworthy for additional Bank borrowing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CYPRUS
11.       Bank lending to Cyprus commenced in 1963 and so far comprises 11
loans totalling $76 million (net of cancellations); of this, $65.4 million
(including $20.1 million undisbursed) was held by the Bank as of September 30,
1976. Bank lending has concentrated on providing Cyprus with essential infra-
structure and fostering much-needed institutional reforms.     It included four
power loans ($37.8 million), which assisted in the consolidation and expansion
of the Electricity Authority of Cyprus; a ports loan ($11.5 million), which
helped finance the construction of a new modern port at Limassol (which now
handles most southern Cyprus port traffic) and provided the basis for the
establishment of a national port authority; a highway loan ($5.4 million);
two sewerage loans ($5.4 million) for Nicosia and Famagusta; the Paphos
irrigation project ($14.0 million); and two loans to the Cyprus Development
Bank (S9.0 million). Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and
IFC investments as of September 30, 1976, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
12.       Despite a hiatus in Bank lending to Cyprus for two years until June
1976, the Bank maintained contact with the Government and, to the extent feas-
ible, also with the Turkish Cypriot administration, with a view to keeping
abreast of economic developments in Cyprus and to advancing work on ongoing
projects and preparing future ones. This approach facilitated the resumption
of the szatisfactory implementation by Cyprus of most of the ongoing projects,
which had been set back for several months as a direct consequence of the 1974
events. The Government has taken initiatives and steps, within constraints
imposed by the political situation, to resume project implementation. As a
result, with the exception of the sewerage project in Famagusta, which lies
entirely in the area controlled by the Turkish Cypriots, the construction of
the Nicosia-Morphou highway, which had to be suspended because its alignment
virtually coincides with the line dividing the two zones, and the feasibility
study of the Nicosia-Famagusta highway and bypasses to both cities (under the
ongoing First Highway Project), other active projects are being implemented as
originally envisaged. The Bank has made sustained efforts to find ways of
serving the Turkish Cypriot as well as the Greek Cypriot communities, both in
developing new projects and in adapting old ones, but these have not borne
fruit.



- 5 -
13.       The Bank's objectives in Cyprus are to finance projects to meet ur-
gent needs for productive employment, exports and rehabilitation; to complete
essential infrastructure useful in the context of the whole country; and to
accelerate the recovery of the economy towards the level prevailing before
the 1974 events. Projects for integrated rural development in the economic-
ally depressed Pitsilia area in the Troodos mountains, for the provision of
credit facilities to the agricultural sector, and for the development of irri-
gation, are being prepared. When a political settlement is reached, the Bank
would seek to help both communities through support of projects designed to
improve living standards of those groups left out of the growing prosperity
prior to 1974; to help build up stronger institutions; to encourage a national
water policy; to develop resources on which both communities are dependent;
and to attract long-term development assistance from other sources.
14.       IFC's first investment in Cyprus was in a cement company in FY73.
The company has since become a leader in the island's successful export drive.
IFC is proceeding with an investment in an asbestos cement pipe plant and is
exploring other industrial investment opportunities. As of September 30,
1976, gross commitments totalled $2.9 million, of which $2.3 million were
still held by IFC.
PART III - TRANSPORTATION IN CYPRUS
15.       The transportation system in Cyprus prior to the 1974 events was
reasonably balanced, comprising roads, ports, airports and very little coastal
shipping. The 1974 events, however, resulted in significant disruptions to
the transport sector. There is little movement between the southern and
northern parts of the islands, although this situation could improve if and
when an island-wide political solution emerges. Meanwhile, the following
description refers essentially to southern Cyprus.
16.       Since the 1974 events, the Government has undertaken to improve
essential parts of Cyprus' transport system to enable existing facilities to
serve the economic needs of the area it controls.     With the closing of the
Nicosia airport (it is now under UN control), the Government has extended the
airport runway at Larnaca to accommodate medium and long-range jet aircraft
so as to re-establish international communications with southern Cyprus. In
1975, the port of Limassol, which was improved and expanded partly with Bank
financing, handled some 56 percent of general cargo. Petroleum products con-
tinue to be imported via Larnaca, while most cement and minerals for export
are shipped abroad via specialized port facilities at Vasilikos. Larnaca and
Limassol ports are now the only ones available to serve the general needs of
the southern part of the island and are handling almost twice the[r originally
anticipated tonnage; the Government is considering their expansion, based on
a Bank-financed port development study under the ongoing First Highway Loan
(904-CY).



- 6 -
17.       As Cyprus has no railway system, highways are of critical importance.
The highway network radiates from the capital, Nicosia, to the mail coastal
centers, Larnaca and Limassol, and to the hinterland.    The totaL Pub.lic Works
Department network of national highways for the southern area minkes up 1,472
km, almost 90 percent of which are paved and the remainder gravel-surfaced.
Although it links all cities, villages and rural areas, its design standards
and development have not kept pace with the country's economic development.
Moreover, the Nicosia-Limassol corridor, which is the main artery of the
southern network (see Map 12355), is currently unable to cope with the shifts
in traffic patterns caused by the 1974 events. Although certain regions of
the island are not adequately served, in general, the rural road network is
adequate to support agricultural redeployment and development in the south,
the average road network density per square kilometer being much higher than
in other comparable countries.
18.       The present level of motorization (17 vehicles per hundred inhabit-
ants) is the highest among the developing countries along the eastern Mediter-
ranean, reflecting relative affluence before 1974 and the fact that road
transport is the only means of overland transport. Given the present uncer-
tainties, it is difficult to project future vehicle and traffic growth rates
accurately.
19.       Responsibility for construction and maintenance of highways is
shared by the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry of Communications
and Works (MCW); the District Administration under the Ministry of the Interior;
the Forestry Department under the Ministry of Agriculture; and the Municipal-
ities. This division of responsibility has resulted in insufficient coordina-
tion and some duplication of efforts, equipment and facilities. In view of
this, the Government carried out a study of highway planning and organization
with the help of Italconsult (Italy) which was completed in 1972. On the basis
of the study's recommendations, the Government undertook under the First High-
way Project to centralize highway administration under the Ministry of communi-
cations and Works according to an implementation timetable to be agreed by
December 31, 1973. A Planning Section was set up in the office of the PWD
Senior Roads Engineer, under whose direction planning data, particularly
traffic and cost data, are compiled. In addition, the Government transferred
responsibility for all inter-urban paved roads to the PWD, effective June 1974.
The Government was unable to fully implement the reorganization because of the
1974 events. However, its underlying rationale is still valid. Hence, during
negotiations for the proposed second highway loan the undertaking to carry out
the above reorganization was confirmed and the date for agreeing on an imple-
mentation timetable revised to December 31, 1977 (paragraph 4 of draft Letter
amending Loan 904-CY).
20.       From 1968 to 1974, PWD expenditures on highway investment and main-
tenance averaged C1, 1.2 and C1m 0.3 million respectively, which was then inade-
quate. Under the present Economic Plan, PWD has budgeted about Cb 1.7 million
for capital investments in 1976, which is also insufficient to meet the new
needs. The Government recognizes the need for increased transport investments
and gives this project very high priority, although it must also satisfy other



- 7 -
priority claims on the country's scarce resources, especially to reactivate
the economy and to meet the pressing social needs of the people, including the
heavy refugee influx.
21.       Highway design standards, as revised under the ongoing first project,
are satisfactory. PWD is staffed with competent personnel, but these are in-
sufficient in number to cope with peak workloads and to carry out special
studies; in these instances PWD relies on consultants. There have been recent
losses in staff to higher paid overseas posts. Under the training component
of the first project, PWD's staff has benefited from short practical courses
designed to keep abreast of modern procedures and techniques. A further
$25,000 will be provided for training under the proposed loan.
22.       There is an adequate civil contracting industry operating in the
southern area. Smaller firms act as subcontractors to PWD for activities
such as earthworks, for which PWD lacks equipment, and for the supply of
materials. Major highway construction is normally undertaken by contract.
There are three major domestic civil works contractors (one was a subsidiary
of a foreign firm but is now wholly owned by Cypriots) with experience in
road construction, all of whom are capable of handling contracts of the size
into which the Nicosia-Limassol road is to be divided. Two of the firms have
several large contracts overseas.
23.       Highway maintenance operations are carried out efficiently, and
there is generally an adequate amount of highway maintenance equipment and
related repair facilities in each district, although about 30 percent of PWD's
total maintenance fleet remains in the northern part of Cyprus. However, the
quantity of maintenance carried out has been inadequate because of insufficient
annual appropriations. The Government has agreed to maintain its highway net-
work and carry out all necessary repairs, all in accordance with appropriate
routine and periodic maintenance practices (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
In addition, as recorded in the Agreed Minute of Understanding during negotia-
tions the Gov-ernment will make every effort to increase the 1976 maintenance
appropriations (which itself was maintained at about the previous "all-island"
level) by 10 percent in order to make up the backlog of maintenance require-
ments, and to base its future road maintenance budget allocations on the
1976 financial level per kilometer and on traffic volumes.
24.       Despite the fact that since 1974 Government revenues from road user
charges have dropped by some 50 percent, these charges, including registra-
tion fees, taxes and duties on vehicles and gasoline, have consistently
exceeded highway expenditures. In view of this, the Government undertook a
study of road user charges with the assistance of consultants under the First
Highway Project. The Government has agreed to adopt a road user charges
policy and system for its highway network taking into consideration the
results of the study not later than December 31, 1977, and to introduce and
thereafter implement such policy and system not later than January 1, 1979
(Loan Agreement, Section 4.04).



- 8 -
25.         Consultants also studied vehicle weight regulations under the First
Highway Project. The Government has agreed to adopt a vehicle weight regula-
tions policy and system for its highway network taking into consideration the
results of the study not later than December 31, 1977, and to introduce and
thereafter implement such policy and system not later than January 1, 1979
(Loan Agreement, Section 4.04).
26.       The Bank's First Highway Loan of $5.4 million to Cyprus, approved
in May 1973, was to have been used to help finance the foreign exchange compo-
nent of the construction of the Nicosia-Morphou highway and access roads, as
well as related studies and training of PWD staff. Construction was inter-
rupted after only one month of work in July 1974 because the alignment is
virtually coincident with the line dividing the two zones. The Bank agreed
in principle in March 1975 to the suspension of construction (paragraph 38).
However, a number of project studies and the training program have proceeded
satisfactorily.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
27.        The Nicosia-Limassol highway was identified initially in the 1972
consultants' study as a high-priority highway in Cyprus for future construc-
tion. The feasibility study and detailed engineering of the highway, car-
ried out by consultants, Louis Berger International (U.S.), were completed
under the ongoing First Highway Loan. The proposed project was appraised
in June 1976. Negotiations took place in Washington in October 1976. The
Cyprus delegation was led by Mr. P. Kazamias, Director-General, Ministry of
Communications and Works.
Project Features and Cost
28.        The project consists of:
(a)  construction (including supervision) of the first two-lanes
of a new Nicosia-Limassol highway (about 75 km), and connecting
and access roads to it;
(b)  feasibility studies for the improvement of the Limassol-Paphos
highway (about 70 km) and the connecting highway between
Nicosia and Larnaca (about 30 km);
(c)  detailed engineering of up to 100 km. of the highest priority
and economically justified sections from (b) above;
(d)  small-scale studies relating to the transport sector;
(e)  an urban transport study of Limassol;
(f)  training of Ministry of Communications and Works staff.

A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III. A detailed description
is provided in report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway Project - Cyprus"
(No. 1271a-CY) dated November 16, 1976, which is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors.
29.       Project Description.    The economic evaluation of various alterna-
tives confirms that immediate construction of two lanes between Pendaskinos
and Dhali (22.8 km) and on the access road to Limassol (2.5 km), together with
4 lanes on sections between Nicosia-Dhali (15.5 km), Pendaskinos River-Limassol
(26.3 km) and the first section of the Limassol bypass (7.4 km), would be jus-
tified. The Government proposes to build all justified sections eventually
but, because of budgetary constraints and as it is unlikely that sufficient
external financing could be mobilized in the near future, to limLt construc-
tion under the present project to staged construction of 2 lanes only, with
the additional 2 lanes to be built at a later date. The design of the
highway takes account of the eventual need for four lanes.
30.       The alignment of the proposed highway runs close to the existing
highway. In this wav, the latter can still conveniently be used as reserve
capacity and for local traffic, while the new highway would have the advantage
of limited access, lower right-of-way costs and minimal traffic interruptions
during construction. A new alignment far from the existing one, which was
also considered, would have been the most costly because of the terrain, and
would have provided the least total access to towns and villages along the
way. The Government and the Bank have agreed on the design standards for
the new highway (Loan Agreement, Schedule 5).
31.       The Government proposes to employ consultants to study the trans-
port needs of Limassol and its environs in relation to the physical pattern
of, and policv on, land use in the city. The study would pay par-ticular
attention to requirements for the integration of essential inter-urban traffic
into the city system, and for the needs of the port.
32.       The proposed project would also assist the Government in determin-
ing the feasibility of improving two important existing road links and, if
justified, in further preparation for their upgrading. The study on the
Nicosia-Larnaca connection, would evaluate several alternative ways of linking
the two cities and determine the most economic one. The study on the Limassol-
Paphos road would cover the continuation of the proposed project to the city
of Paphos in the southwest, a region the Government is interested in develop-
ing to take full advantage of its potential as an agricultural and tourism
center.
33.       Consulting Services.    Consultants would assist PWD in the supervision
of construction, the feasibility studies and subsequent detailed engineering
of priority roads, the aforementioned urban transport study of Limassol, and
if appropriate, small-scale studies relating to the transport sector, under
arrangements acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02 (a)). PWD
would participate in the studies by providing qualified professional, technical,
and supporting staff (Loan Agreement Section 3.02 (e)). Consultant services



- 10 -
are expected to start about mid-1977 and be completed by mid-1979. Approxi-
mately 175 man-months of consultants services would be involved in the feasi-
bility studies and detailed engineering, about 25 man-months for the Limassol
urban study, and 80-100 man-months for construction supervision.
34.       Land Acquisition.   The Government has the necessary legal power to
expropriate the right-of-way required for roads and to restrict access to the
new alignment; the Ministry of Communications and Works has already received
authority to acquire the land required for the project road. The Government
has agreed to make available all right-of-way as needed for the timely imple-
mentation of the project (Loan Agreement, Section 3.05).
35.       Project Costs and Financing.   The total project cost is estimated at
$25.7 million, of which $13.6 million will be foreign exchange. Construction
cost estimates are based on quantities from the final design and on unit rates;
consulting services cost estimates are based on the estimated man-months re-
quired and consultants' rates, both rates being applicable to early 1976.
The average man-month rate for consultants services, including all overheads,
is about US$6,000.
36.       Price escalation of the foreign exchange component of construction
has been calculated using annual escalations of 13 percent (1976), 12 percent
(1977-79) and 10 percent (1980). Price escalation for local costs of construc-
tion has been assumed using a constant annual escalation of 10 percent. Price
escalation for consulting services has been calculated using annual escalations
of 10 percent for both the foreign and local costs.
37.       The foreign exchange component for highway construction is estimated
to be about 70 percent if all work were done by foreign contractors and about
50 percent if local contractors carried out all the work. The latter figure
has been adopted for the cost estimates since the probability of award to a
local contractor is high; foreign contractors, for whom the size of the project
would otherwise be attractive, would probably be reluctant to bid or likely to
bid high because of the extra risks involved due to the political situation on
the island.
38.       The proposed loan of $10 million would finance 74 percent of the for-
eign exchange costs of the project or 39 percent of total cost. The balance of
the foreign exchange requirements, $3.6 million, would be met by the utiliza-
tion of the balance which cannot presently be used for the ongoing First High-
way Project. Approval of the use of the latter funds for the second project as
requested by the Government, is sought in a separate memorandum which I am cir-
culating today (Proposed Amendment to Loan No. 904-CY) which specifically out-
lines the need for appropriate amendments to the Loan Agreement for that project.
The Government will finance the local costs of the proposed project as well as
any shortfall in foreign exchange financing. The Bank would finance the full
foreign exchange component, or 53 percent of total cost.
39.       Procurement.   Construction contracts would be awarded after pre-
qualification and international competitive bidding in accordance with the



- 11 -
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. The works would be divided into a number
of contracts of varying size to maximize the participation of domestic con-
tractors, who are then expected to win all the contracts. Contractors would
be permitted to bid for one or more contracts according to their prequalifica-
tion status. Works are expected to start in late 1977 and be completed by
late 1980.
40.       Disbursement.   The loan would be disbursed against 100 percent of
the foreign exchange cost of consultant services, 50 percent of total construc-
tion expenditures, and the actual foreign exchange cost of training MCW staff.
Disbursements for construction from the proposed loan would begin only after
the $3.6 million proposed to be made available for this project from the First
Highway Loan have been fully utilized (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, paragraph
4 (b)).
Project Benefits and Risks
41.       The existing Nicosia-Limassol road, built in 1930, was judged to be
inadequate for the modest level of traffic that it carried in 1973. Since
then, the need for improvement has become even more urgent, due to rapid
increases in traffic on certain sections, and the need to develop new employ-
ment opportunities as a result of the events of 1974. Besides serving the
growing urban centers along its route, the highway has taken on added im-
portance as the essential arterial link between the main centers of Nicosia,
the port of Limassol, and the international airport at Larnaca, which have
become the principal points of ingress and egress for all goods and passenger
traffic in southern Cyprus. This heavy pattern of traffic can be expected to
continue even after an island-wide political solution is found, as these three
centers would continue to develop and generate considerable traffic while
playing an important part in the interchange of goods, services and people
between north and south. In addition, the project highway would serve cement
manufacturing centers at Vasilikos and Moni, the iron pyrite mines at Kalavasos,
the port of Vasilikos for ore exports and the growing agricultural areas in the
south. The new highway will be able to handle projected traffic flows at an
adequate service level and at the same time improve overall driving safety
and efficiency by improving sight distances, reducing gradients, increasing
shoulder widths and restricting access from roadside development.
42.       Given the uncertainties surrounding the political situation in
Cyprus, the economic evaluation considered three possible cases: (1) no
communication between north and south; (2) freedom of communications, but no
major resettlement of population and integration of economic activities; and
(3) complete restoration of the pre-1974 situation. Traffic is expected to
grow between 1975 and 1986 at 4 to 6 percent annually. The economic analysis
indicates that the project represents a high priority investment not only in
the present political circumstances, but also in the context of the island as
a whole. Based on construction of only the first two lanes, the economic
return on the proposed project is estimated at 23 percent in case 1 and 26
percent in case 2, with returns on individual sections varying from 34 to 12
percent. A preliminary analysis indicates the economic return of the proposed
project would also be satisfactory for case 3.



- 12 -
43.       For the economic evaluation of the project, only savings in vehicle
operating costs and in time on business trips have been counted as quantifi-
able benefits. Both normal and generated traffic, where appropriate, have
been considered for this purpose. Benefits from improved safety, greater
comfort in driving, and savings in time for commuters and all non-business
trips have not been taken into account; the latter have been considered only
as part of a sensitivity analysis. Economic (shadow) prices coincide with
market prices in Cyprus at present (excluding taxes) , except for labor, but no
adjustment has been considered necessary because wages already partly reflect
the post-1974 situation, while the labor component of total project costs is
small. Furthermore, both cost and benefit streams would be similarly affected
by shadow price adjustments. The results of this analysis show that even
under unfavorable assumptions, however, the economic rates of return for the
proposed project as well as for its individual sections remain acceptable.
44.       Project risks are considered no greater than can be normally expected
with operations of this type.
45.       The project will have no adverse affect on the environment.    Special
care has been taken to select an alignment that will not disturb the archeo-
logical site at Amathus.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
agreement conforms with the normal pattern for loans for highway projects.
47.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred to
in paragraphs 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34 and 40. Paragraph 38 refers to the amend-
ment of Loan 904-CY.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 628 Cyprus Ports Project:   US$11.5 million loan of June 30, 1969.
Effective Date:  October 1, 1969.   Closing Date:   (original) March 31, 1974;
(current) December 31, 1976.
Construction of Limassol port has been satisfactorily completed
and it is successfully operating, handling most traffic generated in southern
Cyprus. However, to enable the government to complete actions on some of the
remaining institution building objectives, (the key one of establishing a
Cypus Port Organization has been accomplished) the Closing Date has been
extended by nine months to December 31, 1976.
Loan No. 729 Nicosia Sewerage Project: US$2.7 million loan of April 5, 1971.
Effective Date: July 16, 1971. Closing Date: (original) March 31, 1975;
(current) March 31, 1977.
The project was about 90 percent complete by July 1974, when con-
struction was interrupted. The practically completed treatment plant is
located in the area not under the control of the Government. Following
unsuccessful efforts to reach a mutually satisfactory solution with the
Turkish Cypriot administration on this matter, the Nicosia Sewerage Board
has decided, and is now taking steps, to complete the project by constructing
a smaller low cost treatment plant with some assistance to be provided by the
Government, so that the system can be put into operation in 1978.
Loan No. 730 Famagusta Sewerage Project: US$1.9 million loan of April 5, 1971.
Effective Date: July 16, 1971. Closing Date: (original) March 31, 1975;
(current) March 31, 1977.
The project was about 90 percent complete by July 1974, when con-
struction was interrupted. The project site lies completely in Famagusta,
which is not under the control of the Government. Completion of this proj-
ect therefore depends upon a political settlement.
Loan No. 831 Fourth Power Project: US$9.0 million loan of June 19, 1972.
Effective Date: September 7, 1972. Closing Date: (original) June 30, 1976;
(current) June 30, 1977.
This project was in its last stages of completion when it was in
terrupted in July 1974. Parts and pieces of equipment needed to complete
the project had arrived in Famagusta port at the time. Following discussions
by the Government and the Borrower with the Turkish Cypriot administration,
arrangements were made to have the equipment released from Famagusta port.
As a result of this, and actions since taken by the Borrower to reorder some
of the missing items, the generating unit was commissioned in May 1976, the
transmission line is now nearing completion and the distribution works which
are 65 percent complete, should be finished within less than a year. An ex-
tension of the Closing Date by one year was therefore required. Despite some



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 4
increase of electricity consumption in 1975 from its low level in the second
half of 1974, and a 15 percent tariff increase, the Borrower was unable to
meet the financial targets agreed upon with the Bank, chiefly because it has
continued to supply power to northern Cyprus without receiving payment. This
is, however, a matter the resolution of which depends on a political settlement.
Loan No. 904 First Highway Project: US$5.4 million loan of June 12, 1973.
Effective Date: September 12, 1973. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The alignment of the Nicosia-Morphou road included in the project
virtually coincides with the present line dividing the two communal zones;
as a result, construction works which had commenced thereon, have had to be
suspended. However, the consultant studies for the proposed Nicosia-Limassol
road, have been satisfactorily completed.
Loan No. 960 Paphos Irrigation Project: US$14.0 million loan of January 30,
1974. Effective Date: October 10, 1975. Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
The effective date on this project was delayed due to unsettled
political conditions. Following the changes in the condition of effectiveness
which the Executive Directors approved in September 1975, project implementa-
tion was started. Consultants have been appointed for the dam and the irriga-
tion system, and construction is expected to start during the second half of
1976.
Loan No. 1278 Second Cyprus Development Bank Project: US$6.0 million loan of
June 3, 1976. Effective Date: October 1, 1976. Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
CDB will shortly complete the formulation of an operational defini-
tion of small scale industries for Cyprus, thus enabling the Bank to begin
disbursing for this component of the Loan.

Procurement          Construction works will be procured by international com-
Arrangements:       petitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines
for Procurement". Works will be divided into a number of
contracts of varying financial size to maximize local con-
tractor participation. Contractors would be permitted to
bid for one or more contracts according to their prequal-
ification status.
Technical            Consulting services would be provided by qualified and
Assistance          experienced consultants on terms and conditions of employ-
(Consultants):      ment satisfactory to the Bank.    Consultants would assist
the Public Works Department of the Ministry of Communica-
tions and Works in supervision of construction, carrying
out the feasibility studies and detailed engineering of
priority roads, and the urban transport study of Limassol.
Approximately 175 man-months of consultants services would
be required for the feasibility studies and detailed en-
gineering, about 25 man-months for the Limassol urban study,
and 80-100 man-months for construction supervision.
Rate of Return:      The economic return (ER) on the proposed project, assuming
a continuation of the current situation with practically
no communications between north and south, is 23 percent.
Assuming freedom of communications, but no major resettle-
ment of population and integration of economic activities,



ANNEX III
P'age 4 of 4
the economic return is 26 percent. A preliminary analysis
indicates the economic return of the proposed project
would be satisfactory were Cyprus to return to the
pre-1974 situation.
