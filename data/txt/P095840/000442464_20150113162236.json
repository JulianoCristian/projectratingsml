that because of low\n            rainfall and irregularity of distribution, water represents\n            a social and major economic problem within Maghreb\n            countries. Since independence, Morocco has strongly invested\n            in building dams, developing water supply capacity to ensure\n            coverage of water needs in urban and agricultural areas.\n            Although mainly successful, this effort to develop supply\n            was not accompanied by policies of compensation to ensure\n            sustainable management, such as the management of water\n            demand, conservation and protection of water resources and\n            the development of equitable services for rural and poor\n            communities. The brief spells out that water management\n            strategies with regard to Morocco should therefore evolve to\n            meet a number of challenges: growing water deficits,\n            persistent gaps in access to services, slowness of the\n            legislative changes, programs of limited infrastructure,\n            population growth concern and climate change. Consequently,\n            water was one of the essential priorities the Country\n            Assistance Strategy established in Morocco with the\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            for the period 2006- 2009."}, "docdt": "2010-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
