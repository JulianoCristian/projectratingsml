Morocco Water Sector development policy loan\n            supported comprehensive water reform in Morocco to address\n            legislative, institutional, financing, and planning gaps,\n            and inefficiencies in Morocco\u2019s water sector investments\n            were designed to build infrastructure while supporting\n            implementation of new policies by central and decentralized\n            agencies on the conservation, rural water supply, peri-urban\n            service development and urban sanitation. The government has\n            also placed new emphasis on water management policies,\n            including development of new alternatives, such as\n            desalination and water reuse."}, "docdt": "2010-05-05T05:05:03Z"}
